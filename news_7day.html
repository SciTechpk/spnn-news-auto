In a weekly press briefing, Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi talked about the “abrupt variation” in the flow of the Chenab River, noting that it had been in the news in the past week.
“Pakistan views these variations with extreme concern and seriousness. They allude to unilateral release of water into the Chenab River by India, without any prior notification,” he said.
“Our Indus water commissioner has written a letter to his Indian counterpart seeking clarification on the matters in accordance with the procedures enshrined in the Indus Waters Treaty,” he said.
“Any manipulation of river flow by India, especially at a critical time of our agricultural cycle, directly threatens the life and livelihood as well as food and economic security of our citizens,” he said.
“We call upon India to respond to the queries raised by the Pakistani Indus water commissioner, refrain from any unilateral manipulation of river flow and fulfil its obligations in letter and spirit under the Indus Water Treaty provisions,” he said.

 

He further said that the Indus Waters Treaty was a “binding international agreement”, which had been “an instrument of peace and security and stability in the region”.
Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin.
Andrabi said that violating the treaty threatened the “inviolability of international treaties and compliance with international law” and also posed a serious threat to “regional peace, principles of good neighbourliness, and norms governing interstate relations”.
“The international community must take notice of India’s continued disregard of a bilateral treaty, and counsel India to act responsibly and in accordance with international law and established norms as well as its own obligations,” Andrabi said.
“Pakistan remains committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes and issues with India but will not compromise on the existential water rights of the people of our country,” he said.
In April, India held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
The supplemental award was issued in a 2023 case that Pakistan brought to the PCA over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
Removal of Indian woman’s hijab
During his press briefing, the FO spokesperson also talked about Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar pulling down a female doctor’s hijab this week, a move which had invited criticism.
Noting the incident, Andrabi said that the incident was followed by the “public mocking” of a minister from Uttar Pradesh.
“The forcible removal of the Muslim woman’s hijab by a senior political leader and subsequent public ridicule of this act are deeply disturbing and warrant strong condemnation,” he said.
“The action risks normalising the humiliation of Muslim women in India. The conduct also demonstrates public disrespect of India’s religious minorities, particularly its Muslim citizens,” he said.
“Such conduct reflects a broader and troubling pattern associated with Hindutva-inspired politics, namely the alarming rise of religious intolerance and Islamophobia,” he added.
“We urge all responsible stakeholders and the Indian government to recognise the seriousness of this incident and to reaffirm their commitment to the protection of minority rights, respect for religious freedom, and the preservation of human dignity,” he said.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases this year, with the highest number of cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 19.
The year’s last vaccination campaign against the crippling disease was launched by Health Minister Mustafa Kamal on December 11. The week-long campaign, which began on December 15, is aimed at vaccinating over 45m children under the age of five.
According to NEOC, polio drops have been administered to 20.8m children in Punjab, over 7.4m in Sindh, 6.1m in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 2.1m in Balochistan, 417,000 in Islamabad, 256,000 in Gilgit-Baltistan and 689,000 children in Azad Jammu and Kashmir during the first three days of the campaign.
NEOC said in a statement that over 400,000 polio workers had been going door to door to administer polio drops to children during the vaccination campaign. It called on parents to ensure that their children under five years of age were administered the vaccine.
“The success of the national polio campaign is not possible without the full participation of parents and the community,” NEOC stressed, warning that “polio is an incurable disease that leaves children with lifelong disabilities”.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-12-18 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18072542f17018a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961730/hottest-country-anywhere-in-rapid-fire-speech-trump-highlights-victories-amid-sinking-approval-ratings' target='_blank'><strong>‘Hottest country anywhere’: In rapid-fire speech, Trump highlights victories amid sinking approval ratings</strong></a><br><p>In a rare evening address from the White House, US President Donald Trump boasted on Wednesday of his accomplishments and blamed his Democratic predecessor for soaring consumer prices as his party braces for a tough midterm election next year.
“Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess, and I’m fixing it,” Trump said in a speech that lasted less than 20 minutes and was delivered at rapid-fire pace.
The Republican president, who regularly complains that he does not get credit for his accomplishments, offered few new policy initiatives to address high costs.



Instead, he placed blame at the feet of former president Joe Biden, previous trade deals, immigrants and what he described as a corrupt system.
The Republican president, who regularly complains that he does not get credit for his accomplishments, touted his administration’s work this year on a range of issues from reducing border crossings to bringing down prices of some goods.
Trump announced his administration would send a “warrior dividend” of $1,776 to 1.45 million US service members in the coming week.
He also backed a Republican proposal to send cash directly to the public to offset the cost of health insurance rather than provide subsidies through the Affordable Care Act, a proposal that has yet to receive enough support in Congress.
“I want the money to go directly to the people so you can buy your own healthcare,” Trump said, the room behind him festooned with holiday decor. “The only losers will be the insurance companies.”
Trump gets poor marks on economy
The address offered an opportunity for the president to address people’s concerns about affordability, an issue that Trump, a Republican, has repeatedly referred to as a Democratic hoax.
On Wednesday, while casting blame on Biden’s presidency, Trump conceded that prices remain high while arguing that the nation was “poised” for an economic boom.
“I am bringing those high prices down and bringing them down very fast,” he said.
Trump’s Republicans are seeking to maintain control of the House of Representatives and Senate in November elections next year, while Democrats are highlighting affordability concerns and differences over healthcare policy in an attempt to wrest power away.
High inflation during Biden’s four years in office helped Trump beat former vice president Kamala Harris in last year’s election.
But Trump’s tariff policies this year have created uncertainty and lifted prices in an economy that has now been overseen by his administration for nearly a year — and Trump, like Biden before him, has been struggling to persuade Americans that the economy is healthy.
A new Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday showed just 33pc of US adults approve of how Trump has handled the economy.
Trump’s remarks took place in the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room and not the Oval Office as presidential addresses often do.
‘Hottest country anywhere’
In his remarks, Trump said he had attracted $18 trillion in investments that will create jobs and open factories. He credited his tariff policy as a leading factor: “One year ago our country was dead … Now we’re the hottest country anywhere in the world.”
He also said he would announce the next chair of the Federal Reserve soon, someone who believes in lower interest rates, by a lot, and mortgage payments will be coming down even further”.
The speech came just a day before a closely watched update on inflation from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
After touching a four-year low of 2.3pc in April just three months into Trump’s second term, annual inflation since then has been grinding higher.
In September — the latest data available because of reporting disruptions caused by the record-long government shutdown — the Consumer Price Index was up 3.0pc year-over-year, the highest since January and higher than at any time during Trump’s first term.
Still, the inflation impact from Trump’s tariffs has not been as significant as many economists had predicted early in his term, with the cost of the import taxes spread among foreign producers, goods importers and end users, including consumers.
Prior to the speech, the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, contended that Trump had failed to live up to his campaign promises.
“He promised he’d bring costs down on day one. That was his number-one promise. That was the number-one reason he won the election. And costs are going up and up and up,” Schumer said at a news conference on Capitol Hill.</p><small>2025-12-18 06:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18110106fbd7eb8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961823/india-streamlines-visa-rules-to-ease-movement-of-foreign-engineers-technicians-in-boost-for-chinese-professionals' target='_blank'><strong>India streamlines visa rules to ease movement of foreign engineers, technicians in boost for Chinese professionals</strong></a><br><p>India has reformed its business visa regime to ease movement of foreign engineers and technicians, the government said in a statement, which will be a boost for local firms leaning on Chinese professionals for manufacturing services.
India’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade said late on Wednesday it had launched a new digital platform last month for companies to generate sponsorship letters to invite foreign professionals, has simplified visa forms and will no longer ask relevant ministries for additional recommendations.
The visas have been eased for factory installation, commissioning, maintenance, and production, among other functions. Indian businesses predominantly depend on Chinese professionals for such services and to train local staff, especially in factories that deploy Chinese machinery.
Reuters reported last week that India has cut red tape to speed up visas for Chinese professionals in signs of improved ties between the two nations.
India had blocked virtually all Chinese visits after the nuclear-armed neighbours clashed on their Himalayan frontier in mid-2020, widening its vetting of business visas beyond the home and foreign ministries.
The removal of red tape comes after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China this year for the first time in seven years, meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping and discussing ways to improve ties.
In the face of punishing US tariffs, Modi has cautiously rekindled ties with Beijing.
Think tank the Observer Research Foundation estimates the tougher scrutiny on visas led to production losses of $15 billion over four years to Indian electronics makers, which import key machinery from China.
Major Chinese electronics companies, such as Xiaomi, have also struggled to get visas.
Industry executives have said such curbs hit their plans to expand in India, while the solar industry was also hit by shortages of skilled labour.</p><small>2025-12-18 05:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/18095309cbd6672.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961820/we-need-to-do-more-australian-pm-vows-crackdown-on-hate-speech-after-bondi-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>‘We need to do more’: Australian PM vows crackdown on hate speech after Bondi shooting</strong></a><br><p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Thursday promised a crackdown on hate speech in the wake of an attack on a Jewish holiday event at Sydney’s Bondi Beach, as the youngest of 15 victims was laid to rest.
The alleged father-and-son gunmen opened fire as hundreds of people celebrated Hanukkah on Sydney’s famous Bondi Beach on Sunday. The attack, which shocked the nation and led to fears over rising anti-Semitism, appears to have been inspired by the Islamic State, authorities say.
Criticised by many in the Jewish community for not doing enough to combat a rise in anti-Semitism since the start of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, Albanese said the government will seek to introduce legislation that makes it easier to charge people promoting hate speech and violence.
Penalties would be increased, cancelling or refusing visas would be made easier, and a regime for targeting organisations whose leaders engage in hate speech would be developed, he said.
“Australians are shocked and angry. I am angry. It is clear we need to do more to combat this evil scourge much more,” Albanese told a news conference announcing the reforms.



Albanese’s government has said it has consistently denounced anti-Semitism over the last two years.
It passed legislation to criminalise hate speech, and in August, it expelled the Iranian ambassador after accusing Tehran of directing two anti-Semitic arson attacks in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne.
Still, anti-Semitic incidents have been mounting. A 19-year-old Sydney man was charged and will face court on Thursday after allegedly threatening violence towards a Jewish person on a flight from Bali to Sydney on Wednesday.
“Police will allege the man made antisemitic threats and hand gestures indicating violence towards the alleged victim, who the man knew to be affiliated with the Jewish community,” Australian Federal Police said on Thursday.
Youngest victim laid to rest
Yellow toy bees topped the coffin of 10-year-old Matilda, who was remembered as a “ray of sunshine” who loved animals and dancing.
Matilda’s middle name was Bee, which inspired attendees to wear bee stickers, and bee-themed toys and balloons, while some mourners wore yellow. Matilda’s family has asked the media not to use their surname.
“The tragic, so totally cruel, unfathomable murder of young Matilda is something to all of us as if our own daughter [were] taken from us,” said Rabbi Yehoram Ulman.

 

“Matilda grew up like a child would, loving what children love. She loved the outdoors, animals. She went to school, she had friends, everybody loved her.”
The line outside the hall where Matilda’s funeral was held in Sydney’s eastern suburbs snaked down the street. Many mourners who could not get in watched the service on a screen outside the building.
“It’s like your heart’s been ripped out. It’s terrible … no one wants this,” said Jae Glover, 25, as he handed out bee stickers.
“It’s a feeling, it could have been avoided. Anti-Semitism has now been brewing in Australia for over two years.”
Philippines, Islamic State links investigated
Police allege the attack was carried out by Sajid Akram, 50, and his 24-year-old son Naveed. Sajid was shot dead by police at the scene, while Naveed Akram was charged with 59 offences on Wednesday after waking from a coma, including murder and terror charges.
The centre-left Labour government has ruled out holding a Royal Commission, a high-level inquiry with judicial powers, into the shootings for now.
On Wednesday, the leader of New South Wales, where the attack took place, said he would next week recall the state parliament to pass urgent reforms on gun laws.
Police are looking into Australia-based Islamic State networks as well as the gunmen’s alleged links to militants in the Philippines.
The Philippines’ National Security Council on Wednesday said that while Sajid and his son had been in the country for a month in November, the pair had not engaged in any military training.
Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate in the Philippines and have wielded some influence in the south of the country.
“There is no valid report or confirmation that the two received any form of military training while in the country, and no evidence supports such a claim at present,” Philippine national security adviser Eduardo Ano said in a statement.</p><small>2025-12-18 04:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/69436d7cf0888.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961758/watering-hope-and-hype' target='_blank'><strong>Watering hope and hype</strong></a><br><p>A BRIEF but telling moment passed quickly without comment in the press conference by the DG ISPR on Dec 5. It came in response to a question in which he was asked a vague and rambling question about how the “national media” amplifies the remarks and narratives that the DG had spent the entire press conference denouncing as fake and against the interests of Pakistan.
The DG started off by saying that the big problem with the “national media” is that they want to discuss nothing but “politics and rhetoric”. He exhorted them to talk about “actual issues” inst­e­­ad and went on to furnish a few examples. He said the country’s population is 250 million, and it’s growing by 4m every year, saying that we’re adding a small country’s worth of population every year.
“That requires a lot of resources,” he said, referring to the mouths that need feeding. He pointed to the recent rains and ensuing floods, pointed out the huge losses they caused, then added that, according to one estimate, 25 to 30 million acre feet of water was drained into the sea within three months. “One MAF is equal to $1 billion of agriculture product,” he carried on. “So you poured 25 to 30 billion dollars’ worth of water” into the sea.
Then he mentioned the water storage capacity of the country, at 13 to 14 MAF, and underlined that next year there will be even more rains, then let the thought trail off by saying the media should be talking about “storage and its canals”.

Rarely, if ever, does one see an actual substantive issue being given actual substantive treatment on prime time television.

“Our population is increasing, we need food security for them, we need to increase cultivable land, we need to, for the sake of the economy, properly exploit our mineral resources,” he said, as he urged the media to talk about these (and other) things, “and tell us this is the proper way to do it”. He concluded by telling the questioner that there are not “dozens, but hundreds of issues” to talk about, but the media seems to have made up its mind to keep its focus on “he says, she says” and what people are saying to each other rather than concentrating on the actual problems plaguing the country.

 

So let’s start by acknowledging that the DG is absolutely correct in pointing out that Pakistan’s public conversation is heavily saturated with the “he says, she says” of politics. Rarely, if ever, does one see an actual substantive issue being given actual substantive treatment on prime time television or any actual investigative work in print publications. Journalists rarely make the effort to ask whether a claim that is being made is true or not. They simply report what somebody said and leave it at that.
One result is that inaccurate claims gain widespread circulation and journalists, of all people, don’t ask simple questions, like ‘is this true?’ More than anything else, it is the economy that suffers because wild claims presenting quick fixes, or elaborate cons disguised as ‘innovation’ enter the policy conversation, are backed by dodgy numbers and data, get reported in the media as if they were factual, and perceptions grow around them that somehow a magical fix of all our economic problems can be had if only we can do this one thing, whatever it may be.
Take the example cited by the DG himself, the claim that 1 MAF of water equals $1bn of agriculture output, which he apparently supposes to mean that $25 to $30bn worth of water is being drained into the sea every year. On this supposition he builds the understanding that if we could only harness this water, using dams and canals, we could recover all this value and ensure our food security, and presumably also shore up our external account weakness, since he gives the value of the water in dollars.

 

But does 1 MAF of water really equal $1bn of output? The last mention this claim finds is when the Punjab member of the Indus River System Authority — Rao Irshad Ali Khan — told a Senate committee that “we and our coming generations would die of hunger if we do not build dams” and used this figure to buttress his case back in 2020. But if you look carefully, you will notice something.
It seems a crude calculation was performed to derive this figure. They seem to have taken the GDP contribution of agriculture, forestry and fisheries for FY2019, as reported by the State Bank, converted that amount to dollars at average exchange rate for that fiscal year, then divided that figure with the total availability of surface water in FY2019. If you do this, you get a figure close to $1bn per MAF.
But there are problems here. The first and biggest problem is an underlying assumption that is faulty. If it takes roughly 1 MAF of water to produce $1bn worth of agriculture output today, does that mean we can secure another $1bn worth of agriculture output with every incremental 1 MAF of water? The answer is no, it doesn’t work like that. The costs of building all the infrastructure required to arrange that incremental 1 MAF of water will have to be deducted from the present value of the anticipated future cash flows of any agricultural output that will result from the storage. Once you do this, you will notice that any increase in cultivable land brought about by building more water storage capacity does not break even for at least a decade if not longer.
Space prevents a more detailed examination and rebuttal of the Punjab member’s claims. But suffice it to say that it is a defective idea to build a vision for national renewal out of assumptions built on the claim that 1 MAF of water can add $1bn to our economic output. The lack of focus on substantive issues in our national conversation is what gives currency to such dubious numbers. It is a good idea to take them with a heavy dose of scepticism.

This landmark decision by the ICJ’s 15 judges authoritatively clarifies states’ legal responsibilities, establishing the 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature threshold as the binding global benchmark. COP30 in Belém has since acknowledged growing risks of overshoot.
The court’s opinion imposes on every state a binding obligation to demonstrate its “highest possible ambition” in climate action. This requires aligning Nationally Determined Contributions and regulatory frameworks with the scientifically determined target. Significantly, the court’s analysis extends state responsibility to the full lifecycle of fossil fuels: production, licensing, subsidies, and downstream indirect emissions across the value chain. The opinion confirms that IPCC assessments constitute “the best available science”, rendering fossil fuel subsidies potentially wrongful when foreseeably incompatible with temperature limits.
The ICJ’s reasoning unfolds through five foundational principles:


Precautionary approach: Scientific uncertainty cannot justify inaction. The court emphasises that IPCC warnings mandate immediate protective steps, even as 1.5°C proves unsafe for vulnerable populations of countries like Pakistan at current 1.2°C warming.


Duty to prevent significant harm: Under customary international law, states must exercise due diligence to prevent transboundary environmental damage, extending to all anthropogenic GHG contributions from production through consumption.


Common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC): Burdens must align with historical emissions, current capacities, and evolving circumstances. The Paris Agreement’s “different national circumstances” formulation upholds, rather than weakens this core principle.


Intergenerational equity: Present generations hold climate stability in trust for future ones. The court rejects infrastructure decisions creating emissions lock-in that imperil subsequent generations’ rights to dignified living conditions.


Duty to cooperate: A legally binding obligation requires states to collaborate on mitigation, adaptation, finance, and technology transfer, with higher-capacity states bearing primary responsibility towards vulnerable ones.


The court rejected arguments by developed countries that specialised climate treaties supersede other international obligations, confirming these principles integrate across UN Charter obligations, human rights law, and environmental treaties. This means the developed countries cannot use the Paris Agreement’s ambiguous language to shield themselves from broader legal accountability.

Pakistan’s superior judiciary operationalised ICJ’s recent climate principles much earlier.

While unanimous on core 1.5°C obligations as a state responsibility, individual judges articulated nuanced approaches. Judge Nolte advocated cautious interpretation, prioritising close adherence to treaty texts. Judge Xue highlighted challenges in linking past emissions to present harms, calling for steady progress through careful monitoring while treating 1.5°C as a practical guide. Judge Yusuf stressed that new fossil fuel projects constitute risks under due diligence standards, demanding clear national plans over procedural delays.

 

Judges Aurescu, Bhandari, and Tladi linked human rights and harm prevention to accelerated emissions cuts by major emitters, grounding these in equity principles and compensation duties. In their statement, Judges Bhandari and Cleveland required accounting for full emissions chains from production to use, calling new fossil fuel exploration incompatible with 1.5°C limits.
Pakistan’s superior judiciary operationalised these ICJ principles years earlier. In ‘Shehla Zia vs Wapda’ (1994), the Supreme Court established that scientific uncertainty mandated precautionary protection. ‘D.G. Khan Cement vs Government of Punjab’ (2021) prohibited industrial expansion in ecologically fragile zones, embodying ‘duty to prevent significant harm’ while recognising intergenerational justice and environmental personhood.
Most significantly, ‘Asghar Leghari vs Federation of Pakistan’ (2015) saw Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah recognise Pakistan’s limited historical emissions while mandating action commensurate with national capacity, explicitly invoking CBDR-RC. Justice Shah affirmed future generations’ constitutional rights to climate stability. The Climate Change Commission, where I served under Dr Parvez Hassan, operationalised the ‘duty to cooperate’ through multi-stakeholder collaboration.
Justice Athar Minallah’s Islamabad Zoo case reinforced that governmental neglect causing environmental degradation violates fundamental duties. These precedents position Pakistan’s judiciary among global leaders in climate jurisprudence, presenting a compelling case for Pakistan to recognise its recently ‘retired’ judges by nominating them for ICJ positions in 2027, when a third of the court’s members retire.
The diverse judicial perspectives in the ICJ offer Pakistan multiple pathways rather than binary choices. Pakistan can pursue enhanced environmental standards and climate risk assessments that satisfy core obligations, while evidence-based sectoral transitions can target RE expansion and incremental scaling. Controlled fossil fuel reductions synchronised with global roadmaps can balance climate ambition with economic stability.
Pakistan faces significant implementation challenges. Its political economy, fiscal constraints, institutional capacity gaps, and reliance on fossil fuel projects create tensions with climate commitments. The advisory opinion’s non-binding nature means enforcement depends on political will and diplomatic pressure. However, our unique position as both climate-vulnerable and jurisprudentially advanced creates an opportunity where Pakistan can leverage its superior court precedents to demonstrate that 1.5°C-aligned governance is legally feasible and constitutionally mandated. By formally recognising the judiciary’s pre-emptive alignment with ICJ principles, Pakistan positions its jurisprudence as a global contribution worthy of replication.
Coordinated action is needed across multiple fronts. Pakistan must deliver climate justice to its people by grounding its position in pioneering judicial precedents alongside the ICJ opinion, establishing that developed countries’ obligations to provide financial and technological help stem from binding legal principles, not voluntary solidarity.
By honouring their judiciary’s legacy while embracing the ICJ’s guidance, Pakistani negotiators can champion the 1.5°C imperative as a moral necessity and legal obligation. The deeper challenge ahead, however, is delivering justice to front-line communities while advancing climate accountability.

KARACHI: The country’s real‑estate developers on Wednesday alleged that the city’s business community has been facing an unprecedented rise in extortion and harassment cases from organised criminal gangs, and warned that they will shut down their business activity after January 15, 2026, if authorities fail to curb the unchecked reign of fear gripping the city.
The warning by the Association of Builders and Developers (Abad) came only two months after the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (Kati) and All City Traders Ittehad Association had expressed serious concerns about the growing cases of extortion and urged the Sindh government and law enforcement agencies to ensure foolproof security for traders and industrialists.
Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Abad office-bearers accused criminal networks operating both locally and from abroad of systematically targeting builders, developers and businessmen through extortion calls, threats and shooting incidents.
According to Abad Chairman Muhammad Hassan Bakshi, extortion calls have surged over the past five months, with at least 10 of its association members formally reporting threats.
“We are receiving calls from Iranian and Dubai-based numbers, demanding up to Rs50 million in extortion. Those who refuse are shot at. This is not speculation — it is happening on the ground,” he said.
He alleged that “known criminals,” including Ahmed Ali Magsi, Jameel Chhanga and Wasiullah Lakho, were openly involved in extortion, land grabbing and intimidation.
He said extortionists even send threatening notes, bearing their names, phone numbers and bank account details, yet no effective action has been taken against them. “Sixty cases are already registered against Wasiullah Lakho. The question is why is he still free,” he said, adding that Abad officials had submitted written complaints to President Asif Ali Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Sindh chief minister, leaving “no excuse of ignorance”.
“The law and order is not a favour but a constitutional duty of the state. We can’t understand how five or six individuals are holding Karachi hostage. They are traceable, they are known, yet they are free. If by January 15 the situation does not improve, Abad will be forced to shut down business in Karachi,” he added.
The association’s patron-in-chief, Mohsin Sheikhani, said the real estate section was left with no option but to consider shutting down operations.
The situation, he said, had deteriorated to the point where police appeared “helpless”. He appealed “directly to the army chief to intervene, warning that the economy will collapse” otherwise.
“Unless the federal government takes up this issue and red warrants are issued against extortionists, including those operating from Iran, nothing will change. Our properties, investments and even lives are at stake. If the state cannot protect us, how can we continue doing business?” he asked.
Senior Abad member Syed Afzal Hameed said he had never paid extortion and never would, calling the developing situation a conspiracy to sabotage the economy. He asked the authorities to move “before it’s too late.”
“Karachi’s share in national revenue has already fallen from 62 per cent to 50pc. If real estate collapses, remittances and tax collection will also suffer,” he added.

Hope for redress is growing thin, especially as the justice system comes under greater strain. Meanwhile, antagonistic parties are moving towards further confrontation rather than being engaged in defusing the atmosphere of perpetual crisis that has come to dominate the country.

 

Sadly, despite many revisions of the social contract, matters are not improving, with Pakistan caught in the tightening grip of a sociopolitical crisis. As avenues for legitimate dissent continue to narrow, the government appears more concerned with maintaining its control rather than addressing the grievances that drive public dissatisfaction.
Amnesty International’s South Asia office on Wednesday flagged the use of high-pressure water cannons against protesters outside Adiala Jail the previous night as “a flagrant violation of their right to peaceful assembly”. It also noted reports of chemical irritants being added to the water.
Calling on the authorities to “respect people’s right to peacefully protest and end the disproportionate and punitive use of force”, it reminded them that “International human rights standards permit the use of water cannons only in situations of serious public disorder and widespread violence”.
There is, in fact, no logical need for the state to continue to resort to strong-arm tactics, especially after it has acquired immense power in most spheres of administration and governance in the country. Yet, inexplicably, the government continues to act as if it is under a constant existential threat from the former PM and his political party, and feels it must keep resorting to force to keep them in check.

 

In the process, it is only creating new problems for itself. The UN special rapporteur on torture recently warned that Mr Khan’s prolonged solitary confinement may be considered akin to “torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment”.
“Denying visits by family and legal counsel violates Pakistan’s commitments under international human rights conventions such as ICCPR and due process safeguards,” Amnesty warned in its statement on the matter, adding that, “The Mandela Rules note that prohibition of family contact cannot be used as a disciplinary and punitive measure”.
Mr Khan is already in jail. He is facing multiple trials. His prosecution may continue, but his rights should not be denied. Allowing visits from family and lawyers will not change Mr Khan’s legal status, and it therefore makes little sense for the authorities to insist on keeping him isolated. The state must honour international conventions on prisoners’ rights and avoid more opprobrium while it can.

An FIA official told Dawn that passengers Hanzla and Zain Ali, both belonging to Sialkot, were travelling to Saudi Arabia on an Umrah visa.
However, the official claimed that during clearance, the immigration officials found both passengers to be ‘suspicious’. He claimed that upon further investigation, they were allegedly found connected with a Libya-based human trafficker named Ravi Masih.
He claimed that both passengers had struck a deal with the agent in exchange of Rs2.5 million each for sending them to Italy via Libya. The official said both passengers were later handed over to the Gujranwala FIA circle for further necessary action.
It is pertinent to mention that scores of the passengers are being offloaded daily from different flights out of Pakistan for the last few months.

 

A senior FIA official said that imposition of these restrictions and scrutiny of passengers had been paying dividends since no tragic incidents involving Pakistani immigrants had been reported in the last almost 11 months. He said that the last such incident occurred in the sea between Mauritania and Morocco in January 2025.

 

The FIA has identified several cities of Punjab, mainly in the Gujrat and Gujranwala regions, for profiling. Passengers between the ages of 15 to 40 years with certain destinations in Africa, Middle East and Central Asia are being profiled and stopped to stop illegal immigration and human trafficking.
However, businessmen, tourists, students and other categories of travellers have been facing difficulties due to these restrictions and there are complaints of passengers with valid documents being regularly offloaded.

The request was formally made by Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari to a visiting ADB delegation led by Ms Leah Gutierrez, Director General, Central and West Asia Department though he did not pitch size of the proposed loan to be discussed subsequently. ADB’s total debt stock currently stands at $17bn, the third largest after China and the World Bank.

 

Informed sources told Dawn that the minister proposed that the Manila-based lending agency should come up with financing instruments and arrangements that could directly make power sector debt more affordable through longer payback period and cheaper interest rates than commercial financing from the market. The ADB’s financing and other instruments could also be leveraged to prolong debt-repayment periods.
This would enable the government to avoid budgetary injections and instead finance debt repayments through power tariff at lower than existing rates and help revive power consumption that had been struggling to pickup for years due to unaffordable electricity rates and resultant expansion of the solar revolution, leading to stability challenges to the national grid and power utilities.

Govt requests lender to help stabilise national grid, improve debt affordability, foster private investment

The government had recently contracted around Rs1.25tr from local commercial banks at Kibor minus 0.9pc to replace previous debts but the central bank’s policy rate has since dropped with a similar pathway projects going ahead. The new debt is being financed through a permanent Rs3.23 per unit debt servicing surcharge on consumers. The government team also sought additional financing for smart metering expansion across distribution companies.
The minister also made a case for increased external support for Pakistan’s contribution towards lowering carbon footprint through solar revolution in the country that had also created challenges to the grid stability. The government team argued that combination of financial support for cheaper debt swaps, smart metering and global environmental contribution could significantly reduce average power rates and help stabilise system through new technologies and demand growth for grid supply.
An official statement confirmed that Mr Leghari “sought ADB’s support in addressing power sector debt repayment challenges, and in building confidence among private investors” and briefed the delegation on key challenges facing the power sector.
“He highlighted constraints in financing, issues related to rupee cover, and high upfront costs,” the statement said, adding that the government was engaging local investors through the Pakistan Business Council to attract private investment in the power transmission sector and to improve market visibility.
The minister also explained to the ADB that under the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP), excess power capacity which was not required in the future had been removed and the government will not procure additional power as it was now moving towards a competitive electricity market.
He said Pakistan had already transitioned around 20GW to clean energy. “However, despite this significant transition, no dedicated financing was provided for the clean energy shift, nor was funding made available to ensure grid stability,” he was quoted as saying, adding that the transition to renewable energy continued despite these limitations.
He emphasised that serious and coordinated efforts, supported by adequate financing, were now required to keep the grid stable. The ADB team was also apprised about the details of the recently introduced Energy Surplus Package to increase electricity demand and encourage higher power offtake by the private sector.
“He requested ADB’s support on the financing side, particularly in addressing debt repayment challenges, and in building confidence among private investors,” the statement said.
The minister promised that a feasibility report aimed at private investors will be presented soon.
He also shared that the government was planning the rollout of smart meters through the private sector participation under public-private partnership model, with a focus on technology integration and improved efficiency.

ISLAMABAD: While accusing Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Sardar Sarfraz Dogar of ‘bias’ against him, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri has requested the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to set aside the recent IHC decision to hear a petition challenging the authenticity of his law degree, and filed a formal complaint before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against the chief justice.
In his plea moved through senior counsel Uzair Karamat Bhandari, Justice Jahangiri requested the FCC to set aside the Dec 9 order that had declared maintainable a petition calling upon him to justify the authority under which he holds a high court office in the wake of allegations that his LLB degree from Karachi University (KU) was obtained through unfair means.
The FCC was told that CJ Dogar was biased against Justice Jahangiri and therefore disqualified from hearing any matter relating to his appointment. Justice Jahangiri recalled in the petition that he had already challenged Justice Dogar’s transfer to the IHC, followed by his elevation as IHC CJ and in these circumstances judicial propriety required that the IHC chief justice should not preside over proceedings concerning the writ of quo warranto.

 

Justice Jahangiri said Justice Khalid Hussain Soomro had recused himself from the case on Oct 28, and maintained that the IHC chief justice ought to have followed the same course. Instead, the chief justice not only fixed the petition before himself while heading a division bench on Sept 16, but also passed an interim restraining order barring Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions, though that order was later set aside by the Supreme Court.
The petition recalled that while setting aside the restraining order, the SC had directed the IHC division bench to first decide the office objections raised against the petition pending before the high court and only thereafter proceed to hear the matter. However, according to Justice Jahangiri, the IHC division bench went on to decide the issue of maintainability without issuing notice to him or affording him an opportunity of being heard.
“This was not only a clear violation of the SC directions, but also a grave procedural impropriety, as the petitioner was given no notice on the question of maintainability and only three days to submit a reply on the merits,” the petition argued.
Complaint before SJC
Separately, Justice Jahangiri also filed a formal complaint against his boss, IHC CJ Dogar, before the SJC under Article 209 of the Constitution, accusing him of misconduct, bias, and violation of the Code of Conduct for Judges in relation to proceedings concerning the legitimacy of his degree and appointment.
According to the complaint, while the matter was sub judice, the IHC chief justice discussed the pending case with Justice Jahangiri and advised him, both directly and indirectly, to resign from office. Justice Jahangiri asserted that such conduct alone disqualified Justice Dogar from hearing the case.
The complaint alleged that during these discussions, the chief justice acknowledged that “tremendous pressure” was being exerted on him to decide the matter expeditiously and against Justice Jahangiri. It was claimed that Justice Dogar suggested that if he were to submit a post-dated resignation and hand it over to him for ‘safe-keeping’, it would help placate those exerting pressure and allow proceedings to be delayed.

“Whether it’s the laptops or the 1,000 students trained in agriculture, or even the 600 students I sent to China during my tenure as the chief minister of Punjab, it is my firm belief that Pakistan’s development does not rely on any single province. It depends on holistic development,” he said at a ceremony at the University of Haripur, where he distributed 500 laptops among students of different universities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
On the occasion, PM She­h­baz shared his vision of empowering Pakistan’s you­th, stressing the importance of providing them with opportunities based on their capabilities to gain global recognition. “The future of this nation lies in the hands of our students, who are not just bri­l­liant but capable enough to conquer the world,” he said.
The prime minister also honoured the people of KP and the Hazara division for their resilience in the face of terrorism and ongoing security challenges. He paid tribute to the police, law enforcement agencies and the armed forces for their sacrifices in securing the nation.
During his address, the prime minister also referred to the May conflict with India, saying New Delhi would not forget the setback it faced at the hands of Pak­i­s­tan’s armed forces during “Marka-i-Haq”.
“That was a punch in the face for Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said, while praising the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as brave and patriotic. He said the province’s people, along with civil and military forces, had made unforgettable sacrifices for the country.
Economic challenges
The prime minister also shed light on other challenges facing the nation, particularly the state of the economy and the need for skill development. He touched upon the importance of modern skills in sectors like IT, agriculture and mining, stressing the need to bridge the gap between the youth’s capabilities and the industry’s demands.
“We have pulled the economy back from the brink of default, and now it is time to boost growth,” he said, adding that the government planned to send delegations from all provinces to China for training in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.
Earlier, newly elected MNA from Haripur Babar Nawaz highlighted the issues faced by the constituency, particularly in education and development. He said many girls were unable to pursue higher education in co-educational institutions due to cultural constraints and requested the establishment of a women’s campus at Haripur University.
Minister for Kashmir Affairs Amir Muqam also addressed the ceremony and praised the prime minister’s outreach to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Hazara, saying the region valued the government’s initiatives.

Three ruling coalition partners — Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) — as well as Awami National Party (ANP) approached the BHC, requesting that the upcoming Quetta Metropolitan Corporation and District Council Quetta elections should be postponed due to harsh cold weather, issues related to voters lists and non-completion of limitation of constituencies.

 

The parties also expressed their apprehensions regarding law and order situation.
While PML-N leader Younis Baloch claimed that the petitions were filed by PPP, PML-N, BAP and Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), the latter denied his claim. “Our party has launched a full campaign in favour of its candidates fielded for contesting the election,” Faysal Kakar, spokesman for the party, told Dawn.

PPP, PML-N, BAP and PkMAP approach Balochistan High Court to seek delay

Also, the provincial president of Pashtoonkhwa National Awami Party (PkNAP) Nasrullah Zerey denied the filing of a petition for election postponement.
However, the parliamentary leader of ANP in Balochistan Assembly, Zamarak Khan Piralizai, confirmed to Dawn that his party did file a petition for the postponement of Local bodies’ election in Quetta district.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti earlier opposed the conduct of local bodies elections in Quetta district this month and asked the Election Commission of Pakistan for postponement, informing it the government was working on legislation to make local governments effective.
He also told reports that the term of the existing local bodies’ institutions in the province would end over the next nine months and holding LG polls in Quetta only was without justification.
“Holding of election for Quetta Metropolitan Corporation (QMC) will be an unnecessary practice,” Chief Minister Bugti said, adding that election in Quetta should be held according to new local bodies law being introduced.
The BHC had ordered the ECP to hold local bodies’ election in Quetta two months back, dismissing all petitions against the holding of the election. Sub­sequently, the provincial election commissioner, Balochistan, announced the election schedule, with Dec 28 set as day of polling.
The Balochistan government filed an appeal in the election commission for the postponement of Quetta election but the appeal was rejected.
The chief minister also petitioned the ECP, which rejected the plea.

ISLAMABAD: A United Nations Security Council report has rejected the Taliban’s claim that terrorist groups are not using Afghan territory for cross-border violence, calling the assertion “not credible” and warning that neighbouring states increasingly view Afghanistan as a source of regional insecurity.
The assessment is contained in the sixteenth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, submitted to the UN Security Council, as international concern grows over Afghanistan’s security landscape more than four years after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021.
“The de facto authorities continue to deny that any terrorist groups have a footprint in or operate from its territory. That claim is not credible,” the report said.

 

The Taliban had pledged under the 2020 Doha Agreement to prevent Afghanistan from being used to threaten other countries. While following their return to power in Aug 2021, they have aggressively targeted Islamic State-Khorasan Province, or ISIL-K, their stance toward other terrorist groups has been markedly different, according to various UN assessments.
The latest report said “a wide range of member states consistently report that ISIL-K, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Al Qaeda, the Eastern Turkistan Isla­mic Movement, also known as the Turkistan Islamic Party (ETIM/TIP), Jamaat Ansarullah, Ittiha­dul Mujahideen Pakistan, and others are present in Afghanistan. Some groups have used or are continuing to use Afghanistan to plan and prepare external attacks.”
Al Qaeda is assessed by the United Nations as maintaining close ties with the Taliban, with a persistent presence in several provinces. While its activities are kept low-profile, UN monitors say the group benefits from a permissive environment that allows training and reorganisation. By contrast, ISIL-K is considered the Taliban’s primary adversary. Taliban operations have degraded its territorial control, but the group has remained resilient, carrying out attacks inside Afghan­istan and abroad.
The most acute threat to regional stability, however, is seen as the TTP, which the UN report describes as enjoying strong support from elements within the Taliban and operating from Afghan sanctuaries.
“Taliban authorities continue to deny and deflect responsibility for failing to restrain TTP,” the report said. “Within the Taliban there are varying degrees of sympathy for and allegiance with TTP.”

 

“Some senior members increasingly view TTP as a liability, unnecessarily disrupting and antagonising relations with Pakistan, while others remain supportive of it,” the report said. Assessing the likelihood of the Taliban severing ties with the group under Pakistani pressure, the report said, “Given the historical ties, the Taliban are unlikely to confront or act against TTP.” It added, “Even should they wish to, they may lack the ability to do so.”
According to the report, the TTP has conducted “numerous high-profile attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil”, making it the most serious immediate challenge to relations between Kabul and Islamabad.
“The number of TTP attacks in Pakistan has been increasing throughout 2025,” the report said. “By some estimates, there have already been more than 600 attacks in Pakistan in 2025.”
It added that “many attacks have been complex in nature, involving multiple, coordinated attackers using methods such as vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices, combined with teams of suicide attackers on foot”, and noted that “a majority of those conducting suicide bombings in Pakistan were reported to be Afghans”.
Pakistan has long accused the Taliban of harbouring TTP fighters, estimated by the UN report at about 6,000. These TTP fighters are said to be living in Afghanistan provinces of Khost, Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika and Paktia with the group’s chief Noor Wali Mehsud, reportedly living in Kabul.
An unnamed member state was said to have reported that the family of Mehsud received a monthly payment of three million afghanis (roughly $43,000) from Taliban.
The dispute over the presence of TTP in Afghanistan has severely strained ties between the two neighbours, though the Afghan Taliban were once considered to be closely allied with Pakistan.
“These attacks have led to cross-border military confrontation, causing a number of casualties, as well as disruptions to bilateral trade,” the report said. “At the time of writing, in addition to the loss of life, the closure of border crossings with Pakistan is estimated to cost the Afghan economy around $1 million per day.” The monitoring team said TTP has expanded its targeting.
“In January, TTP issued a new directive expanding targets of its attacks to include military-owned businesses,” the report said, “thereby significantly escalating its focus on the economic interests of the military of Pakistan and of Chinese enterprises in Pakistan.” It also pointed to cooperation between TTP and other terrorist groups.
Despite the broader militant presence, the report noted some counterterrorism progress made by Pakistan.
“There have also been a number of high-profile arrests by the Pakistani authorities, such as the arrest of an ISIL-K spokesperson, Sultan Aziz Azam, on 16 May 2025,” it said.
“Overall, the capability of ISIL-K has been degraded as a result of counter-terrorism operations by the de facto authorities and Pakistan,” the report added, noting that “the arrest in mid-2025 by Turkish and Pakistani authorities of Ozgur Altun, known as Abu Yasir al-Turki, a key figure in the group’s media and logistical operations, may have contributed to the suspension of ‘Voice of Khorasan’.”
On Al Qaeda, the report said, “In March 2025, Osama Mahmoud was formally declared ‘emir’ of AQIS. He comes from Bajaur district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”

According to a notification issued by the Forest, Parks and Wildlife Depar­tment on Tuesday, the GB government has banned establishment of seasonal hotels for tourists and other commercial activities within Deosai National Park for the coming season.
The notification said the GB government’s step is ai­­med at protecting the pa­­rk’s fragile ecosystem and preserving its natural beauty.

 

The commercial activities in Deosai National Park pose a threat to environmental degradation, the notification said.

Step ai­­med at protecting its fragile ecosystem

The government asked hotel owners and managements to follow new regulations and not to establish any accommodation facilities for tourists.
It warned of legal action in violation of the ban. Deosai is a high-altitude alpine plain situated at an average elevation of 4,114 meters above the sea level and it is a National Park.
Stretching between Skar­­du and Astore distri­cts, Deosai National Park is a major summer attraction for national and international tourists and it is famous for its wildflowers, Himalayan brown bears, and breathtaking landscapes and is often called the “Land of Giants”.

 

In September this year, singer Quratulain Balouch suffered injuries after being attacked by a rare Himalayan brown bear during a camping trip in the park, prompting authorities to ban the camping in the area.
The park remains open for tourists from June to November every year.

Nisar Hussain Jafri, chairman of the Pakistan Goods Transporters Allia­nce (PGTA), which represents around 20 major transport associations across the country, told Dawn that the government had accepted the group’s major demands and goods’ movement had resumed.
Earlier, PGTA President Malik Shehzad Awan announced the decision at a press conference at the Gulbai Truck Stand in Karachi along with Punjab Transport Minister Bilal Akbar and Murtaza Wahab, representing the Sindh government. He said the strike was being withdrawn on assurances given by the authorities.
“We have called off the strike after it continued for 10 days. The decision was taken after the federal, Punjab and Sindh governments accepted our demands and signed the settlement document,” said Mr Awan.
He said the authorities had agreed to substantially reduce fines and resolve issues related to axle-load limits, the issuance of heavy transport driving licences, disputes with Customs authorities and the motorway police, and controversial provisions of the amended Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Ordinance 2025.
As part of the commitments, the meeting also decided the temporary allocation of 50 acres for truck parking opposite the US Consulate on Mai Kolachi Road under the administrative control of the Karachi Port Trust (KPT). It was also agreed that around 600 acres on the Northern Bypass (M-10) would be acquired from the Sindh government and earmarked for parking to ease congestion.
The decisions included construction of a 6km stretch of the Northern Bypass by April 2026, with the remaining portion to be completed subsequently. To further facilitate port traffic, the National Highway Authority plans to expand the route to six lanes, and a detailed design will be finalised by March 2026.
On reports of container-theft gangs stealing goods from import containers, the settlement also envisaged action by the Sindh police, with the provincial inspector general tasked with investigating the complaints and taking strict action against those involved.
All Pakistan Truck Trailer Owners Association Chairman Lala Yasir Naseer confirmed that freight movement had resumed following the announcement. “After being informed by our alliance, we have conveyed instructions to our members to resume business activities,” he told Dawn.
Transporters had gone on strike over what they described as excessive fines and had demanded the withdrawal of the Traffic Ordinance 2025.
Mr Akbar said heavy fines and the registration of FIRs against transporters had been abolished. He added that fitness certificates issued in Karachi would be recognised in Punjab and would be valid for six months.
He said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had directed that truck stands be built in cities across the province, along with rest areas for drivers.
Mr Wahab, who is also Karachi’s mayor, said the Sindh government had taken transporters into confidence before making decisions affecting them.
Talks between goods transporters and representatives of the Punjab and Sindh governments, the Customs department and the Ministry of Communications were held on Tuesday but remained inconclusive.
Mr Jafri said a fresh meeting was held on Wednesday at the Customs House in Karachi, attended by the same government side and joined via video link by Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, Federal Minister for Communications Aleem Khan, Port and Shipping Minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiani.
Industrialists said the strike had begun in Punjab on Dec 8, with protests in cities including Rawalpindi and Lahore led by the Punjab Public Transport Association and the Goods Transporters Association against the provincial government’s enforcement of the Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Ordinance 2025.
They said the ordinance introduced sharply increased fines and penalties for traffic violations such as speeding, overloading and operating older vehicles, which transporters deemed an unbearable financial burden.
Industrialists estimated the textile sector alone incurred losses of around $500 million over the past 10 days, while stranded consignments attracted demurrage and detention charges at ports and factory premises.
They said production lines were forced to slow down or shut down due to disruptions in the supply of raw materials and the dispatch of finished goods, raising the risk of missed vessel sailings and cancellations of international orders.
The strike also affected the movement of industrial inputs from seaports to factories across the country.

Heavy weapons and mortar shells were used during the clash, and some of the mortar shells landed in nearby populated areas, causing civilian casualties and damage to property, the residents said.
According to sources, several mortar shells fell on houses in Hasokhel and Moski villages. As a result, a civilian sustained critical injuries and later succumbed to his wounds at a hospital, while four others were seriously injured. Among the injured is the minor daughter of Malik Nisar Ali Khan, president of Awami National Party in North Waziristan.
Residents said announcements were made from mosques’ loudspeakers in nearby villages, appealing to both sides for a ceasefire to allow the evacuation of the injured.
The injured were shifted to a local hospital through rough and unpaved routes after enduring severe hardships. 
During the clash, residents said security forces’ helicopters also targeted suspected terror hideouts in the area, triggering panic and fear among residents. 
Due to the shelling, several families were forced to move to safer locations, while business activities remained suspended. 
The Bannu-Miranshah Road was also closed to all kinds of traffic.
Local people demanded that the use of heavy weapons in populated areas be avoided to prevent harm to innocent civilians.
Official sources said that the operation was launched on the basis of intelligence reports and that action against terrorists was still ongoing in the area. 
Authorities maintained that steps were being taken to ensure the safety of civilians.

There was no indication of the scale of the deployment, which comes as tensions are rising over the standoff between Latin American oil producer Venezuela and the United States.
The personnel will be deployed at Ecuador’s Manta air force base, which had served as a US base for a decade until 2009.
Ecuadoran voters in November overwhelmingly rejected a bid by President Daniel Noboa to lift the country’s ban on foreign bases. But according to the US embassy in Quito, the deployment is a “temporary operation with the Ecuadorian Air Force in Manta”.
The “short-term joint effort” will “enhance the capacity of the Ecuadorian military forces to combat narco-terrorists, including strengthening intelligence gathering and anti-drug trafficking capabilities, and is designed to protect the United States and Ecuador from the threats we share”.
Ecuador’s defence ministry said that US planes with “military material” had arrived in the country, but gave no further details.
Noboa is attempting to roll back a wave of narcotics cartel violence and has argued that Ecuador needs help to fight the gangs.
The US, under President Donald Trump, is aggressively moving to combat drug operations in Latin America. At the heart of the campaign is a growing conflict with the hard-left government in Venezuela.
Multiple US naval and air assets have been deployed in waters off Latin America and dozens of small boats allegedly running drugs have been bombed in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, killing at least 95 people so far.</p><small>2025-12-17 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17230342b58847f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961678/current-account-turns-positive-in-november-with-100m-surplus' target='_blank'><strong>Current account turns positive in November with $100m surplus</strong></a><br><p>The current account posted a $100 million surplus in November, which may change the trend of deficits in previous months of the current fiscal year.
However, data provided by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) shows that imports were curtailed to improve trade deficit figures during the month. The previous month, October, had posted a current account deficit of $291 million.
The previous fiscal year, FY25, surprised many by posting a net current account surplus of $1.932 billion and was widely celebrated by the government as a major positive for the economy. The surplus was also the result of tight import restrictions, which ultimately kept the economic growth rate well below the desired level. Policymakers have yet to announce a strategy to move away from import-led economic growth.
The data shows that the $100 million surplus in November was much lower than the $709 million surplus in the same month of the previous fiscal year.
In November this year, both exports and imports declined, which helped the current account post a surplus. Exports fell by 10% while imports dropped by 12% compared to October.
With this November surplus, the current account deficit for the five months from July to November FY26 has reduced to $812 million, compared with a $503 million surplus in the same period last fiscal year.
The trade deficit swelled to $37.17 billion in the first five months of FY26, making it harder for economic managers to rein in this trend.
SBP data shows that goods exports during the first five months were $12.79 billion, compared to $13.212 billion in the same period last year. Similarly, imports of goods during the first five months of FY26 were $25.559 billion, compared to $23.011 billion in the same period, showing an upward trend. Higher imports caused a large trade deficit, which ultimately puts pressure on the current account.
So far, remittance inflows have remained steady, averaging $3.2 billion per month, and are exceeding last year’s record inflows of $38 billion. The government expects remittances to reach $40 billion in FY26.
Higher remittances provide the State Bank room to buy dollars from the interbank market, boosting foreign exchange reserves and partially meeting external debt obligations. Most of the dues for debt servicing in FY25 were rolled over, and the situation in FY26 is not much different.

While briefing analysts after the Monetary Policy was announced on Monday, SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed said the external debt servicing requirement for FY26 is $25.8 billion, of which $9.7 billion has already been paid or rolled over. For the remainder of this fiscal year, net external debt servicing stands at $6.9 billion, excluding rollovers.</p><small>2025-12-17 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17224002f6c1437.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961676/ali-tareen-among-three-bidders-in-race-to-get-pffs-nod-for-new-league' target='_blank'><strong>Ali Tareen among three bidders in race to get PFF’s nod for new league</strong></a><br><p>Ali Tareen emerged as a surprise contender in the bidding war to hold a new football league in Pakistan, with the former owner of Pakistan Super League (PSL) cricket franchise Multan Sultans in a race against two franchise league merchants, who have long tried to get an event underway.
Last month, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) had invited expressions of interest from individuals and companies looking to hold a league in a bid to revive the domestic structure of the game in the country.
Tareen confirmed on Wednesday, the deadline day for submission, that he had sent a proposal.
“I have proposed a season (six-month) long league for Pakistan football, not a flashy, one-month cash-grab tournament,” Ali wrote on X, in a jibe at the proposed franchise leagues.







Pakistan hasn’t had a functioning league since the last edition of the Pakistan Premier Football League — which had a mix of departments and a smattering of clubs — in 2019.
Ali, who was denied renewal of Multan Sultans by the Pakistan Cricket Board last month as the PSL extended its agreements with other franchises, said his proposed league will have equity ownership for the teams.
“A proper league with home and away fixtures, equity ownership in the league for the teams, derbies with two clubs per city, and mandatory women’s teams playing earlier on matchday like the Hundred (in England),” he added.
“This is the model that builds long-term value, gives fans real clubs to support, and can take Pakistan football to the next level. League > Tournament.”
Two other proposals have come from entities who have been looking to launch franchise football leagues in the country on similar lines to the PSL.
One of them is Global Soccer Ventures (GSV), which held a launch event for its proposed ‘Pakistan Football League’ in Lahore in June last year. The other expression of interest has come from Zabe Khan, who was formerly part of GSV.
“The GSV revived interest in football when there was nothing happening locally,” Pakistan football player Kaleemullah, who is one of the faces of the PSL, told Dawn, on Wednesday, referring to the launch event which featured England striker Michael Owen.
GSV claims to have sold five of its eight franchises. “We have already sold our teams and we are ready to launch,” added Kaleem.
Former K-Electric sports head Zabe left GSV following the launch event amid claims that the company had not honoured its contracts and although he did not mention who was backing him for the league, Dawn understands that it is another entity that has long harboured ambitions of setting up a franchise league.
“We need both leagues … a franchise league and a club league,” Zabe told Dawn on Wednesday. “We’ve sent a proposal for a franchise league that will run for about a month to 45 days.”
The three bidders are set to give a detailed presentation to the Mohsen Gilani-led PFF on Dec 29 after which the country’s football governing body will make a formal decision on which entity to partner with.
Last week, Mohsen said that the PFF was looking to build something “stronger and more sustainable”.
“We have invited expressions of interest and received an encouraging number of propos­als from groups determined to deliver a new and improved league system,” Mohsen told reporters at an event in Lahore.
“As a fresh leadership, we are building something stronger and more sustainable. This league will not be rushed; it will be done the right way.”</p><small>2025-12-17 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1721270627f4028.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961674/three-accused-nccia-officials-resign-as-fia-probe-into-bribery-case-drags-on' target='_blank'><strong>Three accused NCCIA officials resign as FIA probe into bribery case drags on</strong></a><br><p>With the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) moving slowly in the probe against nine arrested officials of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), who are allegedly involved in extracting money from a known YouTuber and call centres, three of them have resigned from their posts.
According to an NCCIA notification, three officers — Deputy Director Sarfaraz Chaudhry, Assistant Director Muhammad Usman, and Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz — resigned from their posts, and their resignations were accepted by the Interior Ministry. “This is to inform that the following officers are relieved from the NCCIA from the date of approval of their resignations — Nov 20.”
Another official, Assistant Director Asma Majeed, also resigned from her post.
A mega scam involving the misuse of authority and acceptance of bribes from different suspects rocked the NCCIA in October.
Not only were nine officials of the NCCIA booked in Lahore, but also 12 in Islamabad, for allegedly taking large sums of money from individuals and call centres.
An internal inquiry found the nine NCCIA accused of operating as a network, taking monthly cash bribes to “facilitate call centres, aggregator companies and individuals involved in online fraud”.
Even investigation is underway regarding the role of some of the suspects being part of the “blasphemy gang” that would frame individuals.
Although only three NCCIA officers named in this scam have resigned so far, sources believe that all 20 or so suspected officials may be fired from the organisation, which was established in May last year.
On the other hand, the FIA, which is probing Sarfaraz Chaudhry and others, has yet to complete its investigation, raising questions about whether it is trying to “save” its former employees. Before the establishment of the NCCIA, these officials were part of the FIA Cyber Crime unit.
“All nine suspects are in jail, and no extensive interrogation has been conducted on them,” a source claimed. “FIA investigators have yet to complete the challan/investigation to submit in court.”
When asked why the FIA had failed to expedite the probe against them, a spokesperson told Dawn that “the matter is under probe.”
Nine NCCIA officers — Additional Director Sarfraz (Lahore); Deputy Directors Muhammad Zawar Ahmad, Muhammad Usman and Ayaz Khan; Assistant Directors Shoaib Riaz and Mujtaba Zafar; Inspector Salman Aziz; and Sub-inspectors Ali Raza and Yasir Ramzan — are accused of accepting bribes and abusing authority in a case against YouTuber Saad ur Rehman, popularly known as Ducky Bhai, over the alleged promotion of gambling apps on social media and through various call centres.
Ducky Bhai also recently disclosed about the “brutal torture” Sarfraz Chaudhry unleashed on him in NCCIA custody.
The YouTuber’s wife Aroob Jatoi, had accused the officials, especially Sarfraz, of taking over Rs100 million, both in local and foreign currency.
According to the First Information Report registered against the officials under Sections 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 161 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 5(2)47 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, which deals with criminal misconduct by public servants, the accused allegedly kept their own shares and distributed the remaining proceeds among other members of the “official gang.”
Sources said the anti-cyber crime body appeared to have “become part of the problem rather than curbing it.” There were also complaints about the exploitation of women victims by some elements within the NCCIA.</p><small>2025-12-17 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1720325533b3cb6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961672/pti-decides-to-contest-islamabad-local-govt-elections-despite-rigging-fears' target='_blank'><strong>PTI decides to contest Islamabad local govt elections despite ‘rigging’ fears</strong></a><br><p>Despite fear of rigging, the PTI decided on Wednesday to participate in the Islamabad local government elections, which will be held on February 15 across the federal capital.
In line with party policy, workers who have remained loyal to the party and its ideology and have made sacrifices during the last three years will be given priority in nominations.
The decision was made during a meeting chaired by PTI Islamabad Region President Aamir Mughal and attended by Regional Secretary and Chairman of the Local Government Committee Malik Aamir Ali Awan, ticket holder Advocate Shoaib Shaheen, Senator Fauzia Arshad, Senate ticket holder Syed Farzand Shah, ticket holder Ali Bukhari, and other senior office-bearers.
After consultations, it was unanimously decided that PTI’s Islamabad wing would take part in the local government elections. However, participants feared that there could be “rigging,” as happened in the recent National Assembly elections in Haripur.
Participants were also of the view that the government had amended the 2015 Local Government Act and abolished the direct election of chairman and vice chairman to “facilitate rigging and horse-trading”, thereby undermining the public mandate. However, they said that the party would contest the local government elections with full strength and aims to achieve a clean sweep across the district.
It was decided that under the leadership of Aamir, a local government committee comprising district presidents, general secretaries, heads of all wings, ticket holders, and senior members would be formed at the earliest. Moreover, an election manifesto would be prepared, and a campaign team would be formed.
It was also decided that a legal team would be established under the committee to oversee election campaigns, the scrutiny and submission of nomination papers, and to handle all other legal matters.
It was decided that Regional President Mughal, in consultation with the leaders of all three constituencies and senior members, would form a parliamentary board to monitor ticket awarding.
Talking to Dawn, Mughal said, despite weak, flawed and “rigging-promoting amendments”, under which the local government elections are being conducted, the PTI will sweep the elections just as it did during the 2024 general elections.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had announced the schedule for local government elections in the Islamabad Capital Territory. The term of the local government expired in February 2021, but elections could not be held and were further delayed due to new legislation.
In a notification also posted to social media, the ECP called on voters in the ICT to elect their representatives to the general seats of union councils. It set Dec 19 as the date for public notice inviting nomination papers to be issued by the returning officers (ROs), while Dec 22-27 (excluding Quaid-i-Azam Day on Dec 25) as the dates for filing of nomination papers with the ROs by the candidates.
The names of the nominated candidates will be published on Dec 29, and the nomination papers will be scrutinised by the ROs from Dec 30 to Jan 3, 2026. From Jan 5-8, appeals may be filed against the decisions of the ROs to accept or reject the nominations. These appeals will be decided by the Appellate Authority from Jan 9-13, and the revised candidate list will be published on the 14.
Jan 15 marks the final day of withdrawal of candidature, the day after which election symbols will be allotted and the list of contesting candidates published. The polling day will take place after 29 days on Sunday, Feb 15, with the results being consolidated between the 16 and 19 of the month. The ECP, in its notification, added that polling hours will be observed from 8am to 4pm and that all polling activities would take place during office hours.</p><small>2025-12-17 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17195829ad79b9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961668/imrans-sisters-among-400-booked-over-pti-adiala-sit-in-at-least-14-party-supporters-arrested' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s sisters among 400 booked over PTI Adiala sit-in; at least 14 party supporters arrested</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — are among 400 people booked on Wednesday after police dispersed a sit-in near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where the party founder and former prime minister is currently incarcerated.
Moreover, 14 PTI workers were arrested and produced before an anti-terrorism court (ATC) today, which approved three days of physical remand and returned the suspects to police custody.
Imran’s sisters, party workers and supporters had staged a sit-in at Factory Naka a day prior, demanding their court-mandated Tuesday meeting with the PTI founder. Police used water cannons and baton charges to disperse the protesters, with police starting their operation at 2am.
According to a copy of the first information report (FIR) — dated December 17 and available with Dawn — 400 suspects, including 35 nominated persons, were booked under various provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (ATA) and Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), including the use of petrol bombs and violating Section 144 of the Criminal Code of Procedure (CrPC), which prohibits public gatherings.
The nominated suspects include Imran’s sisters, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, PTI leader Aliya Hamza and PTI lawyer Naeem Panjhuta, among others.
The 400 suspects have been booked under the following provisions:

Section 7 of the ATA — terrorism
Section 21(I) of the ATA — aid and abetment
Section 109 of the PPC — punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment
Section 120B of the PPC — punishment of criminal conspiracy
Section 147 of the PPC — punishment for rioting
Section 149 of the PPC — every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object
Section 186 of the PPC — obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions
Section 188 of the PPC — disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant
Section 285 of the PPC — negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter
Section 286 of the PPC — negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance
Section 324 of the PPC — attempted murder
Section 341 of the PPC — punishment for wrongful restraint
Section 353 of the PPC — assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty
Section 440 of the PPC — mischief committed after preparation made causing death or hurt

‘Panic and moral bankruptcy’
The PTI condemned the cases filed against the participants of the sit-in and assailed the Punjab Police for using “chemical-laced” water cannons to disperse party leaders and workers.
In a strongly worded statement issued by the PTI Central Media Department, the party lashed out at the government for employing force against sit-in participants and subjecting women, senior citizens and non-violent protesters to water cannons and physical violence.
The party also deemed the forcible arrest of multiple workers “the worst manifestation of political victimisation” and denounced the use of the ATA against the participants, stating that all of these actions reflected “a fearful government’s panic and moral bankruptcy”.
Weaponising the law to target citizens and peaceful political activists was also slammed as an attack on democracy, justice and fundamental human rights.
The PTI also flayed the government for deliberately, systematically and repeatedly obstructing the legally mandated bi-weekly meetings of the PTI founder with his family, lawyers and friends, “effectively reducing the court’s clear orders to mere scraps of paper”.
The party asserted that the federal government was blatantly violating the Islamabad High Court’s orders and setting a dangerous precedent, as these actions were not administrative failures and instead “constituted a direct assault on the Constitution, the rule of law and the authority of the judiciary”.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
Last Friday, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”</p><small>2025-12-17 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17191240d395cd9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961666/fingerprints-are-piling-up-sherry-rehman-says-fatf-should-investigate-growing-support-for-terrorism-from-india' target='_blank'><strong>‘Fingerprints are piling up’: Sherry Rehman says FATF should investigate ‘growing support’ for terrorism from India</strong></a><br><p>PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman on Wednesday suggested that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) investigate “growing support” from India for terrorist groups, after an Indian national was identified as a suspect in a recent mass shooting at Australia’s Bondi Beach.
Alleged father-and-son perpetrators, Sajid and Naveed Akram, opened fire on a Jewish holiday celebration at Sydney’s famed Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing 15 in an attack that shook the nation and intensified fears of rising anti-Semitism and violent extremism.
Sajid, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene, while his 24-year-old son, Naveed, emerged from a coma on Tuesday afternoon after also being shot by police. On Tuesday, it emerged that Sajid was originally from the Indian city of Hyderabad, with police saying his family did not know about his “radical mindset”.
In a post on X, Senator Rehman noted that the attack raised questions about links to New Delhi as Indian and Israeli allegations of Pakistani involvement “were backfiring at warp speed”.
“Perhaps the FATF should also look into growing support from India for terrorist groups operating internationally. The fingerprints are piling up,” she wrote, tagging the anti-terror financing watchdog.







She further wrote that though the suspects were Muslims, the man who disarmed one of the alleged attackers was himself a Muslim immigrant and hailed as a hero by Australian authorities.
“The Bondi attack is also being scaffolded away from its purported intent to terrorise per se, as an identity politics issue,” the senator’s post read.
“It must also be remembered that the many phobias, including a vicious streak of Islamophobia, generated in the wake of this heinous attack, are plain wrong. It is wrong to attack innocent people on any strip of beach or faith, whether that be Bondi or Gaza.”
Earlier today, Naveed Akram was charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, police said.
New South Wales Police said on Wednesday that a man had been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of wounding with attempt to murder, as well as a terror offence and other charges.
“Police will allege in court the man engaged in conduct that caused death, serious injury and endangered life to advance a religious cause and cause fear in the community,” it said in a statement.
“Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by ISIS, a listed terrorist organisation in Australia”.
Furthermore, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said earlier today that it was falsely claimed after the Bondi Beach shooting that one of the attackers was from Pakistan, holding “hostile countries” responsible for this campaign.
“When the incident happened, certain media outlets were very quick to state that one of the attackers was from Pakistan and the other one was born in Australia.
“There was no evidence to prove this claim, there was no documentation, and there was no verification of this claim. But somehow, we know that this campaign was launched from hostile countries trying to malign Pakistan,” Tarar said during a media briefing in Islamabad.</p><small>2025-12-17 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1719323334ad768.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961667/amnesty-condemns-repeated-use-of-water-cannons-on-pti-protesters-outside-adiala-prison' target='_blank'><strong>Amnesty condemns ‘repeated’ use of water cannons on PTI protesters outside Adiala Prison</strong></a><br><p>Amnesty International on Wednesday condemned the “repeated” use of high-pressure water cannons by authorities to disperse a sit-in outside Adiala prison in Rawalpindi, after incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s family was denied a meeting with the former prime minister.
“The repeated use of high-pressure water cannons by authorities against peaceful protesters outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi is a flagrant violation of their right to peaceful assembly.”
Amnesty added that Pakistan authorities “must respect people’s right to peacefully protest and end the disproportionate and punitive use of force”.







After authorities again barred Imran’s sisters from meeting the incarcerated former prime minister, a sit-in was staged outside the prison.
A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured.
Despite the IHC’s order, Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, have tried and failed to meet Imran over the past several weeks. Last Tuesday, after being denied a meeting with the PTI chief, his sisters and party supporters staged a sit-in, which was later dispersed with water cannons.
Early on Wednesday, water cannons were again used to disperse the protesters, with police starting their operation at 2 am. Initially, water cannon vehicles were used to disperse the protesters, with police later baton-charging those who remained.
Some of the party workers were arrested, but the number could not be confirmed.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir, who remained at the protest until late Tuesday night, condemned the inhuman treatment meted out to the protesters.</p><small>2025-12-17 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17182815943b89b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961663/pakistan-navys-fourth-hangor-class-submarine-launched-by-chinese-shipyard' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Navy’s fourth Hangor class submarine launched by Chinese shipyard</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Navy’s fourth Hangor-class submarine, named Ghazi, was launched at Shuangliu Base in Wuhan, China, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) announced on Wednesday.
With the Ghazi’s launch, the ISPR hailed “another significant milestone” by the navy, where all four submarines being built in China are currently undergoing “rigorous sea trials and are in the final stages of being handed over to Pakistan”.
“The Government of Pakistan signed an agreement with China for [the] acquisition of eight Hangor-class submarines. Under this contract, four submarines are being built in China and [the] remaining four will be constructed in Pakistan by Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works Ltd (KS&EW), under Transfer of Technology (ToT),” the ISPR said in a statement.
The military’s media wing added that the submarines will be fitted with advanced weaponry and sensors capable of engaging targets at standoff ranges.
“Hangor-class submarines will be pivotal in maintaining peace and stability in the region,” the statement read, adding that the launch ceremony was attended by senior officials from China and Pakistan, exemplifying deepening bilateral cooperation.
The navy launched the first of the new submarines in April 2024, while the second and third were launched on March 15 and August 15 this year, respectively.
The submarine class, named after the PNS Hangor, is a diesel-electric attack submarine with air-independent propulsion technology, which allows it to travel over greater distances before resurfacing.
During the 1971 Pakistan-India war, the then-PNS Hangor became the first submarine to sink a warship after World War II, sinking an Indian frigate.

These actions followed a crackdown on migrant smuggling launched after the 2024 Greece boat tragedy, which claimed several Pakistani lives.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also ordered the formation of a committee to investigate the frequent offloading of passengers from international flights, an issue that has reportedly affected numerous travellers despite them holding valid documents.
Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Riffat Mukhtar Raja informed the committee that, “Passengers are offloaded on the basis of document verification, data checks, and online authentication.”
Raja told the parliamentary panel that of the 66,000 passengers offloaded this year, 51,000 were stopped by the FIA for insufficient or unverified documentation.
He added that many of those offloaded lacked complete information related to their courses, universities or employment details abroad.
“In many cases, passengers attempt to travel through agents using incomplete or incorrect information,” DG FIA added.
The committee was further informed that 180 FIA officials involved in corruption had been dismissed from service, while all major airports had been connected to NADRA’s online database to strengthen immigration controls.
“No passenger was cleared under political influence or VIP pressure,” he stressed.
The official further informed the lawmakers that cameras have been installed at immigration counters at airports and that monitoring is being carried out from the control headquarters.
“The immigration system is using artificial intelligence to identify suspicious cases in advance.”
He added that most offloaded passengers belonged to the visit, Umrah and work visa categories. During the current year, 8.5 million people travelled abroad from Pakistan, while 226 cases were registered for various offences.
“Over the past three months, 450 people were arrested while attempting to cross into Iran illegally,” the DG FIA told the committee.
He also revealed that several Bangladeshi nationals were found attempting to travel illegally to Europe via Pakistan.
“Bangladeshi citizens travelling on Pakistani tourist visas were caught while heading to Europe,” added DG FIA.
He further stated that 287 people were deported last year and 170 this year over the use of fake documents.
The parliamentary panel was also told that 24,000 accused of begging have been deported from Saudi Arabia this year.
$1 trillion investment coming to Saudi Arabia; opportunities to increase for Pakistanis
Secretary Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry informed the committee that investment worth $1 trillion is coming to Saudi Arabia under Saudi Vision 2030, creating multiple employment opportunities.
“If we can provide better training to skilled manpower, Pakistan can benefit from these opportunities,” he added.
The secretary told the committee that 451,000 Pakistanis travelled to Saudi Arabia last year, while more than 500,000 Pakistanis have been sent to Saudi Arabia during the current year.
Chairman of the committee Agha Rafiullah said that the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission was “not functioning at all”, adding that officers posted there were temporarily fixing matters instead of resolving them permanently.
Committee member Muhammad Ilyas Chaudhry said drivers have been provided to community welfare attachés, questioning how Grade 17–18 officers were being assigned drivers in Europe.
He said “more than 50 per cent of community welfare attachés have been provided drivers”, asking whether the ministry was aware of the cost of providing a driver to a Grade 17 officer in Europe.
Community welfare attachés are officials of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis, posted abroad to assist Pakistani migrant workers, safeguard their interests, and provide legal or financial protection.
Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that “no passenger with complete travel documents is being stopped from travelling, and they will not be stopped,” adding that, however, passengers in possession of “incomplete or bogus documents will definitely not be allowed to travel”.
“No passenger who brings disrepute to the country can be allowed to travel,” he further stated, according to PTV News.
In November, the FIA clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or if authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.
The same day, the agency also initiated legal action against those involved in spreading fabricated information on social media regarding the offloading of passengers.
FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar had also acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.</p><small>2025-12-17 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/17143644f35e9f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961654/campaign-falsely-linking-bondi-shooting-suspect-to-pakistan-launched-from-hostile-countries-tarar' target='_blank'><strong>Campaign falsely linking Bondi shooting suspect to Pakistan launched from ‘hostile countries’: Tarar</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Wednesday that it was falsely claimed after the Bondi Beach shooting in Australia that one of the attackers was from Pakistan, holding “hostile countries” responsible for this campaign.
The tragic attack by two men on Sunday resulted in the death of 16 people, including one of the attackers. Soon after the incident, a Pakistan-origin man living in Sydney was misidentified as one of the attackers. Later, it was confirmed that among the father-son duo of suspects, the former, 50-year-old Sajid Akram, was from India, and the latter, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, was born in Australia.

“When the incident happened, certain media outlets were very quick to state that one of the attackers was from Pakistan and the other one was born in Australia.
“There was no evidence to prove this claim, there was no documentation, and there was no verification of this claim. But somehow, we know that this campaign was launched from hostile countries trying to malign Pakistan,” Tarar said during a media briefing in Islamabad.
The minister continued, “In Israel and India, this campaign was proliferated and posted on social media platforms, as well as electronic media platforms, which is very, very sad.”
He highlighted that Pakistan had been a frontline state in the war against terrorism and continued to combat terrorists. Here, he also mentioned the Army Public School massacre that took place on December 16, 2014.
A total of 147 people, including 132 students, were martyred and 180 were injured in the attack.
“So, we are a country whose children have also given sacrifices, whose children have laid down their lives in this war against terrorism,” Tarar said, adding that it was unfortunate that a “false campaign” was run against Pakistan.
He reiterated that there was not even a shred of evidence or any reliable source to back the claim that one of the Bondi Beach attackers was from Pakistan.

Tarar further stated that the “misinformation campaign” against Pakistan was run deliberately, adding that it saddened him that very well-reputed media outlets fell prey to this “disinformation campaign”.
The minister said that these media houses and outlets, operating globally, had editorial boards and systems in place to verify information.
“There are structures, there is a hierarchy through which information is passed on, and editorial control is exercised. Even then, they failed to exercise the basic norms of journalism,” he said, reiterating that it was falsely claimed that one of the attackers was from Pakistan.
The claim, he said, was refuted as Indian police issued a press release on Tuesday stating that one of the suspects was from Hyderabad in India. He added that it had also been confirmed that the Indian embassy in Sydney had issued the suspect his passport.
“In fact, he travelled to the Philippines on that Indian passport as confirmed by the Philippines authorities,” Tarar said. “So, I don’t know why this campaign was run. But, it is very, very unfortunate.”
The minister then played a video that he said detailed how the campaign was run and which media outlets were involved in it.
‘Organised campaign’
After the video ended, the minister said the campaign seemed to be an organised one. “It spread like wildfire, and no editorial board, no management, no reporter questioned where the information was coming from.”
He went on to say that one of the news outlets had gone as far as claiming that the attackers were from Lahore, without showing any documentation.
“How is it possible that when you give news with regard to a terrorism incident, and you claim that the attackers are from a certain country or are of a certain origin, you have no evidence whatsoever to substantiate your claim?
“It really saddens us as victims of terrorism.”
He said Pakistan had always and would always condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
Tarar pointed out that Pakistan did not instantly react to the false claim as “a responsible state acts like a responsible state by actually verifying information”.
He also questioned how it was possible that the Indian government did not know that the suspects were of “Indian origin or had Indian passports or were Indian citizens”.
“Every country has a national database through which,[using] facial recognition, it can be easily identified to which country a certain individual belongs. There are retinal scans, there are fingerprints, there is facial recognition — there is so much technology in the world now that any database would have revealed where they were from.
“But unfortunately, there was a vicious campaign to instantly say that one of the attackers, the father, was a Pakistani national,” Tarar added.
The minister linked the occurrence also to the suspects having a name that “is common in certain parts of the world”.
He said it was not sufficient evidence to pin the blame on Pakistan.
‘Who is going to cover the damage?’
Tarar also appreciated Australian authorities for “conducting themselves very professionally throughout the investigation. Despite the vicious campaign which was run all over the international media, they did not cast any aspersions in this regard, and they actually waited for this information to be verified”.
Saying that now that it was clear that the suspect was from India, Tarar added, “My question is, and I have the right to question, that who is going to cover the damage that was caused to Pakistan through these fake posts and false information.
“How do we go back to the position before the Bondi Beach attack? Should we initiate legal proceedings? Should we request an apology? Or will it just become a part of history as a campaign based on absolutely fake and false information to malign Pakistan?”
‘’India-backed terrorism in Pakistan’
He said acts of terrorism had been taking place elsewhere in the world as well, recalling the murder and assassination of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada.

 

Nijjar was shot dead by masked gunmen outside the temple he presided over in 2023 after being wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism offences and conspiracy to commit murder — accusations he denied. India was accused of being involved in his assassination, but New Delhi termed the allegation “absurd”.
“We have seen transnational assassinations taking place. We have seen this incident,” Tarar said during his briefing, adding, “We know that India supports terrorism in Pakistan.”
The minister said the Inter-Service Public Relations director general and he, too, had shared evidence of terrorism in Balochistan and Kyber Pakhtunkhwa being backed and funded by India.
“There is irrefutable evidence to prove that.”
In addition, he said, “Whenever Afghan soil is used for an attack in Pakistan, somewhere there is an indian link.”
Saying that the Afghanistan government had been cosying up to India these days, Tarar questioned: “What is the main reason behind it? Do they have any bilateral trade? Do they have other areas of mutual cooperation the great potential of which they want to realise?”
Reiterating that there was “irrefutable evidence of Indian terrorism in Pakistan”, he alleged that the country was not just involved in funding terrorism but also planning the attacks in Balochistan and KP.
Again highlighting that Pakistan had been fighting terrorism for long and rendered sacrifices in doing so, Tarar repeated that the campaign against Pakistan following the Bondi Beach shooting was unfortunate.
“And a country from where this campaign originated, and most of the Indian outlets that aired the [false] news without verification, they had no right to do this.
“Because their country is supporting terrorism, and we are fighting terrorism. That is the difference between India and Pakistan,” he continued.
Tarar further stated that now that there was credible information and irrefutable evidence of one of the suspects hailing from Indian, “how do you vindicate Pakistan in this? How do you say that ‘we are sorry and this should not have happened’”.
He asserted that while Pakistan had stood for peace, would always promote peace and condemn incidents of terrorism, the media was required to act responsibly and “pin the blame where it lies”. The media, he stressed, needed to verify the information and then disseminate it.
Again mentioning Nijjar’s assassination, Tarar said it “shows you the true face of the Indian state”.
He also mentioned the recent incident of the chief minister of Indian state of Bihar pulling off a woman doctor’s hijab at a graduation ceremony.
“This just shows the mindset that is prevalent in that country with regard to extremism of any kind. Their society is absolutely disoriented. They don’t have any narrative to sell to the world, any story to tell to the world.
“All you can find within India is extremism of every kind being promoted. Because you have a government [there] which believes in extremism, suppressing the minorities and their rights and promoting terrorism and extremism,” Tarar commented.
‘Highly condemnable’
Earlier in the media briefing, the minister termed the Bondi Beach shooting “highly condemnable”, adding that “since Pakistan is a victim of terrorism and has remained a victim for so many years, we actually know what it feels like”.
“We can feel the pain of Australia, the citizens of Australia. We can relate to them because we see this happening in Pakistan,” he said, expressing solidarity with the government and people of Australia.
He also lauded the Australian citizen who wrestled a gun from one of the alleged attackers and “saved several lives”.
During the Bondi Beach incident, 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed had hid behind parked cars before charging at one of the gunmen from behind, seizing his rifle and knocking him to the ground. He was hospitalised after getting injured in his bid to stop the attackers and has been hailed as a hero around the world.</p><small>2025-12-17 12:08</small></div><hr>
