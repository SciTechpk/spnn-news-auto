<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/02084321db40f39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946022/flawed-scheme' target='_blank'><strong>Flawed scheme</strong></a><br><p>IT appears that the leaders of the Muslim world have been played by Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. Though many Muslim governments, including our own, initially welcomed the 20-point Gaza ‘peace’ plan, when the reality of what it articulates — Palestinian surrender, Israeli impunity, colonial control of Gaza — dawned on them, clarifications began to pour in.
As per media reports, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu made changes to the plan that were not included in the original scheme, which US President Trump had discussed with the leaders of several Muslim states in New York last week. Perhaps that is why Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had to clarify on Tuesday that “this is not our document”, despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s initial euphoria. Other Muslim states, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkiye, have similarly been caught off guard by the American-Israeli sleight of hand. Reportedly, the Qataris asked the US to hold off on announcing the plan, a request that Washington clearly spurned.
If reports of Israeli tinkering with the plan are true — the contents of this atrocious deal leave little room for doubt on that count — then the Muslim world must ask itself some important questions.
For one, how was Israel able to alter a deal that several Muslim states had already agreed to, and why did the US let it happen? Secondly, how was the plan finalised, with little to no input from the Palestinians — the party most affected by Israel’s brutal violence? The plan effectively neutralises Hamas, and puts the Palestinian Authority in its place, until it begs Israel for forgiveness and atones for its ‘sins’. If the two biggest Palestinian parties are excluded from the deal, who will run Gaza? Will the Palestinian ‘technocrats’, who are supposed to administer the occupied Strip, have to swear an oath of fealty to Israel, and forever denounce aspirations of a viable Palestinian state? That is the feeling that emerges after reading this embarrassment of a document.
 
 

Furthermore, there is no mention of a clear roadmap towards a two-state solution with Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital, only vague language about a “credible pathway”.
The fact is that there is nothing credible about this plan, and its chances of success are close to zero. Reports indicate that Hamas is unlikely to accept it, while there have even been rumblings of discontent within Fatah. Mr Trump has promised a “very sad end” in case Hamas rejects the scheme. Meanwhile, Israel has continued to pummel the civilians of Gaza as Hamas’s response is awaited; this shows how ‘committed’ Tel Aviv is to peace. If and when this charade collapses, Muslim leaders must ask themselves what they got in return for placing blind faith in America and Israel.

He was blindfolded and taken to a building where he was interrogated and tortured for several days. The interrogators demanded that he confess to crimes and links with criminal gangs.
Akram was then taken to a police station. There, a police officer told him to pay up or else a criminal case would be registered against him. Neither Akram nor his family could afford the bribe. The officer lodged an FIR implicating him for murder and terrorism. Soon after, Akram was charged with murder under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) and convicted for life by an anti-terrorism court.
During the trial, the prosecution did not allege, let alone present, any evidence to show links between Akram and terrorist activity. On appeal, the Sindh High Court set aside Akram’s conviction on the basis that the prosecution’s evidence against him was insufficient. The high court also noted that the prosecution failed to establish any motive for terrorism.
Akram’s story is similar to that of many others convicted under the ATA. State actors use both illegal means — enforced disappearance — and the legal process under the ATA to imprison mostly poor young men who have no proven connection to any terrorist activity.

The recent anti-terror amendment covers an impermissibly broad and vague range of activities.

The ATA was enacted in 1997 because legislators at the time believed that regular criminal procedures could not cope with the problem of terrorism. They enacted a special law with weaker due process guarantees and harsher penalties compared to regular proceedings under the Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes. For example, the ATA permits remand to an investigating authority for interrogation for up to 30 days at a time, in contrast to the Criminal Procedure Code, which permits remand for a maximum of 15 days.
The ATA also permits the federal government to issue lists of “proscribed persons” suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. These “proscribed persons” are subjected to draconian surveillance and restrictions on their movement.
Vague and over-broad provisions in the ATA itself, as well as its misuse, have rendered the law an ineffective tool against terrorism. Law enforcement and courts have misinterpreted the ATA since it was passed to cover crimes that should not be deemed terrorism.
In 2020, a seven-member bench of the Supreme Court observed that courts have consistently interpreted as terrorism crimes driven by personal motives rather than political or ideological goals. The Supreme Court clarified that a crime, however heinous, should not be deemed terrorism only because its effect is to create fear and insecurity in society at large. The primary motivation behind that act must be to create terror in wider society.
The Supreme Court declared that the definition of terrorism contained in the ATA 1997 is “too wide” and this “puts an extra and unnecessary burden” on special anti-terrorism courts. It recommended that parliament replace the existing definition with a “more succinct definition bringing it in line with the international perspectives of that offence”.
Rather than address these problems with the law and its implementation, our legislators continue to expand the scope of the ATA and the powers that it confers on law enforcement.
A recent amendment to the ATA allows the authorities to preventively detain a person for three months without charge if they believe the per­son is “concerned” with any offence under the Act related to the “security or defence of Pak­istan” or “public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta, or the maintenance of supply or services …”
Preventive detention, used against persons anticipated to commit subversive activity must be used very sparingly and be circumscribed by strong, rigorously enforced procedural protections. Renowned civil liberties lawyer and scholar David Cole maintains that preventive detention should only be used against those engaged in armed conflict against the state. Even terrorist acts outside armed conflict should be treated as crimes and subject to all due process requirements of criminal prosecution.
Pakistan’s Constitution permits preventive detention in certain circumstances. The preventive detention provisions in Article 10 of Pakistan’s Constitution are similar to that of India’s constitution. When members of India’s constituent assembly objected to the draft provision allowing preventive detention, the justification provided by the chief framer of India’s constitution, B.R. Ambedkar, was telling: “We do not know how the situation in this country will develop what would be the circumstances which would face the country …. whether the people and parties in this country would behave in a constitutional manner in the matter of getting hold of power, or whether they would resort to unconstitutional methods for carrying out their purposes.”
The rationale behind the permitting of preventive detention, therefore, was to address the risk of constitutional subversion in a newly independent country.
The recent ATA amendment covers an impermissibly broad and vague range of activities. It permits preventive detention for persons “concerned with” criminal activities (target killings, kidnappings and extortion) that would not fall in the category of terrorism let alone the even narrower set of acts amounting to subversion of the constitutional order or armed conflict.
While the amendment is almost guaranteed to enable due process violations, it will not deter terrorism. A similar amendment was made to the law in 2014, which lapsed in 2016. Parliament has now reintroduced preventive detention without any evidence that the earlier provision helped curb terrorism.
An even more recent amendment to the ATA by the Balochistan Assembly that effectively permits secret trials for some suspects is further evidence that the state wants to undermine due process through anti-terror laws. The stories of Akram and many others imprisoned under ATA illustrate that rather than preserve the rule of law, anti-terror laws in Pakistan are used as an extension of the state’s extrajudicial acts to further state repression.

• Farmers’ body demands $10bn in compensation from ‘world’s rich’
LAHORE: In a move reminiscent of the prepaid debit cards issued in the wake of the 2010 floods, the Punjab government has decided to issue ‘ATM cards’ to flood survivors across the province after due verification.
Dubbed ‘Maryam Nawaz Sharif Flood Relief ATM Cards’, these will be issued after verification from the Punjab Info­rmation Technology Board (PITB), Pun­jab Land and Revenue Authority (PLRA), and the National Database and Regis­tration Authority (Nadra), said Provincial Disaster Management Autho­rity (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia.
The cards will be issued to flood victims to compensate for their losses due to the devastating floods, he added.
The decision to launch a new mechanism for distributing flood aid comes amid a war of words between the PML-N and the PPP — both allies in the Centre and ruling Punjab and Sindh, respectively —  over the relief measures.
These new debit cards will be issued after a survey, currently underway in the flood-affected areas. CM Maryam has assured that the government would not only reach out to every flood-affected individual, but would also compensate them.
After the survey, the amount will be allocated in light of the losses and be transferred to the ATM card.
According to a PDMA report, 1,314 survey teams are actively engaged in flood-affected areas across 27 districts of the province. So far, survey teams have collected data from 41,735 flood victims. Details of crop losses from 28,632 farmers have also been compiled, covering 49,510 acres of the affected land.
 
 

Moreover, data has been collected on 12,500 damaged houses, 603 farmers lost their livestock, and a total of 2459 cattle perished.
200 villages under water
Meanwhile, more than 200 villages in Multan, Lodhran, and Bahawalpur districts remain submerged due to breaches in the embankment along the Sutlej River, while the government has pledged to plug all fissures within a week.
For the past 20 days, these areas have been submerged. However, stagnant water in these villages has decimated homes, destroyed crops, and left thousands of residents homeless.
 
 

Afzal Baloch of Kotla Chakar said water was not moving. “Our homes are destroyed; our crops are gone. We have been patient for 20 days, but now we need this water to be drained so we can even begin to think about rebuilding our lives.”
Irrigation officials confirmed that a major breach in the Noraja Bhutta embankment, from where water from the River Sutlej was entering the area, was plugged, which had stopped fresh inflows.
Provincial Minister for Irrigation Kazim Ali Pirzada stated that teams were engaged in closing the breaches at the Noraja Bhutta bund in Jalalpur Pirwala. So far, four out of seven breaches in the flood bund have been successfully closed, he said, adding that the breaches would be plugged within one week.
Overhaul of agri policies
Separately, the Pakistan Kissan Rabita Committee (PKRC) has called for immediate international financial assistance, a moratorium on foreign debt repayments, and a complete overhaul of domestic agricultural and fiscal policies.
Speaking at a press conference here on Wednesday, PKRC General Secretary Farooq Tariq said the committee discussed the climate change problem and the ensuing floods and demanded that rich countries must immediately provide at least $10 billion to Pakistan as a direct aid grant as compensation for the damage they caused to the climate.
The statement said that the flood-affected farmers, particularly in Sindh and Punjab, must be provided with immediate targeted cash support, including grants for seeds, fertiliser, and small machinery. Furthermore, their debts should be cancelled, and interest on agricultural loans for affected districts should be waived to enable them to replant and restore production.
He said the committee demanded the abolition of corporate farming and called for land redistribution. Specifically, the land of public-sector agricultural farms should be given to the tenants who have been cultivating it for over 100 years.

The Global Sumud Flotilla — around 45 vessels carrying activists and politicians including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg — left Spain last month aiming to break Israel’s blockade of the Palestinian territory, where the UN says famine has set in.
“The warships are moving in to intercept the flotilla — only 81 nautical miles remain to Gaza,” said the Maghreb contingent of the Global Sumud Flotilla in a statement.
French politician Marie Mesmeur and Franco-Palestinian MEP Rima Hassan also reported that their boats were being intercepted.

Fleet’s naval escorts depart after Spain, Italy warn against entering ‘exclusion zone’

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot posted on X that Israeli authorities were “currently boarding” the flotilla.
 






Earlier, the Israeli navy warned the flotilla against entering waters under its blockade.
“The Israeli Navy has reached out to the… flotilla and asked them to change course,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. “Israel has informed the flotilla that it is approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade.”
Spain and Italy, which both sent naval escorts, had urged the ships to halt before entering Israel’s declared exclusion zone off Gaza.
After a 10-day stop in Tunisia, where organisers reported two drone attacks, the flotilla resumed its journey on Sept 15.
One of its main ships, the Alma, was “aggressively circled by an Israeli warship”, the group said, before another vessel, the Sirius, was subjected to “similar harassing manoeuvres”.
‘Stop now’
The flotilla had earlier vowed to press on with its bid to deliver aid to the devastated coastal territory despite intimidation tactics by the Israeli military.
It said on X it remained “vigilant as we enter the area where the previous flotillas were intercepted and/or attacked”.
Israel blocked similar attempts in June and July.
At around 1500 GMT on Wednesday, the flotilla said it was less than 170 kilometres from the Gaza Strip.
“We sail on undeterred by Israeli threats and tactics of intimidation,” said the flotilla, which is also carrying Nelson Mandela’s grandson Mandla Mandela and Rima Hassan, a French-Palestinian European Parliament member.
Spain’s digital transformation minister, Oscar Lopez, had urged the flotilla not to cross into Israel’s declared exclusion zone, extending 150 nautical miles off Gaza.
“Our message to the flotilla has been clear: do not enter that zone,” he told Spanish public television, adding that Spain’s naval escort would not cross into the exclusion area.
Italy, too, urged the activists to “stop now” after its frigate also halted at the 150-nautical-mile limit, broadcasting radio messages to the activists’ vessels asking them to abandon their mission.
The activists said Spain and Italy’s decision was an attempt to “sabotage” their endeavours.
South Africa called for “utmost restraint and caution against any unilateral actions that could escalate the situation or endanger human life”.
It said the “safety, security, and physical integrity of all unarmed participants aboard the flotilla, including South African citizens, are of paramount importance”.
In a joint statement, Italy and Greece appealed to Israeli authorities to “guarantee the safety and integrity of the flotilla’s participants”.
Rome and Athens also urged the flotilla to “refrain from any initiative that could be exploited by those who still reject peace”.

But for beleaguered KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who routinely stays here when he visits Islamabad, the meeting with his jailed party chairman after months of waiting and petitioning the Supreme Court, could not have come too soon.
For six months, he weathered a storm. Not from a weak opposition — it has lost the will to throw a political challenge anyway — but from his own party, backed by an unbridled overseas social media brigade, clamouring for his head.
He was called a ‘traitor’, ‘compromised’ and ‘establishment tout’. The noise reached such a fever pitch that some within his own cabinet began to wonder loudly about the prospects of replacing him.

It was no secret that Aleema Khan never had any liking for the KP chief minister, but it was her media interactions outside Adiala jail that not only added to Ali Amin’s political woes, but also emboldened his critics

Many in officialdom were left puzzled and wondering whether the mustachioed, long-locked strongman was indeed on his way out.
“I never felt so weak,” Gandapur narrated to his jailed party leader.
For months, he said, he was trolled for refusing the chairman’s orders not to present and pass the provincial budget, hold direct negotiations with the Afghan Taliban to put an end to militancy in the volatile province and, more crucially, refuse support for military operations and drone attacks in the tribal districts.
The sardar from Kulachi, Dera Ismail Khan, has hardly had smooth sailing as KP’s eighteenth chief minister. For the first eight months, he was required to launch one protest march after another as the party attempted to pressure the powerful military establishment to eke out concessions for his leaders.
Governance, at the time, was placed firmly on the back burner.
But his political challenges became compounded after the D-Chowk fiasco last November, and were further exacerbated by subsequent events, beginning with the abortive attempt to pass the mines and minerals bill, which the party’s social media activists claimed was being sponsored by the military establishment.
The chief minister had to relent, however, when his incarcerated leader conveyed his own opposition to the bill.
Then came the budget. Orders from Adiala said the incarcerated leader should be consulted before it is presented to the house. Efforts were made to share the draft proposals and seek his nod, but things didn’t work out.
Then came another order, ‘Don’t pass the budget’.
Barrister Saif, self-acclaimed ‘Pindi boy’ and adviser to the chief minister, was dispatched to brief the leader that passing the budget was a constitutional requirement, and failure to do so would technically knock out the government. This time, Khan sahib relented.
The unforgiving internet activists, however, trolled Gandapur again when the worsening security situation warranted a military response. The problem was further compounded by incidents involving drone attacks that resulted in civilian casualties.
All this while, the only seemingly credible voice relaying the party leader’s views on anything political was Imran’s own sister, Aleema Khan. She, along with her two other siblings, was among the few who had permission to meet Imran.
That she never had any liking for the KP chief minister was hardly a secret, but it was her media interactions outside Adiala that not only added to Ali Amin’s political woes, but also emboldened his critics.
Gandapur claimed he was being pulled down by two ladies, “one who is trying to run the party and the other who is actually running the party”, and a military establishment driven by its own exigencies.
The political storm was gathering, and the chief minister’s fate seemed to have been sealed when Imran’s frustration with him seemed to boil over, triggered by his “failure to stop” military operations in the province.
But while he claimed he never cared what the overseas social media trolls said about him, what really mattered was what Aleema Khan was saying to the media after each tete-a-tete with Imran Khan.
Being his sister, her word was treated as gospel.
“It was clear to me that our messages to Khan sahib were not being delivered. He is unaware of what is happening outside… he was not only being misled, but also whatever he said was being filtered, censored, distorted and manipulated [before being relayed].”
To add insult to injury, no rebuttal seemed to be forthcoming from the party chairman.
 
 

With the wolves baying for blood, Gandapur’s last chance was a face-to-face with his imprisoned leader. According to the KP CM, during their meeting he laid bare what he termed “proofs” of Aleema’s manipulation to discredit him, and blatant meddling in party matters.
According to Gandapur, Mr Khan listened patiently, assured him that he still believed in his (Gandapur’s) loyalty, and that he had never asked his sister to issue any rebuke on his behalf.
“I would not have said what I said in my video message about Aleema Khan… [if not for]  her media interaction… I said what I said and I can prove what I said,” the CM told me.
Fresh from the meeting with his leader, Gandapur confessed to feeling more relaxed and more relieved than he had been over the past six months or so.
He subsequently called up two of his cabinet colleagues and told them the party leader wanted them to step down. A further reshuffle of portfolios was carried out on Wednesday, as other cabinet members, mired in corruption allegations, have been either shown the door or assigned other less important portfolios.
For now, those close to CM believe he has gained the upper hand against his opponents. But the window remains very small.
“He needs to seize the opportunity and do the right thing… before the gullible party chief’s mood changes again.”

• Distrust remains over proposed International Stabilisation Force
• Hamas seeks changes to ‘disarmament’ clause
DESPITE their misgivings with the ‘pro-Israel’ draft of US President Donald Trump’s plan to bring peace to war-ravaged Gaza, countries from the eight-member Muslim bloc may yet push for it to be accepted.
Officials from Qatar and Pakis­tan have already implied — albeit diplomatically — that the plan announced by the White House was quite different from the one they signed up to in New York.
But some countries — especially those in Gaza’s immediate neighbourhood — also believe they have secured key concessions, such as Trump’s refusal to recognise Israeli annexation of the West Bank and a US commitment that Palestinians will be allowed to remain in Gaza.
Israel has also agreed, under the plan, not to permanently occupy the Gaza Strip.
“Gaza’s reconstruction represents a major economic opportunity for Egypt, ranging from debris removal to infrastructure development and urban projects. Such operations would channel billions of dollars into Egypt, directly and indirectly, boosting its economy in the long run,” Middle East Eye quoted a senior Egyptian political source as saying.
 
 

This would also end the looming threat of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza being expelled into the Sinai Peninsula.
“Accepting Trump’s plan to halt the war in Gaza would completely end the displacement scheme, which had become a source of deep tension between Cairo and Tel Aviv,” Middle East Eye reported.
The most surprising changes concerned the number of Palestinians set to be released as part of the deal, and the phased approach to the Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian enclave.
 
 

Where previously hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would have been released alongside 1,700 men, women and children detained from Gaza, now just 250 inmates would be freed with the detainees.
Original drafts mandated 600 aid trucks entering Gaza per day, while the new version’s vague language afforded no such commitment.
There were also changes to what had been agreed on governance: Gaza would be run by a ‘Board of Peace’, to be led by Trump and former British PM Tony Blair, cutting out international ­con­sult­ation.
Troop deployment
Meanwhile, the so-called Inter­national Stabilisation Force (ISF), which was slated to train Palestinian police to take over security duties, suddenly had expanded powers, which suggested increased Israeli control.
Not only was the Israeli troop withdrawal staggered without clear deadlines, the addition of a “security zone” around the perimeter appeared to signal the prospect of a permanent presence within Gaza.
The ISF was one of the main issues discussed in the 45-minute meeting between Trump and leaders of Muslim nations in New York last week.
According to Middle East Eye, Trump had asked all countries present — Pakistan, Jordan, UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt — to contribute troops to the force.
In the wake of Trump’s announcement, all eight countries issued a joint statement welcoming the Gaza plan and expressing their readiness to help finalise it.
But despite those positive words, behind closed doors serious concerns still exist in these countries about the prospect of deploying their soldiers on the ground in Gaza.
“Who will lead this force? Who will decide when to intervene? What will be the rules of engagement?” another senior regional official asked. “These questions all need to be discussed.”
The official suggested that further negotiations involving Arab and Muslim countries, the US, Israel and Palestinian representatives would be necessary before such a force could be viable.
The source added that Turkey, Jordan and Egypt sought to have UN Security Council approval for the force to legalise the move in the eyes of the international community, but the US and Israel dropped it from the draft plan.
“The Israelis don’t want UN involvement in any matter related to Palestine,” Middle East Eye quoted a source as ­saying.
A Turkish source familiar with Ankara’s position said Turkey is considering deploying troops in Gaza, depending on variables such as the structure and leadership of the force.
However, those familiar with Israeli thinking say Netanyahu would oppose any Turkish participation in such a mission, which is exactly why Hamas may insist on Turkish involvement.
Pressure on Hamas
Despite dissatisfaction with several elements, officials from Turkey, Qatar and Egypt convened quickly in Doha on Tuesday to encourage Hamas to give a positive response to Trump’s proposal.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told the media over the weekend that while the US was tasked with persuading Israel to accept the plan, Turkey and other regional players would focus on convincing the Palestinians.
“Hamas leaders were briefed on its terms immediately after the official announcement, with an emphasis that this was the last opportunity to end the war and ease the suffering of the Palestinian people,” Middle East Eye quoted a source as saying.
However, Hamas officials still want amendments to clauses in President Trump’s peace plan including on disarmament, a Palestinian source close to the group’s leadership told AFP on Wednesday.
In their discussions in Doha, the group said it needed “two or three days at most” to respond.
Hamas wants to amend some of the clauses such as the one on disarmament and the expulsion of Hamas and faction cadres, the source said.
Its leaders also want “international guarantees for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip” and guarantees that no assassinations attempts will be made inside or outside the territory.

Also, four terrorists disguised in women’s clothing were arrested in Khuzdar on Wednesday, according to the military’s media wing.
According to CTD officials, an operation was conducted in the Aghbarg area on the outskirts of Quetta after a tip-off about the presence of terrorists.
A CTD team cordoned off the locality, prompting armed militants to open fire. Security personnel retaliated, and an intense exchange of fire ensued for over an hour, during which automatic weapons were used.
“As a result of the gun battle, 10 terrorists were killed on the spot,” a CTD spokesman said, adding that two personnel sustained injuries and were shifted to hospital. Large quantities of arms, ammunition, explosives, and other equipment were seized from the site. The slain terrorists, however, remain unidentified. Further investigation is underway.
In a separate operation in Sherani district, eight terrorists were killed when security forces struck a suspected camp of the outlawed Fitna al Khwarij in the rugged Mughal Kot area. Officials confirmed that a cache of sophisticated weapons, ammunition, and equipment was recovered.
Meanwhile, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 13 terrorists belonging to Fitna al Khwarij and Fitna al Hindustan — the state’s terms for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Baloch separatist outfits, respectively - were killed in Quetta and Kech on Sept 30 and Oct 1.
During the Quetta operation, security forces engaged a militant hideout, resulting in the deaths of 10 “Indian-sponsored Khwarij.” Another IBO in Kech district neutralised three terrorists affiliated with Fitna al Hindustan. Weapons, ammunition, and explosives were recovered from both sites.
Four held
Additionally, ISPR reported that four terrorists were apprehended in Khuzdar district during an intelligence-based operation (IBO).
The suspects, allegedly linked to the Indian proxy group Fitna al Hindustan, were captured while attempting to flee disguised in women’s attire. Weapons and ammunition were also seized.
According to the ISPR, the arrested terrorists had been involved in multiple attacks in the region. It reiterated that security forces remain committed to eradicating terrorism and reaffirmed the nation’s determination to bring all perpetrators and their facilitators to justice.

• Kaira calls BISP ‘transparent aid method’, asks CM not to peddle ‘narrow nationalism’
• Azma hits back, says PPP cannot ‘steady itself’ by targeting PML-N
LAHORE: As PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row sparked by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s recent outburst against the coalition partner, the former has asked the Punjab CM to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights and Sindh’s ruling party.
During the meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Law Minister Azam Nazir, Senator Rana Sanaullah and PPP’s Navid Qamar and Ijaz Jakhrani at the NA speaker’s office, it was agreed that the matter would be taken up with PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and CM Maryam Nawaz.
The war of words, which began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River, as the Punjab’s chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe.
Addressing a press conference, PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira urged the CM not to fan ‘narrow nationalism’.
“Differences should be kept within limits. You (Maryam Nawaz) are a woman and our sister, and our leader (Benazir Bhutto) too was a woman. Reconsider your tone.  What do you want to achieve by playing narrow nationalism… Do you want the rest to leave Punjab, and their rights to be ended?”
Flanked by Usman Malik, Chaudhry Aslam Gill, and Faisal Mir, Mr Kaira said the country could not be run by a “single leader or institution”. “This country does not belong to any one person; it belongs to all of us. You (Maryam Nawaz) are not just a CM, you are also the daughter of Nawaz Sharif and the niece of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. If you say that you will not allow anyone to speak, this approach is not appropriate in any way. Reconsider this attitude,” he said.
He further said the floods had caused immense damage, and the entire nation spoke with one voice on this. “Where something is wrong, we will point it out and we will protest. But when we give opinions or criticism, you start threatening. The question concerns flood management, but the response is to target the Sindh government,” he said.
The PPP leader said BISP was even endorsed by the IMF. “It…provides immediate relief, and this was done before as well. If you don’t want to use BISP, fine; but in terms of transparency, BISP stands first, which is why the IMF itself directed that Rs200bn be added to it in this year’s budget. Our objections concern the relief mechanism,” he added.
 
 

In response to the CM’s remarks about the canal project, he said there already existed a formula for water distribution, and the matter must be decided in the Council of Common Interests by the federal and provincial governments together. “The PPP has been unfairly blamed regarding canals.”
PPP South Punjab President Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood said if the Punjab government was criticised, it was because of its failed policies that left the Seraiki belt submerged after floods. “Even in the past, there have been worse floods, yet never before were the people abandoned in such a helpless state,” he said, calling out the government for its ‘choreographed’ response.
Azma’s presser
On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said the PPP leaders were competing to hold press conferences against the Punjab government while claiming they were not politicising the plight of flood victims.
Azma Bokhari further said that the PML-N took pride in “its popularity and public service”, and the PPP should focus on building its own support instead of such rhetoric. “Such statements make no difference, and PPP cannot stand on its own feet this way,” she added.
She said this was not merely political differences but a deliberate attempt to target Punjab collectively. “Personal attacks will naturally invite a response. “You may use BISP in Sindh; we have no objection,” she said.

• Neelum Bridge turns into battleground; shops shut, roads blocked, phones dead
• Govt claims 90pc of JKJAAC’s demands accepted; AJK PM insists ‘violence solves nothing’
• Interior ministry to consider steps to quell unrest today
ISLAMABAD / MUZAFFA­RABAD: The government on Wednesday invited protesters in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) to resume dialogue, as the territory reeled from deadly violence amid an ongoing protest movement.
The unrest over the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee’s (JKJAAC) demands took a bloody turn on Wednesday, with at least nine people killed in clashes with law enforcers — including three policemen — and over a hundred injured.
Talks between the JKJAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Rival groups have since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement.
Addressing a press conference alongside Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, AJK PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said a “civilised and peaceful” path to securing public rights lay in negotiations, warning that violence would only deepen the crisis.
 
 

In Muzaffarabad, most shops — including medical stores, restaurants and tandoors — remained shut, while street vendors and public transport stayed off the roads. Major arteries were strewn with broken glass, boulders and other debris, forcing the few private vehicles on the streets to take detours or turn back.
The main flashpoint was again Neelum Bridge and its environs — the same spot where a shopkeeper was shot dead on Monday — with police deployed on one bank of the Neelum River and demonstrators massed on the opposite side. Witnesses said protesters hurled stones at police, who responded with tear gas shelling and gunfire.
According to one youth, police resorted to firing directly at the crowd, killing at least six protesters and leaving several others critically wounded. The exact number of casualties could not be ascertained due to a communications blackout, which left key officials unreachable.
Enraged residents burned bushes and placed obstacles on roads to protest the killings. Earlier, journalists observed a heated exchange in the district headquarters complex between Islamabad police personnel and some AJK police officials. The former reportedly complained they had been left in an unfamiliar area while stones were being thrown from higher ground.
Dialogue offer
During their presser, AJK PM Haq said that just as the federal government has extended an invitation for talks, “I too urge the Awami Action Committee to participate in the negotiation process to resolve political and social issues through mutual understanding.”
He recalled that the JKJAAC was not an organised political force, as it comprised both nationalists and violent elements, and added that the use of violence and force by them could never be justified.
“I warn again that violent protests only lead to chaos; therefore, it’s essential that we talk,” he said.
He claimed that ‘90 per cent’ of the protesters’ demands had been accepted, and judicial reforms could also be carried out through legislation. “But there is a deadlock over the reserved seats for refugees, which cannot be abolished in the context of the Kashmir freedom movement,” he added.
PM Haq said that PM Shehbaz Sharif had personally asked for dialogue with the JKJAAC.
Expressing deep grief and sorrow, the AJK premier stated that there could be no recompense for the loss of human life.
“The responsible leaders of the Action Committee should call off this protest and engage in dialogue. The cabinet members of AJK are in Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot and Mirpur, and the government is fully prepared for dialogue,” he added.
PM Haq condemned recent arson, including an attack on a school and urged an end to violent protests.
As for police casualties, he confirmed three deaths, with eight personnel critically injured and more than 100 wounded in recent clashes, while reports regarding civilian casualties were still being compiled.
Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said the federal government had remained in close contact with the AJK administration, with him and Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engr Amir Muqam mandated by the prime minister to help resolve the dispute.
“We held talks with members of the Awami Action Committee in Muzaffarabad,” he said. “Ninety per cent of the demands were accepted, and both the federal ministers acted as guarantors to ensure the implementation of the agreement. The IGP was directed to cancel cases from the previous protest, electricity-related issues were acknowledged and local government-related demands were also accepted.”
However, he said two of the JKJAAC’s demands — abolishing refugee seats and reducing the number of ministers — fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the AJK Legislative Assembly.
He criticised the committee for pressing ahead with district-wide protests from Sept 29 despite a written draft agreed “to their satisfaction” and warned that violent demonstrations would not deliver results.
Interior ministry calls meeting
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior has convened an important meeting in Islamabad on Thursday (today) to consider steps to defuse the situation.
Separately, Jamaat-i-Islami deputy emir Liaquat Baloch phoned Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to express concern over escalating tensions and reports of casualties among police and civilians.
He expressed serious concern over the loss of precious lives and stressed that all parties should exercise restraint.
Mr Baloch expressed a lack of confidence in the government committee’s ability to resolve the issues or reassure the public to remain calm.
The JI leader said that in such a tense environment, the Ministry of Interior should play an active role.
He also opposed the use of force in Azad Kashmir and stressed that the matter should be resolved on the principles of justice.

“In the past few days, such questions have been raised that now a dialogue has begun, which, in our understanding, is not appropriate. It is neither beneficial for politics, nor for democracy,” he said at a press conference in Lahore.
“And this is our [PPP’s] view, not a suggestion to anyone,” he added.
The PPP and PML-N continued to engage in a war of words over flood relief, as PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari asserted that the BISP was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by the recent floods in the country, while PML-N’s Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz accused his party of “politicising” the issue.
Furthermore, the tensions between the ruling coalition partners on Tuesday flared in parliament as the PPP lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest CM Nawaz’s diatribe against their party.
“This is the first time that we decided to help the government without taking ministries in the government … without sharing power in the executive,” Kaira said at the press conference.
“We did this so that the government, with unity, could resolve the country’s problems, and we could support it,” he added.
He continued that his party would support the federal government in every possible way.
“[We have] supported it on every issue, when Pakistan was at war we supported it, in assemblies we supported it, we supported legislation, we did no favour; we do not keep count of favours. We did this thinking that we must find solutions to the country’s crises. Otherwise, there were formulas for power sharing, formulas for terms … many formulas were discussed.”
However, he added that the purpose was not to give the federal government “a blank cheque that whatever it does, whatever the PML-N does, we will support it“.
“If our opinion proved better, they would accept it; if their views proved better, we would accept it. Otherwise, we would come to a middle ground and find a compromise, that is the method. We have tried this so far and will continue to do so.”
But he regretted that in the “last few days, a two-way dialogue began and on one side of that dialogue are some colleagues of the PPP and on the other side, the Punjab government”.
He said the recent floods caused immense damage, people’s homes were looted, crops destroyed, and human lives as well as livestock were lost.
“Wherever there was any mistake, or where we thought there might be a better way to do the work, we gave our suggestions; if our suggestions were not accepted, we criticised [the move]; if we were not heard, we protested — this is our democratic right. And this is also the way.
“If you do not accept it, if you do not want to do that, then fine, but we will tell the people of Punjab, we too are Punjabis. We will tell the people of Punjab that in our view this crisis has both immediate and long-term solutions. We will present our ways based on our experience.”
 






Criticising CM Maryam’s remarks, he said: “Now if we give our suggestions and you do not listen and if we criticise [you], you say that you will not allow anyone to speak … and that if a finger is raised here, you will break it and you will not spare them.
“We only offered ways to deal with the floods, but in response, the Sindh government was targeted. Some objections were very painful. We were accused of an electricity subsidy [and] other matters.”
We know the present government is not at fault, but there are certain objections. The PPP chairman said that on the devastation caused by the floods, people must be given immediate relief, and that can be done through the BISP. That is a tried and tested method we have, and the other thing is that [you] should declare an agricultural emergency.”
He continued that the BISP has now become a subject of debate; some want money to be disbursed through it, others do not.
“So the cash grant under BISP is for immediate relief; it provides initial relief. And this is not the first time we have done this in 2023, 2022, 2010, 2011; such amounts were used for the flood-affected people. You did not accept that idea, that’s okay. We only give you our opinion.”</p><small>2025-10-01 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01224603700af08.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945875/troll-in-chief-trump-mocks-democrats-over-shutdown' target='_blank'><strong>Troll-in-chief Trump mocks Democrats over shutdown</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump has appointed himself troller-in-chief during a US government shutdown, mocking rival Democrats with sometimes racially tinged memes and hoping they take the blame.
From ambushing top Democrats with “Trump 2028” hats in the Oval Office to an AI-generated video of US House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries in a sombrero, the social media onslaught has been extreme even by the Republican’s standards.
But there is a serious strategy behind the socials — don’t negotiate, threaten mass layoffs and hope the Democrats cave in.
As the clock ticked down to the deadline for a first shutdown in nearly seven years, Trump seemed more interested in trolling than dealmaking.
Hours before the deadline on Tuesday, Trump posted three pictures on his Truth Social network of his meeting a day earlier with Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Jeffries.
In the foreground? Red “Trump 2028” hats placed on the iconic Resolute Desk, referring to a constitutionally banned third Trump presidential term. In one picture, a grinning Trump is pointing at Jeffries.
 


Jeffries said the baseball caps “just randomly appeared in the middle of the meeting on the desk. It was the strangest thing ever.” It was an extraordinary stunt from a president — even one who recently replaced a photo of his predecessor Joe Biden with a so-called “autopen“.
Vance told Fox News on Wednesday that the Trump hats made Schumer and Jeffries “very uncomfortable“ but insisted that they had also had a “very good conversation” on the shutdown row, before Trump gave up and accused Democrats of trying to take them “hostage”.
 


‘Lighten up’
Far more controversial was Trump’s posting on Monday of an “AI slop” video of Schumer and Jeffries outside the White House that the House minority leader branded “racist and fake”.
It featured fake, AI-generated footage appearing to show Schumer using vulgar language and announcing plans to entice illegal immigrants with benefits, while showing Jeffries wearing a sombrero and bushy moustache as mariachi music plays.
Trumpworld doubled down on the video despite the accusations of racism.
Trump’s son Don Jr posted three crying-laughing emojis on X above a repost of a picture of Trump with the caption: “Tell them they have one hour or I will post them wearing another sombrero.”
 






The White House, meanwhile, joined in the trolling. Footage of Democrats opposing previous shutdowns played on a loop on screens in the famed briefing room.
In a deeply polarised US political scene where winning the social-media war is at least half the battle, Republicans are hoping Trump’s memes will be an effective weapon. It may work, with Democrats still struggling on strategy and messaging after Trump’s crushing 2024 election win.
“If you can’t laugh at this, then you epitomise the problem with the Democratic Party these days,” Michael LaRosa, a former spokesman for Jill Biden, said on X about the hat stunt. “Let’s all lighten up a bit.”
 






Some Democrats have embraced a similar strategy. California Governor Gavin Newsom, whose press office has deliberately copied Trump’s abrasive, all-capitals style, said as the shutdown kicked in: “Trump always chickens out (TACO). No sombrero needed!”
But Trump’s trolling of the Democrats also extends to serious, targeted threats. Threatening mass firings during the shutdown, Trump said on Tuesday that “We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn’t want. They’d be Democrat things.”
A Siena/New York Times poll seemed to show US voters held both sides pretty much equally responsible for the shutdown, for now.
Of 1,075 people surveyed from September 22 to 27, 19 per cent blamed Democrats in Congress, 26pc blamed Trump and Republicans in Congress, 33pc blamed both equally, while 21pc said they had not heard enough to say.</p><small>2025-10-01 17:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01214650139f87b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945831/us-senate-rejects-plan-to-end-government-shutdown' target='_blank'><strong>US Senate rejects plan to end government shutdown</strong></a><br><p>Efforts to bring a quick end to the US government shutdown floundered Wednesday when senators rejected a plan to resolve an acrimonious funding stand-off between President Donald Trump and Democrats in Congress.
With the government out of money after Trump and lawmakers failed to agree on a deal to keep the lights on, many federal departments and agencies have been closed since midnight.
Senate Democrats — who are demanding extended health care subsidies for low income families — refused to help the majority Republicans approve a House-passed bill that would have reopened the government for several weeks while negotiations continue.
Around 750,000 public sector workers are expected to be placed on furlough — a kind of enforced leave, with pay withheld until they return to work.
Essential workers such as the military and border agents may be forced to work without pay and some will likely miss pay checks next week.
Shutdowns are a periodic feature of gridlocked Washington, although this is the first since a record 35-day pause in 2019, when Trump was in his first term. They are unpopular because multiple services used by ordinary voters, from national parks to permit applications, become unavailable.
This time, the shutdown comes against a darker backdrop, with Trump racing to enact hard-right policies, including slashing entire government departments.
The White House is threatening to turn many of the furloughs into mass firings.
“A lot of good can come down from shutdowns,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn’t want. They’d be Democrat things.”
Democrats — motivated by grassroots anger over the expiring health care subsidies for low-income families and Trump’s dismantling of government agencies — have been withholding Senate votes to fund the government as leverage to try and force negotiations.
No compromise
Republicans in the House of Representative have already passed a stop-gap funding fix to keep federal functions running through late November while a longer-term plan is thrashed out.
But the 100-member Senate does not have the 60 votes required to send it to Trump’s desk, and Democrats say they won’t help unless Republicans compromise on their planned spending cuts — especially in health care.
“It’s the job of senators on both sides of the aisle to come together,” top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer told CNN.
“And here’s what we hope now — that the Republicans have seen they don’t have the votes.”
With no compromise on the table, both plans were expected to fail again.
Talks that have taken place so far have been unusually bitter, with Trump mocking Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on social media.
Senate Republican leaders, who have just one rebel in their own ranks, need eight Democrats to join the majority and rubber-stamp the House-passed bill.
They got three moderates to cross the aisle in an initial vote Tuesday and were hoping to peel off five more as the shutdown chaos starts to bite. But Wednesday’s result went exactly the same way.
Democrats will be acutely aware however that the party trying to force policy changes by holding back votes on government funding has usually failed in the past.
“Chuck Schumer, at the behest of a bunch of liberal far-left activist groups, has walked his Democrat colleagues into a box canyon. There’s no way out, folks,” Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters at the US Capitol.
Congress is out Thursday for the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday but the Senate returns to work on Friday and may be in session through the weekend. The House is not due back until next week.</p><small>2025-10-01 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01211615e1a5b18.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945870/mobile-and-internet-restored-across-afghanistan-afp-journalists' target='_blank'><strong>Mobile and internet restored across Afghanistan: AFP journalists</strong></a><br><p>Mobile networks and the internet were restored across Afghanistan on Wednesday, 48 hours after the Taliban authorities shut down telecommunications.
Confusion gripped the South Asian country on Monday night when mobile phone service and the internet went down without warning, freezing businesses and cutting Afghans off from the rest of the world.
The massive blackout came weeks after the government began cutting high-speed internet connections to some provinces to prevent “immorality”, on the orders of shadowy supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.
AFP journalists reported on Wednesday that mobile phone signals and wifi had returned to provinces across the country, including Kandahar in the south, Khost in the east, central Ghazni, and Herat in the west.
The Taliban government has yet to comment on the telecommunications shutdown.
On Wednesday night, hundreds of Afghans poured onto the streets in the capital Kabul, spreading the word that the internet was back.
“It’s like Eidul Azha; it’s like preparing to go for prayer,” said 26-year-old Sohrab Ahmadi, a delivery driver.
“We are very happy from the bottom of our hearts.”
After days of tension, Afghans celebrated by buying sweets and balloons, as drivers honked their horns, phones pressed to their ears.
“The city is alive again,” Mohammad Tawab Farooqi, a restaurant manager in the city told AFP.
Businesses, airports, banks closed
It is the first time since the Taliban government won their insurgency in 2021 and imposed a strict version of Islamic law that communications have been cut in the country.
Netblocks, a watchdog organisation that monitors cybersecurity and internet governance, said the blackout “appears consistent with the intentional disconnection of service”.
It said connectivity had slowed to one per cent of ordinary levels.
A government official warned AFP minutes before the shutdown on Monday evening that the fibre optic network would be cut, affecting mobile phone services, “until further notice”.
There were widespread closures of businesses, airports, and markets, while banks and post offices were unable to operate.
Afghans were unable to contact each other in or out of the country, and many families stopped their children from going to school during the uncertainty.
Those living in Herat and Kandahar travelled to border towns to catch signals from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan.
The United Nations said on Tuesday the shutdown “left Afghanistan almost completely cut off from the outside world”, and called on authorities to restore access.
Internet connections have been extremely slow or intermittent over the past weeks.
On September 16, when the first internet services were first cut in northern provinces, Balkh provincial spokesman Attaullah Zaid said the ban had been ordered by the Taliban’s leader.
“This measure was taken to prevent vice, and alternative options will be put in place across the country to meet connectivity needs,” he wrote on social media.
“Recent studies in Afghanistan found that internet applications have badly affected the ongoing, economic, cultural and religious foundations of society,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-01 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01125217dc59b6f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945833/10-terrorists-killed-during-ctd-operation-in-quetta-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>10 terrorists killed during CTD operation in Quetta: spokesperson</strong></a><br><p>At least ten terrorists were killed in Quetta’s Aghbarg area during an exchange of fire with security personnel from the Counter-terrorism Department (CTD), a spokesperson said on Wednesday.
“Ten terrorists were killed during an exchange of fire between them and the CTD team in the Aghbarg neighbourhood of Quetta,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
“CTD carried out the operation after receiving a tip-off from intelligence agencies,” he said, adding that “upon reaching the area, they were attacked by the terrorists but promptly retaliated.”
“Heavy ammunition and weapons were recovered from the slain terrorists,” as per the statement.
The spokesperson said that the “terrorists had previously been involved in attacking security forces and belonged to a banned terrorist outfit.”
“The slain terrorists have not yet been identified,” the spokesperson said, adding that their “bodies have been transferred to a hospital for identification purposes.”
“Further investigation into the matter is underway,” the statement said.
The Inter-Services Public Relations confirmed that 10 terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij were killed in a separate statement.
The development comes a day after 10 people, including four security personnel, were martyred in a suicide car blast near the headquarters of the Frontier Corps (FC) in Quetta.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The banned so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.</p><small>2025-10-01 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01175454d029cfd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945859/so-far-so-good-aurangzeb-says-talks-with-imf-headed-in-right-direction' target='_blank'><strong>‘So far, so good’: Aurangzeb says talks with IMF headed in right direction</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday said that talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were headed in the “right direction”.
An IMF mission led by Iva Petrova held a formal kick-off meeting with Pakistan’s economic team to review the implementation of the EFF and RSF. The programme’s performance as of the end of June this year — the period under review — has been mixed.
The start of the next review period, ending December this year, has also been off the mark, particularly in revenue collection. The two sides now have to agree on corrective measures during their dialogue to meet the next biannual targets.
Today, Aurangzeb spoke to reporters as he left a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue in Islamabad. The minister told reporters that the $7.1 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the $1.1bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) were being reviewed.
“So far, so good,” he said. The EFF is undergoing its second review, while the RSF is being reviewed for the first time.
When asked about the reviews and whether they will conclude by October 8, Aurangzeb said: “Whatever discussions are happening, they are moving in the right direction.”
Additionally, Aurangzeb also spoke about the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) recording a shortfall of Rs198bn in the first quarter of the fiscal year.
“We want to get FBR tax to gross domestic product (GDP) of 11 per cent by the end of this fiscal year,” he said. “We want to remain very committed to that target. As you know, there are certain pending court cases … let’s see how the court decides and that can help bridge some of this gap.”
 


Pakis­tan and the IMF reached a three-year, $7bn aid package deal in July last year, giving much-needed respite to the nation. The new programme aimed to enable Pakistan to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
In May this year, the IMF board approved a fresh $1.4 billion loan to help Pakistan strengthen its economic resilience to climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters. However, the disbursement of funds is contingent upon successful completion of reviews under the EFF, an IMF official said.
The opening session of the IMF talks which kicked off on Monday was attended by key economic stakeholders, including the State Bank of Pakistan governor, finance secretary and chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
While power sector benchmarks for the end-June 2025 period were comfortably met, revenue collection fell short by about Rs1.2 trillion — almost 1pc of GDP — in the last fiscal year, and the first two months of the current fiscal year have shown similar shortfalls.
The mission will remain in Pakistan for almost two weeks and will also hold forward-looking discussions with the authorities to push for faster implementation of the end-December 2025 targets.
Upon the successful completion of the review, Pakistan will be eligible for the disbursement of about $1bn (760 million Special Drawing Rights) by the end of next month.</p><small>2025-10-01 15:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0118563781c0706.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945863/us-offers-security-guarantees-to-qatar-after-israel-strikes-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>US offers security guarantees to Qatar after Israel strikes: White House</strong></a><br><p>The United States will regard “any armed attack” on Qatari territory as a threat to Washington and will provide the Gulf Arab state with security guarantees, the White House said, after an Israeli strike on the country last month.
“In light of the continuing threats to the State of Qatar posed by foreign aggression, it is the policy of the United States to guarantee the security and territorial integrity of the State of Qatar against external attack,” said an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump on Monday.
In the event of an attack on Qatar, the United States will “take all lawful and appropriate measures — including diplomatic, economic, and, if necessary, military — to defend the interests of the United States and of the State of Qatar and to restore peace and stability,” the order said.
The agreement comes after an Israeli strike on the key US regional ally on September 9, targeting officials from Hamas who were discussing a US peace proposal to end the conflict in Gaza.
 
 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Qatar’s prime minister from the White House on Monday, apologising for strikes and promising not to do so again, the United States said. Netanyahu was in Washington to meet Trump, and had until then been defiant since ordering the September 9 strikes.
Qatar is a key US ally in the Gulf and hosts the largest US military base in the region at Al-Udeid, which also includes a regional headquarters for elements of US Central Command.</p><small>2025-10-01 14:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01184830efcfb1c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945837/islamabad-court-recalls-non-bailable-arrest-warrants-as-imaan-mazari-husband-appear-before-judge' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court recalls non-bailable arrest warrants as Imaan Mazari, husband appear before judge</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad District and Sessions Court on Wednesday recalled the non-bailable arrest warrants issued against human rights defenders and lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha after the two appeared in court.

While the couple appeared in court today, they did not respond with a confirmation or denial when the charge sheet against them was read out.
“We will hire lawyers and can respond to the court regarding this after that,” Chattha said. “We have filed a new application regarding our documents … No indictment can be made until this application is decided.”
The accused had earlier applied to obtain their written statements submitted before the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) under Section 161 (examination of witnesses) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and other documents. Section 161 deals with the power of the police to examine witnesses orally during an investigation and to reduce their statements into writing.
Judge Majoka then directed the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to provide the documents to both the lawyers and adjourned the hearing until 11:30am.
When the hearing resumed, Judge Majoka issued an order on the accused couple’s miscellaneous application for the documents.
Former Islamabad High Court Bar president Riasat Ali Azad, along with Islamabad Bar Association President Naeem Gujjar and its ex-president Qaiser Imam, also appeared before the court.
The prosecution had initially expressed ignorance about the written statements, but once the judge began dictating the order, the statements were handed over to Mazari and Chattha.
Subsequently, the two decided to challenge the trial proceedings till the current stage of framing of charges and their lawyers requested additional time from the court. The request was accepted, and the hearing was adjourned until October 7.
Last week, Mazari filed a grievance letter over “inaction” on her workplace harassment complaint against Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar.
On September 11, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had issued condemnatory statements in reaction and called for the judge’s dismissal from the post of the IHC top judge.
Mazari had also approached an inquiry committee of the IHC and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against Justice Dogar.</p><small>2025-10-01 13:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011716561575ef1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945855/competition-commission-of-pakistan-approves-ptcls-acquisition-of-telenor-with-conditions' target='_blank'><strong>Competition Commission of Pakistan approves PTCL’s acquisition of Telenor with conditions</strong></a><br><p>The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has approved Pakistan Telecommunications Limited’s (PTCL) acquisition of mobile carrier Telenor Pakistan and Orion Towers shareholdings, according to a press release issued on Wednesday.
According to the telecommunication company’s website, one of its subsidiaries is mobile carrier Ufone. As part of the deal, Telenor and Ufone will merge.
 
 

According to the press release, the merger was announced today at a press conference at the CCP’s head office. CCP Chairman Dr Kabir Ahmed Sidhu, CCP Registrar and Head of Legal Ambreen Abbasi and members Salman Amin and Shahzad Hussain shared the key highlights of the agreement.
“They explained that [the] CCP conducted a comprehensive review of the merger transaction,” the press release read. “The review examined market structure, concentration levels, efficiencies, and potential competition risks.”
Dr Sidhu emphasised that the commission’s decision “ensures a level playing field for all telecom operators and safeguards consumer interests”.
“The merger aims to enhance service quality, expand product offerings and accelerate technological innovation, including the rollout of 5G,” he was quoted as saying.
“The CCP [has] studied various international precedents, including orders from the United States, United Kingdom and European Union, involving similar transactions before granting approval.”
According to the press release, Abbasi explained that the assessment considered possibly lessening competition in the relevant sub-markets, market shares and efficiency claims. She underlined that the merger was approved conditionally, with safeguards designed to prevent anti-competitive conduct.
Some of the key conditions listed in the press release were:

PTCL and the merged entity will maintain separate boards and independent management structures.
Chief executive officers and senior management must meet strict competency and integrity requirements, with UAE-based telecom company Etisalat ensuring professional leadership.
An independent third-party will monitor compliance, audit transactions, and submit quarterly reports to CCP for five years.
Related party transactions and cross-subsidisation will be prohibited unless
conducted competitively and at arm’s length.
Non-discriminatory access will be applied to capacity and infrastructure for all operators. PTCL and MergeCo shall submit all its existing and future Reference Interconnect Offers (RIO) to the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) for approval. PTCL shall offer interconnection to all operators in accordance with RIO as approved by the PTA.
PTCL shall seek the PTA’s approval for its wholesale pricing structure in relation to IP Bandwidth, LDI, Domestic Leased Line and telecom infrastructure services provided to PTA licensees, as well as associated companies including MergeCo. PTCL shall not set predatory retail prices.
Mandatory compliance will be ensured with service quality standards, innovation policies and PTA tariff approvals.
PTCL and Telenor must demonstrate that claimed efficiencies are passed on to consumers through better services, pricing and infrastructure investments.
The CCP reserves the right to direct divestiture of assets or business segments in case of future violations.

In the press release, Amin was quoted as saying that these conditions are specifically aimed at preventing favouritism, predatory pricing and barriers to market entry, while ensuring continued regulatory oversight by the CCP and PTA.
Last week, the CCP raised concerns over PTCL’s non-cooperation and delay in providing critical information for evaluating the merger, with the watchdog citing potential competition risks and warned of cross-subsidisation between PTCL and Ufone, both of which operate under joint management.</p><small>2025-10-01 12:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0114524624df35a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945844/have-never-apologised-to-bcci-nor-will-i-ever-do-so-mohsin-naqvi-hits-back-at-indian-media-reports' target='_blank'><strong>‘Have never apologised to BCCI nor will I ever do so’: Mohsin Naqvi hits back at Indian media reports</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Asia Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday refuted claims by Indian media that he had apologised to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the trophy handover issue at Sunday’s Asia Cup final.
The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from the ACC chief, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. Subsequently, Indian skipper Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup.
Later, Indian media alleged that Naqvi had himself refused to hand the trophy over to the Indian team.
Today, several Indian outlets, including IndiaToday, Financial Express and Hindustan Times, reported that Naqvi had now apologised to the BCCI, but that he still refused to hand them the trophy.
Responding to an India Today post about their report on social media platform X, Naqvi stated, “Indian media thrives on lies, not facts. Let me make it absolutely clear: I have done nothing wrong and I have never apologised to the BCCI nor will I ever do so.”
He called the claims “fabricated nonsense” and “cheap propaganda”, saying it was aimed at misleading Indian people.
The PCB chairman slammed India for continuing to “drag politics into cricket, damaging the very spirit of the game”.
“As ACC chairman, I was ready to hand over the trophy that very day and I am still ready now,” he said. “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.”
 






During the Asia Cup, Naqvi had previously expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” from the Indian side after Yadav seemingly politicised the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May.
Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention. Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The PCB had lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Yadav’s remarks, leading to him reportedly being fined 30 per cent of his match fee after being found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct.
Meanwhile, pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were also reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against India.
Following the final, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on winning the match, calling it a continuation of India’s Operation Sindoor.
Naqvi had also responded to Modi’s post on X, saying: “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”.
“Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he had said.

According to the United Nations’ International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef), Pakistan is home to over 19 million child brides, with nearly 1 in 6 young women married before the age of 18 and as many as 4.8m girls married before the age of 15.
“In view of the fact that the alleged detenue has attained puberty and appears to have given free and voluntary consent, she shall be at liberty to reside with the petitioner,” read a verdict issued by Justice Muhammad Azam Khan for a hearing held on July 11.
The verdict was issued on a plea filed by Muhammad Riaz, challenging a June 23 order by an Islamabad-East district judge that denied the recovery of the girl after her family members allegedly “forcibly” took her away from the man’s house on June 21.
According to the order, the birth certificate, which was registered after the marriage, said the girl was aged 15 at the time of solemnisation of her Nikkah on May 30. However, the Nikahnama “vaguely records her age as ‘almost 18 years’”, and the court noted it was not empowered to “conclusively decide the question of age”.
 
 

The girl was presented before the court on July 11, when she “unequivocally
affirmed that she had contracted marriage with the petitioner of her own choice and expressed her desire to reside with him, explicitly declining to return to her parents”, the order stated.
“It is noteworthy that even during her stay at the Crisis Centre, Islamabad, she has consistently maintained this position.”
Justice Khan observed that the trial court “overlooked” that the petitioner’s counsel had highlighted that there was “great apprehension to the life, honour and dignity of the detenue” if she remained in the custody of the respondents.
Justice Khan noted that while a marriage wherein either or both of the parties were under 18 was “not void under the Shariah, it is nonetheless punishable by law and treated as contrary to public policy, especially where it undermines the minor’s physical, emotional, and educational development”.
The order delved into the legal definitions of “child”, “child marriage” and “child abuse”, and considered various questions, including whether a marriage “valid under the Islamic law/Shariah can be considered void under the statutory law, particularly in light of the Act of 2025”.
 
 

The IHC order also mentioned the Islamabad Child Marriage Restraint Act 2025 (ICMRA) passed in May, which raised the minimum marriage age for girls from 16 years to 18 years.
However, the judge pointed out that the ICMRA “does not render the marriage itself void” but has been “enacted merely to punish the party contracting, arranging and/or solemnising a marriage with a child”.
“This bifurcation, where the marriage is considered valid under one body of law but criminal under another, creates a legal paradox that risks frustrating the very objective of the statute, which is to act as a deterrent against child marriages and protect minors from premature unions that could harm their physical, emotional, and educational well-being,” Justice Khan wrote.
On the question of whether child marriage would fall within the definition of
Sections 375 and 377A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and thereby constitute “rape”, the judge observed that prior precedents do not consider consummation within such a marriage as “rape”. The “element of lawful relationship and consent within marriage fundamentally distinguishes” underage marriages from rape cases, he added.
The petitioner’s counsel, Advocate Shumaila Rafique Awan, cited previous Supreme Court orders from 1970 and 2021 to “assert that the marriage contracted is valid under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO, 1961), therefore, the petitioner has the right to recover his wife and protect their lawful union”.
Advocate Mirza Irfan Ghazanfar, the counsel for two of the respondents, contended that the earlier order did not “call for any interference” and that the girl was not sui juris (of age) at the time of the Nikkah.
The respondents’ lawyers, as per the order, cited a 2022 IHC ruling to “contend that marriages contracted between a minor and an adult are considered void ab initio, as the same constitute a criminal offence under the Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929”.
Legal clarity urgently needed to ‘safeguard minors from harm’
Despite constitutional protections, disparities in legal marriage age persist across provinces, with only Sindh and the Islamabad Capital Territory enforcing 18 as the minimum age for girls — a gap that continues to expose millions to early pregnancies, domestic violence, and educational exclusion.
Given the sensitive nature of the case, the court made “certain recommendations in aid of legislative clarity and institutional consistency”.
These included urging the federal government to undertake a legislative review to get rid of “inconsistencies across various statutes qua the
determination of age”.
 
 

“It is recommended that the federal government adopt a clear statutory
stance regarding the marriage contracted involving minors, even if they
have attained puberty and show signs of mental maturity. It is necessary
to do so in order to protect children of tender age.
“To uphold Constitutional rights and safeguard minors from harm, statutory clarity is urgently needed,” the judgment stressed.
The judge listed various discrepancies in different statutes, including the PPC, Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance 1979, Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939, Guardian & Wards Act 1890, Majority Act 1875, National Commission on the Rights of Child Act 2017, Juvenile Justice System Act 2018, and the Islamabad Capital Territory Child Protection Act 2018.
Justice Khan strongly recommended that the federal government “launch a sustained and comprehensive awareness campaign to educate citizens, public officials, Nikkah registrars, and community leaders about the harmful consequences and legal implications of child marriages”.
The judge stressed that the district administration and licence-issuing authorities shall ensure that all Nikkah registrars are fully informed about the provisions and penal consequences under the ICMRA, and that they must be trained to “strictly avoid solemnising or registering any marriage involving a
minor”.
 
 

To prevent the registration of underage marriages, Justice Khan called on the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) and relevant marriage registration authorities to integrate the Birth Registration Certificate into their systems, ensuring verification of age before issuing a Marriage Certificate.
The court further directed that “all Guardian Courts, Family Courts, and Courts exercising jurisdiction under Section 491 [of the Code of Criminal Procedure] must engage Child Protection Officers (CPOs) under the Islamabad Child
Protection Act 2018 to conduct a statutory welfare assessment”.
“The CPO’s report should be treated as an essential aid in determining
custody, care, or marital status of the minor,” the order added, emphasising that the approach would ensure child-centric, evidence-based decision-making in line with Constitutional protections under Articles 9 (security of person), 14 (inviolability of dignity), 25 (equality of citizens), and 35 (protection of family, etc).
The judge also urged that “all courts dealing with cases involving alleged child marriages adopt a participatory, protective and trauma-informed approach, one that treats the minor not merely as a subject of parental or spousal authority, but as a rights-bearing individual whose voice must guide
the inquiry and whose welfare must define the outcome”.
In view of the recommendations, the judge ordered that copies of the judgment be sent to the law, human rights and interior ministries, the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, the Islamabad chief commissioner, the Nadra director general, the Council of Islamic Ideology (CCI) secretary, as well as all district and sessions judges.</p><small>2025-10-01 11:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011626285738823.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945848/more-ingredients-for-life-discovered-in-ocean-on-saturn-moon' target='_blank'><strong>More ingredients for life discovered in ocean on Saturn moon</strong></a><br><p>The ocean hidden under the icy shell of Saturn’s moon Enceladus harbours complex organic molecules, a study said on Wednesday, offering further evidence that the small world could have all the right ingredients to host extraterrestrial life.
Just 500 kilometres (310 miles) wide and invisible to the naked eye, the white, scar-covered Enceladus is one of hundreds of moons orbiting the sixth planet from the Sun.
For a long time, scientists believed Enceladus was too far away from the Sun — and therefore too cold — to be habitable.
Then the Cassini space probe flew past the moon several times during a 2004-2017 trip to Saturn and its rings, discovering evidence that a vast saltwater ocean is concealed under the moon’s kilometres-thick layer of ice.
Since then, scientists have been sifting through the data collected by Cassini, revealing that the ocean has many of the elements thought to be needed to host life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide, and phosphorus.
When the spacecraft passed over the moon’s south pole, it discovered jets of water bursting through cracks on the surface.
These jets were propelling tiny ice particles — smaller than grains of sand —  into space. While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon’s surface, others collected around one of Saturn’s many rings.

When Cassini flew through Saturn’s outermost “E” ring, it was “detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,” Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space Agency.
By looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules — including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.
But these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years —  or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.
So the scientists wanted to look at some fresh ice grains.
Luckily, they already had access to some.
When Cassini flew directly into the spray spewing from the moon’s surface in 2008, grains of ice hit the spacecraft’s Cosmic Dust Analyser at around 18 kilometres a second.
But it took years to complete a detailed chemical analysis of these particles, which was the subject of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.
Back to the moon?
Study co-author Frank Postberg said the research proves that “the complex organic molecules Cassini detected in Saturn’s ‘E’ ring are not just a product of long exposure to space, but are readily available in Enceladus’s ocean”.
French astrochemist Caroline Freissinet, who was not involved in the study, told AFP that there was “not much doubt” that these molecules were in the moon’s ocean.
But this confirmation provides “another piece in the puzzle,” she added.
It also shows that recent technology, such as artificial intelligence, allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.
But to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.
The European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.
After all, “Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,” the agency said in the statement.
Khawaja added that “even not finding life on Enceladus would be a huge discovery, because it raises serious questions about why life is not present in such an environment when the right conditions are there.”</p><small>2025-10-01 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011441176509c96.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945843/man-allegedly-guns-down-brother-3-family-members-in-abbottabad-police' target='_blank'><strong>Man allegedly guns down brother, 3 family members in Abbottabad: police</strong></a><br><p>A man allegedly shot dead his brother, sister-in-law, and their two daughters in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Abbottabad district on Wednesday, according to the police.
Abbottabad Police Spokesperson Azam Mir Afzal told Dawn.com that the incident took place in the Bandi Attai area of Havelian.
“The suspect allegedly killed his brother along with his family members, but the motive behind the murders could not be immediately ascertained.”
He said a police team had been dispatched to the area and a first information report (FIR) was being registered at the Havelian police station.
According to the spokesperson, the suspect killed his brother, his sister-in-law, and two nieces before fleeing the scene.
The spokesperson added that police had reached the spot and the bodies of the victims were shifted to the Havelian hospital for post-mortem.

“Additionally, it noted a shutdown of cellular services on election night, which reduced the transparency of the process and impacted the efficiency of receiving results,” a COG press release said on Tuesday.
The report had been the subject of some controversy after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had buried the report after finding the elections to be riddled with problems.
The COG noted areas for improvement and provided recommendations for strengthening the independence of the country’s democratic institutions, the press release said.
A “Letter of Transmittal”, written by COG Chairperson Dr Goodluck Jonathan and included in the report, noted the denial of election symbol to the PTI, the  consecutive convictions of the party’s founder Imran Khan, and limitations on freedom of association and assembly.
It then said: “When looked at in isolation, some — though not all — of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party’s ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”
The COG chairperson wrote: “We noted with concern a number of factors in the pre-election period that significantly impacted the level playing field, most crucially the non-allocation of the bat symbol to PTI and the registering of PTI candidates as independents.
 
 

“While the for this decision had a basis in law, the negative consequences of this decision appeared vastly disproportionate to the offence this decision sought to address.”
The Supreme Court had revoked the PTI’s bat symbol just weeks before the elections over not holding its intra-party polls, forcing the party’s candidates to contest as independent candidates without a unified symbol.
Other “issues of concern” noted by the COG included Imran’s convictions in three separate cases days before the election. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the group said.
It also noted “limitations on journalistic freedoms, including in relation to freedom of speech and a culture of impunity for perpetrators of violence against journalists, which may have led to self-censorship”.
Forms-45 ‘may have been altered’
The 161-page report also mentioned the Forms-45 controversy that has been at the heart of rigging allegations levelled by the PTI during those elections.
“In several constituencies, the Group reviewed documentation that suggested that Form 45s may have been altered to change the total number of votes received by candidates, and that these altered forms were used to compile the tabulated results on Forms 47, resulting in some candidates being illegally returned as elected,” the COG report read.
 
 

It said the COG was informed that, in many cases, the Forms-45 submitted to the Returning Officer (RO) differed from the copies of Forms-45 “received at the polling station by agents of independent candidates and other party agents”.The COG also “reviewed documentation that appeared to show that a significant number of Forms 46 had been altered”.
Providing its assessment of the English-language media coverage, the COG noted that the mainstream media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting”.
“However, some sections of the media covered some candidates and political parties more favourably than they did others, with PTI-affiliated independent candidates receiving less positive coverage in national mainstream media.”
The report pointed out that state-owned PTV News “lacked balance, with the majority of its coverage concentrated on PML-N and the PPP — especially the former” — while PTI-affiliated independent candidates were not given as much coverage.
The COG said it was “informed that broadcasters were prevented from saying Imran Khan’s name, instead being instructed to refer only to the chair of PTI”.
 
 

Moreover, the group noted that “some English language newspapers published obvious campaign messages of PML-N and its leader on 7 February” despite the campaign period ending the day before.
The report also detailed the COG’s assessments on the pre-poll activities; the voting, counting and results process; the inclusion of women, youth, the transgender community and religious minorities; and the legal environment, including certain recent rulings and a letter by judges alleging interference.
“Jurisprudential inconsistencies in two of the most significant and consequential cases in the pre-election period had severe impacts in terms of the level nature of the playing field,” the COG said, specifying the SC’s reversal of the lifetime ban for politicians, and the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision, later upheld by the apex court, to withhold the bat symbol from PTI.
Reduction in voter registration gender gap
In its report, the COG also “commended the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) efforts to ensure inclusive elections”.
“It noted the ECP’s expansion of its Gender and Social Inclusion Wing as a worthwhile endeavour, which contributed to a reduction in the voter registration gender gap from 12 per cent in 2013 to 7.7pc in the 2024 election.
“The group further noted the establishment of the ECP’s gender hotline for reporting election-related harassment and intimidation. There was also an improvement in youth voter turnout.”
The press release, citing the report, added that despite challenges, the “potential for improving future polls was encouraging”.
“The potential of Pakistan’s democracy is enormous. Pakistan has a vibrant and diverse media; women and the youth are more engaged than ever; and Pakistan’s CSOs play a critical role in the democratic life of the country, continually pushing for reform and improvement.”
The report proposed reforms to various aspects of the electoral process, including the legal framework and its interpretation, election administration, and laws impacting political rights, women’s participation, pre-election campaigns, and the role of the media,  the press release said.
The COG noted areas for improvement and provided recommendations for strengthening the independence of the country’s democratic institutions, the press release said.
It further stated: “The group highlighted, among others, the conditions which appeared to limit fundamental political rights and impacted one party’s ability to fairly contest the election. Additionally, it noted a shutdown of cellular services on election night, which reduced the transparency of the process and impacted the efficiency of receiving results.”
The report concluded that these developments may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process”.
‘Delayed’ report
According to the letter of transmittal appended to the report, it was submitted by the COG to the Commonwealth Secretary General on Nov 20, 2024. A press statement issued alongside the report did not explain the inordinate delay in its publication.
In September, the PTI had called on the COG to release this report, claiming that it laid bare “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting of PTI and its founder, Imran Khan”.
However, in a statement issued on Sept 14, the COG said it was aware that a version of its report on the 2024 Pakistan general elections was circulating online, but that they did not comment on leaked documents as a matter of policy.
“The government and the Election Commission of Pakis­tan have already received the report. The full report, as we had communicated earlier, will be released later this month, along with a number of COG reports currently in the publication pipeline,” the COG statement said.
The PTI’s demand came after a recent report by the independent news outlet Drop Site News claimed that the COG had “buried their report” after finding the Feb 8 general elections to be riddled with problems.
Although the group’s report on Pakistan was yet to be officially released back then, media outlets claimed to have obtained leaked copies of the report.</p><small>2025-10-01 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01111136f7a9345.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945827/32-magnititude-earthquake-jolts-parts-of-karachi-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>3.2-magnititude earthquake jolts parts of Karachi: PMD</strong></a><br><p>A 3.2-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Karachi on Wednesday morning, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said.

The bond, meant to raise funds from global investors, was issued in 2015 with a 10-year tenor and matured on September 30 this year.
Taking to the X platform, Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad announced the development, saying, “Timely debt servicing remains business as usual, reflecting the country’s commitment to financial discipline.”
 






He said the development was encouraging as it comes at a time when external buffers and liquidity have improved, sovereign ratings have been raised, and investor confidence is rising, with Pakistan’s bonds recently trading at a premium.
Schehzad further said that the debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio had improved from 77 per cent in FY20 to 70pc in FY25.
“External debt’s share in total public debt has declined from 38pc to 32pc in FY25, reducing FX vulnerability,” Schehzad added. “Debt growth has moderated sharply in FY25 versus in earlier years.”
Looking ahead, easing global borrowing costs, alongside stronger fundamentals, position Pakistan to access markets on more competitive terms and continue building a more sustainable debt profile, he said.
“This is a steady step forward — repayment as expected, but with stronger fundamentals, improved investor sentiment, and a more resilient outlook.”
Pakistan faced a prolonged economic crisis over the last few years, marked by critically low foreign exchange reserves, an acute balance-of-payment crisis, and the looming risk of default in 2023. The crisis was averted after the International Monetary Fund released a crucial loan tranche, while support from friendly countries, including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, also played a key role.
After averting default, Pakistan has undertaken tough IMF-prescribed reforms to stabilise its economy and bolster macroeconomic indicators. This year, global credit rating agencies like Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P Global raised Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating.</p><small>2025-10-01 06:56</small></div><hr>
