The spokesperson for district police, Yaqoob Zulqarnain said, told Dawn that an IED was used in the blast that took place in Paniyala area, which is in the jurisdiction of the Shaheed Nawab Khan police station.
ASI Gul Alam, Constable Rafiq and the driver of the mobile van, Sakhi Jan, lost their lives in the incident, the police spokesperson said, adding that another constable accompanying them, Azad Shah, remained unhurt.
He said the site of the incident had been cordoned off and a search operation had been launched.
“Police are searching for the attackers, and the matter is being investigated from all angles,” he said.
The Paniyala deputy superintendent of police and station house officer, as well as the district police official (DPO), also reached the site of the blast after the incident, according to the police spokesperson.
Separately, a statement issued by the office of DI Khan DPO Sajjad Ahmad Sahibzada said that the attack was carried out by “unidentified terrorists”.
The statement said the DPO also spoke to the media, saying: “The terrorists have carried out a cowardly attack. Such acts cannot dampen the morale of the police.”
Later, an official statement issued by DI Khan Police said the DPO reviewed the evidence gathered from the site. He was briefed by Saddar Superintendent of Police (SP) Muahammad Nawab Khan, Paharpur Syed Asad Ali Shah and DI Khan bomb disposal unit in-charge Inayatullah briefed the DPO on the initial investigation, nature of the attack and evidence collected until then.
Outlining the details of the search and strike operation under way in the area, the statement said it was being carried out by police personnel, alburq force, elite force and bomb disposal teams.
Meanwhile, security had been beefed up in certain areas, it added.
In a subsequent statement issued around 4:30, police said two terrorists had been killed during the ongoing search and strike operation.
“An intense exchange of fire took place between the police and terrorists for long,” the statement said, adding that two terrorists of “Fitna-al-Khawarij” had been killed while there were reports of another two getting injured.
Condemnations
State-run APP reported that KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi strongly condemned the blast and expressed deep sorrow and grief over the martyrdom of three policemen in the attack.
The statement issued by the CM’s Office and carried by APP quoted Afridi as saying that the three martyred cops had “laid down their lives for the nation”.
According to the statement, the CM highlighted that police had been “bravely fighting terrorism on the front line” despite limited resources.
He termed today’s attack a “cowardly act” and said that such incidents could not weaken the resolve of the nation.
The statement said CM Afridi assured that the provincial government “stands firmly with its brave police force and salutes their great sacrifices”.
“He vowed that the martyrs’ sacrifices would not go in vain and that the terrorists involved would be brought to justice.”
It further quoted the CM as saying that the “fight against terrorism will continue with even greater determination and full force”.
He prayed for the martyred policemen and expressed solidarity with the bereaved families, assuring that the KP government would provide them all possible support.
A statement issued by KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi’s office said he strongly condemned the attack and termed it a “cowardly and brutal act”.
The statement said Governor Kundi expressed grief over the martyrdom of three policemen in the incident, paid tribute to them and termed them “heroes of the nation”.
He extended condolences to their families and expressed solidarity with them, the statement added.
It further quoted the governor as saying: “Their (the martyrs) sacrifices will always be remembered.
“The sacrifices of police and security forces will not go in vain, and the struggle for peace in the province will continue at all costs. Such cowardly attacks cannot weaken the strong and unshakeable resolve of the nation against terrorism. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s people and institutions are united for the elimination of the menace of terrorism,” he said.
State broadcaster Radio Pakistan, meanwhile, reported that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also condemned the attack and expressed “deep sorrow and grief” over the martyrdom of the three police personnel.
The PM prayed for the martyrs and extended condolences to their families, the Radio Pakistan report said, adding that the premier also directed that “those responsible for the incident be identified and brought to justice”.
He paid tribute to the “great sacrifices of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police in the fight against terrorism” and reaffirmed “the unwavering commitment to root out the menace of terrorism”.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also strongly denounced the attack, APP reported.
“The bravery and sacrifice of the valiant sons of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police are commendable,” he was quoted as saying. Naqvi said the “sacrifices of the martyrs will always be remembered”.
“We hold the sacrifices of KP Police in the highest regard,” he added.
There have been several incidents of attacks on law enforcers in recent months in KP, as Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism.
The country has witnessed a surge in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Today’s attack on police comes around two weeks after the targeting of a police mobile with a bomb in DI Khan on November 20. Two cops were martyred and four were injured in the incident.
In October, terrorists also attacked the Police Training School in DI Khan. Six policemen, including trainees, were martyred and 13 others — 12 policemen and a civilian — were injured in the terrorist attack. The military’s media wing said five terrorists were killed in the retaliatory operation by security forces.
A police checkpoint had also come under attack from multiple sides by terrorists late on the night of October 8. One cop was martyred in the incident.</p><small>2025-12-03 12:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/03163239fc7689d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958979/kyrgyzstan-president-arrives-in-islamabad-on-official-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Kyrgyzstan president arrives in Islamabad on official visit</strong></a><br><p>Kyrgyzstan President Sadyr Zhaparov arrived in Islamabad on Wednesday where he was received by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari.







A press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office earlier said the invitation for the visit was extended to the Kyrgyzstan president by PM Shehbaz.
It added that a high-level delegation, comprising senior ministers, business leaders and other officials, would accompany the president during the official visit.
Pakistan and the Kyrgyz Republic share longstanding relations, founded on deep-rooted cultural, historical and spiritual affinities.
The two countries had agreed to promote bilateral cooperation in cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and digital finance in August.
In July, they reaffirmed an agreement to increase bilateral trade to $100 million at a session of their intergovernmental commission.
Alongside bilateral relations, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan are both members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisa­tion, a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose other members include China, Russia, India, and Iran.</p><small>2025-12-03 11:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/03150915769328c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958978/karachi-atc-acquits-mahrang-baloch-in-terrorism-sedition-case-after-a-year' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi ATC acquits Mahrang Baloch in terrorism, sedition case after a year</strong></a><br><p>A Karachi anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Wednesday acquitted Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) leader Dr Mahrang Baloch in a case of sedition and public mischief registered against her in October last year.
Mahrang had been booked in the terrorism case by Malir district’s Quaidabad police on Oct 11, 2024, for allegedly inciting people by levelling “allegations against security institutions”.
ATC Judge Ayaz Mustafa Jokhio announced the verdict today on Mahrang’s acquittal plea in the case, filed by Advocate Jibran Nasir.
“I am of the view that there is no probability of the accused being convicted of any offence. I hereby allow this application and acquit the accused, Mst. Mahrang Baloch, d/o Abdul Ghaffar,” the court order read.
The rights activist was cleared of charges under section 265-K (power of court to acquit accused at any stage) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
Mahrang, as per the court order, appeared via video link from Quetta Prison, where she has been incarcerated after her arrest in March. Despite her acquittal in the Karachi case, the activist cannot be released due to other pending cases against her.
In the order, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Judge Jokhio said he considered the arguments of Mahrang’s lawyer, the state counsel, and also reviewed the material on record.
“In this regard, the complainant has not produced any independent witnesses, which prove his contention,” the judge observed.
He noted that the investigation officer had cited five witnesses in the charge sheet, and besides the complainant, the “remaining [prosecution witnesses] are police officials who do not know about facts of alleged incident”.
The judge further said that in their statements under Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the witnesses had “not stated single word about the alleged incident, which shows they have no knowledge about the alleged incident”.
He noted that during the investigation, at the time of visitingthe  place of the incident, “neither IO called any private/independent witness from locality nor made query from area people regarding alleged incident”.
The judge pointed out that the case was registered in October 2024, while the challan was submitted in August 2025, “after the delay of 10 months” without any reason provided by the IO for the delay.
Judge Jokhio observed that the “purpose of provisions of section 265-K, CrPC is very much clear, and it never prevents a court from acquitting an accused at any stage of the case”.
“It may be observed here that in view of [the] plethora of pending cases, instead of allowing the complainant/prosecution to produce weak, deficient, and inadmissible proposed evidence in the trial, it is high time for the trial courts to exercise such vast power vested therewith, to save precious public time.”
On the matter of the charge not being framed, the judge said it was a “well-settled law that court can exercise power under section 265-K CrPC even before framing of charge”.
The judge also noted that the complainant failed to appear in court despite the police being ordered to produce him.
Fabricated case: Mahrang
Mahrang had termed the case “fabricated”, saying it showed “how the state had grown increasingly uncomfortable” with her activism.
The first information report (FIR) was registered on the complaint of a resident named Asad Ali Shams, who claimed that Mahrang was inciting violence in his area.
Accusing her of instigating the people against the state and its institutions, the complainant had also alleged Mahrang had links to terrorist groups operating in Balochistan.
The FIR invoked Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 as well as Sections 124-A (‘sedition law’), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 153-A (promotion of enmity between groups), 500 (punishment for defamation) and 505 (statement conducing to public mischief) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2025-12-03 11:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/031333533f1db22.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958971/arshad-sharif-murder-federal-constitutional-court-wonders-whether-it-can-proceed-with-suo-motu-case' target='_blank'><strong>Arshad Sharif murder: Federal Constitutional Court wonders whether it can proceed with suo motu case</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) on Wednesday wondered whether it could continue proceedings in the murder case of journalist Arshad Sharif, as the suo motu powers invoked by the Supreme Court while taking up the case had been curtailed after the 27th Amendment.
The question was raised by a two-judge FCC bench, headed by Justice Aamer Farooq and also including Justice Rozi Khan, as it took up the murder case.
Sharif was shot in the head when Kenyan police opened fire on his car on the outskirts of Nairobi on Oct 23, 2022. He had left Pakistan in August 2022 after multiple cases of sedition were registered against him in different cities.
The suo motu case for an independent and transparent probe of the murder was initially taken up by a five-member SC bench in December 2022. After the passage of the 26th Amendment, it was heard by a six-member constitutional bench of the SC. However, after its formation under the 27th Amendment, the FCC was granted jurisdiction over both constitutional and suo motu cases.
But, during debate on the 27th Amendment bill in the Senate, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had explained that while the legislation granted the FCC suo motu powers, they could only be exercised when an application was submitted, and if the court deemed that the plea was valid and needed.
During the hearing today, the two-member FCC bench sought assistance on the jurisdictional question pertaining to suo motu from both sides of the divide at the upcoming hearing on December 17.
Justice Farooq emphasised that, along with regulating the court proceedings, jurisdictional questions should also be looked into, adding that the constitutional court could not function “without satisfying itself” on the matter.
For his part, Advocate Imran Shafique, who represents Sharif’s wife Javeria Siddique, argued that there was a court decision that the FCC could proceed with suo motu cases.
He contended that more than five thousand letters had been written to the SC after Sharif’s killing, and any one of them could be taken as a plea.

 

Progress report sought
The FCC also sought a progress report on the case’s murder investigations, with an observation that the report should contain what steps were taken legally, as well as suggestions for the probe in the future.
The bench said this matter would be further considered after winter vacations.
Justice Farooq also wondered what could be legally done to investigate and bring the culprits responsible for the murder to justice. The purpose of the proceedings should be achieved for which the suo motu was taken by the SC, the judge observed.
Moreover, Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamer Rehman told the FCC that a legal assistant agreement had been reached with the Kenyan government and a request had been sent to it for a Special Joint Investigation Team’s (SJIT) visit to the crime scene.
AAG Rehman had informed the SC’s constitutional bench of the same in March this year.

 

Advocate Saad Umar Buttar, the lawyer of Sharif’s first wife Summaiya Arshad, also requested the court to allow the slain journalist’s family to see the SJIT investigation report.
At that, Justice Farooq observed that if the law allowed, the court was with them.
However, AAG argued that the documents could only be seen after the final challan was submitted to the court, also reminding that a fact-finding report on the murder case had become public earlier.
The 592-page fact-finding report, which was furnished before the SC and had become public, concluded that the murder was a “planned targeted assassination” that purportedly involved “transnational characters”.
The investigators had also contested the version put forth by the Kenyan police that Sharif’s killing was the “case of mistaken identity”.
During today’s hearing, when Justice Farooq inquired about the progress regarding the Kenyan government’s investigation, one of the lawyers representing the journalist’s family said the Kenyan High Court had “declared [Kenyan] police officers accused”, but the prosecution against the police in the murder case had not yet started in Kenya.

 

Rather, the Kenyan government had promoted the responsible police officers, the court was told.
Justice Farooq also observed that “undoubtedly, the grief of Sharif’s family cannot be expressed in words, and everyone wants those responsible for the murder to be brought to justice”, but the crime scene was outside Pakistan and the Pakistani government was bound by international laws.
AAG Rehman, too, emphasised that had the crime scene of the murder been in Pakistan, the case would have been solved by now.
He said 47 meetings of the SJIT had been held so far, and the investigation team had recorded the statements of 74 individuals.
Justice Farooq observed that it had been three years since the murder of the journalist, adding that if the proceedings had been carried out, perhaps there would have been no need to take suo motu notice.
The judge then asked who the accused were in this case and whether a first information report (FIR) had been registered in Pakistan.
One of the lawyers replied that it had been three years and “nothing has happened in the investigation yet”. He said he “only wants the state of Pakistan to stand by me before the Kenyan judiciary”.
The lawyer further said that he had approached the Kenyan High Court in his personal capacity, and the government had not even exercised the option of legal assistance from the United Nations.

 

But, AAG Rehman argued that at this level, Pakistan could not go against a friendly country.
He said Kenya was a friendly country that always supported Pakistan in the UN, and therefore could not be offended.
He also confirmed that an FIR of the murder had been registered in Pakistan, in which three people, Khurram, Waqar and Saleh, had been named. But they were absconding, and Interpol had been contacted for their red warrant, he said.
After the signing of the Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) agreement with Kenya, the investigation team should visit the crime scene, the AAG said.
He also recalled that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had a telephonic conversation with Kenyan President William Ruto regarding Sharif’s murder case in 2022.</p><small>2025-12-03 10:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/03141350f9a3bb1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958974/childs-drowning-in-manhole-kmc-report-attributes-death-to-carelessness-of-brt-department-store-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Child’s drowning in manhole: KMC report attributes death to ‘carelessness’ of BRT, department store officials</strong></a><br><p>A report by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) on the drowning of a three-year-old boy in an open manhole in Gulshan-i-Iqbal has attributed the incident to the “carelessness” of officials from the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service and a department store adjacent to where the incident took place, it emerged on Wednesday.
The body of a three-year-old boy who drowned in an open manhole near Nipa in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night was found on Monday, around 15 hours after the incident occurred.
The report by the KMC, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said that the department had received instructions from Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab and the municipal commissioner to initiate an operation for recovering the body of the child from the drain located in front of Chase Departmental Store in Nipa.
It said that following the retrieval of the child’s body, “the site was meticulously inspected to ascertain the exact cause of the drowning”.
According to the report, the inspection found the ongoing BRT construction work at the location to be a “significant contributing factor”.
“Based on reports from the concerned inspector and area residents, the BRT construction has resulted in the severe damage and disruption of the entire drainage system, which runs from Nipa towards Aziz Bhatti Park,” it said.
“It was observed that, at most locations, the drains were covered with temporary two by two feet square covers. Unfortunately, one of these covers was reportedly left open in front of the Chase Departmental Store,” it said.
“It is pertinent to mention that the procedure of covering cleaning pits with two by two feet square covers from Nipa to Aziz Bhatti Park road is a non-standard practice never implemented by KMC at any location,” it said.
It further stressed that BRT service officials had failed to formally notify or obtain clearance from KMC before carrying out excavation work.
“These pits were excavated by BRT officials and subsequently paved over during road construction,” the report said.
In light of those facts, the report concluded that the incident occurred due to the “carelessness of both the concerned BRT officials and the management of Chase Departmental Store” as “neither took adequate measures to secure the open drain”.
It should be mentioned that the construction of the BRT’s Red Line project has turned the city’s major arteries, including one of the busiest thoroughfares, University Road, into construction zones.
The report added that under the monitoring of the deputy commissioner for District East, the assistant commissioner of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, and BRT engineers, the excavated pits had been refilled to maintain the flow of traffic.
The child’s tragic death, particularly the lack of cooperation from relevant civic agencies to launch an immediate search, had angered relatives and area residents, who staged a protest on University Road on Sunday night and again during the day on Monday.
On Tuesday, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials.</p><small>2025-12-03 09:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/031433500e55f01.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958968/pakistan-sends-urban-search-and-rescue-team-to-assist-cyclone-hit-sri-lanka' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan sends urban search and rescue team to assist cyclone-hit Sri Lanka</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has sent an urban search and rescue team to cyclone-hit Sri Lanka, where severe flooding and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah have claimed more than 400 lives.
According to Radio Pakistan, a Pakistan Air Force C-130 aircraft carrying a 47-member team along with 6.5 tons of essential equipment has departed to participate in the humanitarian and rescue efforts.
Speaking at a ceremony in Islamabad for seeing off the aid on Wednesday morning, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik said the urban search and rescue team was being sent to help the people affected by the cyclone in Sri Lanka.
He asserted that Pakistan and its government stood in solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka. The NDMA chairman further said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir had directed “full-out support” to assist those affected.
“Pakistan has committed all-out support since November 28 when the cyclone impacted Sri Lanka,” he said. He said that a Pakistan Navy ship that was in the area was immediately tasked with staying with the Sri Lankan government and evacuating those people stranded in the rains.
The NDMA chairman said that Cyclone Ditwah was “unfortunate and unprecedented” because a decline had previously been observed in hurricanes in South Pacific, with more cyclone-related activity being witnessed in the southern Indian Ocean and southern Arabian Sea.
He said that the urban search and rescue team being sent for assistance was a “very competent military team” that was also experienced in being a key search and rescue partner for other teams in the recent past. He said the team will remain in the field as long as required.
Malik said the government had also dispatched 200 tons of cargo assistance for Sri Lanka yesterday that would sail out from Karachi via a commercial container ship.
“The prime minister has also committed additional support from Pakistan if required,” he added.
Malik also said that climate change was threatening “all nations alike”, saying this was the time to “collate global knowledge” on early warning systems.



Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also spoke at the press conference, extending his “deepest condolences” to Sri Lanka on behalf of the government and people of Pakistan.
He added that another aid consignment would be sent from Lahore, where Sri Lankan planes were to arrive, and an additional consignment would be sent from Karachi.
“Everything that is possible for the government of Pakistan to do will be done,” he assured the Sri Lankan ambassador, who was also present at the ceremony.
“We stand with you in these testing times,” he said.







The development comes a day after the Foreign Office (FO) said that India was preventing humanitarian assistance from being sent to Sri Lanka by air, prompting Islamabad to send aid by sea to the South Asian island.
A statement issued by the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka also said Pakistan’s aircraft were awaiting clearance to fly and accused India of blocking the humanitarian relief operation through “shenanigans”.
It said that since Saturday, the Pakistan Army and the NDMA had been ready for relief operations in Sri Lanka.
“However, for more than two days, Pakistan’s emergency relief mission comprising C-130 aircraft carrying a fully equipped urban search and rescue team, field hospitals, highly trained sniffer dogs and nearly 200 tonnes of life-saving supplies have remained stranded at Noor Khan Air Base in Islamabad due to delaying tactics deployed by India in granting flight clearance to C-130 aircraft,” it said.
PM orders full support for relief activities
Yesterday, PM Shehbaz also presided over a meeting in Islamabad that was called to review relief activities in parts of Sri Lanka affected by Cyclone Ditwah, state broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported.
Outlining details of the meeting, the report said the PM directed relevant authorities to extend full support for the ongoing relief efforts in Sri Lanka.
The report quoted PM Shehbaz as saying: “Pakistan will also play a significant role in the restoration and rehabilitation of flood-affected areas of Sri Lanka after the search and rescue phase”.
He expressed regret over the loss of lives due to the cyclone and said that “we stand with the government and people of Sri Lanka during this crisis”, the report said.
It added that participants of the meeting were informed that an urban search and rescue team from Pakistan would be departing for Sri Lanka on Wednesday (today), along with additional relief supplies to be sent via commercial sea vessels.
The meeting was also told that Pakistan Navy ship Saif had been engaged in relief operations during its deployment in Sri Lanka. A helicopter on board the Pakistan Navy ship rescued a family that had been stranded for five days, the report said.
It further stated that participants of the meeting expressed the “resolve to continue providing relief and rescue assistance in Sri Lanka”.
PM Shehbaz also received a telephone call on Tuesday evening from Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
During the conversation, the prime minister expressed grief over the loss of life and widespread destruction caused by Cyclone Ditwah in Sri Lanka. He conveyed condolences to the people and the government of Sri Lanka, especially to the families who lost their loved ones in the catastrophic floods and landslides that claimed hundreds of lives and displaced thousands of people across the country.
The Sri Lankan president thanked PM Shehbaz for Pakistan’s expression of solidarity with his nation, as well as for the provision of humanitarian assistance. He appreciated that Pakistan was among the first countries to respond after the cyclone.</p><small>2025-12-03 09:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/031417154d14bc9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958972/india-ready-to-change-state-run-security-app-order-after-outcry' target='_blank'><strong>India ready to change state-run security app order after outcry</strong></a><br><p>India is willing to amend an order requiring smartphone makers to pre-install a state-run cybersecurity app, the telecoms minister said on Wednesday, signalling a softening government stance following a backlash over surveillance fears.
Earlier in the day, the main opposition party took the government to task over the issue, while newspaper editorials joined privacy advocates in denouncing the move.
The government is also likely to find itself at odds with phone manufacturers. Apple does not plan to comply with the directive, sources have said.
“We are ready to make changes to the order based on the feedback we receive,” Communications Minister Jyotiraditya M. Scindia told lawmakers in parliament.

 

The Indian government has confidentially ordered companies including Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi to preload new phones with an app called Sanchar Saathi, or Communication Partner, within 90 days.
The government says the app only helps track and block stolen phones and prevents them from being misused.
Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a notice to the parliament that the government needed to clarify the legal authority for “mandating a non-removable app” and called for the house to debate privacy and security risks.
“The grave, serious and real apprehension is also that such compulsorily installed app can have a backdoor, thereby absolutely compromising the data and privacy of the user,” he added.
The notice also called for the disclosure of what independent cybersecurity audits, safeguards and misuse-prevention mechanisms are in place for the app.
Describing the app as a tool to combat the “serious endangerment” of cyber security, the government also ordered that the app be pushed to users via software updates for phones already sold and for manufacturers to ensure that the app is not disabled.
Russian example
Modi’s plan has little precedent, according to industry sources. Russia may be the only other known example.
Moscow in August ordered that a state-backed messenger application called MAX, a rival to WhatsApp that critics say could be used to track users, must be pre-installed on all mobile phones and tablets.
Apple will convey its concerns to New Delhi, noting that it does not follow such mandates anywhere in the world as they raise a host of privacy and security issues for the company’s iOS ecosystem, sources have said.
The plan has become the story of the day on Indian prime time news, with politicians and privacy advocates sparring over its pros and cons.
Major newspapers also chimed in, with The Indian Express saying the directive “raises serious apprehensions of surveillance and intrusion”.
The Times of India said the government must “withdraw the order”, adding that phones “are our private space and one mandatory intrusion by govt raises fears of more in the future”.
The storm of controversy marks the second major time that Modi has faced criticism over issues of privacy.
In 2020, his government also came under fire for a Covid-19 contact-tracing app compulsory for use by office workers. That measure was later diluted to a request when privacy advocates protested.
Downloads for the app have risen, however, with data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower showing a 13 per cent jump in daily downloads on Monday from a day earlier to 78,000.</p><small>2025-12-03 09:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/03123242c20f851.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958967/unga-adopts-resolution-demanding-israeli-withdrawal-from-occupied-palestinian-territory' target='_blank'><strong>UNGA adopts resolution demanding Israeli withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territory</strong></a><br><p>The UN General Assembly (UNGA) on Tuesday adopted a resolution calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied Palestinian territory, with Pakistan, which voted in favour of the text, reiterating that Palestinians must be allowed to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination.
The resolution, titled ‘Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine’, was adopted with 151 countries voting in favour, 11 voting against and 11 abstaining, according to the summary posted by the UN.







According to the summary, the UNGA, through the resolution, “stressed the need for urgent, collective efforts to launch credible negotiations on all final status issues in the Middle East peace process and called for the timely convening of an international conference in Moscow — as envisioned by Security Council resolution 1850 (2008) — to advance a just, lasting and comprehensive peace settlement”.
“The Assembly also called on both parties to act responsibly, urgently reverse negative trends and create the conditions necessary for a credible political horizon and the advancement of peace efforts,” it said.
It also called on Israel to “comply strictly with its international law obligations, including by ending its unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, ceasing all new settlement activities and evacuating all settlers from the occupied Palestinian territory”.
Addressing Israel’s presence in the West Bank, the UNGA “rejected any attempt at demographic or territorial change in Gaza and stressed the importance of unifying the strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority without delay”.
“Additionally, the Assembly called for Israel’s withdrawal from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, the realisation of the Palestinian people’s inalienable rights — primarily the right to self-determination — and a just resolution of the problem of Palestinian refugees,” it said.
World must turn promises into action, says Pakistan’s UN envoy
Speaking during the UNGA debate, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Asim Iftikhar Ahmed said, “Today’s resolution is more than a statement of principle. It is a reminder that the world must now turn promises into action.”







Calling for the realisation of an independent Palestinian state, Ambassador Iftikhar said, “Pakistan’s solidarity with the Palestinian people is steadfast, and we stand with them in their legitimate struggle for dignity, justice and self-determination.”
He further said that voting in favour of the resolution reflected Pakistan’s “long-standing and principled position on this matter”.
The UN envoy further said that the momentum generated at Sharm El-Sheikh, where the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas was signed, must be sustained, particularly by advancing Palestinian-led governance, reconstruction and institution building, emphasising the role of the Palestinian Authority as “central”.
“Peace cannot be shaped without the direct involvement and ownership of the Palestinian people,” he stressed.
He further said that the Gaza ceasefire must be “implemented fully, with no unilateral actions or military activity”, calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.
He added that full humanitarian access should also be guaranteed to the Palestinian enclave.
“With winter approaching and large parts of Gaza destroyed, the population needs sustained life-saving assistance.
“Any obstruction of aid violates international humanitarian law and must not be allowed under any pretext,” he said, adding that reconstruction of the ravaged Gaza Strip should begin without delay.

 

He said that there must be no annexation, no forced displacement, and no division of occupied lands, adding that Gaza’s territorial integrity and its contiguity with the West Bank were fundamental to a viable, sovereign and independent Palestinian state.
He further said that all settlement activity should stop.
“Efforts to change the demographic or legal character of the occupied territories, including around Al-Haram Al-Sharif, are illegal and must end,” he said.
He added that in order to “break the cycle of violence”, it was necessary to end the Israeli occupation of all Arab territories, including in Palestine, Syria and Lebanon.
“The imperative of a political horizon — a credible, time-bound political process anchored in relevant UN resolutions, leading to a sovereign, independent and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-03 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/031152287a03de7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958961/dar-says-multilateralism-under-assault-amid-complex-security-climate-in-south-asia' target='_blank'><strong>Dar says multilateralism ‘under assault’ amid complex security climate in South Asia</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said on Wednesday that multilateralism was “under assault” as stability in South Asia faced various threats, stressing the need for regional cooperation.
Speaking at an event in Islamabad, Dar said, “Multilateralism is under assault and the institutions of global governance are often criticised for the acts of omission and commission of a few states driven by unilateralist impulses.”
Referring to the four-day conflict with India earlier this year in May, Dar said, “In 92 hours, the Indo-Pakistan war had the potential to escalate to far more dangerous levels.”
He said that states had increasingly resorted to the use of force to settle disputes while disregarding international law and the principles of the UN Charter.
The deputy premier noted that “emerging technologies, transnational terrorism and hybrid warfare, including misinformation campaigns, continue to challenge stability”.

 

Dar said that India and Pakistan were “involved in a conflagration” that would have gone toward an “uncontrollable escalation”, adding that an “uneasy and fragile peace persists”.
“Pakistan demonstrated both in resolve and capability to thwart aggression and reinforce deterrence. The concept of a net security provider is buried,” he asserted.
The foreign minister pointed out that “major power competition is a defining feature of our times”, with military, technology, trade, tariff and resource rivalries intensifying.
However, the deputy PM said, Pakistan “opposed bloc politics and zero-sum approaches and consistently stressed the imperative of cooperation rather than confrontation”.
“We have underscored the indispensability of dialogue and diplomacy, of peaceful settlement of disputes, and of international cooperation and solidarity.”
As an elected member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2025-2026 term, Pakistan was “engaged in vanguard efforts to promote international peace and security”, Dar highlighted.

 

Dar also noted that the rise of extremist ideologies, political populism, democratic backsliding and Islamophobia were “negatively impacting the globe and causing upheavals in unprecedented ways”.
“Pakistan envisions a South Asia where connectivity replaces divisions, economies grow in synergy, disputes are resolved peacefully in accordance with international legitimacy and where peace is maintained with dignity and honour,” Dar said.
“We remain ready to work with all willing partners to help South Asia realise its immense potential,” the deputy premier affirmed.
‘War-fighting notions in nuclearised environment’
Speaking further on South Asia, Dar said the region had a complex security environment as it comprised “three geographically contiguous nuclear powers with complicated relationships”.
“Major regional states boast of some of the largest armed forces in the world. There is a continuous buildup of conventional and nuclear arms and regular induction of destabilising weapons systems.
“Strategic stability is delicate, among other things, by some dangerously ill-conceived war-fighting notions in the nuclearised environment,” he added.

 

Pointing out that sustainable peace had eluded South Asia for the past 78 years, Deputy PM Dar said there were “escalating disputes” over resource sharing, particularly on river waters, as exemplified by India’s illegal and unilateral announcement on the Indus Waters Treaty” in April.
“There are pervasive interstate differences and some of the longstanding unresolved political disputes, like Jammu and Kashmir, continue to threaten the peace and stability in the region,” Dar highlighted.
“Sustainable peace in South Asia, however, requires more than maintaining strategic stability,” the foreign minister said, emphasising that a just and lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute remained essential.
Dar stated that the structured dialogue process between India and Pakistan has remained stalled for over 11 years.
“Other South Asian states have had their share of the see-saw relationship with our neighbour India,” he said.

 

“Burden of history, trust deficit, impulses of dominance and hegemony; domestic, political and electoral calculation; rise of populism and hypernationalism; and an ideological inclination for territorial expansionism add multiple layers of complexity to the regional landscape,” the deputy PM added.
He went on to highlight that the Indo-Pacific strategy aimed at China’s containment assigned the role of the net security provider to “one state in the region”, and that “friction” between it and China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which was focused on connectivity, impacted the regional states’ efforts for peace and development.
‘Are we doomed to remain mired in confrontation and conflict?’
Deputy PM Dar also detailed various challenges that South Asia faces, including poverty, inequality, illiteracy, disease, malnutrition, income disparities, food insecurity, natural disasters and the impacts of climate change.
The region fares terribly low on most human development indices. South Asia also remains poorly integrated economically, with intra-regional trade hovering around 5 per cent,” he said, adding that the region was energy-deficient.
“Regional connectivity is woefully inadequate,” he said, pointing out that South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) — the only region-wide platform for economic cooperation — had “largely remained inactive for over a decade”.

 

Dar asked: “We South Asians need to think really hard. Are we doomed to remain mired in confrontation and conflict while other regions progress and prosper?
“The answer should be a clear ‘no’. The cumulative challenges of regional security, economic fragility and climate crisis are simply too grave to disregard.”
The deputy PM asserted that these challenges could not be tackled in an environment of “political fragmentation and fractured regional architecture”.
“To begin with, we must overcome zero-sum mindsets and foster an environment of dialogue, peaceful coexistence, economic interdependence and win-win cooperation,” Dar said.</p><small>2025-12-03 07:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/03123620a274213.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958960/malaysia-says-search-for-long-missing-flight-mh370-to-resume-end-of-december' target='_blank'><strong>Malaysia says search for long-missing flight MH370 to resume end of December</strong></a><br><p>The search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 will resume at the end of December, Malaysia’s transport ministry said on Wednesday, more than a decade after the plane disappeared.
The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people vanished from radar screens on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in one of aviation’s greatest enduring mysteries.
Two-thirds of the passengers were Chinese, while the others included Malaysians, Indonesians and Australians, as well as Indian, American, Dutch and French nationals.
Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has not been found.

 

Kuala Lumpur said in a statement it “wishes to update that the deep-sea search for (the) missing wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 will be resuming on 30 December 2025”.
Maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity will be conducting the search in a “targeted area assessed to have the highest probability of locating the aircraft”, the ministry said.
The latest search in the southern Indian Ocean was suspended in April as it was “not the season”.
It was conducted on the “no find, no fee” principle as Ocean Infinity’s previous search, with the government only paying out if the firm finds the aircraft.
Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, led an unsuccessful hunt in 2018, before agreeing to launch a new search this year.
An initial Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometres (46,300 square miles) in the Indian Ocean over three years but found hardly any trace of the plane other than a few pieces of debris.
The ministry said the latest development underscores its commitment in “providing closure to the families affected by the tragedy”.
Relatives of the victims had voiced hope in February that a new search could finally bring some answers.
When contacted by AFP, relatives of victims were not immediately available for comment.
Aviation mystery
The plane’s disappearance has long been the subject of theories — ranging from the credible to outlandish — including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue.
A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the course of the plane was changed manually.
Investigators said in the 495-page report that they still did not know why the plane vanished and refused to rule out that someone other than the pilots had diverted the jet.
Relatives of passengers lost on the flight have continued to demand answers from Malaysian authorities.
Family members of Chinese passengers gathered in Beijing outside government offices and the Malaysian embassy in March on the 11th anniversary of the flight’s disappearance.
Attendees of the gathering shouted, “Give us back our loved ones!”, with some holding placards asking, “When will the 11 years of waiting and torment end?”</p><small>2025-12-03 06:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24144559107bf0c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955851/the-rise-and-ruin-of-keti-bunder' target='_blank'><strong>The rise and ruin of Keti Bunder</strong></a><br><p>“Ye teesra sheher hai (This is the third city),” Haji Umer Sholani Baloch quipped, watching the Indus’ floodwaters push past Kotri barrage and spill into the sea in Keti Bunder. A native son of this sinking coastline, Umer’s offhand remark captures the tragedy that has unfolded here: entire settlements swallowed, rebuilt, and swallowed again as sea intrusion becomes an unrelenting fact of life.
His words carry an unspoken warning: the Arabian Sea is advancing. And in this fragile delta at the tail-end of the Indus Basin Irrigation System, it has already forced whole communities to uproot and retreat.


A view of a small bazaar in Keti Bunder

Keti Bunder, a once bustling seaport that lies in Thatta district, was once the glittering capital of Sindh. Historical accounts place Thatta at the centre of power from the 14th to 16th centuries, until the arrival of the Mughals. The late Ghulam Mohammad Lakho, who headed Sindh University’s history department, once told me that Thatta served as the capital under the Soomro and Samma dynasties (1335–1520), and remained a port city well into the 18th century. He often quoted the Persian author Mir Tahir Nasyani, who wrote: “The people of Thatta never experienced hunger when it basked in economic prosperity.”
Umer Baloch, too, grew up on stories of a thriving Keti Bunder. It was the same historical memory that resurfaced during the Musharraf era, when then-chief minister Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim proposed reviving Keti Bunder as Sindh’s third seaport. But today, the town faces a different fate including collapsing farmlands, migration, and the slow violence of a sea inching inland.
“The city was known for its rich agricultural landscape,” Umer tells me from behind the counter of his small grocery shop, lit only by a solar panel because electricity is unreliable here. Like many residents of Keti Bunder, he has turned to the sun for power.
The turning point came as the Indus began to thin. Freshwater flows declined, and the sea began to eat its way in. “Sheher iss se pehle aagay hota tha,” he explained, recalling that the town used to lie further ahead. Entire communities, their homes and their businesses, have been pushed inland repeatedly by sea intrusion, forcing them to rebuild their lives on shrinking land.
The conversation is joined by Ghulam Hyder Channa, a small farmer who grows vegetables and cultivates paddy. “The destruction of our region actually began after 1964,” he said. “We once received freshwater throughout the year.”
Wheat, sugar cane, bananas, and the famed varieties of red rice were once staples of undivided Thatta’s fields. But as river flows dwindled, and floodwaters became rare, arriving now only during the monsoon or extreme climate events (like the ones recorded in 2025), the entire landscape transformed.
Channa noted that a rice factory operated in Keti Bunder until 1955 — a reminder that this was once a region dominated by rice cultivation, a water-intensive crop. Today, such mills have largely shifted to upper Sindh or to traditional rice belts like Tando Mohammad Khan.

A port town being undone
“We are living through a crisis,” Hyder lamented. “Imagine the prosperity of a place where people once had enough to offer milk as a soft drink.” Fifty years ago, he added, massive river flows posed the biggest challenge to those living along the banks. “Now it is saline seawater that is swallowing our land.”
Even the road leading into Keti Bunder, he said, acts like an informal dyke. “Water used to stay three to four feet below the road. Now it touches the edges twice a day, rising and falling with the sea.”
Keti Bunder taluka (an administrative unit comprising a number of villages) comprises 31 revenue Dehs. Of these, official figures show that 114,208.32 acres are now under the sea. Collectively, 170,199.39 acres out of 212,752.24 acres across Thatta’s three talukas — Keti Bunder, Mirpur Sakro, and Ghora Bari — have fallen prey to an ever-advancing sea.
Sujawal district mirrors this decline. It also has three talukas: Kharochhan, Shah Bunder, and Jati. According to revenue records, 85 of its 257 Dehs have been overtaken by the sea.
In Kharochhan alone, 400,000 acres out of 595,091 acres (29 of 32 Dehs, or 67 per cent), are under water. In Shah Bunder, 518,895 acres out of 735,706 acres (43 of 92 Dehs, or 46pc) have been lost. Jati taluka fares no better: 405,000 acres out of 879,373 acres (47pc of its land, spread across 13 of 133 Dehs) now lie beneath seawater.
These are not just disappearing revenue units on paper. Each submerged Deh represents uprooted families, forced relocations, and the erosion of entire coastal communities along with their livestock (their only sources of livelihood). Over the years, this encroaching seawater has also contributed to a steep decline in the Indus Delta’s mangrove forests.
“I remember people cultivating red rice in Deh Shahpur Dhakan Wari in the Keti Bunder area. We had to move to Deh Doolho Chholani in 1999 after the catastrophic cyclone,” recalled 70-year-old Haji Mohammad Murugur. “It wasn’t just red rice, even gidra (watermelon) was grown here back then.”
His community member, Fateh Baloch, believed the road connecting Kharochhan once served as a natural dyke. “Without it, the groundwater turned brackish because of sea intrusion into the aquifer,” he said. The advancing seawater, he added, ultimately forced their caste fellows to abandon their homes in Deh Shahpur Dhakan Wari and shift to Deh Doolho Chholani.
Until recently, residents of Keti Bunder relied almost entirely on tanker-supplied drinking water. Relief came only after the intervention of the area’s Sindh Assembly member, Haji Ali Hassan Zardari, regarded as a powerful minister due to his proximity to the sitting president, who initiated a long-delayed piped water project.

“We are getting water supply now,” said Abdul Wahid Memon, chairman of the Keti Bunder union council. He explained that the previous supply line had long been damaged. “Sea intrusion is the main reason the network keeps collapsing. The seawater cuts through the land, creating small creeks and destroying the pipeline. The original line was laid during Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s era,” he said, referring to the PPP founder who contested elections from this region in the 1970s.
According to Wahid, drinking water had become an unaffordable luxury for many households until recently. “As the sea kept advancing, the pipelines corroded and became unusable, so a completely new network had to be installed,” he stated. Water storage ponds have now been rebuilt, and he claimed that “regular supplies are finally reaching every household in Keti Bunder.”
The delta that’s slipping away
Mangrove forests have long been an essential part of Pakistan’s coastal belt, but their decline over the past couple of decades has been stark. In recent years, however, large-scale replantation efforts under various Sindh government initiatives have begun to reverse this trend. These projects have not only revitalised degraded ecosystems but also enabled the government to tap into the global carbon credit market. So far, they have generated around $40 million in carbon credit sales, with projections indicating even greater revenue in the years ahead.
Experts such as Naseer Memon, a consultant on climate change-induced natural disasters who has written extensively on Sindh’s water crises, trace the delta’s ecological collapse to the decline in sustainable flows during the kharif season and to upstream Indus projects that have diverted critical freshwater away from the delta.

“In the past, the Indus would experience a low flood annually and a medium flood every third year. That pattern sustained the delta,” he explained. “But those flows have now drastically diminished.” As a result, estuaries and creeks have begun shrinking, undermining ecosystems and accelerating mangrove loss. “It was the post-Tarbela era, I believe, that set the stage for irreversible damage. The degradation reached its peak over the next 40 to 50 years,” he noted.
An estuary is the wide part of a river where its waters meet the sea, creating mudflats formed by the silt the Indus carries. When the river once brought historic volumes of water, mangroves flourished. But as those flows reduced, so did the mangroves. “These muddy lands are the natural home of mangroves in the river’s estuary. This process is becoming increasingly rare, with only a handful of creeks still receiving enough Indus water to carry it out to sea. That is why the government’s recent carbon-credit project has been launched in a very limited area,” Naseer explained.
He cautioned that we must not lose sight of the mushrooming housing societies and widespread land reclamation along Karachi’s coast. This unchecked infrastructure boom has resulted in bulldozed mangrove belts, while the city’s polluted industrial discharges into the sea have become a major driver of their degradation.
Still, he viewed the Sindh government’s carbon-credit initiative as a step in the right direction, given the rapid decline of green cover in the delta. “We must scale this up, even if the world is still debating it,” he said. To him, it is a model worth replicating in clean energy too as it is an area where Sindh has significant potential.


Under a Sindh Forest Department project, mangroves have been planted in Keti Bunder and are showing significant growth

According to the Sindh Forest Department, four species of mangroves survive in the Indus delta — about 90pc are Avicennia marina, with much smaller shares of Rhizophora mucronata, Aegiceras corniculatum, and Ceriops tagal. Of the delta’s roughly 600,000 hectares, the Forest Department administers 280,470ha (693,000 acres), Port Qasim Authority oversees 64,400ha (159,000 acres), and the Sindh Board of Revenue controls 255,130ha (630,000 acres).
The department acknowledged that the delta’s mangrove ecosystem has been severely degraded in recent years driven by rising coastal populations, overexploitation of resources, industrial pollution, and, above all, the acute shortage of freshwater as the Indus is diverted inland for agriculture. Historically, abundant freshwater and nutrient-rich sediment fuelled a thriving ecosystem. But as the river’s discharge has steadily reduced, the sediment supply to the mangroves has fallen with it, eroding the ecological foundation of the Indus delta itself.
But beyond the environmental strain, an equally striking change has emerged in the way this coastal town keeps its lights on. Keti Bunder is perhaps the only town in Sindh that has effectively bid farewell to the conventional electricity grid.
“We are no longer dependent on traditional power supply from the utility,” said Wahid, referring to the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) network. “In fact, Hesco staff removed the transformers in our area during Imran Khan’s government because of outstanding dues,” he recalled.
In the aftermath, residents collectively shifted to solar energy. “Now almost every household in Keti Bunder runs on solar power,” he said. The town’s relatively mild temperatures, moderated by coastal winds even in peak summer, mean that air conditioners are rare, allowing solar systems to meet daily needs comfortably.
A rare reprieve for Pakistan’s mangroves
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) launched its report, Assessment of Mangroves in Pakistan, at the 29th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November 2024.
The report’s summary stated that it documents changeed in Pakistan’s mangrove cover from 1980 (the baseline year) to the present. It noted that mangroves were heavily exploited in the past for fuelwood, timber and animal fodder. The construction of irrigation structures on the Indus River, particularly the Kotri Barrage in 1955, had major negative environmental impacts on mangroves due to the drastic reduction in freshwater and fine sediment flows reaching the lower Indus delta.


Newly grown mangroves along the Keti Bunder coastline

According to the IUCN report, the first large-scale mangrove rehabilitation efforts began in the 1990s, when 17,100 hectares of mangroves were planted in the delta under a World Bank–supported project using propagules brought from Miani Hor. Continuing mangrove rehabilitation and afforestation efforts have since led to a remarkable increase in mangrove cover, by roughly 300pc in less than 30 years, in both Sindh and Balochistan. The latest mangrove area data indicate that cover increased to at least 285,000ha in 2022, with projections suggesting a total of up to 345,000ha by 2027–2030.
The 2025 monsoon season, now at its end, brought intense flooding to the upper regions, particularly Punjab. However, for the Indus Delta, this deluge carried an unexpected reprieve. Downstream flows at Kotri remained unusually robust, according to an irrigation official, with nearly 30 million acre-feet of water surging past the barrage between April and September, driven by swollen eastern rivers.
As this lifeline finally reached the sea, it rekindled hope across fishing communities from Kotri to Thatta, where livelihoods are tethered to the river’s pulse. For many, the return of the palla fish was simply evidence of what steady flows can restore.
And yet, this may be too little, too late for Haji Umer and the hundreds of thousands like him who have seen this cycle repeat time and again for at least the last five decades. What Keti Bunder needs is a holistic plan for its revival — one that involves steady river flows all-year round, but which appears increasingly unrealistic given the sporadic nature of the water flows courtesy a combination of climate change and bad infrastructure development.

The pause applies to people from 19 countries that were already subjected to a partial travel ban in June, placing further restrictions on immigration — a core feature of US President Donald Trump’s political platform.
The list of countries includes Afghanistan and Somalia.
The official memorandum outlining the new policy cites the attack on US National Guard members in Washington last week, in which an Afghan man was arrested as a suspect. One member of the National Guard was killed, and another was critically wounded in the shooting.
Trump has also stepped up rhetoric against Somalis in recent days, calling them “garbage” and saying “we don’t want them in our country.”
Since returning to the office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.
The flurry of promised restrictions since the attack on National Guard members suggests an increased focus on legal immigration framed around protecting national security and casting blame on former President Joe Biden for his policies.
The list of countries targeted in Wednesday’s memorandum includes Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, which were subjected to the most severe immigration restrictions in June, including a full suspension on entries with a few exceptions.

 

Others on the list of 19 countries, which were subjected to partial restrictions in June, are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
The new policy places a hold on pending applications and mandates that all immigrants from the list of countries “undergo a thorough re-review process, including a potential interview and, if necessary, a re-interview, to fully assess all national security and public safety threats.”
The memorandum cited several recent crimes suspected to have been committed by immigrants, including the National Guard attack.
Sharvari Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said the organisation had received reports of cancelled oath ceremonies, naturalisation interviews and adjustment of status interviews for individuals from countries listed on the travel ban.</p><small>2025-12-03 04:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/03083720f49fbcc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958825/anger-grows-over-manhole-death' target='_blank'><strong>Anger grows over manhole death</strong></a><br><p>• Pleas for FIR against mayor, KWSC, Gulshan town chairman and judicial inquiry land in courts• Parties, civil society demand mayor’s resignation• Celebrities blame failed civic management for tragedy
KARACHI: The widespread outrage that the tragic death of a child, who drowned in an open manhole in Gulshan-i-Iqbal near Nipa, ignited has intensified, with political parties, civil society, and celebrities demanding answers, asking: “Who is responsible for this?”
Three-year-old Ibrahim fell in an uncovered manhole in front of a departmental store near Nipa on Sunday evening. The body was recovered after a 15-hour-long rescue operation on Monday.
By Tuesday evening, the manhole and the connected drain that had been dug up by rescuers to retrieve the body remained open, posing a threat to people.
Many parties held protests against the provincial administration on Tuesday and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign.

Pleas for FIR against mayor, KWSC, Gulshan town chairman and judicial inquiry land in courts

A lawyer moved a sessions court seeking registration of a case against the mayor, Gulshan Town chairman, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) and Red Line contractor over their alleged negligence.

 

Another lawyer filed a petition before the Sindh High Court for a judicial inquiry.
Protests continue
The Jamaat-i-Islami on Tuesday staged a protest near Nipa against Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab and the Sindh government of Pakistan People Party (PPP) over the incident that claimed the life of the three-year-old a day earlier.
The protesters carrying placards and banners chanted slogans against the PPP government and demanded the mayor’s resignation.
Senior party leader and opposition leader in the City Council Advocate Saifuddin said Karachi had been “bleeding for long” and another innocent life had now been lost.
Those responsible, directly or indirectly, should be nominated in the FIR, he said, urging the Sindh chief minister to take serious action.
Also on Tuesday, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders visited the area near Nipa and pointed out that the manhole was yet to be covered. They strongly condemned the inaction of the PPP-led provincial set-up and municipal authorities and demanded that lids be placed on all uncovered gutters across the metropolis.
Meanwhile, the Karachi Restoration Movement (KRM) demanded that an FIR for the alleged killing of Ibrahim be registered against the mayor.
Speaking at a press conference outside the KMC head office, KRM leaders said that as mayor — the “custodian and father of the city” — he must be held responsible.
They announced that their protest camps would continue across the city in mourning for Ibrahim and other children who had died in similar incidents, and that their campaign would continue until a case is registered and the mayor resigns.
Lawyers move courts
A lawyer on Tuesday filed an application before a sessions court seeking registration of a case against the mayor, Gulshan town chairman, KWSC and the contractor of Red Line project over their alleged negligence.
Applicant Advocate Sheikh Saqib Ahmed filed the application under Section 22-A of the Criminal Procedure Code and submitted that the tragic death of the child was not an isolated incident, as at least 23 people have lost their lives in Karachi in 2025 due to falling into open manholes.

 

He stated that after incident, he approached the Aziz Bhatti SHO for lodging an FIR under Section 322 (qatl-e-bis-sabab) of the Pakistan Penal Code against the proposed accused persons but the police refused to register the case.
Meanwhile, another lawyer filed a petition in the Sindh High Court seeking an independent judicial inquiry into the same incident by a district and sessions judge.
Petitioner Gulzar Nigar also sought directives for the mayor and all 25 town chairmen to file detailed reports about uncovered manhole trenches and pits in the city.
The petitioner also asked the SHC to further direct the respondents to formulate and implement a city-wide municipal safety and hazard prevention framework.
Social media outrage
Many X users framed Ibrahim’s death not as an unfortunate mishap, but as the latest example of systemic failure in the city.
One post captured the sentiment bluntly: “Imagine taking your child shopping and walking out with empty arms because the street itself swallowed him… This isn’t an ‘accident’; it is state-engineered negligence. Every open manhole in Karachi is a death trap waiting for another Ibrahim.”
Actor Mahira Khan called out “unimaginable apathy” after watching a “video of a mother helplessly screaming, crying for her baby”. All she could ask was, “Who the hell is responsible for Karachi?”
Sajal Ali criticised the city’s crumbling infrastructure and “collapsing, failed system”, saying she couldn’t imagine the parents’ pain as they waited for a miracle that never came because “there was no one to save him”.
She added that Karachi “carries the weight of millions yet receives no care in return”.
Adnan Siddiqui blamed the authorities who “couldn’t be bothered to cover a manhole”, calling the tragedy a “simple, preventable act of responsibility” and the indifference “as if human life means nothing here”.
Rapper Talha Yunus said, “My heart weeps and my blood is boiling; this is all the result of our government’s incompetence. 2026 is almost here and this is the state of our city. Curse you,” he said, offering condolences to the family.
Naumaan Ijaz also questioned the government’s priorities, saying, “Cameras worth millions have been installed [to give out] e-challans, but manhole covers were not installed to save someone’s life.”

KARACHI: The city commissioner has informed the Sindh High Court that all milk samples collected from Karachi were found unfit for human consumption by the Pakistan Standards & Quality Control Authority.
The report, which was submitted on behalf of the commissioner, also said that presence of formalin in 22 samples and phosphate in eight samples indicated extensive adulteration.
It also maintained that there was no justification for any increase in the price of fresh milk particularly due to decline in consumption of milk related products in winter.

 

Citing the department of agriculture, supply and price, the commissioner and others as respondents, a petition was filed in 2023 by a dairy farmer impugning a notification about the official price of fresh milk fixed in October 2023.
A report on behalf of the commissioner of Karachi was placed before a two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhry in compliance with the last court order.
The report said that the impugned notification as well as subsequent notifications were issued for revision of milk prices after due deliberations with all relevant stakeholders and in pursuant to court directives, various meetings were convened with all stakeholders to finalise milk prices.
However, it maintained that the hygiene practices and safety standards followed by wholesalers/farmers/retailers were hazardous to human health.
The report also said that an exercise of the quality checking of milk samples were conducted across the city on the request of a milk retailer association and the same were sent to the PSQCA for sampling.
“After testing, the PSQCA declared all the samples unfit for human consumption. In the meeting held on 20.11.2025, a representative of the PSQCA stated that due to unhygienic practices adopted by farmers, wholesalers and retailers, the milk was found unfit for human consumption. He further noted that the presence of formalin in 22 samples and phosphate in eight samples, indicates extensive adulteration”, it added.

 

The commissioner in his report further stated that in order to address the issue of adulteration, the milk sellers’ associations were instructed to formulate joint Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure proper hygiene and safety practices and the same were prepared and submitted to the commissioner office on Nov 25.
It maintained that in a meeting held on Nov 20, a representative of the bureau of supply & prices observed that there was no justification for any increase in milk prices at this stage particularly in view of the seasonal decline in the consumption of milk-related products in winter and anticipated that the prices were likely to decrease in the coming month.
Subsequently, the report also said that a fresh notification was issued on Nov 27, fixing the maximum retail price of fresh milk at Rs220 per litre and all the associations were instructed to adhere to the notified rates, maintain proper measurement practices and ensure quality strictly in accordance with the SOPs.
The bench in its order noted that since no one was present for the petitioner to dispute such reports, same were taken on record.
Earlier, the petitioner had stated that he was aggrieved by a notification issued on Oct 3, 2023 whereby milk price in a certain way per litre had been fixed by the provincial authorities which was less than the actual price as per formula devised by the government itself.
In May, the bench had directed the commissioner to consider representations/applications of all the stakeholders, including the petitioner, and provide them a fair and proper hearing and fix the milk price in Karachi in accordance with law and the formula already in existence within a period of one month.
Disposing of the petition, the bench had also directed the commissioner to file compliance report after one month through member inspection Team-I of SHC for perusal in the chamber.

The prime minister said this while presiding over a meeting of the working group on tax reforms. The huddle was part of a series of meetings held with the private sector experts’ working groups for national economic reforms, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.

 

During the meeting, PM Shehbaz said the government held the tax-paying businesses and companies in high regard, adding that only strong businesses and a robust economy could generate tax revenues.
“We desire to make business environment in the country better and more competitive through long-term measures. Since day one, the government has been taking practical steps for export-driven economic growth,” he added.
Ministers Ahad Khan Cheema, Muh­ammad Aurangzeb, Ali Pervez Malik, Minister of State Bilal Azhar Kayani, Special Assistant to PM Haroon Akhtar and senior officials attended the meeting.
Chairman of the Working Group, Sheh­zad Saleem, also attended the meeting.
The meeting was given a comprehensive briefing on tax rates in various sectors, including the corporate sector.
Proposals regarding necessary tax ref­orms to support private sector developm­ent, increase exports and promote investment in the country were presented.
Recommendations were also shared on enhancing the competitiveness of the country’s business sector in the region.
The prime minister also expressed his gratitude to private sector experts for presenting comprehensive proposals, hinting that after due consideration, he would be forming a committee headed by the finance minister to make these proposals actionable.

ISLAMABAD: A division bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday sought relevant record from the Higher Education Commission (HEC) regarding the law degree of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri.
The division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan resumed the hearing of a petition filed by lawyer Mian Dawood. Representatives of the legal fraternity, along with amicus curiae Barrister Zaffarullah Khan, also appeared before the bench.
During the proceedings, the petitioner urged the court to summon the academic record directly from Karachi University (KU), contending that the LLB degree of Justice Jahangiri had been cancelled by the university. The Sindh High Court (SHC), on a petition filed by Justice Jahangiri, had suspended KU’s order regarding the degree’s cancellation.
Chief Justice Dogar observed that since the HEC was the regulatory authority for universities, the bench would first examine the record provided by the commission before issuing any notice to KU.
The court also passed the direction to the HEC to appoint a senior officer for court’s assistance.
At this stage, a representative of the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) drew the court’s attention to the council’s pending application seeking to become a party to the case. The bench assured the representative that the application would be considered and taken up in due course. The matter was subsequently adjourned.
The case has undergone a complex procedural trajectory since it first came before the court on September 16, when the same division bench initially took up the matter. At that hearing, the bench issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be examined.
The decision — issued without prior notice to the respondent — prompted considerable debate within the legal community.
The Supreme Court later intervened, and on September 29 set aside the IHC’s restraining order. A five-member constitutional bench headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan held that no high court could bar a sitting judge from performing judicial duties by granting interim relief.
The apex court emphasised that its ruling was confined to the legality of the interim order and did not touch upon the underlying merits of the petition.
During proceedings before the Sup­reme Court, Attorney General for Paki­stan Mansoor Usman Awan acknowledged that the petition raised an unprecedented legal question, as quo warranto proceedings against sitting judges were exceedingly rare.
He referred to the 1988 Malik Asad Ali judgement, in which the SC held that judges could not be rest­ra­ined from judicial functions through int­e­rim orders. The SC then asked the IHC to decide the objections raised to the petit­ion and proceed in this matter accordingly.

Criticising the rulers, he said a parliament formed through stolen mandates, money or influence had no authority to alter the basic structure of the Cons­t­i­tution.







Mr Achakzai was speaking at a public meeting held at Ayub Football Stadium on Tuesday to mark the 52nd death anniversary of Shaheed Khan Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai. Leaders of various political parties attended the gathering and paid tributes to Khan Shaheed for his struggle against colonial rule, his efforts to strengthen democracy and work for people’s rights.

 

The PkMAP chief, who also heads the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), alleged that in order to secure a majority, state repression was unleashed against the PTI.
He claimed thousands of homes were raided, workers were tortured in police stations and detention centres, and even their dignity was violated. “Despite this, the public gave PTI the mandate, but instead of counting votes, candidates who came third or fou­rth were declared winners through tick-marking, while others were given victory in exchange for millions,” he alleged.
He added that when a majority still could not be achieved, opposition members were disqualified en masse through court rulings and their seats handed to the “fake government.”

“All six militants who attacked the FC fort have been killed by the security forces in the clearance operation,” officials said.
The militants barged into the compound on Sunday night after a suicide bomber detonated herself at the main gate of the fort. Security officials said they had killed three armed men instantly, while three managed to enter the building and take hostages.
The local residents said that the firing stopped on Tuesday morning, after which the authorities stated that the remaining assailants were killed in the late-night operation.
By the time this report went to press, there was no statement from the military’s media wing about the number of casualties in the attack.

These documents were signed during the ongoing visit of a Turkish delegation led by Minister for Energy and Natural Resources Alparslan Bayraktar that had engagements with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik and Power Minister Awais Leghari on Tuesday.
Prime Minister Sharif witnessed the ceremony for the exchange of MoUs and agreements between Turkiye and Pakistan in the field of petroleum exploration, including the deed of assignment for Eastern Offshore Indus-C, the Petroleum Concession agreement Ziarat North Block, the Petroleum Concession agreement Sukhpur-II Block, the Petroleum Concession agreement Deep C block and the Offshore Deep F Block.







The premier underscored the historic and fraternal ties between the two nations and expressed satisfaction at the positive trajectory of bilateral relations and a strong desire and commitment to further expanding cooperation, particularly in the energy sector.

Companies reach exploration pacts for three offshore and two onshore fields

Mr Sharif and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had agreed in June 2022 to expand bilateral trade to $5bn in three years from $1.1bn in 2021. The bilateral trade stood at $1.4bn in 2024.
He also emphasised the importance of expanding collaboration between Pakistan and Turkiye in the energy, petroleum, and mineral sectors, according to an official statement, noting with satisfaction that Turkish Petroleum had joined offshore and onshore exploration activities in Pakistan, marking a major milestone in bilateral energy cooperation.
The prime minister also extended an invitation to Turkish companies to increase their investment footprint in Pakistan’s energy market and called for the need to ensure close coordination between the two nations in view of the fast-evolving regional and global environment. The two sides agreed that a ministerial delegation from Pakistan will visit Turkiye soon to explore further cooperation in these fields.
The Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar informed the hosts that Turkiye was planning to develop additional ventures in partnership with Pakistan, particularly in oil & gas exploration, energy infrastructure, and the mining sector. “To achieve our shared goal of $5 billion in bilateral trade, significant contributions will come from deeper collaboration in energy and mining,” the visiting minister said.
He recalled his participation in the Pakistan Minerals Investment Conference early this year and noted Pakistan’s vast mineral potential. “That is why I have brought a Turkish mining company with me,” he said. “It is a milestone for Türkiye to enter the mining sector with Pakistan, and we look forward to building long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships”, he was quoted as saying.
Managing directors of Mari Energies, Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) gave detailed presentations on their ongoing and planned projects and highlighted promising opportunities for Turkish counterparts for collaboration in oil and gas exploration, including those in shale gas and tight gas and mining and minerals, through joint venture and technology partners.
The visiting delegation also informed Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik that the office of Turkish Petroleum will be opened in Islamabad this month, where ten Turkish nationals will be working along with local staff. The two sides agreed to explore the concept of adopting a unified approach by incorporating a joint trading company for the procurement of petroleum to meet their respective energy requirements.
Both sides agreed to enhance investment facilitation and expand collaboration to unlock the full potential of Pakistan-Turkiye energy cooperation, according to the statement.
During these interactions, Power Minister Awais Leghari also invited Turkish experienced and reputable international private-sector investors in the bidding as Pakistan prepares for the privatisation of the first three Discos, an Expression of Interest for which will be invited shortly.

ISLAMABAD: Amid stiff opposition from both sides of the aisle, parliament on Tuesday passed by majority vote a bill to establish a statutory body to protect and promote the rights of minority communities in the country.
The opposition was based on fears that a provision giving the law an overriding effect would affect the anti-Ahmadiyya ordinance promulgated in 1984.
A motion seeking leave of the House to take up the bill for immediate consideration was opposed by around one-third of the members present in the joint sitting. A total of 160 members voted in favour of the bill while 79 opposed it.







The bill was, however, passed with certain amendments, including the omission of the clause giving it overriding effect and a change to withdraw the suo motu powers earlier proposed for the National Commission for Minorities’ Rights.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar tabled the bill amid outcry from some members, particularly those belonging to the PTI and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F).
However, Mr Tarar made it clear that the bill would neither dilute the anti-Ahmadiyya provisions nor affect any court judgement. “Neither the law nor the Constitution, nor our conscience, allows us to make a proposal that contradicts the Holy Quran and Sunnah,” he remarked.
He said the Constitution and the state had declared Ahmadis as non-Muslims, but they did not accept this and therefore did not fall within the ambit of the bill. He said that when the decision declaring Ahmadis non-Muslims was challenged, the Supreme Court had held that the protection under Article 20 of the Constit­ution was not available to those who did not recognise their non-Muslim status.
The minister said four amendments had been suggested to the original draft and these had been incorporated into the proposed legislation. Saying that minorities were defined as “non-Muslims” in the Constitution, he added: “This is a commission for non-Muslims. Our Hindu, Christian and Parsi brothers are as good Pakistanis as we are.”
Mr Tarar recalled that a 2014 Supreme Court judgement had called for the constitution of a commission for minorities. The matter had landed in the joint sitting after around 10 years, he added, before the debate on the bill began. He underlined that the proposed commission would not have punitive powers and would instead send its recommendations to the government.
“Our Christian, Hindu, Parsi, Sikh and other non-Muslim brothers and sisters deserve a forum to address issues — whether forced conversions, job quotas, sanitation workers’ rights or other matters of dignity,” he said.
Presidential assent
During the debate, PTI Chairman MNA Gohar Ali Khan pointed out that the bill had come to the joint session after the president returned it without giving his assent and with certain objections. “It should be seen why the president did not give his assent to the bill,” Mr Gohar said.
He pointed out that the president had objected to the proposed procedure for the removal of the chairperson and members of the commission on the pattern of superior court judges, as well as to the proposed powers of the commission to create and upgrade posts and maintain independent accounts.
The PTI chairperson also objected to Section 35 of the bill, a point further elaborated on by JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza. He said the section stated that the legislation would have an overriding effect. This meant that, being the more recent law, the bill under consideration, once approved, would have precedence over all previous legislation.
He said the provision should be omitted from the bill in its entirety. Moreover, he also objected to Section 12 of the bill, which he said gave suo motu powers to the commission to be established under the proposed legislation.
“On the one hand, you are taking away suo motu powers from courts. And on the other hand, you are giving this power to commissions,” he said, apparently referring to the recent 27th Amendment that curtailed the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers. If these two provisions were omitted, he said, “we could say that this is acceptable”.
Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas also participated in the debate, saying: “We are here today to give some people their rights, to legislate so that they get more rights.”
He said that at present the biggest issue in Pakistan was the violation of fundamental and civil rights. “There is democracy, (and) you are presiding over a session where there is no opposition … It is not a good sign.”
As he went on to express his grievances on this matter, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq interrupted him and asked him to confine his remarks to the bill.
JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also stated that the Pandora’s box of Ahmadis, who were declared non-Muslim in 1974, should not be opened again. He pointed out that the law minister himself had stated that Ahmadis were non-Muslims and did not follow the Constitution. “But at the same time, I will ask the minister that he should also be aware of the past tricks of Qadianis,” he said.
He also expressed concerns regarding the recently passed 27th Amendment and other legislation passed by the ruling coalition.
Lamenting that no one was taken into confidence regarding the amendment, he stressed that the legislation “will remain controversial”.
Noorul Haq Qadri of the PTI endorsed the position taken by Maulana Fazlur Rehman. He also suggested that the bill be referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology. Abdul Qadir Patel of the PPP also opposed the bill.
Proposed commission
According to the bill, the proposed commission will include representatives from all provinces and minority communities, promoting inclusivity and effective oversight. There shall be a council of the commission to be established under this act. The council shall exercise all powers, perform all functions and do all acts and things assigned to it by the commission.
It shall consist of 18 members, including three Hindu members (of whom two shall be from the scheduled castes); three Christian members; one Sikh member; one member from the Bahai community; one member from the Parsi community; two Muslim members with a human rights background; one representative from each provincial human rights or minorities affairs department; and one minority member from Islamabad Capital Territory.
Upon the commencement of this act, or whenever required thereafter, the National Assembly Secretariat shall, within 60 days, initiate and complete the process for appointing the chairperson.
A four-member parliamentary committee is to be constituted by the National Assembly speaker after consultation with the Senate chairman, consisting of two members from the Senate, preferably non-Muslims, and two members from the National Assembly, also preferably non-Muslims. If the parliamentary committee fails to take a majority decision, the prime minister will appoint the chairperson of the commission.
The joint sitting also passed the National Assembly Secretariat Employees (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (Implem­entation) Bill 2024, the Pakistan Institute of Management, Sciences and Technology Bill 2023, the National University for Security Sciences, Islamabad Bill 2023, and the Ghurki Institute of Science and Technology Bill 2025.

The 70-year-old pope spoke to reporters on the plane at the end of his visit to Turkey and Lebanon — his first trip outside of Italy since becoming head of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics in May.
Leo said anti-Muslim sentiment was “oftentimes generated by people who are against immigration and trying to keep out people who may be from another country, another religion, another race.” He said his visit to Lebanon was intended to show “that dialogue and friendship between Muslims and Christians is possible”.
Leo said stories he heard during the trip of Christians and Muslims helping each other were “lessons … that we should perhaps be a little less fearful”.

The pontiff urges halt to attacks in Lebanon as first trip abroad ends

The US-born pope spent two decades in Peru as a missionary within the Augustinian order.
He has been critical of growing nationalist sentiment in Europe and the United States, and has called for an end to the “inhuman treatment” of migrants under US President Donald Trump.
He has also exhorted followers to reject an “exclusionary mindset” that he said had led to nationalism around the world.
Leo has said the Catholic Church “must open the borders between peoples and break down the barriers between class and race”.
A 150,000-strong mass at Beirut’s waterfront was the highlight of the trip by the head of the world’s Catholics, who arrived in Lebanon on Sunday after visiting Turkey, the start of his six-day trip.
Before landing in Rome on Tuesday afternoon, the 70-year-old pontiff told journalists aboard the papal plane that he looked forward to his next international trip, which has yet to be officially confirmed.
“I hope to make a trip to Africa, which would possibly be my next trip to confirm,” he said, adding that he hoped to visit Algeria “to visit the places where St Augustine lived”.
He also mentioned “Latin Amer­ica, Argentina, Uruguay” as possible visits.
In Lebanon, the US pontiff received a jubilant welcome in a nation beset by a years-long economic collapse and which is still reeling from last year’s war between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah, with many fearing renewed hostilities.
Noting that he was unable to visit all of the country, Pope Leo expressed his “aspiration for peace, along with a heartfelt appeal: may the attacks and hostilities cease”.
Israel has continued to launch stri­­kes on Lebanon despite a Nove­mber 2024 ceasefire with Hezbollah and has escalated attacks in recent weeks — but has not announced any raids during the pope’s visit.
Under heavy pressure, Lebanon’s government has committed to disarming the Iran-backed group, which, however, has rejected the idea.
The pope appealed in his mass “to those who hold political and social authority here and in all countries marked by war and violence. Listen to the cry of your peoples who are calling for peace”.
He said that “the Middle East needs new approaches to reject the mindset of revenge and violence, to overcome political, social and religious divisions, and to open new chapters in the name of reconciliation and peace”.
Later, as he prepared to depart from Beirut airport, he declared, “While weapons are lethal, negotiation, mediation, and dialogue are constructive. Let us all choose peace as a way, not just as a goal!”
Before the service, the pope prayed at the site of a catastrophic port explosion on August 4, 2020, which killed more than 220 people, injured over 6,500, and devastated swathes of the capital.
Near a monument to those killed, with the facility’s devastated grain silos visible nearby, the pope spoke with survivors and relatives of victims, many of whom were holding photos of their loved ones.
“I was deeply moved by my brief visit to the Port of Beirut,” the pope said from the airport.
“I carry with me the pain, and the thirst for truth and justice, of so many families, of an entire country,” he added.
Nobody has been held to account for the Beirut port blast, one of the world’s largest ever non-nuclear explosions.
Cecile Roukoz, a lawyer whose brother died in the explosion, expressed gratitude for the pope speaking up for the victims.
“We need justice for our brothers and all the victims of this explosion,” she said.

The cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Faisal Rat­h­­ore late on Monday, also decided to provide Rs2.9 billion in equity to Bank of AJK to help it obtain the scheduled-bank status from the State Bank of Pakistan, establish women police stations at divisional headquarters, and fix the number of administrative departments at 20.
Among other key decisions, the cabinet approved uniform domestic and commercial power tariffs for 5kV and 60kV consumers, waived Rs139 million in outstanding electricity dues, and sanctioned the establishment of education boards in Muzaffarabad and Rawalakot.
The cabinet decisions were shared with the media by Senior Minister Mian Abdul Waheed and Minister for Forests Sardar Javed Ayoub on Tuesday.
Mr Ayoub said the government would initiate the health card scheme immediately after finalising an agreement with State Life Insurance. A committee led by the health minister would identify hospitals and submit its report within five days, he added.
On education reforms, he said staff shortages would be addressed under a rationalisation formula of one teacher per 25 students. New posts would be created where required, while surplus teachers would be shif­ted within the same union council. Institutions would also be upgraded or newly established on a need basis.
A separate committee headed by the higher education minister wou­ld present its recommendations on the revival of student unions within five days. He said a finance minister-led committee would also submit proposals within five days to reduce taxes on property transfers. 
A committee has also been for­m­­ed for the rehabilitation of Mangla Dam-affected families, which would submit its report within five days, after which land allotment for the affectees would begin.
The cabinet further approved a revised scheme for the Revenue Complex in Muzaffarabad, the launch of solid waste management projects in nine district headquarters, and procurement of machinery for the Communications and Works Department in Poonch.
Projects earlier cleared by the Cabinet Development Committee (CDC) also received approval. These included the 500kW Pathyali and 500kW Haryala hydropower projects in Muzaffarabad, costing Rs495.305 million and Rs499.250m, respectively, and the 220-metre Gulpur bridge in Kotli at a cost of Rs824.369m.

She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
The meeting took place under strict supervision and without mobile devices, she added, declining to provide further details.
In a separate talk with the media, flanked by Aleema Khanum and PTI leaders, Uzma said: “When I met him, he was very disturbed and very angry. He said that they are keeping him and Bushra Bibi in such mental torture in a small room, he said he was not allowed to meet anyone for four weeks … he said this mental torture is worse than physical torture.”
She added the PTI founder was even more disturbed when informed about the treatment meted out to his sister, Noreen Niazi, a few weeks ago.
Uzma said Imran also gave a message to the party to support the candidates nominated by PTI’s Salman Akram Raja and Hamid Khan for the Pakistan Bar elections, along with ensuring that Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas were notified as the opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate.
She further said Imran had also tasked the PTI with supporting and following any call by the two nominees for the opposition leaders. Uzma added that Imran further directed that Shahid Khattak be made the parliamentary leader of the opposition.
“About Sohail Afridi, he said that he is very happy and supports him completely.”
In a strict warning for PTI members seen fraternising with those from the government, she said Imran gave one direction: “My party members who play on both sides of the wicket have no place here and are the Mir Jafar and Mir Sadiq of my party.”
Meanwhile, Aleema announced the party’s future course of action, saying the sisters would now sit outside Adiala every Tuesday and would not move until six family members and just as many lawyers were allowed to meet Imran. Party members would continue their own sit-in every Thursday, she added.







The development comes following the PTI’s protests outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the Adiala jail today against restrictions on the former prime minister’s visitation rights. The party had claimed that the ex-premier’s family and party leaders had been denied access to him for the last several weeks.

According to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, no one had been allowed to meet Imran or his wife, Bushra Bibi, since October 27.
Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code was imposed in Islamabad and Rawalpindi ahead of PTI’s protests. It is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
Tallal’s warning
Earlier today, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said that compliance with Section 144 would be ensured in Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
“Whether they come to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) or the Adiala jail, action under Section 144 would be carried out without any discrimination,” Chaudhry warned while speaking to the media in Islamabad. He particularly urged PTI-backed parliamentarians to “abide by the law”.
Chaudhry said Section 144 had been imposed in the twin cities “in light of intelligence reports”.
He further linked the matter to terrorism, saying: “Terrorists look for instances [which they can use] to spread fear and make headlines; be it [a] political gathering, courts or important places or offices.”
The state minister further said that terrorists used social media applications, particularly for communication. “They use these apps with virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their identities and locations.”
So, Chaudhry continued, the interior ministry had decided that it, along with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), would find a solution to this problem.
“The PTA has issued a detailed press release regarding the registration of VPNs,” he said, adding that the government did not want IT-related businesses to be affected by this measure. “But, it has to be done at any cost to ensure that mobile and social media apps are not used for terrorist activities.”
The state minister also recalled that the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had ruled that state resources were not to be used for political activities.
So, “we hope that the KP (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) chief minister, who repeatedly comes to Islamabad and Pindi, will not use state resources for his political activities”, he added.
The state minister asserted that “KP police will [only] be used in KP for security”.
“If they come to Islamabad or any other province, prior intimation will be required in a proper manner. If any state resources are used without any intimation, action will be taken and criminal cases will be registered against government employees [concerned], in line with the PHC’s directive,” he warned.
He further stated that Section 144 had been imposed for the protection of lives. “An incident has occurred in Islamabad, and threats still exist,” he said.
The minister pointed out that the PTI had staged protests in Rawalpindi, demanding meetings with Imran, several times.
The administration, he said, was closely monitoring the situation to ensure that citizens’ lives and peace in the city were not affected. “To ensure that such gatherings of protests do not cause any loss.”
Here, he also recalled the violent protests of May 9, 2023, which were held after Imran’s arrest. “They will do it themselves just like on May 9, and entire Pakistan will face the consequences. They will do it themselves, and will then deny [any responsibility].”
He maintained that KP Chief Minister had no authority to demand a meeting with Imran.
Reiterating that Section 144 had been imposed in light of terror incidents. “And I hope that terrorists will not be facilitated — that such gatherings are held where they could carry out [terror] activities with ease and spread fear in Pakistan. We have made foolproof security arrangements, and God willing, no such incident will take place. But, we need the cooperation of other political parties and civil society to ensure this.”
He again warned Section 144 would be “strictly imposed” and action would be taken in light of the PHC order if any provincial public office holder used state resources for political activities.
To a question about whether Imran would be shifted from the Adiala jail to a prison in Islamabad, Chaudhry said: “It is too early to say anything.”
The minister said that the prison’s construction was in its last stages, after which its staff would have to be trained. “That jail is not being constructed for just one prison. It was needed in Islamabad as prisoners from the federal capital had to be sent to jails elsewhere,” he added.
He also said if the authorities were provided all the necessary documents and “tracking number, Imran’s sons would be issued visas in the next 24 hours”.
Security beefed up in Pindi
Rawalpindi police said effective arrangements had been made to ensure law and order in the city. In a statement, police said at least 3,000 security officers were performing traffic and other security duties.
“Section 144 has been imposed across Rawalpindi for three days which restricts unlawful assembly, rally and protest,” it said.
It added that Rawalpindi police would deal strictly with those who breached the law and it would ensure the implementation of Section 144 to maintain law and order in the city.
Reports from the twin cities said pickets were set up on routes leading to the Adiala jail. Meanwhile, roads leading to the Red Zone, which houses key government buildings, from Serena Hotel and the National Database and Registration Authority office were also reported to have been blocked.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser said on Monday the opposition lawmakers from both houses of parliament will protest outside the IHC before taking their demonstration to Adiala jail in Rawalpindi. “It has been decided to hold protests because IHC has failed to implement its order and the Adiala jail administration is not willing to implement the court orders,” he said.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and other leaders will stage protests in the twin cities, Qaiser said.
Last week, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had staged a sit-in outside the prison after he was barred from meeting Imran for the eighth time.
Imran’s sisters had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier.
The PTI also alleged that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters after they, along with other party members and supporters, held a protest outside the jail on November 19.
There were also speculations about his health, but the government and the PTI leaders had said that he was in good health.</p><small>2025-12-02 17:47</small></div><hr>
