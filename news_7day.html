Latin chants and English prayers echoed through the chapel, where Leo was elected the first US pope by the world’s Catholic cardinals six months ago in front of frescoes by Michelangelo depicting Christ delivering the Last Judgment.
Charles, supreme governor of the Church of England, was seated at the pope’s left near the altar of the chapel as Leo and Anglican Archbishop Stephen Cottrell led a service that featured the Sistine Chapel Choir and two royal choirs.
 






Although Charles has met the last three popes, and Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI travelled to Britain, their previous encounters never included joint prayers.
‘A healing’
The King and Queen Camilla are on a state visit to the Vatican, marking the closening ties between the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion, five centuries after their turbulent separation.
“There is a strong sense that this moment in the extraordinary setting of the Sistine Chapel offers a kind of healing of history,” Anglican Rev. James Hawkey, canon theologian of Westminster Abbey, said.
“This would have been impossible just a generation ago,” he said.  “It represents how far our churches have come over the last 60 years of dialogue.”  Cottrell, the Ang­lican Archbishop of York, stood in at the Sistine Chapel service for Sarah Mullally. She was recently announced as the first woman to serve as Archbishop of Canterbury, the spiritual head of the Anglican Communion, but will not take the role until next year.
The split between the Catholic Church and the Church of England was formalised in 1534, after Pope Clement VII refused to annul King Henry VIII’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon.
Henry’s desire for a male heir—and a new wife who might provide one—was the immediate catalyst, but other factors were also at play, involving the English crown’s seizure of church assets and the growth of Protestant ideas in England. As England swung between Cath­olicism and Protestantism during the reigns of Henry’s daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I, hundreds of Catholics and Prot­estants were executed for their faith, often burned at the stake.
Special title, seat
Charles and Camilla, who visited the Vatican earlier this year to see Pope Francis, also had a private meeting with Leo on Thursday morning. At home in Britain, Charles’ disgraced brother, Prince Andrew, is engulfed in a deepening crisis over abuse allegations and his ties with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The King will travel in the afternoon to Rome’s Basilica of St Paul Outside the Walls, one of Catholicism’s four most venerated churches, where Leo has approved giving him a new title of  “Royal Confrater”, or brother, at the connected abbey.
Charles will also be gifted a special seat in the apse of the basilica. The wooden chair, reserved in the future for use only by British monarchs, is decorated with the king’s coat of arms and the ecumenical motto  “Ut unum sint” (That they may be one).
Bishop Anthony Ball, the official Anglican representative to the Vatican, said the honours  “show the commitment that both of our Churches have to working for a shared future.”
Ties improving since 60s
The Church of England is one of 46 autonomous churches across some 165 countries that together form the Anglican Communion.
The Catholic Church, which has 1.4 billion members, and the Anglican Communion, with 85 million members, have been improving ties since the 1960s.
The teachings of the two traditions align on many major issues, but the Catholic Church does not ordain women and generally does not allow priests to marry.

DSP Muhammad Yousef Reki had gone missing while travelling from Noshki to Quetta last weekend.
According to police, DSP Reki was kidnapped by unidentified armed men who intercepted him in the Karginah area.
Security forces launched a search operation in the area, but were unable to trace the missing officer.
An official of the Mastung administration said locals informed the  authorities about the presence of an unattended body. Police rushed to  Kirdgab and took the body into custody. It was later shifted to Civil Hospital in Quetta for legal formalities.

Police officer had disappeared while travelling from Noshki to Quetta at the weekend

Kirdgab police station SHO Ghulam Sarwar said the slain officer had sustained multiple bullet injuries to the head and other parts of the body.
Police said DSP Reki had been abducted five days earlier, on the night between Saturday and Sunday, while travelling from Noshki to his home via Mastung and Surab. Unidentified armed men intercepted his vehicle near Kirdgab and kidnapped him along with his car.
 
 

Moments before his abduction, DSP Reki reportedly called his wife and informed her that armed men had stopped him, after which contact was lost. Initial investigations revealed that the officer was travelling alone, without security, and had taken a shorter, less-populated, mountainous route instead of the National Highway. His vehicle has not yet been recovered.
Authorities said the motive behind the kidnapping and killing remains unknown, and no group has claimed responsibility for the murder.
Funeral held in Quetta
The funeral of the martyred officer was held at the Fayyaz Sumbal Police Lines in Quetta. It was attended by Balochistan Governor Jaffar Khan Mandokhail, provincial minister Mir Asim Kurd Gello, 12 Corps Commander Lt Gen Rahat Naseem Ahmed Khan, Inspector General Muhammad Tahir Khan and several civil and military officers.
After the funeral, the body was sent to his native town for burial.
Governor Mandokhail expressed condolences to the slain officer’s family and assured them of the government’s full support and solidarity.

She feels she will not be staying in the job for long. Her salary is only Rs20,000 per month. She thinks she will be married soon and might not work afterwards. Or if she has to work, she will look for a job that pays better. Low- to medium-fee private schools, which constitute the overwhelming majority of private schools operating across Pakistan, mostly pay teachers around Rs18,000 to Rs24,000 per month. Keep in mind that the minimum wage for unskilled work in Pakistan is now around Rs40,000 per month.
Durdana is a teacher at a high-fee private school. Her salary is around Rs60,000. She feels this is not enough. But both her children are enrolled in the same school at half the tuition fee (employee discount). She is likely to stay in teaching till her children have moved beyond school level.
Salaries for teachers in the public sector are better than they are in the private sector. Primary school teachers make more than the minimum wage, and those in grade 17 or above take home over Rs100,000 a month. But, for a teacher to treat teaching as a long-term prospect, even this amount may not be enticing for a lot of young people. Though teachers are covered under the minimum wage legislation across almost all provinces, or should be, most of the private sector does not pay them the requisite minimum. Punjab’s education minister has said a number of times that teachers in the private sector are paid in accordance with the law. His interpretation is that since teachers work fewer hours than other workers, their salaries are determined accordingly. Clearly, the minister is just covering for the fact that the government does not want to or is unable to ensure the minimum wage for teachers.
 
 

School timings are from 8am to 2.30pm these days. Schools require teachers to be present at school from 7.30am to 3pm. This makes it a 7.5-hour workday. The regular workday is eight hours. How is teachers’ worktime shorter? In addition, most teachers take grading and class preparation home. They have to as they do not have time to do it during their teaching hours. In fact, most school teachers I know, put in 10-odd hours. The minister is plainly wrong or is just pretending.

Why would the best minds in the country want to turn to teaching?

But leaving the hours issue aside, if teachers are to be paid so little, what should they do to supplement their income? Clearly Rs20,000 to Rs40,000 is not enough for a household. Should teachers take on another job in the many ‘free’ hours, à la the minister, that they have on their hands. Teachers know how to teach, but if they start coaching or giving tuitions in the evening, people aren’t happy with that either. They don’t want the ‘coaching’ or ‘tuition’ culture for their children.
Even the government discourages that for public sector teachers. So, what should teachers do? Get a non-teaching job in the evenings? We have about two million teachers working in Pakistan currently. What sort of evening jobs should they look for? Youth unemployment for Pakistan is at its highest level historically. The economy is not and has not been growing by much in recent years. Are there enough (second) job opportunities out there?
 
 

There is a strong gender angle to this discussion as well. Women are, probably, a majority in the teaching profession in Pakistan. It is, likely, the only profession that has a female majority. Pakistan has one of the lowest female labour force participation rates internationally and even in the region. Teaching is one profession a lot of women are able to join and which is more ‘acceptable’ in our context. How do women who work as teachers — and it is one of the few professions that is acceptable for women to work in — find jobs in sectors other than teaching to make a decent level of income? This cannot and will not happen.
Currently, it seems, the state, the governments in power and the people, are quite comfortable ‘exploiting’ the labour of educated women in Pakistan for the education sector. We have (created) a context in which most women are not able to work, by design or default, in many other sectors. Teaching seems to be an acceptable option for many females and their families. This creates a supply level that allows the private sector to pay market clearing wages but these wages are below the minimum wage level. We do not allow this to happen in other areas irrespective of the conditions of supply and demand. But here we are happy to do that and some even try to justify it.
What is not thought through is that if teaching does not even give minimum wage returns, why would the best minds want to become teachers. They do not. But if we do not get the best minds to be teachers, how will we prepare the next generation of Pakistanis? How will teaching become a profession if returns are so low? On the one hand, governments do not want to ensure even minimum wages, while on the other, some provinces are talking about licensing teachers. Licensing is supposed to control and improve quality, but if teachers cannot even get the minimum wage, how can licensing help create quality?
Monetary returns in teaching are low. Most private sector teachers do not make the minimum wage level and the government seems to be happy with it, not wanting to disturb the current equilibrium in the market. The equilibrium works for schools and the government but does not work for teachers, for improving the quality of education or making teaching an attractive profession. But governments seem to be happy trading off short-term calm at the cost of medium- to long-term benefits of decent opportunities in teaching. The teachers, mostly women, are the ones paying the cost and will continue to be ‘exploited’, it seems, for the foreseeable future.

The Snow Leopard Foundation estimates only 167 of these animals are left in Pakistan.—File photo

GILGIT: Snow leopards living in Pakistan are severely threatened by climate change, poaching, and habitat fragmentation, experts have warned after a first-of-its-kind scientific survey that revealed only 167 of these rare animals remain in the country.
The research by the Snow Leopard Foundation of Pakistan (SLF) provides a scientific population estimate for the species, which was previously counted on the basis of suggestions and assumptions, said Dr Hussain Ali, the paper’s author and a senior regional programme manager at the SLF.
Conducted between 2010 and 2019, the study used extensive camera trapping over 40,000 square kilometres, with 1,000 cameras and 1,200 genetic samples.
Climate change, along with shifting weather patterns, threaten the snow leopard’s habitat, Dr Ali said, a sentiment echoed by other conservationists.
“Less snowfall and drought at the mountains force snow leopards either to migrate or move to low-lying areas,” he added. This movement results in snow leopards attacking livestock, and “in retaliation, owners attempt to kill the snow leopard”.
The snow leopard is considered a key indicator of the health of mountain ecosystems, which are a vital source of water for billions of people. Threats to its survival signal a danger to the entire region.
Increasing human activity, including the development of roads and infrastructure near their habitat, also threatens the elusive cat, Dr Ali added.
Meanwhile, the United Nations marked International Snow Leopard Day on Thursday, releasing new videos showing the elusive mountain cat in Pakistan’s northern ranges and other parts of its habitat, while urging stronger efforts to protect the species from extinction.
 
 

In messages to Pakistan and 12 other range countries, the UN said snow leopards remain at high risk of extinction in the wild, even though they were reclassified as “vulnerable” — rather than “endan­gered” — on the Intern­ational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List in 2017.
In 2024, the UN General Assembly declared Oct 23 as International Day of the Snow Leopard to promote international and regional cooperation for conserving the species, which plays a vital role in maintaining the ecosystem of high mountain regions.
“The snow leopard is not just a symbol of wilderness; it is vital to the health of our mountain ecosystems,” the UN said, urging local communities, park authorities, and conservation groups in Pakistan to intensify protection efforts.

The agreement aims to strengthen economic cooperation and deepen bilateral relations between the two countries.
The three-day Sixth Session of the Pakistan-Qatar Joint Ministe­rial Commission (JMC) on Econo­mic, Trade and Technical Coopera­tion concluded on Thursday. The protocol was signed by Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan and Qatar’s Minister of Commerce and Industry Sheikh Faisal bin Thani bin Faisal Al Thani.
 






According to an official statement, the protocol commits both sides to implementing the Amir of Qatar’s earlier pledge to invest $3bn in Pakistan. A key focus is strengthening direct engagement between the QIA and Pakistan’s Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) to streamline investment processes and create an enabling environment for Qatari investors. The SIFC will serve as the leading platform for facilitating investment in priority sectors.

Deepens cooperation in transport, health, education, culture, solidifies bilateral relations

In the transport sector, both sides agreed to explore cooperation on public transport systems, including rail, buses, and metro networks, with a focus on adopting green technologies such as electric, autonomous, and hydrogen-fuelled vehicles. Pakistan invited Qatari investors to participate in road infrastructure projects, such as the Kharian-Rawalpindi Motorway (M-13) and the Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway, through public-private partnerships or direct financing.
The delegations also discussed the need for an MoU on land transport and port cooperation. In civil aviation, the two countries agreed to continue collaboration and hold bilateral aeronautical authorities’ consultations in the first quarter of 2026 to enhance aviation ties.
Education and health cooperation formed a major part of the talks. The two sides discussed the draft Second Executive Programme for 2025-2028 to promote collaboration in education, higher education and scientific research. They also considered a draft MoU on Technical and Vocational Education and Training between Qatar’s Ministry of Education and Pakistan’s National Vocational and Technical Training Commission to strengthen technical skills development.
In health, the protocol calls for activating an existing MoU through a joint working committee to implement joint programmes, attract Pakistani medical professionals to Qatar’s Hamad Medical Corporation and facilitate the exchange of medical expertise. It also includes exploring mutual recognition of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to improve market access.
Cultural and media cooperation was another area of focus. Both countries agreed to develop a ‘Year of Culture’ programme featuring collaborations in film, museums and heritage. The protocol also provides for fast-track visa processing and streamlined procedures for cultural and academic exchanges.
Agreements were signed between the Qatar News Agency and the Associated Press of Pakistan to promote news exchange, joint productions and media training. Cultural exchange programmes between Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation and Qatar Radio were also prioritised.
In communications and information technology, both sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in e-government, smart cities, digital economy and digital transformation. Collaboration between Qatar Science and Technology Park and Pakistan’s Special Technology Zones Authority will be pursued to support startups and promote innovation.
The protocol also emphasised the deployment of skilled Pakistani workers to meet Qatar’s labour market needs. Both sides agreed to expedite a new MoU on labour cooperation, building on the 1987 employment agreement, and to share best practices in workforce management.
In their concluding remarks, both ministers reaffirmed their commitment to expanding trade and investment ties, stressing the importance of leveraging existing relations to promote joint ventures and economic growth.

Sheikh Saleh bin Fawzan bin Abdullah Al-Fawzan was named the grand mufti of Saudi Arabia by royal decree, the official SPA news agency reported late on Wednesday.
Fawzan, who has made controversial comments on child marriage and the Shia school of thought, succeeds the conservative Abdulaziz al-Sheikh, who died in September after more than 20 years in the role.
In 2011, Fawzan publicly opposed a minimum age for marriage, after the justice ministry moved to stamp out the practice of marrying off pre-pubescent girls.
He was appointed on the recommendation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler who has ushered in sweeping reforms in a bid to diversify the economy of the world’s biggest oil exporter.
 
 

However, the deeply conservative kingdom has sought to modernise since Prince Mohammed was appointed heir to the throne by his father King Salman, now 89, in 2017.
Under his direction, the power of Saudi Arabia’s influential clerics has diminished. Many women now forgo veils and head-coverings in urban centres, non-Muslim tourists are allowed, and since 2018, women can legally drive.
Umar Karim, a Saudi policy expert at the University of Birmingham in England, said the appointment was in line with “the established Saudi religious policy of selecting the most senior and well respected Aalim (religious scholar) within the council as the successor”.

Special rules under international law have been developed over a long period to impart fixity and certainty to international borders. Clearly demarcated borders are the hallmark of international peace and security. Disrespect or denial by one country of the borders of another amounts to indirect denial of the integrity and independence of the latter. The Charter of the United Nations clearly prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.
After the recently held peace talks in Doha between the Pakistan and Afghan Taliban governments, Qatar’s foreign ministry on Sunday issued an ‘amended’ press statement regarding the results of peace talks between the two neighbours. In the earlier statement issued on Saturday, optimism was expressed that the ceasefire would de-escalate tensions along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. However, presumably strong objections were raised by the Afghan government against the use of the word ‘border’ in the press release. The press statement was reissued and the word ‘border’ omitted.
Kabul does not act as a responsible state when it denies the status of the Durand Line as the international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The amendment of the press release is yet another example of the obduracy of the Afghan government, which has its genesis in the early 1950s. Despite the passage of time, Afghanistan has not been able to come up with any historical or legal argument in favour of its amorphous and unsubstantiated denial except for the assertion that the Durand Line treaty of 1893 was executed ‘under duress’ by the then Afghan king. So let’s take a look at the ‘duress’ argument.
 
 

The Durand Line Agreement was not executed in isolation by only one ruler of Afghanistan. It was affirmed and reaffirmed, without protest, successively by several kings of Afghanistan in treaties executed between the British and Afghan governments in 1919 (Treaty of Rawalpindi), 1921 (Kabul Agreement) and 1930 (reaffirmation of the Kabul Agreement). Under customary international law and Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969, every state is obliged to perform its international obligations in good faith. The Afghan government contends that the VCLT, which came much after the Durand Line Agreement, cannot retroactively create international obligations. However, this line of argument is not correct because the VCLT is well recognised as falling in the category of what are referred to as ‘codifying treaties’, ie, treaties that document long-standing customary norms. They are to be contrasted with ‘law-making’ treaties, which enact a new law for the first time such as the ones relating to nuclear and chemical non-proliferation. Therefore, VCLT does not adversely affect the standing of treaty of the Durand border. Rather, it endorses it.

Afghanistan does not act as a responsible state when it denies the status of the Durand Line as the international border.

Under Article 62 of the VCLT, a state is bound to uphold boundary treaties made by its predecessor. Pakistan upon independence in 1947 became bound to uphold the Durand Line Agreement signed by the British with the then Afghan ruler. Likewise, the Vienna Convention on the Succession of States in Respect of Treaties, 1978, recognises international borders inherited through the succession of states. Here also the objection to retroactivity fails as both these articles codify customary international law, which binds all states irrespective of the existence of treaties. Further, the VCSSRT merely re-enacts the well-respected old principle of ‘uti possidetis juris’, which recognises the borders of newly independent states as valid. The principle also has received the judicial stamp in the case titled the ‘Superintendent Land Torkham vs Zewar Khan’ decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan and reported as PLD 1969 SC 485.
 
 

Further Pakistan’s admission to the UN as a member state and the recognition of its boundaries unconditionally by the global body shows the acceptance of the Durand Line as the international border. In 1949 and 1950, the recognition on behalf of the British Crown and the House of Commons of the Durand Line Agreement as creating the international border was yet another factor in Pakistan’s favour. The US likewise recognised the Durand Line as the international border in 1956, and reiterated its position in 2012.
UNSC Resolution 1267/1999 reaffirms the Durand Line as the de jure international border. The USSR and US recognised it as the international border in the Geneva Accords of 1988. Afghanistan itself has recognised implicitly the Durand Line as the de facto international border when it comes to transit, trade and issuing visas for international travellers, etc. The much-hyped mantra of expiry of the Durand Line Agreement in 1993, like the expiry of the Convention on the Extension of Hong Kong Territory after a century, is misplaced as the Durand Line Agreement, contrary to the Hong Kong Convention, does not contain any such stipulation.
Afghanistan also claims easement rights over the Durand Line for its citizens and objects to the fencing of the border by Pakistan. However, both claims are unfounded as they find no mention in the Durand Line Agreement. Pakistan, of course, is acting in furtherance of its objects of national security by fencing the international border and no objection thereto can be taken under international law. The US likewise unilaterally fenced its border with Mexico under the Secure Fence Act, 2006, enacted by the US Congress. Easement rights are only reserved for tribes that straddle both sides of the international border. Other citizens of Afghanistan cannot claim to enjoy easement rights.
Above all, the Afghan transit arrangement itself serves as evidence that the Durand Line, for decades, has been recognised by Customs and other state authorities of the two countries as the international border.
Since the argument that the Durand Line is not an international border is not tenable under international law, it is no wonder it has not found support from any country except Afghanistan.

However, the tariff cut will not reduce electricity bills for Karachi residents, as end-user prices would remain the same under the government’s uniform national tariff policy.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (Nepra) decision from earlier this week had reduced the average tariff from Rs39.97/kWh — set by the regulator in May of this year — to Rs32.37/kWh.
The earlier decision had allowed the power utility to offset its losses and other overheads through a ‘loss recovery allowance’ that would be built into their tariff, starting from 6.75pc in FY24 and gradually declining to 3.5pc by FY30.

Nepra’s move will not impact consumers’ bills, applies to power utility’s recovery loss allowance, other overheads

However, the latest decision — issued on a series of review motions filed by various stakeholders, including the Power Division — has “significantly altered its prior determinations in a manner that… is not sustainable for the company and will have far-reaching consequences for its stakeholders, including consumers”, KE claimed.
While the Power Division hailed the power regulator’s decision on KE’s multi‑year tariff as a landmark move for Karachi residents, the power utility warned the move could have an indirect impact on consumers.
In a cautiously worded statement, KE Chief Executive Officer Moonis Alvi said that the management was making every effort to avoid direct impact on customers. “However, there may be some indirect impacts, which are being mitigated,” he added.
 






Mr Alvi said that the decision regarding the company’s multi-year tariff (MYT) for FY2024-2030 would also significantly impact the company’s financial position, ultimately affect its operations and performance.
The KE chief said that Nepra had made significant changes and reductions in the utility’s approved multi-year tariff, which was approved in May after more than two years of public hearings, consultations and feedback from all stakeholders.
“This kind of change after more than two years of detailed consultation and analysis is unusual and could impact the company’s investments, planning and long-term sustainability,” he added.
Mr Alvi said KE was closely reviewing the impact of the amended decision to determine how to continue operations effectively and minimise the potential impact on customers.
The company’s board of directors has been fully briefed on the amended decision, and consultations were underway to determine the future course of action, he said.

Although this year’s tally of 30 cases so far is less than half of last year’s 74, the persistence of transmission shows how fragile these gains remain. While more than 200 countries and territories have eradicated polio, Pakistan remains among the last two where it still cripples children — a distinction no country should bear with pride.
The latest case, a 12-month-old boy from KP’s Torghar, brings the province’s total to 19, followed by nine in Sindh and one each in Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan. Sewage surveillance in September found the virus in 44 of 127 samples — proof that, despite improving trends, it still circulates in high-risk zones.
 
 

The virus’ persistence is not due to a lack of effort. Last week’s national vaccination campaign was aimed at reaching more than 45m children. Yet the attacks on those performing this national duty remind us that the challenge is not merely medical.
In recent weeks, a security officer escorting a vaccination team in Swat was gunned down, another in Nowshera met the same fate, and a guard in Balochistan was killed protecting vaccinators. Each death underscores the peril in which Pakistan’s front-line health workers operate — and the limits of state protection for them.
The country’s approach, though vast in scale, still struggles with three persistent gaps. First, uneven coverage — especially in the aftermath of the floods — leaves pockets of unvaccinated children where the virus survives. Second, vaccine hesitancy continues to fester in certain communities. Third, an over-securitised model of vaccination that, while necessary, often intimidates those it seeks to reassure.
 
 

Pakistan has the infrastructure, campaigns and partners — domestic and international — to eradicate polio. But the final mile will need less bulk-mobilisation and more precision, trust and community ownership. Pakistan must recommit to three priority goals: reach every child — no exceptions, change minds as well as deliver drops, and integrate security with access and trust. For this, the aim must be zero missed children in every district and union council. Surveillance must translate into targeted action where the virus still shows up. It will not die unless it is deprived of hosts entirely.
The polio programme must also invest in community engagement. Campaigns must be co-produced with Lady Health Workers, local imams, teachers, and village elders. They must make the vaccination drive their own mission — safeguarding the neighbourhood’s children. Furthermore, building relationships with communities must be prioritised so that the presence of health workers is welcomed rather than feared.
The last mile will not be crossed in policy meetings but at the doorstep — where a vaccinator knocks in Torghar, where a register is marked in Sindh, and where a mother finally says yes.

• Talal says TLP acted like an extremist group, reneged on commitments
• Rana Sanaullah says ban aims to ‘purge anti-state, terrorist elements’, not erase party
• PM unveils three-year ‘Roshan Economy’ power tariff of Rs22.98 per unit
ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to proscribe the religion-political group Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), days after nationwide protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad.
The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on a proposal from the Punjab government. A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after the meeting said the ban was “unanimously” approved by the federal cabinet.
The interior ministry briefed the cabinet on what it called the TLP’s “violent and terrorist activities”, stressing that the organisation had repeatedly incited unrest across the country.
The group, founded in 2015 as a movement, turned into a political party in 2016. It was previously banned by the PTI government in 2021 after violent protests.
The interior ministry informed the cabinet that the 2021 ban on TLP was lifted after six months on the assurance that it would refrain from violence. It added that the current ban on TLP stemmed from its reneging on those guarantees.
“In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP,” the PM Office statement said.
A source privy to the meeting told Dawn that participants were asked to share their views on TLP’s “firebrand” approach, and “almost everyone was of the view that the organisation must be barred from paralysing the country time and again”.
The cabinet meeting was held on a single-point agenda, and no other items were discussed, the source added.
Later, speaking on Geo News, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said the intent behind a ban was not to eliminate a party but to purge it of “anti-state and terrorist elements”.
He said no one had any issue with the TLP’s religious views. But whenever the party staged protests in the past, it “led to violence and loss of life, such as the 2017 Faizabad demonstrations”.
In separate remarks to Geo News, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the TLP had acted like an extremist group and violated its prior commitments.
Mr Chaudhry said the government had no other option in light of reports submitted by the Punjab government than to ban the party. He said the interior ministry had summoned reports from all provinces about the party’s conduct in the past decade regarding its involvement in violence, targeting of minorities, incitement of sectarianism and other such matters.
Legal framework
Under the country’s legal framework, the Nat­ional Counter-Terrorism Aut­hority (Nacta) maintains lists of proscribed persons and groups. Those designated as terrorists or associated with terrorism face severe consequences, such as travel bans and financial sanctions.
 
 

Individuals may also be placed on the Fourth Schedule of the ATA for monitoring.
Historically, proscribed entities have included the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Hizbut Tahrir, Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Jaish-i-Mohammad and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA).
The provincial government can request a ban on a party, as in the case of the TLP.
In turn, the federal government has the power to refer this request to the Supreme Court by declaring that the party “has been formed or is operating in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan”, according to Article 17(2) of the Constitution.
However, according to analysts, the final decision to ban a political party rests with the Supreme Court under the Constitution.
“The federal government shall, within 15 days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, whose decision on such reference shall be final,” the article says.
The government can also invoke Section 212 of the Elections Act 2017 to seek the dissolution of a political party.
Any declaration is subject to adjudication by the Supreme Court.
Electricity package
Separately, PM Shehbaz announced a three-year “Roshan Economy Elec­tricity Package” offering additional electricity to the industrial and agriculture sectors at a subsidi­sed rate of Rs22.98 per unit from Nov 2025 to Oct 2028. The current tariffs of around Rs34 for industry and Rs38 for agriculture will be reduced to Rs22.98 for both. During a meeting with a delegation of experts from the industry and agriculture sectors, as well as representatives of the business community, he said the fiscal impact would not be passed on to domestic consumers or other sectors.
Appreciating the efforts of Power Minister Awais Leghari and his team, he said lowering energy costs was essential to competitiveness, exports and job creation.

• Official sees no chance of opening border before Istanbul summit on 26th
QUETTA / ISLAM­ABAD: Border closures between Pakistan and Afghanistan for over 12 days on Thursday have pushed up prices of essential goods in both nations, with tomatoes now costing five times more in Pakistan since fighting broke out between the two neighbours this month and transit trade coming to a halt.
Border crossings bet­ween the two countries have remained closed since Oct 11, following ground fighting and Pakistani airstrikes across their 2,600km frontier that killed dozens on both sides in the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.
“We have no information when the border with Afghanistan will be opened,” a senior official of the Chaman administration said.
The official added that even though the traders and the people involved in import and export are demanding the reopening of the border, but no decision has been made so far.
All trade and transit have been blocked since the fighting erupted, Khan Jan Alokozay, the head of the Pak-Afghan Chamber of Commerce in Kabul, told Reuters on Thursday.
“With each passing day, both sides are losing aro­und $1 million,” he said.
Fresh fruit, vegetables, minerals, medicine, wheat, rice, sugar, meat and dairy products make up most of the $2.3 billion annual trade volume between the two countries.
The prices of tomatoes, used extensively in Pak­i­s­tani cooking, have jumped by over 400 per cent to around Rs600 per kg. Apples, which mostly come from Afghanistan, are also seeing a price surge.
Around 5,000 containers of goods are stranded on both sides of the border, said a Pakistani official at the main Torkham border crossing.
He said there was already a shortage of tomatoes, apples and grapes in the market.
‘No chance’
A senior official said that there is no chance of opening the border before the meeting between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul on Oct 26 where both sides will decide future plans in view of the recent clashes.
“The trade and business activities between Pakistan and Afghanistan will be restored under what will be the outcome of the Istanbul review meeting,” Imran Khan Kakar, a leading businessman, told Dawn.
The border authorities opened the Friendship Gate for a limited time for the repatriation of Afghan refugees, who were reaching Chaman from different areas of Balochistan and Karachi.
The activities at the immigration section of Federal Investigation Age­ncy (FIA) was also suspe­nded and those who were going to Afghanistan using visas and passports were also stuck in Chaman due to the border closure.
“Over 5,000 Pakistanis are stranded in Spin Boldak as they visit there and Vesh on a daily basis for their small businesses,” an FIA official said.
Clearance suspended
According to customs officials, more than 1,009 trucks carrying transit cargo, exports, and imports goods are stranded because of a suspension in customs clearance owing to “unprovoked aggression” from Kabul.
The disruption follows the suspension of customs clearance for both exports and imports at key border crossings — including Tor­k­ham, Ghulam Khan, Kha­rlachi, and Angoor Adda — effective from October 12 and at the Chaman border from October 15.
According to the officials, the suspension was prompted by unprovoked aggression from the Afghan side that posed serious security risks to customs inspectors and personnel stationed at these posts.
An official announcement from the FBR confirmed that around 500 vehicles carrying transit trade cargo remain stra­nded at the Torkham and Chaman border crossings.
The transit consignments, imported by Afghan traders, are awaiting customs clearance.
On the bilateral trade front, congestion remains acute at the Torkham border, where 255 export vehicles and 24 import vehicles are currently held at the terminal.
An additional 200 trucks, stranded along the Jamrud–Landi Kotal road, are awaiting clearance.
In contrast, the Chaman border has comparatively lighter traffic, with 25 export vehicles and five import vehicles still pending processing.
In light of prevailing security concerns, the FBR has confirmed that the majority of customs personnel have temporarily relocated to headquarters.
However, a limited number of inspectors and support staff remain stationed at each border post to resume clearance operations promptly once conditions stabilise and trade routes reopen.
To mitigate disruption and ensure the continued availability of essential consumer goods in the market, the collectorates of the Northern Region have proactively cleared import consignments that had arrived prior to the border closures.

Earlier in the day, the PSL management had acted following repeated public statements by Tareen criticising the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and PSL, and had sought a public apology if the latter wished to avoid legal proceedings.
The move marked a significant escalation in the simmering tensions between the board and the Multan franchise.
Tareen then posted a video on social media platform X on Thursday night, in which he could be seen holding what seemed to be the legal notice sent by the PSL management, saying he wanted to apologise but demanded better of the league organisers.
Making sharp remarks targeted the PSL management, he ended the video by tearing up what seemed to be the legal notice he had received.
Tareen had stoked the fire in April when he shared a podcast clip on X questioning the PCB’s pre-season build-up, writing: “How is PSL 10 bigger and better? Same games, same teams – what’s new? Fed up with hollow words. PCB had time to plan innovations, but we’re repeating last year. Our biggest brand deserves more. Explain the vision!”
A few days later, he sought to clarify his stance amid backlash from other franchise owners, posting: “I love PSL — it’s a MADE-IN-PAKISTAN success story we all benefit from. My words were about pushing for real growth, not negativity. Salman Naseer & PCB team are giving their all. Let’s unite as owners to back them and elevate the league. No more stagnation!”
However, the tensions persisted. In July, Ali renewed his criticism in response to a PCB post-season debrief video celebrating PSL 10’s “success”.
He wrote: “Applause? You must be kidding. TV ratings down, attendance plummeting, digital engagement slowing — yet we’re celebrating? PCB, wake up. PSL deserves better planning, not self-congratulation. Time to fix these issues before it’s too late.”
A PCB source said the repeated statements “damaged the league’s reputation and violated the terms of the agreement”.
The board’s notice reportedly outlines specific clauses of the franchise agreement that were breached. PCB officials maintained that the board remains committed to upholding the integrity and professional standards of the PSL.
A Multan Sultans spokesperson told Dawn on Thursday that “the PCB last month sent a legal notice, which is not a notice of termination”.
“The notice threatens termination of our franchise agreement and a lifetime blacklist of Mr Tareen from owning any cricket team in the future,” a statement by the franchise said later.
“Every statement he (Tareen) has made has been in the best interest of the PSL, urging the league to aim higher and do better.
“For the PCB management to treat constructive criticism as a crime is outrageous. It demonstrates the pettiness of the current management and clearly shows that the PSL is not open to questions or accountability, even from those who have given the most to make it stronger.
“Silencing honest feedback is not how great leagues are built,“ it read.
The development comes amid growing concerns over franchise-board relations within the PSL framework, with several stakeholders calling for greater transparency and consistency in the PCB’s dealings with team owners.</p><small>2025-10-24 02:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24072408671be8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950908/punjab-under-fire-for-choking-wheat-flow-to-two-provinces' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab under fire for ‘choking’ wheat flow to two provinces</strong></a><br><p>• KP says ‘ban’ on inter-provincial movement of commodity violates Article 151(1)
• Warns of shortages, risks to food security
• Sindh accuses Punjab of halting supply of wheat seed; seeks PM’s intervention
PESHAWAR / KARACHI: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Thursday asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs are disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province.
Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed.
In a letter to his Punjab counterpart, KP’s food secretary said that lifting the ban was critical to res­t­oring a smooth supply chain, stabilising market prices, and safeguarding his province’s food security.
The letter said KP, a wheat-deficient province, depends on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its requirements — roughly 14,500 tonnes per day.
“The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,” it read.
While KP acknowledged Punjab’s recent permit-based allocation of 2,000 tonnes of flour for transport to KP, it termed the quota “insufficient” relative to actual requirements.
KP lamented that despite repeated communications from its chief secretary, food secretary and director of food to Punjab, the ban continued to remain in force.
“This situation is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 151(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which guarantees freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country,” the letter said.
The letter added that the issue was raised at a high-level meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, on Oct 17 regarding the Interim Wheat Policy 2025, where the smooth inter-provincial movement of wheat and its products was emphasised.
“The KP Flour Mills Association has repeatedly conveyed grave concerns over the rapidly depleting wheat stocks, cautioning that the non-availability of wheat and flour may arise in the coming days if the restrictions persist,” it said.
On Wednesday, KP Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi condemned Punjab’s “ban” on wheat and flour transport to KP, calling it a violation of the Constitution and “an attack on the rights” of the people of the province.
Chairing a meeting, he directed the food department’s high-ups to write a letter to the Punjab government demanding immediate removal of all restrictions to ensure free movement of wheat and its flour across the provincial borders, according to a statement from the chief minister’s secretariat.
Mr Afridi said that hiding behind political differences to deprive citizens of necessities was unacceptable.
Officials told the meeting that KP consumes about 5.3 million tonnes of wheat and flour annually, of which only 1.5 million tonnes are produced locally, while the remainder is sourced from Punjab and other provinces.
Seed supply issues in Sindh
Meanwhile, despite an apparent ceasefire between coalition partners, tensions between the PPP and PML-N have escalated once again after the Punjab government allegedly halted the supply of wheat seed to Sindh — a move that sparked strong protests from the PPP, which has called for the prime minister’s urgent intervention.
Nisar Khuhro, PPP’s Sindh chapter president and chair of the provincial Public Accounts Committee, accused both the federal and Punjab governments of being “anti-Sindh” and urged PM Shehbaz to take immediate notice of the issue.
“As the wheat sowing season begins, the Punjab Agriculture Regulatory Authority and the Food Department, acting on the Punjab government’s directives, have reportedly halted the supply of hundreds of thousands of wheat seed bags to Sindh,” he said.
“This disruption has raised serious concerns that wheat cultivation across vast areas of Sindh could be severely affected. If Punjab does not resume seed supply to Sindh immediately, the province’s overall wheat production could decline significantly,” he added.
On Wednesday, the PPP’s questions over the wheat procurement mechanism following the recent announcement of the minimum support price (MSP) at Rs3,500 per 40 kilograms created quite a stir between the two sides and drew a strong reaction from the Punjab government.
In May, the federal food minister told the National Assembly that Passco was being abolished as part of market deregulation. The policy has since been reversed under a national wheat policy, but procurement modalities remain contested.
Against this backdrop, PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza asked at a press conference on Wednesday who would procure wheat and under what mechanism following Passco’s “abolition”. He said farmers were at the mercy of middlemen paying below the MSP.
The remarks drew a strong response from the Punjab government. Provincial Information Minister Azma Bokhari urged the PPP leadership to take notice of Mr Murtaza’s remarks, warning the PML-N would otherwise respond in kind.
With the dust barely settled, the PPP’s leadership from Sindh has now raised fresh objections, accusing the PML-N of depriving the province’s farmers of their due rights.
“It’s a grave injustice to Sindh’s farmers and tantamount to economic exploitation of growers and haris [farm labourers],” said Mr Khuhro. “Pakistan produces about 552,000 tonnes of wheat seed annually, out of which Punjab-based seed companies account for roughly 516,000 tonnes. However, the Punjab government is reportedly preventing these companies from selling their wheat seed to Sindh.”
According to the PPP leader, Sindh’s farmers and dealers have already paid Punjab-based suppliers for the seeds, yet the supply has been blocked. He described the move as “anti-Sindh” and discriminatory against the province’s farmers.

On Wednesday, Israeli lawmakers voted to advance two bills on annexing the occupied West Bank, barely a week after US President Donald Trump pushed through a deal aimed at ending Israel’s two-year military offensive in the Gaza Strip.
Trump has warned that Israel would lose its crucial backing from the United States if it annexes the occupied West Bank.
In a statement issued today, the FO condemned “in strongest terms the approval of the Israeli Knesset of two draft laws aiming to impose a so-called ‘Israeli sovereignty’ over the occupied West Bank”, calling it a “blatant” violation of international law.
 






The joint statement was signed by 14 countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, and Turkiye.
The FO noted that the move violated the “United Nations Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 2334, which condemns all Israeli measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character, and status of the occupied Palestinian territory since 1967, including East Jerusalem”.
The statement also welcomed the “Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 22 October 2025 on Israel’s Obligations in and in relation to the Occupied Palestinian Territory.”
It noted that the Israeli move to annex the West Bank went against the “advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, which affirmed the illegality of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and the invalidity of settlement construction and annexation measures in the occupied West Bank,” the statement said.
The FO further stated that the court ruled that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory”.
In the ruling, the “court reaffirmed Israel’s obligation under international humanitarian law to ensure that the population of the OPT, including Gaza, has the essential supplies of daily life, and to agree to and facilitate by all means at its disposal relief schemes on behalf of the population, including through the United Nations and its entities, particularly the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)”.
“The Court confirmed Israel’s obligation to respect the prohibition on the use of starvation, recalling Israel’s blocking of aid into the Gaza Strip and reaffirmed the prohibition of mass forcible transfer and deportation, recalling that this also includes inflicting conditions of life that are intolerable,” the statement read.
It continued: “The court further reaffirmed the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and independent statehood, recalling that Israel’s territorial claim over East Jerusalem has been declared ‘null and void’ by the Security Council, which includes the ‘Law to Cease UNRWA Operations in the Territory of the State of Israel’, which purports to apply to East Jerusalem.”
The countries, in the statement, warned “against the continuation of Israel’s unilateral and illegal policies and practices.”
The statement also called on the international community to “shoulder its legal and moral responsibilities and to compel Israel to cease its dangerous escalation and unlawful measures in the occupied Palestinian territory, and to uphold the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to establish their independent and sovereign state on the lines of June 4, 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital as the only path toward achieving a just and comprehensive peace that ensures security and stability in the region”.</p><small>2025-10-24 02:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23230432f2879a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950802/undefeated-rizwan-slays-yet-another-indian-opponent-with-first-round-win-in-mma-bout' target='_blank'><strong>Undefeated Rizwan slays yet another Indian opponent with first round win in MMA bout</strong></a><br><p>The record remains unblemished, the streak grows more formidable. MMA fighter Rizwan “The Haider” Ali, reinforced his status as kryptonite for Indian adversaries, systematically dismantling Rana Rudra Pratap Singh “The Rajput” to secure a first-round technical knockout at the Absolute Championship Akhmat in Dubai’s Agenda Arena on Thursday.
The victory marks his fourth win over an Indian opponent in two years — a perfect finishing rate he has maintained against all of them, keeping his pristine professional record intact at 11-0.
The tension was palpable from the start, a fuse lit long before the first punch was thrown. It manifested in a telling moment during the fighter introductions: Rizwan and Rudra Pratap (12-3) refused a glove touch, a silent acknowledgment that this was more than sport. This was conflict.
From the opening bell, the clash was charged with the weight of the cross-border rivalry. Rudra Pratap, a 28-year-old force from Lucknow, shot for an immediate takedown, aiming to ground the aerial assault of the “Pakido Warrior”.
But Rizwan, a fortress of technique and power, sprawled perfectly, stuffing the attempt and seizing control.
He turned his opponent into the cage, a knee to the gut serving as a brutal punctuation before he slammed Rudra Pratap — who fought mostly at the bantamweight category — to the canvas.
What followed was a cold, systematic dissection. Rizwan advanced through Rudra Pratap’s defenses with calm precision, securing a full mount — the king’s throne in ground combat.
Rudra Pratap — who has 11 finishes — tried to cling close, to survive the storm, but Rizwan, hailing from Rawalpindi, is a master of creating chaos in confined spaces.
He carved out room for his heavy hammer fists to descend. The concussive blows were a prelude to the final, relentless ground-and-pound that forced the referee’s intervention with just under two minutes left in the first round.
The victory was a statement of resurgence. The chip on Rizwan’s shoulder from a controversial split-decision win over Egypt’s Adham Mohamed was shattered, replaced by the definitive clarity of a violent finish.
As the arena roared, Rizwan climbed the cage, arms raised to a legacy he alone is building. The significance of the moment was further amplified when UFC superstar and middleweight champion Khamzat Chimaev, a revered figure in the combat sports world, greeted him cageside, offering a champion’s congratulations that signaled Rizwan’s arrival on the global radar.
But in a moment that transcended sport, Rizwan then turned from the adulation and embraced his fallen Indian rival, a powerful testament to respect that exists beyond the fray.
The pre-fight snub made the post-fight grace all the more profound. The warrior from Pakistan had spoken once again, not with words, but with the thunder of his fists.</p><small>2025-10-23 19:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23220832cceb95c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950800/islamabad-sp-passes-away-after-apparent-self-inflicted-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad SP passes away after apparent self-inflicted shooting</strong></a><br><p>A superintendent of police (SP) posted in Islamabad passed away on Thursday after sustaining critical injuries from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot near Serena Chowk.
He was rushed to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), where he succumbed to his injuries.
A police official told APP that police teams reached the site immediately after the incident, cordoned off the area, and collected forensic evidence. Senior police officials launched a detailed investigation into the circumstances surrounding the event.
According to police sources, the SP was a respected officer of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) and had recently assumed charge as SP Industrial Area, Islamabad.
A day earlier, the police official visited a doctor of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), at his private clinic, and informed the medical practitioner that he was having suicidal ideation.
Psychiatrist Dr Sultan Muhammad, who checked the SP, suggested he take leave and get admitted to Pims, but the deceased informed him that he had applied for leave, but his application was not approved.
The doctor also asked the police official’s wife to keep his service weapon, knives, and any other objects that could be used for self-harm out of his reach.
The deceased police officer held an MPhil in governance and public policy from the National Defence University and had previously served in several districts of Balochistan, where he gained experience in security management, community policing, human rights protection, counter-terrorism and crisis response.
He was known among colleagues for his professionalism, humility and commitment to public service. Authorities said the matter was being handled with the utmost sensitivity and a formal inquiry was launched.
Addressing the media with Islamabad police chief Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said all the facts of the case would be verified and only after that would any official comments be made.
Rizvi said the incident took place around 4:30pm today with the SP on his way back to his office from Constitution Avenue.
Questioned about the alleged link of a phone call before the incident, Rizvi said it was “too early” to come to any conclusion, adding that the matter was being looked at from all angles and the CCTV footage showed no external involvement of any kind.
Chaundhry also told the media to avoid any speculation, saying the family of the deceased should be respected.</p><small>2025-10-23 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23221611e83b66d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950801/coas-munir-reaffirms-pakistans-commitment-to-enhanced-military-cooperation-with-egypt-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir reaffirms Pakistan’s commitment to enhanced military cooperation with Egypt: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to improved defence and military cooperation with Egypt, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.
Pakistan and Egypt share long-standing bilateral relations. In May, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi reaffirmed Egypt’s desire for stronger bilateral ties with Pakistan in a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Last week, Pak­istan and Egypt agreed to enhance cooperation in the maritime and industrial sectors, aiming to foster joint ventures and promote their blue economies.
According to military’s media wing, in a meeting with Egyptian defence officials, Field Marshal Munir discussed “matters of mutual interest, regional security situation and bilateral defence cooperation”.
The army chief, during his official visit to the country, called on the Egyptian Minister of Defence and Defence Production General Abdul Maged Saqar and Chief of Staff of the Egyptian Armed Forces Lieutenant General Ahmed Khalifa Fatehi.
“Field Marshal affirmed that Egypt is a brotherly country and cooperation between [the] two states will not only benefit the people of both the states but will also contribute towards achieving peace and stability in the region,” ISPR said.
“The visit is aimed at enhancing military cooperation and defence collaboration between the two brotherly countries,” the statement added.
“During the visit to the Ministry of Defence, Field Marshal was warmly welcomed and presented with the Guard of Honour,” added the ISPR.
The statement added that the army chief also visited and laid a floral wreath on the Memorial of the Unknown Soldier and the grave of former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat.
During the visit, Field Marshal Munir also met the Grand Imam of Al Azhar Sheikh Ahmed El Tayab. “The grand Imam shared his views on challenges faced by the Muslim Ummah,” the statement read.
“COAS highlighted the need to eradicate extremist ideologies and contorted interpretations of Islam.”
In June, Field Marshal Munir undertook a visit to the US and met with US President Donald Trump, marking the first time a US president had hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House unaccompanied by senior civilian officials.
In August, COAS Munir was honoured with a prestigious war medal by Azerbaijan’s defence minister, according to ISPR.</p><small>2025-10-23 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/232201534976dc7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950799/trump-says-would-pull-us-support-if-israel-annexes-west-bank' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says would pull US support if Israel annexes West Bank</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump said Israel would lose its crucial backing from the United States if it annexes the occupied West Bank, in a Time magazine interview published on Thursday.
Trump’s comments, which Time said were made by telephone on October 15, were published as both Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned against any annexation.
“It won’t happen. It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. And you can’t do that now. We’ve had great Arab support,” Trump said when asked what the consequences would be for Israel if it did so.
“Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.”
Trump also told Time that he believed Saudi Arabia would join the Abraham Accords, which normalise relations between Israel and Arab states, by the end of the year.
“Yes, I do. I do,” he said when asked if he thought Riyadh would join in that timeframe.
 






“See they had a problem. They had a Gaza problem and they had an Iran problem. Now they don’t have those two problems,” he said, referring to Israel’s military onslaught in Gaza and Iran’s nuclear programme, which US airstrikes targeted earlier this year.
Trump then said that he would be “making a decision” on whether Israel should release high-profile Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti as part of peace moves.
Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — was among the Palestinian prisoners Hamas wanted to see released as part of the Gaza deal, according to Egyptian state-linked media.
Trump has dispatched a stream of top officials to Israel in recent days to shore up the fragile Gaza ceasefire he brokered earlier this month.
But as Vance wrapped up his three-day visit and Rubio arrived, Israeli lawmakers advanced two bills paving the way for West Bank annexation. A bill applying Israeli law to the West Bank, a move tantamount to annexation of a territory that Palestinians seek for part of a future independent state, won preliminary approval from Israeli lawmakers on Wednesday.
Vance said it was a “very stupid political stunt and I personally take some insult to it”. As Rubio left Washington he warned Israel against annexing the West Bank, saying steps taken by parliament and settler violence threatened the Gaza truce.
Vance said that Trump would oppose Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank and it would not happen.
Vance spoke after Rubio warned that steps toward annexing the territory, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war, could endanger Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict, which has yielded a shaky ceasefire so far.
“The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of President Trump is that the West Bank will not be annexed. This will always be our policy,” Vance said at the end of a two-day visit to Israel.
Far-right opposition sponsored vote
The vote was sponsored by a far-right opposition lawmaker who until recently was in the ruling right-wing coalition, and backed by ultranationalists National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. The reading passed by a vote of 25-24 out of 120 lawmakers.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office later said that the vote was a “deliberate political provocation” that aimed to sow division during Vance’s visit.
Netanyahu’s Likud party did not vote for the bill, it said, adding that without its support, attempts to legislate the annexation of the West Bank were “unlikely to go anywhere”.
The US has long been Israel’s most powerful and staunch major power ally and the Trump administration is particularly close to Israel with considerable sway over its leadership.
Netanyahu has repeatedly ruled out Palestinian statehood. His cabinet has considered the idea of annexation as a response to major Western allies recently recognising a Palestinian state to put pressure on Israel to stop its devastating military onslaught in Gaza, but appeared to shelve it after Trump objected last month.
Senior White House officials and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner have been visiting Israel seeking to keep alive the 13-day-old truce between Israel and Hamas after two years of fighting that has upended the Middle East.
Rubio is due to arrive in Israel on Thursday.
The US State Department said Rubio was visiting Israel to support the implementation of Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan, which envisages eventual reconstruction and stable governance in the enclave along with possible steps towards Palestinian statehood.
Vance told reporters at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport that he “feels pretty good” about the Gaza ceasefire after holding talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, other senior officials and the military.
 
 

Israel and Hamas have reiterated their commitment to the US-mediated ceasefire while trading accusations of repeated violations since it took effect on October 10.
The deal has so far seen the release of captives held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel, a handover of bodies of some deceased people and a partial pullout of Israeli troops.
West Bank settlements
There are hundreds of thousands of people living in Jewish settlements across the West Bank. The United Nations and much of the international community consider the settlements illegal under international law.
Israel’s government cites biblical and historical connections to the West Bank, territory that it regards as disputed, and opposes any steps towards Palestinian statehood.
The settlements are a highly volatile issue that has for decades loomed as a major obstacle to Middle East peace, as they fragment territory Palestinians want for a viable state.
Wednesday’s vote was the first of four needed to pass the law and coincided with Vance’s visit to Israel — a month after Trump said he would not allow Israel to annex the territory.
Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkiye and 13 other Muslim-majority nations condemned the vote, as did the key multilateral organisations that represent Arab states and Muslim nations.
 






Trump hopes his Gaza plan will deliver stability across the Middle East and widen normalisation deals known as the Abraham Accords between Israel and Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates to include regional power Saudi Arabia.
The kingdom has repeatedly said it would not strike a deal with Israel without the formation of a Palestinian state.
Speaking at a conference in Jerusalem, Smotrich had said that, “if Saudi Arabia tells us normalisation in exchange for a Palestinian state, friends, no thank you.
“Keep riding camels on the sand in the Saudi desert; we’ll keep truly developing — with an economy, a society, a state and all the great and wonderful things we know how to do.“
He later expressed regret for what he called his “unfortunate” remarks about Saudi Arabia.
“My statement regarding Saudi Arabia was unfortunate, and I regret any offence it may have caused,” Smotrich said in a video statement he posted on X.
 






But he said that he also expected Saudis not to offend Israel.
“I’m also not willing to accept hypocrisy. Just as I don’t intend to offend the Saudis, I expect from them not to offend me, or rather, offend us,” he said.
“And anyone who denies the living and very deep connection we have to the regions of our homeland in Judea and Samaria, offends us,” he added, using the Israeli Biblical term for the occupied West Bank.
Smotrich, who lives in a West Bank settlement, is an outspoken supporter of annexing the Palestinian territory.
His earlier comments had prompted sharp responses in Israel.
Opposition leader Yair Lapid had swiftly denounced the comments.
“To our friends in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, Smotrich does not represent the state of Israel,” Lapid posted on X in Arabic, later calling for him to apologise.
 






Former defence minister Benny Gantz, another opposition figure, said that Smotrich’s comments “indicate ignorance, and a lack of internalisation of his responsibility as a senior minister in the government and cabinet”.
The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco normalised relations with Israel in 2020 under the US-brokered Abraham Accords.
But Saudi Arabia’s own normalisation talks with Israel were frozen after Hamas’s October 2023 attack sparked the Gaza war.</p><small>2025-10-23 17:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/232032025851aa5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950796/trump-pardons-convicted-binance-founder-zhao-white-house-says' target='_blank'><strong>Trump pardons convicted Binance founder Zhao, White House says</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump has pardoned convicted Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, a White House official said on Thursday.
In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had “exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency.“
Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Zhao, one of the most powerful people in the crypto world, had to step down as chief of Binance when the company agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement with the US government to end a years-long probe into misconduct at the world’s largest crypto exchange.
Trump’s pardon of Zhao paves the way for the crypto mogul to return to the business he helped found in 2017. He has already served his time in prison after a judge sentenced him to four months.
Zhao’s pardon is the latest in a series Trump has doled out to executives convicted of white collar crimes.
Earlier in April, he was appointed as a strategic adviser to the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), a press release issued by the Finance Division said.
The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was officially launched earlier in April to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
Earlier this year, Trump also pardoned the founders of crypto exchange BitMEX in connection with similar anti-money laundering violations and the founder of electric truck company Nikola, who was convicted of fraud. He has also commuted the sentence of the executive of the now-defunct start-up Ozy Media.</p><small>2025-10-23 16:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23143349dd588fb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950760/26th-amendment-case-justice-shahid-hassan-says-ignoring-article-191a-akin-to-granting-final-relief' target='_blank'><strong>26th Amendment case: Justice Shahid Hassan says ignoring Article 191A akin to granting final relief</strong></a><br><p>Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan on Thursday remarked that ignoring Article 191A through which the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench (CB) was formed under the 26th Amendment would amount to granting the petitioners “final relief”.
Justice Hassan’s observation came as an eight-member CB heard over three dozen petitions against the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year.
The PTI claimed seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate, with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence.
The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The hearing
Advocate Uzair Bhandari, counsel for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), began his arguments today. The hearing was adjourned till November 10, with Justice Aminuddin Khan saying that a later date would be fixed for the hearing if the bench was not available that day.
 


Justice Aminuddin is heading the bench hearing the case. It also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Mohammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan and Hassan.
At the outset of the hearing, retired Justice Shahid Jamil Khan, a former judge of the Lahore High Court who resigned four years before his superannuation, came to the rostrum.
Justice Mandokhail asked Jamil whether he had a separate petition against the 26th Amendment, to which the latter replied that his client has requested for the “implementation of the Practice and Procedure Committee’s decision”.
The former judge informed the court that he had a visit abroad scheduled for November 2, with Justice Aminuddin telling him that the CB will listen to his arguments towards the end of the proceedings.
Justice Mandokhail remarked, “You may present your arguments after returning […] We will also be fresh.”
Subsequently, Advocate Bhandari came to the rostrum and said he will present his arguments on the “current value” of the 26th Amendment.
However, Justice Mandokhail directed him to inform the court which bench could hear the case before presenting his main arguments.
Bhandari noted the bench’s “concern” that Article 191A, through which the CB was introduced in the apex court, was in place. “The bench considers that Article 191A bars it from referring the matter to a full court.”
Here, Justice Hassan told the SIC lawyer to detail what constitutes a full court. Justice Mandokhail quipped that the CB wanted to know whether a full court would be “formed on wishes or as per the law”.
Bhandari responded that it will be according to the law. He added that “full courts are never formed; they always exist”, echoing the stances taken by lawyers Munir A. Malik and Dr Adnan Khan.
Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Bhandari whether a full court was a “precedent” and had not been defined in the Constitution, the counsel contended that a full court’s definition was stated in Article 176 (constitution of SC).
Noting that the question now was who would form the full court, Bhandari argued that the current CB could issue orders for it, which would be “binding on all persons”.
Justice Mazhar then again raised a question mulled repeatedly in recent hearings: “How can Article 191A, due to which this bench was constituted, be ignored?”
Bhandari replied, “Even when the authority is taken away from one court, it still has the authority to send [the case] to the competent court.”
Justice Mazhar reiterated that the foundations of the CB were provided under Article 191A, adding that the lawyer was arguing to “ignore” that provision.
Justice Hassan also remarked, “You are making us ignore Article 191A, but also want this bench to pass an order.”
At this, Bhandari stressed, “I have not requested to suspend the 26th Constitutional Amendment in my petition. If the Amendment is suspended, then you all would not be even able to hear any case.”
Justice Mazhar once again observed that he and other judges were part of the current CB under Article 191A, asking rhetorically how the provision could be disregarded.
Addressing Bhandari, Justice Hassan noted, “If Article 191A is ignored, then that would amount to granting you final relief.”
The SIC council contended that the court had to decide “whether Article 191A is valid or not”.
Justice Mazhar responded that the provision — introduced under the same Amendment that is under challenge — is “valid, which is why it is a part of the Constitution”.
 
 

Justice Afghan then observed, “The question is what forum can declare Article 191A right or wrong.”
Bhandari answered the judge, saying that the SC had the jurisdiction to hear the case. “This would amount to suspending the 26th Amendment,” Justice Aminuddin remarked.
Bhandari said he would first “remove the obstacle of Article 191A in front of him”. “Only the lordships in the bench are consistently raising this question. The ladyships have not asked any question,” he said.
“The ladies have understood the matter,” Justice Hilali quipped. Justice Mandokhail added, “The women judges are sharper than me.”
At this point, Justice Ayesha observed that Article 191A was not taking away someone else’s powers, but was vesting them in the SC.
“No jurisdiction has been taken away anywhere,” she asserted.
Bhandari then recalled that once a former United States judge was asked why a full court hears all cases, to which the judge responded that the jurisdiction lay with the US top court, not with the benches.
Justice Mandokhail then remarked, “The Supreme Court has given the powers to the benches.” In response, the lawyer contended that every judge belonged to the SC and had “judicial powers”.
The hearing was then adjourned till November 10, with Bhandari set to continue his arguments.
Commenting on the proceedings, Barrister Asad Rahim Khan pointed out on X that Article 191A “says not a word” on a full court.
“And even if it did, the entire point of this case is to determine whether the amendment, which includes [Article] 191A, was legal and constitutional.
“Why already presume its permanency — that it must remain unquestioned?” he asked.
“By that logic, the SC should never have convened a full court to hear challenges to the 18th, 19th, 21st Amendments either. Art. 175(3) had been amended by the 21st to exclude the SC altogether. But it did anyway, because the core issue — their validity — remained unresolved.”
 






Requests for full court
Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s (BHCBA) counsel Munir A. Malik, Afrasiab Khattak’s counsel Khwaja Ahmed Hosain, and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed.
Other lawyers have also presented arguments for a 24-member full court based on judges present in the SC currently, including six who were appointed after the Amendment.
Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request. The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself.
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-23 16:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/231550247fb512e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950777/adiala-jail-superintendent-directed-to-implement-earlier-ihc-order-allowing-imran-twice-a-week-meetings' target='_blank'><strong>Adiala jail superintendent directed to implement earlier IHC order allowing Imran twice-a-week meetings</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court on Thursday directed the Adiala jail superintendent to implement a March 24 order that reinstated the twice-a-week meeting schedule for former prime minister Imran Khan.
The directive came as a larger bench, led by Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and including Justices Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Muhammad Azam Khan, collectively took up all 11 petitions filed by PTI leaders regarding Imran’s jail visitation. The ex-premier’s family and party have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “sabotaging” meetings with him.
Today, the IHC directed Adiala jail’s Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum, who was present during the hearing, to allow Imran’s jail meetings, as per the earlier order, while abiding by standard operating procedures (SOPs).
It directed the jail official to facilitate the meetings as per the lists provided by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who also attended the proceedings.
Raja and Anjum traded barbs during the hearing as the PTI leader claimed that “not even once” was the earlier IHC order implemented despite them giving a list of names, while the jail official asserted that “regular meetings” were held, but no list was received.
Petitions taken up by the bench included those filed by newly elected Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, who attended the IHC hearing. Shortly after it concluded, Afridi departed for Adiala jail but later claimed he was denied a meeting with Imran.
 






The PTI later posted a video on its X account of Afridi speaking to the media outside the Adiala jail. Afridi said on the occasion that he would be seeking policy guidelines from Imran during their meeting.
“Nothing else is going to take place inside. I have to implement my leader’s policies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He might give me some good advice inside […] There is nothing wrong with us wanting to meet our leader,” he added.
 






A subsequent post reshared by the PTI’s account showed Afridi, along with several others, sitting on the ground. The post stated that they were not being allowed to meet Imran despite court directives.
“A symbolic sit-in is under way,” it said.
 






According to a statement later issued by the KP CM Secretariat, “Despite the court’s explicit permission, the chief minister was not allowed to meet his party leader (Imran).”
Speaking to media persons outside the Adiala jail, CM Afridi said that the refusal to implement a clear court order reflected not his weakness, but the “helplessness of the judiciary” itself.
“If court orders are not being respected, it raises serious questions about the state of justice in the country,” he was quoted as saying.
The chief minister stressed that his visit was “purely Constitutional and aimed at seeking guidance from his party leader on key policy matters related to governance” in KP, the statement added.
“For the past two years, I have not met my leader. Yesterday’s meeting was important for taking policy direction and moving forward in line with the vision of Imran Khan,” Afridi said.
 






The PTI leader asserted that he had followed every legal and administrative channel — including communications with the Punjab Home Department, the federal government, and the chief justice — before approaching the Islamabad High Court.
“Whatever instructions come from Imran Khan, I will implement them in letter and spirit,” CM Afridi asserted. “No cabinet will be formed without the guidance of Imran Khan,” he affirmed.
Court did not say to tape our mouths: Salman Raja
Punjab Advocate General (AG) Amjad Pervaiz and Islamabad AG Ayaz Shaukat appeared before the court today and presented their arguments on their separate appeals challenging the striking down of the bar on prisoners’ political talks.
At one point during the hearing, PTI’s Raja attempted to present his contentions but was stopped by Justice Dogar. The IHC chief justice told the lawyer to let the Punjab government counsel complete his arguments first.
Raja said he wanted to assist the court, at which Justice Dogar said the former’s assistance was not needed.
Here, Pervaiz referred to the 1992 Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao case, adding that it was held that a notice under Order 27A of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Justice Tahir then asked Raja if he wanted to say something, at which the PTI lawyer said he wanted to assist the court.
After Pervaiz completed his arguments, a representative from the attorney general’s office informed the court that he was supporting Pervaiz’s stance. In his arguments, Islamabad AG Shaukat said he had raised objections, but they were “dismissed”.
At this point, Raja claimed that the March IHC order had not been implemented  “on even one day”. “We give a list of names [for the meeting] repeatedly as per the court order, but those people are not allowed inside [the jail],” he said.
He went on to allege, “An outsider is added to the names given in the list.”
 
 

Anjum, the jail superintendent, then asserted that the PTI leaders “regularly” have meetings with Imran. He further said that the jail administration received no list from Raja.
“The court restricted them from speaking to the media after meeting [Imran, but] they speak to the media after coming outside [the jail],” Anjum said.
In response, Raja quipped, “The court said not to speak to the media at the [jail] gate; it did not say to tape our mouths.
“We are kept a mile away from the Adiala jail, where we speak [to the media],” he added.
Subsequently, the court ordered the Adiala jail superintendent to implement the March 24 order that allows Imran to have two meetings per week with visitors, while placing restrictions on the latter’s media interactions.
The bench observed that while the PTI leaders were not barred from holding a media talk, they should not speak at the jail’s gate, but rather in a “chamber” or somewhere else later. Raja assured the court that they would not speak at the prison’s gate.
IHC suspends order nullifying ban on political talks in jail meetings
Among the petitions taken up today were intra-court appeals (ICAs) against the October 2024 order by IHC’s Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan that nullified a ban on political discussions during prisoners’ meetings with visitors.
Justice Ishaq had issued the ruling on a plea filed by former PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat. The subsequent ICAs were filed by the Islamabad chief commissioner and the Punjab government, and were taken up by a division bench in November 2024, according to APP.
The IHC then suspended the single-bench order that had ended the ban on political discussions.
 
 

As the Punjab AG began his arguments, his Islamabad counterpart informed the court that he had earlier objected that the Punjab and Islamabad AGs had not been issued notices in the case.
Justice Tahir wondered whether it was mandatory to issue a notice to the AG as well, along with the attorney general. Pervaiz cited past Supreme Court orders in response, contending that following the said procedure was necessary.
Responding to a question by Justice Tahir, the Punjab AG replied that the jail rules had been in place since 1984, with no amendments made since then.
On Justice Dogar’s directives, the Punjab AG read out his writ petition. Justice Tahir asked the counsel whether notices were issued to the attorney general, to which the Islamabad AG replied that neither the attorney general nor the advocate general was notified.
Pervaiz stated that even the Punjab government had not been made a party in the petition, but was made later on through a notice to its AG. “The Punjab government was not made a respondent in a proper manner.”
At this point, Justice Tahir then sought reasons for the single-member bench declaring the rules regarding political conversations illegal. Pervaiz responded that the decision was made based on various grounds, including contradictions with Article 19 (freedom of expression) of the Constitution.
According to Rule 265 (letters and interviews) of the Pakistan Prison Rules 1978, the “discussion of political matters shall not be allowed” during a prisoner’s meeting, and letters also “shall not contain any reference” to politics.
 
 

During his incarceration so far, Imran has written multiple letters to the chief justices of Pakistan, as well as three “open letters” addressed to the army chief. The ex-premier had also purportedly authored an essay published by The Economist in January 2024, just a month before the general elections.
When the Punjab AG cited past rulings to argue that issuing notices to the relevant attorney general was necessary for striking down a law, Justice Dogar observed that the laws Pervaiz was referring to were for under-trial suspects.
“The suspended rules were not even the federal rules,” Pervaiz said, adding that the laws fell within the Punjab government’s jurisdiction after the 18th Amendment.
Aleema signs warrants, but not arrested
At one point during the hearing, Rawalpindi police also made an appearance to have Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum sign a non-bailable arrest warrant issued for her in a case pertaining to the PTI’s November 26 protest.
After City Police Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Azhar Shah received Aleema’s signature on her arrest warrant, the police departed without arresting her. Yesterday, a Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court issued show-cause notices to two police of­­ficers for submitting a “fabricated” report claiming that Aleema had gone into hiding.</p><small>2025-10-23 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23113041f6c1437.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950764/pcb-suspends-multan-sultans-over-contract-breach' target='_blank'><strong>PCB suspends Multan Sultans over contract breach</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has issued a suspension notice to the Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Multan Sultans, citing breach of contractual obligations, it emerged on Thursday.
According to sources, the PCB has also sent a formal notice for termination of the franchise’s contract “after completing all necessary legal procedures”. The move marks a significant escalation in the simmering tensions between the board and the Multan franchise.
Sources revealed that the action followed repeated public statements by franchise owner Ali Tareen, who allegedly criticised the PCB and PSL management.
In April, Ali shared a podcast clip on X questioning the PCB’s pre-season build-up, writing:
“How is PSL 10 bigger and better? Same games, same teams – what’s new? Fed up with hollow words. PCB had time to plan innovations, but we’re repeating last year. Our biggest brand deserves more. Explain the vision!”
A few days later, he sought to clarify his stance amid backlash from other franchise owners, posting:
“I love PSL — it’s a MADE-IN-PAKISTAN success story we all benefit from. My words were about pushing for real growth, not negativity. Salman Naseer & PCB team are giving their all. Let’s unite as owners to back them and elevate the league. No more stagnation!”
However, tensions persisted. In July, Ali renewed his criticism in response to a PCB post-season debrief video celebrating PSL 10’s “success”.
He wrote: “Applause? You must be kidding. TV ratings down, attendance plummeting, digital engagement slowing — yet we’re celebrating? PCB, wake up. PSL deserves better planning, not self-congratulation. Time to fix these issues before it’s too late.”
A PCB source said the repeated statements “damaged the league’s reputation and violated the terms of the agreement”.
The board’s notice reportedly outlines specific clauses of the franchise agreement that were breached. PCB officials maintained that the board remains committed to upholding the integrity and professional standards of the PSL.
A Multan Sultans spokesperson told Dawn on Thursday that “the PCB last month sent a legal notice which is not a notice of termination”.
“The notice threatens termination of our franchise agreement and a lifetime blacklist of Mr. Tareen from owning any cricket team in the future,” a statement by the franchise said later.
“Every statement he (Ali) has made has been in the best interest of the PSL, urging the league to aim higher and do better.
“For the PCB management to treat constructive criticism as a crime is outrageous. It demonstrates the pettiness of the current management and clearly shows that the PSL is not open to questions or accountability, even from those who have given the most to make it stronger.
“Silencing honest feedback is not how great leagues are built.”
Multan Sultans added that the legal notice by the PCB demanded Ali to “retract all recent critical statements and issue a public apology to the PSL management”.
The development comes amid growing concerns over franchise-board relations within the PSL framework, with several stakeholders calling for greater transparency and consistency in the PCB’s dealings with team owners.</p><small>2025-10-23 15:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/231857296e3237e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950792/police-arrest-2-members-of-banned-outfit-in-connection-with-karachi-sectarian-killings' target='_blank'><strong>Police arrest 2 members of banned outfit in connection with Karachi sectarian killings</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on Thursday claimed to have arrested two suspects — linked to the outlawed Zainebiyoun Brigade — in connection with the killing of an Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) worker, as well as another sectarian killing in Karachi.
The militant group Zainebiyoun Brigade was added to the list of proscribed organisations in June of last year. It has also been designated by the US State Department as a terrorist organisation since 2019.
ASWJ, also an outlawed group, has seen a spate of attacks in recent times in Karachi. On October 20, an ASWJ worker was shot dead in the city’s Nangan Chowrangi area. Earlier this month, another worker was killed in a suspected targeted attack on main University Road.
Speaking at a press conference today, Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) CTD Azfar Mahesar said that the “counter-terror force of police and a federal intelligence agency jointly carried out an intelligence-based operation (IBO) and arrested two suspects linked with the Zainebiyoun Brigade.”
The suspects “were involved in recent terrorism cases linked with sectarianism in Karachi,” the DIG CTD claimed.
“The suspects confessed they had carried out the targeted killing of Qari Anas on Main University Road in Gulistan-i-Jauhar near Samama Shopping Centre recently,” the CTD official said.
The suspects also revealed that they had killed Qari Abdul Rehman in Sherpao Colony in May 2025 on “sectarian grounds,” added the counter-terror force official.
One of the suspects’ names was also included in the Red Book, CTD Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Irfan Ali Bahadur told Dawn.com, adding that he was a resident of Karachi and had been associated with the “Mehdi Force” of Sipah Mohammad Pakistan.
“He had come to Karachi recently after fleeing to a neighbouring country,” SSP Bahadur said.
He was also involved in an armed attack on the caravan of the central leader of the banned ASWJ, Maulana Aurangzeb Farooqi, in Gulshan-i-Iqbal in 2012, the CTD official said.
“The other suspect hailed from Gilgit and had come to Karachi only eight months ago for the targeted killings”, SSP Bahadur said.
SSP Bahadur also clarified that the suspects were not involved in the recent ASWJ attack near Nangan Chowrangi.
The two members of the outlawed Zainebiyoun Brigade were planning attacks to further the group’s interests in Karachi, as per DIG Mahesar.
CTD personnel recovered two 9mm pistols and two hand grenades from the arrested suspects, police said.
According to DIG Mahesar, the suspects also disclosed that they had “foreign links” while the outfit’s main leader lives in a “neighbouring country” from where they received financial assistance, as well as a list of targets.
However, he did not disclose the name of the neighbouring country.
“The suspects revealed that their fellow accomplices were also involved in killings linked with sectarianism in the provincial capital,” DIG Mahesar said, adding that “concerted efforts are underway to arrest them.”
“The suspects and their facilitators involved in recent targeted killings in Karachi have been identified,” declared the CTD DIG, adding that teams have been formed for their arrest, and expected a “breakthrough” soon.</p><small>2025-10-23 14:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23182829a5c002c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950790/after-balochistan-sindh-also-requests-transfer-of-armoured-vehicles-refused-by-kp' target='_blank'><strong>After Balochistan, Sindh also requests transfer of armoured vehicles refused by KP</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government on Thursday became the second province, after Balochistan, to request the federal government to transfer armoured vehicles rejected by the provincial administration of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
On Monday, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had blamed the “flawed policy” of the federal government for the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province. He further claimed that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other constitutional rights”. He had also alleged that the bulletproof cars provided by Naqvi were “defective and old”, adding that they should be recalled.
Balochis­tan CM Sarfraz Bugti had subsequently waded in, saying that like KP, his pro­vince was also affected by terrorism. “It is an appeal to the interior minister that if the KP government is refusing to take the bulletproof vehicles, they should be transferred to the Balochistan government so that terrorism can be countered effectively,” he said in a post on X. In a unique turn of events after that, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi allocated the bulletproof vehicles meant for KP to Balochistan.
Today, the Sindh Home Department also requested the interior ministry to allocate it the vehicles turned down by KP.
“In view of the critical security environment in Sindh, particularly with regards to the protection of Chinese nationals as well as the security of foreigners, very very important persons and dignitaries visiting the province, there exists a pressing need for bulletproof vehicles.”
“It is, therefore, requested that these bulletproof vehicles may kindly be allocated to government of Sindh for deployment under the Home Department. The vehicles will be used exclusively for aforesaid official security duties and will be maintained and operated under strict departmental control,” said the letter from Sindh Additional Chief Secretary Muhammad Iqbal Memon.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.</p><small>2025-10-23 13:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23124617286c396.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950768/dar-hails-visit-of-polish-counterpart-as-significant-says-two-sides-agreed-to-expand-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Dar hails visit of Polish counterpart as ‘significant’, says two sides agreed to expand bilateral cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar hailed the visit of his Polish counterpart to Pakistan on Thursday as “significant”, saying that during the delegation-level talks, the two sides had agreed to expand bilateral cooperation.
“During the delegation-level talks, Minister Sikorski and I took stock of the Pakistan-Poland bilateral ties, which continue to develop on a very positive trajectory. We have over a billion-dollar bilateral trade and both sides agreed that there remains immense untapped potential to further expand trade and economic cooperation.
“We agreed to expand bilateral cooperation in trade, energy, infrastructure, defence, counter-terrorism, science and technology and education,” Dar said during a joint press conference with Poland’s Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, who landed in Islamabad today on a two-day official visit.
Dar also announced that the foreign ministries of the two countries had signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) that envisioned regular bilateral consultations, which he said aimed at further enhancing cooperation between the two sides.
Moreover, he said an MoU had also been signed on cooperation between the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad and the Polish Institute of International Affairs.
At the outset of the press conference, Dar welcomed his Polish counterpart, mentioning that this was his second visit to Pakistan, the last being in 2011.
Moreover, he said, Sikorski was “no stranger in this part of the world”, having served as a war correspondent in the region during 1980s.
Dar underlined that Pakistan attached great importance to its ties with Poland.
“Poland’s struggle for freedom and independence is exemplary,” he said, further stating that Pakistan and Poland shared a “unique historical connection”.
“During World War II, thousands of Polish refugees found shelter in present-day Pakistan i.e. in Karachi and Quetta.”
He also recalled and lauded the role of Polish pilots and engineers in laying the foundation of the Pakistan Air Force.
Dar continued that with this shared historical context, Pakistan viewed Poland as an important partner, bilaterally, as well as in the European Union.
“We rejoice the economic progress Poland has made to now become a trillion-dollar economy,” he said, further congratulating the European country on the “successful and smooth presidential election and for its it able stewardship of the European Union”.
FM Dar further said that during the talks today, the two sides had exchanged views on major regional and global issues, including the security situation in South Asia, Afghanistan, Europe and the Middle East.
“I apprised the foreign minister of our concerns regarding unprovoked Indian aggression and Pakistan’s principled position on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, advocating for the resolution according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people and in line with UN Security Council resolutions.
“We also discussed the recent excess of the Taliban regime. Presence of Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan elements on Afghan soil and their continued attacks against Pakistan remain our top concerns.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan are terms designated by the state for the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and terrorist organisations in Balochistan, respectively.
Dar said he had emphasised the need for “strengthening multilateralism and consistent adherence to the fundamental principles of the UN Charter to address the existing and emerging international challenges in an effective and credible manner”.
Concluding his speech, he said Sikorski’s visit to Pakistan was a “significant milestone” in relations between the two countries, saying, “Today, we reaffirm our resolve to transform these relations into a comprehensive and mutually beneficial partnership.”
After Dar, the Polish foreign minister began his speech by thanking Dar for “reminding us of the shared historical legacy” between the two countries.
He confirmed that the two sides had agreed to renew the MoU between their foreign ministries to “facilitate better coordination”. He also welcomed the signing of an MoU between think tanks in the two countries.
Moving on to talks between the two sides, he said, “We have covered a broad range of issues, from bilateral economic ties […] to regional issues and global governance.
“During the talks with Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, I presented a […] offer of more intense bilateral collaborations in the fields of trade, public finances, fintech and water management. We also discussed further collaboration in the mining and the energy sector, building on the success of such engagements as the Polish Oil and Gas Company exploring natural in Pakistan. This, I believe, has huge potential for the future.”
Sikorski further said that the Pakistani diaspora in Poland had been growing over the past few years.
“It is still quite small, around 2,000 people, but I am glad to say a quarter of them are students. We are happy that Polish universities are popular among young, talented people from Pakistan, and we hope that their experience and impressions that they gather in Poland serve as a basis for actual people-to-people diplomacy.
“So Poland remains open to legal migration, and for real studies for real students. But I want to emphasise that there is zero tolerance for illegal migration to Polish territory, which is simultaneously the EU territory.”
He said for several years, Poland’s neighbours, Russia and Belarus “have been trying to help people smugglers breach our border, exploiting people, exploiting tragic situations and using them as a tool of hybrid warfare and putting them under unnecessary risk. And Poland had to respond. Polish border are now some of the best protected borders of the EU”.
He also said Poland and Pakistan shared a “common perspective on sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. This principle holds particular significance in our region in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
“Recent Russian violations of the Polish airspace — and you know a thing or two about that around here — is an outrageous and unprecedented miliatry provocation. It is new stage of Russian attempts to destabilise the situation in our part of Europe,” he said.
The foreign minister added that “Poland remains steadfast in its support of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine, and welcomes all efforts towards achieving such a peace. It should be based on the UN Charter and international law”.
On Gaza, he said “we root for peace” there. “Poland has recognised Palestine for decades, and we believe there should be a two-state solution for the two ancient peoples of the Middle East to live in dignity and peace with each other”.
Concluding his speech, FM Sikorski underlined that Poland was also interested in a “stable and prosperous South Asia”.
“We welcome all the efforts of Pakistan, both regional and globally, that help to achieve this aim.”
Polish FM lands in Islamabad
Earlier today, the Foreign Office said in a post social media platform X that “Deputy prime minister/foreign minister of Poland, His Excellency Radosław Sikorski, [had] arrived in Islamabad today for a two-day official visit”.
The FO added that Sikorski was received by the additional secretary for Europe, the Polish ambassador and other senior officials.
 






Later, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received Sikorski at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“The two leaders held a tête-à-tête meeting and exchanged views on matters of mutual interest,” the FO said.
 






A day earlier, the FO had stated that the Polish minister would be paying an official visit to Islamabad at Dar’s invitation.
“This will be minister Sikorski’s second official visit to Pakistan; his previous visit took place in 2011,” the statement said. During the visit, Dar and Sikorski will hold a one-on-one meeting as well as delegation-level talks.
“The two sides are expected to discuss the full spectrum of bilateral relations,” the FO said, adding that the talks would be followed by a joint press stakeout.
The FO said that Sikorski’s visit marked a “significant milestone in Pakistan-Poland relations” and reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to enhancing cooperation with Warsaw “for the mutual benefit of both countries”.
 






In July, Pakistan and Poland had agreed to enhance collaboration via high-level visits, parliamentary interactions and dialogue, during the 9th round of Bilateral Political Consultations between the two countries held in Warsaw.
At these consultations, regional and global issues of mutual interest were also discussed, including developments in South Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. It was mutually agreed that the next round of consultations would be held in Islamabad in 2026.</p><small>2025-10-23 13:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2317195203a55bb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950786/nearly-700-people-including-pakistanis-flee-to-thailand-after-myanmar-scam-centre-raid' target='_blank'><strong>Nearly 700 people, including Pakistanis, flee to Thailand after Myanmar scam centre raid</strong></a><br><p>Nearly 700 foreigners, including Pakistanis, have fled Myanmar and crossed into Thailand, the Thai army said on Thursday, following a military operation against the Chinese-backed KK Park, a notorious cybercrime compound.
Thailand has detained 677 people, including 618 men and 59 women, after they crossed the border into Tak province, it said in a statement.
Myanmar’s military has taken control of KK Park and is inspecting the area, driving a large number of people into Thailand, the statement said.
The people are now undergoing legal procedures and screening, and Thai authorities have also made additional detention facilities available in case existing spaces become insufficient, the army said.
“All actions are in line with legal and humanitarian principles,” it said, adding that it was working closely with local security agencies to maintain order along the Thai-Myanmar border.
 
 

The group consists primarily of individuals from India and China, with smaller numbers from Vietnam, Pakistan, Indonesia and several other countries, the army said.
Myanmar’s KK Park is a notorious enclave known to international law enforcement and diplomats for its involvement in cyberscams.
KK Park’s sprawling compound and others nearby are run primarily by Chinese criminal gangs and guarded by local militia groups aligned to Myanmar’s military.
 
 

Border areas between Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia have become hubs for online fraud since the Covid-19 pandemic, and the United Nations says billions of dollars have been earned from the trafficking of hundreds of thousands of people forced to work in scam compounds.
The sprawling compounds, where internet fraudsters target people with romance and business cons, have thrived along Myanmar’s loosely governed border during its civil war, sparked by a 2021 coup.
A highly publicised crackdown starting in February saw around 7,000 workers repatriated and Thailand enact a cross-border internet blockade.
 
 

But an AFP investigation this month revealed construction has continued apace at several compounds, while Starlink internet service receivers have been installed en masse, seeming to connect the hubs to the Elon Musk-owned satellite network.
Sawanit Suriyakul Na Ayutthaya, deputy governor of Tak province on the Myanmar border, told AFP that “677 people fled from the scam centre“ across the Moei river into Thailand as of Thursday morning.
Another crowd of more than 100 people gathered on the Myanmar side of the main local border crossing to Thailand early Thursday, an AFP journalist saw, many carrying large suitcases and backpacks.
A driver in the area, speaking anonymously for security reasons, estimated 700 people had made illegal overnight crossings.
While some scam workers are clearly trafficked into often fortified compounds, experts say others go voluntarily with hopes of earning more in the multibillion-dollar illicit industry than they can at home.
Sawanit said immigration police and the military had provided assistance “under humanitarian procedures”.
Those who crossed “will undergo screening” to determine whether they have been victims of human trafficking or if they may be prosecuted for crossing the border illegally, he said.
The Tak Provincial Administration office, which oversees the area, said in a statement that the group entering from Myanmar comprised “foreign nationals” — both men and women — and authorities expected more to cross into Thailand.
Indonesian state news agency Antara reported around 20 Indonesians had “successfully crossed into Thai territory via the Moei River” as of Wednesday evening, according to the Indonesian embassy in Yangon, which cited Thai authorities.
Conned out of billions
Experts say Myanmar’s military has long turned a blind eye to scam centres which profit its militia allies, crucial collaborators in their fight against rebels.
The junta has also faced pressure to shut down scam operations from its military backer China, irked at the number of its citizens both participating in and being targeted by the scams.
But military crackdowns on scam hubs are likely token efforts organised in cahoots with allied militias in an attempt to appease China without badly denting profits, analysts say.
“Because of the news it became a need for our organisation to resolve it carefully,” said Saw Tin Win, a senior figure in the most powerful local militia.
“There is pressure from the military, so we warned people not to continue bad things,” he added, a Myanmar media outlet reported on Wednesday evening.
The transnational scam industry has ballooned in Southeast Asia in recent years, with thousands of scammers estimated to be involved.
Victims in the wider region were conned out of up to $37bn in 2023, according to a UN report, which said global losses were likely “much larger”.
Thailand’s Anti-Money Laundering Office seized assets worth 70 million baht ($2.1m) from Cambodian senator and tycoon Ly Yong Phat as part of an investigation into scam centres and his businesses, a senior police official told local media on Wednesday.
The US government sanctioned Ly Yong Phat last year for alleged abuses related to human trafficking in scam centres.
Thailand’s deputy finance minister Vorapak Tanyawong resigned on Wednesday following allegations linking him to Cambodian cyberscam operations.
Cambodian authorities said today they arrested 57 South Koreans for alleged involvement in cyberscams, as well as 29 Chinese nationals in the capital Phnom Penh — adding to 64 South Koreans deported last week for alleged links to the fraud networks.</p><small>2025-10-23 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/231252122053a55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950770/harmer-stars-as-south-africa-crush-pakistan-to-draw-test-series' target='_blank'><strong>Harmer stars as South Africa crush Pakistan to draw Test series</strong></a><br><p>South Africa beat Pakistan by eight wickets in the second Test in Rawalpindi on Thursday to draw the series 1-1 with Simon Harmer taking a maiden five-wicket haul.
The 36-year-old off-spinner finished with 6-50, taking his 1,000th first-class wicket in the process, on a deteriorating Rawalpindi stadium pitch.
South Africa reached the 68-run target for the loss of captain Aiden Markram (42) and Tristan Stubbs (nought), both to spinner Noman Ali, who finished with 2-40.
Ryan Rickelton, who scored 25 not out, hit Sajid Khan for a six to seal an emphatic win minutes before the lunch break for the World Test Championship holders.
 






In another battle of spinners, Pakistan managed 333 in their first innings before the South African tail wagged to help them pile up 404 for a crucial 71-run lead.
Spinners took 34 of the 40 wickets to fall in the first Test in Lahore, which Pakistan won by 93 runs.
Thursday’s morning session saw Pakistan’s batters fold, adding just 44 runs after resuming the fourth day on 94-4.
Harmer torpedoed Pakistan’s hopes of saving the Test when he trapped Babar Azam leg-before with the fifth ball of the day after the batsman had reached his 30th Test half-century.
 






Pakistan’s hopes had rested on Azam ending his century drought, having not scored a ton since December 2022.
His lean spell goes on.
Nine runs later Harmer had Mohammad Rizwan caught by close-in fielder Tony de Zorzi for 18.
In his next over the spinner dismissed Noman for nought, caught behind for Harmer’s 1,000 wicket in his 235th first-class match.
Harmer is the fourth South African to take 1,000 or more first-class wickets, behind Mike Procter (1,417), Allan Donald (1,216) and Charlie Llewellyn (1013).
Harmer’s previous best figures of 4-51 came in the first Test in Lahore.
Unlike South Africa, Pakistan’s tail did not last long as they lost their last five wickets for just 33 runs in their second innings, just their latest batting slumps in the series.
Shaheen Shah Afridi was run out without scoring while Keshav Maharaj dismissed Salman Agha for 28 and Sajid Khan for 13 to swiftly wrap up the innings.
Maharaj finished with 2-34 to follow up his 7-102 in the first innings.
Shan backs policy of preparing slow test wickets
Pakistan captain Shan Masood gave a vote of confidence to his country’s controversial policy of preparing slow, spinning wickets for home tests, even after it backfired as they lost to South Africa.
Pakistan have deliberately looked to produce dry and deteriorating pitches for their spin bowlers to thrive on in home tests over the last 12 months against England, West Indies and South Africa a decision that has attracted some criticism.
“Look, it’s been four wins out of six since we’ve operated on these wickets,” he said.
“Obviously, the wickets have got a bit better. They’ve been much more battable. Four out of six isn’t bad considering in the two test matches we’ve lost we got into winning positions. Had we finished those games off it could easily have been six out of six.”
Critics of the Pakistan approach fear it holds back the development of their fast bowlers, and this would erode their competitiveness in away series.
“There is a lot to work on,” said Masood who has now lost ten of the 14 Test as skipper. “The lower order batting, finishing the innings of the opposition, and our third innings batting are not perfect.
“We had a great opportunity to close it out when we had a lead of 98 with two wickets to go but those last two wickets cost us dearly, putting us under a lot of pressure, and in these conditions it’s the difference between the first innings that leads into the third and fourth innings,” said Masood.
“We have a lot to work on when it comes to lower order batting, when it comes to finishing the innings off, when it comes to the third innings of batting, also when it comes to the first innings where we could have posted something north of 400, but we didn’t,” he added.
Pakistan spin lessons good for South Africa, says Markram
Skipper Markram says lessons learnt from the spin-dominated series will put South Africa in good stead for their tour of India next month.
Markram, standing in for injured skipper Temba Bavuma, praised his team’s fightback.
“After the first Test we were put under pressure and the guys have put their hands up and excelled,” said Markram.
“We have taken a lot of confidence from this win and we are in a great space to be in as a team, but we are still a work in progress in these conditions as we now head to India.”
Markram said his spin quartet was up to the challenge.
“The unit out here had quality spinners,” said Markram of Maharaj, Harmer, Senuran Muthusamy and Prenelan Subrayen — who between them took 35 of the 40 wickets in the series.</p><small>2025-10-23 10:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2314532026cba8f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950779/india-limits-content-takedown-powers-to-fewer-officials-after-spat-with-musks-x' target='_blank'><strong>India limits content takedown powers to fewer officials after spat with Musk’s X</strong></a><br><p>The Indian government has reduced the number of officials who can order content to be taken down from the internet, a move that follows a bitter legal battle with Elon Musk’s X that centered around a contentious policy.
X, Musk’s social media platform, had been in opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 2023 decision to police the internet by allowing thousands of officials to file takedown orders.
In August, Reuters reported that police inspectors were issuing takedown orders on cartoons and satirical posts, sparking one of X’s most high-profile legal challenges against a government’s content-removal policy.
 
 

X lost the lawsuit in Karnataka High Court in September, with a judge ruling that its challenge was without merit and X had to abide by local laws. But late on Wednesday, India’s IT ministry changed its policy by limiting the number of people who can issue such orders to top bureaucrats and police officials.
Now only bureaucrats with the rank of joint secretary or higher and police officials who are serving as deputy inspector general or above can issue takedown orders, the government said in its modification to the rules.
“The government is backing down and reducing its earlier powers that extended to many more officials, but the number of officials who can issue orders will still be in the hundreds,” said Akash Karmakar, a partner at Indian law firm Panag & Babu who specialises in technology law.
The changes are meant to ensure “additional safeguards to ensure senior-level accountability, precise specification of unlawful content and periodic review of government directions at (a) higher level”, a government statement said.
X did not respond to a request for comment. It previously said it would challenge the Karnataka High Court’s ruling.
Government backing down, ‘reasoned intimation’ needed
In its court challenge, X argued that India’s actions were illegal and unconstitutional, adding that they trampled upon free speech by allowing scores of government agencies and thousands of police to suppress legitimate criticism of public officials.
India contended that it was attempting to curb a proliferation of illegal content and ensure accountability online.
When it changed its rules on Wednesday, the government did not make reference to its legal fight with the social media platform. In July, X’s counsel said in court that every “Tom, Dick, and Harry” in India was illegally issuing takedown orders.
The change in rules will become effective on November 15.
“The process of challenging these takedown orders remains onerous and inverts the burden of proof on the user whose content is taken down, curbing free speech,” said Karmakar, the tech-focused lawyer.
The new rules also require content takedown orders to be supported by a “reasoned intimation”, “clearly specifying the legal basis and statutory provision invoked, the nature of the unlawful act” as well as the website’s address.
The earlier rules did not contain such requirements.
In another layer of scrutiny, the rules also add a requirement that takedown orders shall be “subject to periodic review” by an officer of secretary rank once a month.</p><small>2025-10-23 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/23115844c66bbfe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950765/fo-condemns-israels-attempt-to-extend-so-called-sovereignty-over-occupied-west-bank' target='_blank'><strong>FO condemns Israel’s attempt to extend ‘so-called sovereignty’ over occupied West Bank</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Thursday condemned Tel Aviv’s attempt to “extend its so-called ‘sovereignty’” over parts of the Occupied West Bank a day after a bill applying Israeli law to the occupied West Bank won preliminary approval from the Knesset.
Israeli lawmakers voted on Wednesday to advance two bills on annexing the occupied West Bank, barely a week after US President Donald Trump pushed through a deal aimed at ending Israel’s two-year military offensive in the Gaza Strip.
In a statement released today, the FO said, “Pakistan strongly condemns Israel’s attempt to extend its so-called ‘sovereignty’ over parts of the occupied West Bank, including illegal Israeli settlements, through a draft law introduced in the legislature of the occupying power.”
 






The FO said that these actions constituted a “flagrant violation” of international law, relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, and the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.
“Such provocative and unlawful measures undermine ongoing efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region,” the FO said.
It called on the international community to take “urgent and decisive action” to halt these illegal steps and to hold the Israeli occupying forces accountable for their continued violations of international law.
“Pakistan reiterates its commitment to working with regional and international partners to uphold the rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination, and to ensure peace, justice, and dignity for the Palestinians,” the FO said.
The FO also reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, including the establishment of an independent, sovereign, viable, and contiguous state of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
The vote in the Israeli parliament on Wednesday was the first of four needed to pass the law and it coincided with the visit of US Vice President JD Vance to Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party did not support the legislation, which was put forth by lawmakers outside his ruling coalition and passed by a vote of 25-24 out of 120 lawmakers. A second bill by an opposition party proposing the annexation of the Maale Adumim settlement passed by 31-9.
Members of Netanyahu’s coalition have been calling for years for Israel to formally annex parts of the occupied West Bank, territory to which Israel cites biblical and historical ties.
Israel argues the territories it captured in 1967 are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as occupied.
The UN’s highest court in 2024 said that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, including the West Bank, and its settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible.
The Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in some areas of the occupied West Bank.
US says Israel annexation moves in West Bank ‘threatening’ peace deal
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday warned Israel against annexing the West Bank, saying steps taken by parliament and settler violence threatened the Gaza peace deal.
“I think the president’s made clear that’s not something we can be supportive of right now,” Rubio said of annexation as he boarded his plane for a visit to Israel.
Annexation moves are “threatening for the peace deal,” he told reporters.
 






“They’re a democracy, they’re going to have their votes, and people are going to take these positions,” he said.
“But at this time, it’s something that we … think might be counterproductive,” he said.
Asked about increased violence by extremist Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, Rubio said: “We’re concerned about anything that threatens to destabilise what we’ve worked on.”
But Rubio voiced optimism overall for preserving the peace deal.
