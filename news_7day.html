<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20165558c859689.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932075/iran-says-cannot-completely-break-with-un-nuclear-watchdog' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says ‘cannot completely’ break with UN nuclear watchdog</strong></a><br><p>Iran “cannot completely cut cooperation” with the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog but the return of its inspectors is up to the country’s security chiefs, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Wednesday.
The remarks come nearly two months after Iran suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) following its 12-day war with Israel in June.
Iran has cited the IAEA’s failure to condemn Israeli and American strikes on its nuclear facilities as the reason for its decision, which saw the watchdog’s inspectors leave the country following the passing of new legislation by parliament.
“We cannot completely cut cooperation with the agency,” Araghchi said, noting that new fuel rods need to be installed at Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant in the coming weeks, which will require the presence of IAEA inspectors.
 
 

“Under the law passed by parliament, the return of inspectors will be possible through a decision of the Supreme National Security Council,” he told the official IRNA news agency in an interview published on Wednesday, referring to Iran’s top security body.
In mid-June, Israel launched an unprecedented attack targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites, but also hitting residential areas.
The United States launched its own attacks on nuclear facilities at Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz.
The war derailed talks between Iran and the US on a new nuclear deal to replace the one abandoned by US President Donald Trump during his first term in 2018.
Iran has since said cooperation with the agency will take “a new form” and earlier this month, the agency’s deputy head visited Tehran for talks.
At the time, deputy foreign minister Kazem Gharibabadi said Iran and the agency had agreed to “continue consultations”.
In recent weeks, Britain, France and Germany have threatened to trigger a snapback of UN sanctions lifted under the 2015 accord if Iran fails to agree a deal on uranium enrichment and cooperation with the IAEA.</p><small>2025-08-20 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20171406244b3ef.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932077/india-china-agree-to-resume-direct-flights-boost-business-links' target='_blank'><strong>India, China agree to resume direct flights, boost business links</strong></a><br><p>India and China agreed on Tuesday to resume direct flights and step up trade and investment flows as the neighbours rebuild ties damaged by a 2020 border clash.
The Asian giants are cautiously strengthening ties against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable foreign policy, staging a series of high-level bilateral visits.
The two countries would resume direct flights and boost trade and investment, including reopening border trade at three designated points, and facilitate in visas, the Indian foreign ministry said.
Direct flights have been suspended since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. No date was given for their resumption.
The latest statements came at the end of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s two-day visit to New Delhi for the 24th round of talks with Indian National Security (NSA) Adviser Ajit Doval to resolve their decades old border dispute.
The border talks covered issues related to pulling back troops both countries have amassed on their Himalayan border, delimitation of borders and boundary affairs, the Indian ministry said.
Both countries have agreed to set up a working group to consult and coordinate on border affairs to advance demarcation negotiations, a Chinese foreign ministry statement released on Wednesday showed.
It said the mechanism will extend talks to cover the eastern and middle sections of the border. Meanwhile another round of talks on the western section will be held as soon as possible, the ministry said.
Beijing also said both countries agreed to meet again in China in 2026.
“Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X after meeting Wang.
 






Modi is scheduled to travel to China at the end of this month to take part in the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation — his first visit to the country in more than seven years.
Tibet dam
A readout from the Chinese foreign ministry said Wang told Doval that “the stable and healthy development of China-India relations is in the fundamental interests of the two countries’ people.”
The two sides “should enhance mutual trust through dialogues and expand cooperation”, Wang said, and should aim for consensus in areas such as border control and demarcation negotiations.
 
 

India said Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar had underlined in his talks with Wang India’s concerns with regard to the mega dam China is building on the Yarlung  Zangbo river in Tibet.
Yarlung  Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra as it flows into India and Bangladesh, a lifeline for millions.
The dam would have implications for lower riparian states and the need for “utmost transparency” was strongly underlined, New Delhi said.
To that, China agreed to share with India emergency hydrological information on relevant rivers on humanitarian principles, China’s foreign ministry said.
Both sides agreed to engage an expert-level mechanism on cross-border rivers, and maintain communication to renew flood reporting arrangements, the ministry said.
Chinese officials had previously said hydropower projects in Tibet will not have a major impact on the environment or on downstream water supplies, but India and Bangladesh have nevertheless raised concerns.
Earlier on Tuesday, an Indian source said Wang had assured Jaishankar that Beijing was addressing three key Indian concerns — the need for fertilisers, rare earths and tunnel boring machines.
The Indian foreign and mines ministries and China’s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><small>2025-08-20 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20145116dc56f0b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932049/rain-starts-pouring-again-in-karachi-as-some-roads-remain-flooded-death-toll-rises-to-8' target='_blank'><strong>Rain starts pouring again in Karachi as some roads remain flooded; death toll rises to 8</strong></a><br><p>Rain began pouring again in parts of Karachi on Wednesday afternoon as inundated roads due to yesterday’s heavy downpour continued to present challenges to weary citizens.
Meanwhile, the death toll from rain-related incidents since yesterday rose to eight, while Sindh and Balochistan braced for more showers in the coming days.
Tuesday’s rains severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, along with disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced hours-long power and internet services outage. Due to the severity of the situ­ation, the provincial admin­­istration anno­unced a public holiday in the city today.
 


Shortly after 2:30pm, rainfall was reported in Saddar, Malir, Malir Cantonment, Scheme 33, Gulistan-i-Jauhar Block 2, and near I.I. Chundrigar, Kala Pull Road, and Jinnah Postgraduate Medical College (JPMC).
In an alert issued at 3pm, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said rains with thunderstorms and strong winds were expected at most places in Karachi and its surrounding areas in the next two to four hours, while heavy showers were also forecast at some locations.
Warning of the risk of increased urban flooding, the PMD advised the public to take necessary precautions and remain alert.
 






In a post on X, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab also warned citizens: “It is expected to rain again from 2pm onwards. I would request people to avoid movement and if it starts to rain, please stay put where you are whether it is your office or residence.”
 






“We are expecting more intense rains,” Anjum Nazir, a spokesperson for Sindh’s meteorological department, as quoted as saying by Reuters.
The Sindh government had ordered all private and public educational institutions across the city to remain closed today, after Wahab declared a rain emergency. However, Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah rebutted a “fake” notification of school closures for tomorrow and Friday, clarifying that the government had not issued any such directives yet.
Separately, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah⁩ chaired a meeting on Karachi’s rain situation.
“More rain expected, municipal and emergency teams are on alert. Continuous efforts underway for drainage and rescue operations,” said a post on his X account. It noted that 26 de-watering pumps had been deployed citywide to “ease flooding”.
 






CM Shah also visited Sharea Faisal and the Nursery area, where he spoke to the media and highlighted that the effects of climate change were visible around the world.
“Rainwater accumulated in the city, but you can see that the nullahs are flowing,” he said, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa.
“Did the nullahs get cleared within a night? No, the Sindh government had been working on it. But the media was saying that the city had drowned and the administration was not present, which is wrong.
“The entire city administration, municipality corporation’s staff, and I myself are on the streets,” the chief minister added.
Inundated roads as mayor stresses ‘climate change is a reality’
Floodwater was still accumulated on multiple roads across the city, including near I.I. Chundrigar Road, as Karachi did not witness any further rain till at least 2pm.
While the traffic police listed 10 bypasses and three main roads as being closed till at least 12pm due to urban flooding, Wahab presented a contrasting picture on his social media accounts, sharing videos of only those routes that were clear for vehicles.
The PPP mayor shared videos shot from inside a car of a drive along the Sher Shah Suri Road, Submarine Underpass, Shahrah-i-Pakistan and Liaqatabad No. 10 leading to Daak Khana, which did not have any rainwater in the videos.
 

This Google Map screengrab shows road blockades across Karachi on Aug 20, 2025 as of 4:50pm, a day after heavy rainfall led to flooding in various areas.

In a post on X, Wahab urged citizens not to use Shaheed-i-Millat Road at the moment as “work is being carried out to clear the underpasses”. He suggested using Stadium Road or Shahrah-i-Quaideen as alternative routes.
 






In an update at 12:37pm, Karachi Traffic Police said various bypasses and roads in the city’s multiple districts were closed due to rainwater accumulation.
In District East, Shaheed-i-Millat Road, Tariq Road Underpass and Drigh Road Underpass towards the airport were shut for traffic.
In District Central, Nazimabad No. 1 Underpass, Nazimabad No. 2 Underpass, Liaquatabad No. 10 Underpass and Gharibabad Underpass were closed.
In the Malir district, Sohrab Goth Underpass was inaccessible, while in the Korangi district, both the roads of Korangi Crossing and EBM Causeway were shut.
The traffic police advised commuters to call the traffic helpline 1915 for alternative route options to avoid inconvenience.
 






Addressing a press conference in Karachi, Wahab said: “Climate change is a reality. If you want to make someone a target of criticism and say whatever you want, you can. But, you can see how huge a challenge climate change is for any government, state, or administration around the world.”
Noting that Pakistan faced “different challenges” from the developed countries, the PPP mayor said climate change had wreaked havoc in other parts of the country too in recent weeks.
He underscored that people had two options: either change their behaviour to combat climate change, or criticise others. He compared yesterday’s torrential rains in Karachi to those that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, other northern areas and Islamabad faced this monsoon.
Wahab detailed that there were two rain spells on Tuesday, with the first one ending by 9:30am, allowing the city administration to work on removing the rainwater. “By 12:30pm, the situation had been fixed and the main arteries of your city were open.”
 
 

However, the second spell began at around 1:15pm and continued “non-stop” till 6pm, the PPP mayor highlighted. Even after that, rain continued “on and off” till around 8pm with each spell lasting 10 to 12 minutes, Wahab added.
Noting that 235 millimetres of rain occurred in only Manghopir in 12 hours yesterday, Wahab stressed that Karachi’s nullahs had a capacity of 40mm so rainfall above that would result in a spillover effect. He asserted that a nullah situated in the Nursery area was fully functional and had no blockage.
Rain started again while Wahab was holding the media talk, with the mayor saying he was ready to continue the press conference in the same outdoor setting, and later pushed back an umbrella someone else was holding for him.
According to the rainfall record issued by the PMD at 8am for the previous 24 hours, Gulshan-i-Hadeed received the highest amount of rain (178mm), with Keamari following close (173mm).
Airport Old Area recorded 164mm of rain, Jinnah Terminal 156mm, Nazimabad 150mm, Surjani Town 151mm, North Karachi 149mm, Saadi Town 146mm, DHA Phase 7 138mm, Met Office at University Road 145mm, Korangi 139mm, PAF Faisal Base at Sharea Faisal 133mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar (Jamia Rasheed) 103mm, PAF Masroor Base (Karachi West) 101mm, Orangi Town 81mm and Bahria Town witnessed the lowest 5mm.
 






Deaths from rain-related incidents rise to 8
According to separate statements issued by Karachi Rescue 1122, two more people died in rain-related incidents, in addition to yesterday’s six deaths.
Edhi Marine Service volunteers recovered the body of a 50-year-old man, identified as Abbas Mohsin, who went missing in a nullah near the Gurumandir area yesterday, Rescue 1122 said. His body was taken to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK).
 
 

In Defence Housing Authority’s (DHA) Phase 5, Edhi Marine Service volunteers recovered the body of 19-year-old motorcycle rider Yasir, after being informed about an electrocution incident. The man’s body was shifted to the JPMC.
A man and a woman were injured after part of an old building collapsed in the Ranchore Line area, a statement from the Edhi Rescue service said. Both were taken to CHK in an ambulance.
According to statements by Sindh Rescue 1122, “several people” were rescued from Karachi’s Sukhan Nadi, while 18 men and 12 women were evacuated safely from a call centre in PECHS Block 6 after they were trapped there due to rainwater accumulated inside the building.
Among the six people who died yesterday were four members of a family who lost their lives after the walls of a house in Gulistan-i-Jauhar’s Block-12 collapsed during the heavy rain. According to a JPMC statement, a boy aged between two to four years and a six to seven-year-old girl were among the deceased, while a fifth relative was injured.
In another similar incident in Orangi Town, an eight-year-old child lost his life. An unidentified man, aged 20-24 years, died in a suspected electrocution case in DHA’s Phase 7.
Power restored in various areas: KE
In an update at 2:15am, K-Electric spokesperson Imran Rana said efforts were underway to restore power supply in affected areas after getting safety clearance from on-ground teams as accumulated rainwater receded.
“K-Electric’s generation, transmission, and distribution systems remain stable after the torrential monsoon rains, and power supply continues across the city through more than 1,700 feeders,” the statement on Rana’s X said.
Areas in which power had been restored, as per KE, included North Nazimabad’s Block L and M; Askari 5; Malir Cantt Sector J; Orangi Town; Shamsi Colony; Feroz Shah Colony; Bangla Bazaar; Sectors 14-A, B, C, D, E and F; Pak Colony; F.B. Area Block 10, 11 and 14; Sarhad Colony; and Naubahar Colony.
Power had also been restored in Badar Commercial’s Street 2, 6, 9 and 12; Zamzama Commercial; Azam Basti; DHA Phase 5; Clifton Block 2 and 9; Gulistan-i-Johar’s Block 15 and 17; City Railway Colony; Defence; Dhoraji; CP Berar; Faran Society; Zamzama Commercial; and Azam Basti.
Rana said fuel supply disruptions across the city were also impacting the movement of KE vehicles for the restoration work.
 






Yesterday’s rains severely flooded Karachi’s major arteries, including Sharea Faisal, M.A. Jinnah Road, and I.I. Chundrigar Road, with hundreds of cars and motorcycles submerged and commuters stuck in traffic jams for several hours. Many had to wade through waist-deep water in the business district as they tried to return home.
Shortly after the heavy rains hit the city, power outages swept across the city, plunging several areas into darkness. Even upscale neigh­bourhoods, such as DHA and Clifton, were severely affected, with rainwater flooding homes and adding to the residents’ misery.
The domestic and international flight operations at Jinnah International Airport were also affected, with the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) confirming that several flights were either delayed, cancelled or diverted to an alternative airport due to inclement weather.
More rains expected in Sindh, Balochistan
The PMD has forecast torrential rains in Sindh, parts of Balochistan, and other regions of the country in the coming days, advising the provincial disaster management authorities to make necessary arrangements.
According to the PMD, strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are continuously penetrating the country, particularly the southern parts.
Under the influence of these conditions, widespread rain-wind/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls, at times very heavy, are expected in Karachi, Mithi, Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar and Jamshoro.
Scattered showers are likely in Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, and Jacobabad till August 22 with occasional gaps.
 






In Balochistan, rain-wind/thundershowers with scattered heavy falls are expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibi, Zhob, Qila Saifullah, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Kech, Gwadar, and Panjgur till August 22 with occasional gaps.
The Met Office warned that torrential rains may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Sindh, including Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tharparkar, Umer Kot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar, and Jamshoro.</p><small>2025-08-20 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/201632394cd9a32.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932073/fm-dar-lands-in-kabul-for-meeting-with-chinese-afghan-foreign-ministers' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar lands in Kabul for meeting with Chinese, Afghan foreign ministers</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar landed in Kabul on Wednesday for a trilateral meeting with Afghanistan and China on counter-terrorism and other issues.
A statement from the Foreign Office (FO) said FM Dar was received by Afghan Deputy FM Dr Mohammad Naeem, other Afghan officials, and Pakistan’s Ambassador to Afghanistan, Ubaidur Rehman Nizamani.
“During the meeting, discussions will be held on enhancing cooperation between the three countries, especially in trade, regional connectivity and counter-terrorism domain,” the FO said.
It added that Dar would also hold a bilateral meeting with his Afghan counterpart, Amir Khan Muttaqi, to discuss matters between both countries.
 






On May 21, Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed in principle to upgrade their diplomatic relations by exchanging ambassadors — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.
The understanding was reached during an informal trilateral meeting of foreign ministers from Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan in Beijing. The talks were part of Beijing’s broader effort to ease regional tensions and advance connectivity through its Belt and Road Initiative.
Pakistan and China had also noted that there was an agreement on the extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan.
China, which has strategic interests in regional stability and economic integration, hosted the gathering to help resume the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral dialogue, which had been paused since 2023.
The key outcomes from the Beijing meeting also included commitments to enhance cooperation in security and counter-terrorism, including joint action against militant groups and external interference and an understanding to formally resume the trilateral process by convening the sixth China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue in Kabul.
Earlier that month, the Afghan government had called for “mutual respect and constructive engagement” with Pakistan and China, according to a statement issued by its interior ministry.
The statement was issued after special envoys of Pakistan and China, Mohammad Sadiq and Yue Xiaoyong, met Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul.</p><small>2025-08-20 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2013511936c58ee.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932053/imran-khan-nominates-mahmood-achakzai-as-na-opposition-leader-swati-for-senate' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan nominates Mahmood Achakzai as NA opposition leader, Swati for Senate</strong></a><br><p>Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan has nominated Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai for the post of Opposition Leader in the National Assembly, PTI Secretary-General Salman Akram Raja said on Wednesday.
“Azam Khan Swati has been nominated as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,” Raja added. He also said Imran has asked for five names to decide on his nominee for the opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly.
The announcement comes after the Election Commission of Pakistan earlier this month disqualified PTI’s Omar Ayub Khan as the NA opposition leader and Shibli Faraz from the same role in the Senate, along with other opposition MNAs and MPAs, following their convictions in May 9 cases. Both PTI opposition leaders were formally removed from their posts on August 8.
Speaking to reporters outside the Supreme Court, Raja said that Imran nominated had nominated Achakzai, who currently leaders the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), to take Ayub’s place.
“The PTI founder has entrusted the matter of by-elections [to seats vacated after recent convictions of lawmakers in May 9 cases] to the party’s political committee,” he said.
“A political committee meeting will be held later today, where a decision will be made in this regard.”

Last week, the Peshawar High Court had issued a stay order for the appointments of new opposition leaders in the NA and the Senate. The bench also issued notices to the ECP, seeking its response to two separate petitions filed by Ayub and Faraz. The petitions challenged their disqualification and de-notification as MNA and Senator, respectively.
The PTI is a part of a coalition of six opposition parties, working under the banner of TTAP, which was formed last year.
Earlier this month, the opposition alliance had organised a multi-party conference, following which it had appealed for a new social contract to restore the Constitution and democracy.
The TTAP formalised its organisational structure in July, declaring blanket support for all anti-government protests. During a press conference, Raja had announced Achakzai’s appointment as TTAP chairman, with PTI’s Asad Qaiser as the Secretary General.</p><small>2025-08-20 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20152344524d4e2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932061/talks-expected-soon-between-pti-govt-officials-imrans-release-not-on-agenda' target='_blank'><strong>‘Talks expected soon between PTI, govt officials; Imran’s release not on agenda’</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has said he expects negotiations between the PTI and the government to start in a few days, but Imran Khan’s release from jail would not be part of the discussion.
Since Imran’s incarceration last year in several cases, PTI’s relations with the government and the establishment have deteriorated sharply. Last year in November, protests by the party had escalated into violence amid state repression.
Subsequently, in December last year, Imran Khan had formed a five-member committee to hold talks with “anyone”, prompting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to set up a counterpart panel. Despite several rounds, however, the talks ended abruptly and without results. Ties have been further strained after several PTI leaders’ recent convictions in May 9 cases.
In an interview on DawnNews TV programme Doosra Rukh, aired on Tuesday night, the minister said that he saw negotiations “starting in a few days”.
“PTI leaders have contacted us as well as other leadership, and are convincing us that negotiations should open up again,” he said, adding that the opposition was also in consensus that they wanted “some pathway out” after the sentencing and disqualifications of PTI leadership in the wake of the May 9 riots.
He said that the negotiations would be held between the PTI’s team and a committee formed by the Speaker of the National Assembly, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.
He stressed, however, that these negotiations would not include a discussion on Imran’s release, as this was “not in the government’s power”.
“We have told them a dozen times to take the route of the courts, to prove his innocence in court,” he said. “His release is only possible that way. The government cannot provide him freedom or release in any way.”
He added that if there was any issue that party members wanted to discuss; if they wanted to talk about “political space or political issues”, such discussions would be welcome.
Malik also said that the PTI would have to “convince” them as to the necessity of forming a judicial commission for an investigation into May 9 at the current stage in the proceedings, as many cases had already been decided.
“If they have a convincing argument, then they can bring it to that session and convince us,” he said, adding that the evidence already provided in these cases was already admissible and had been taken into account in the trial stages.
 


Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9. In July, he filed an appeal in the Supreme Court after being denied bail by lower courts. That appeal has yet to be decided, with the hearing put off again today.
Earlier this month, PTI’s Opposition Leader in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, and Opposition Leader in the Senate, Shibli Faraz, were removed from their seats after being convicted in May 9 cases by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza, and other PTI lawmakers were similarly disqualified from their seats following their convictions in cases related to the riots.</p><small>2025-08-20 11:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/20154429316b6da.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932065/data-protection-standards-issued-for-companies-to-safeguard-citizens-personal-information' target='_blank'><strong>Data protection standards issued for companies to safeguard citizens’ personal information</strong></a><br><p>The National Cyber Emergency Services Response Team (PKCERT) on Wednesday issued data protection guidelines for organisations handling citizens’ personal information, citing an increasingly insecure cyberspace environment.
PKCERT is a federal entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage.
The advisory, applicable to companies holding Personally Identifiable Information (PII), prescribes immediate, medium- and long-term measures, which include classifying data sets based on their sensitivity, advanced encryption methods, multi-factor authentication, and others.
Organisations collecting, processing, storing, or transmitting PII may include “financial services, telecommunications and internet providers, commerce and logistics [companies], government agencies, healthcare institutions, educational entities, as well as third-party and outsourced service providers,” the notification said.
In its recommendations, PKCERT instructed companies to keep their PII handling systems updated, retain PII only for legally required durations, and dispose of outdated information lest it be stolen.
It also urged organisations to align their practices with the National Cyber Security Policy 2021 (NCSP) as well as the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016.
The NCSP “mandates safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of citizens’ personal data as a matter of national security and public trust,” reads the advisory.
 
 

PKCERT also called for an immediate review of the systems organisations have been using to handle PII, recommended security training for all staff handling personal information, as well as continuous monitoring to prevent unauthorised access.
 




Recomendations made by the PKCERT advisory.

Outlining possible vulnerabilities and threats, the cybersecurity body underscored the need for data protection, noting that in light of “the growing sophistication of cybercriminals, the widespread exploitation of misconfigured systems, and negligent data handling practices, urgent remediation measures are required.”
 


The advisory detailed that threat actors may include:

Cybercriminal Gangs: Monetising stolen PII via identity fraud, phishing kits, and dark web
marketplaces.
State-Sponsored APT Groups: Using compromised citizen data for surveillance, political manipulation, and intelligence gathering.
Hacktivists: Targeting organisations for ideological reasons, often leaking sensitive records publicly.
Malicious Insiders: Employees or contractors exploiting privileged access for personal gain or revenge.

According to PKCERT, inadequate data protection can lead to “identity theft, fraud, mass privacy breaches, operational disruption, erosion of public trust, national security risks and legal and regulatory consequences.”
In its recommendations to individuals, the advisory outlined preventative measures such as submitting CNIC and personal documents only when necessary, using strong passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and avoiding sharing personal information online.
In May, PKCERT issued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan had been stolen in a global data breach, and urged citizens to take immediate protective measures.
In March 2024, a Joint Investiga­tion Team (JIT) formed to probe a data leak from the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) had found that the credentials of as many as 2.7 million citizens had been compromised between 2019 and 2023.</p><small>2025-08-20 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/201503331ff0270.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932060/murtaza-solangi-appointed-spokesperson-for-president-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>Murtaza Solangi appointed spokesperson for President Zardari</strong></a><br><p>Senior journalist and former caretaker information minister Murtaza Solangi has been appointed spokesperson for the President of Pakistan, he confirmed on Wednesday.
A former director general of Radio Pakistan, Solangi served as the caretaker minister for information and broadcasting from August 2023 to March 2024.
“Mr Murtaza Solangi is appointed as Spokesperson of the President of Pakistan on honorary/pro bono basis with immediate effect until further orders,” said a notification by the president’s secretary, Muhammad Shakeel Malik yesterday.
“A little personal news,” Solangi wrote on X today. “I have been appointed the Spokesperson of the President of Pakistan. I will assume my new responsibilities starting tomorrow. Thank you.”
 






During his tenure at Radio Pakistan from 2008 to 2013, Solangi oversaw a workforce spanning 64 broadcasting units and over 3,000 individuals. He also forged partnerships with international news organisations, including Voice of America, China Radio International, and Deutsche Welle.
He was the first Pakistani elected as the vice president and the acting president of Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union.

Swiatek — who on Monday had battled through a two-hour tussle with Jasmine Paolini to win the Cincinnati Open — looked full of energy as she and Ruud powered into Wednesday’s semi-finals.
Swiatek and Ruud needed just 39 minutes to dispatch the US pairing of Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe 4-1, 4-2 in their opening game at Arthur Ashe Stadium, and then reappeared roughly 20 minutes later to defeat Caty McNally and Lorenzo Musetti 5-3, 4-2 in their quarter-final clash.
The victories capped a gruelling 24 hours for Polish star Swiatek, who hot-footed it to the airport after Monday’s win in Cincinnati and only arrived at her
hotel in New York in the early hours of Tuesday.

“Honestly the last two days have felt like one day, but I’m super happy to be here,” Swiatek said.
Ruud and Swiatek had just enough time to fit in a quick practice before taking to the court in their first match as a doubles pairing.
“I was happy to team up with Iga,” Ruud said afterwards.
“She’s on the winning train these days so I’m just jumping on the train and let’s see if we can win some more before the mixed doubles is over.
“I was super happy to team up with Iga — I think everyone should show some appreciation to Iga today. She only got to her hotel 12 hours ago at 2:30am, and she’s here playing.”
McNally and Musetti had progressed to the last eight earlier Tuesday after taking care of Naomi Osaka and Gael Monfils 5-3, 4-2.
In other early results on Tuesday, US tennis icon Venus Williams and partner Reilly Opelka exited against Karolina Muchova and Andrey Rublev, losing 4-2, 5-4.
Italy’s reigning champions Andrea Vavassori and Sara Errani ousted second seeds Elena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz 4-2, 4-2.
Earlier on Tuesday, world number one Jannik Sinner’s withdrawal from the mixed doubles was confirmed as expected.
Sinner, who retired due to illness in the first set of his Cincinnati Open final with Carlos Alcaraz on Monday, was due to partner Katerina Siniakova in the doubles.
Sinner and Siniakova were replaced in the draw by the American duo of Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison.
This year’s US Open mixed doubles competition is being held over Tuesday and Wednesday in the week before the main singles draws get under way.
The tournament is using a modified scoring system, with short sets to four games, no-advantage scoring, tiebreakers at four-all and a 10-point match tiebreak in lieu of a third set.
The final will be a best-of-three set match to six games, featuring no-advantage scoring, with tiebreakers at six-all and a 10-point match tiebreaker instead of a third set, with the winning pairing pocketing $1 million.</p><small>2025-08-20 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2011083125535a6.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932044/china-to-showcase-latest-military-hardware-at-september-parade' target='_blank'><strong>China to showcase latest military hardware at September parade</strong></a><br><p>China will unveil a slate of new domestically produced military hardware that will showcase its “powerful capability to prevail in modern war” at a parade next month, officials said on Wednesday.
The event, marking 80 years since the end of World War II, will see President Xi Jinping inspect troops in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and other world leaders expected to attend.
Millions of Chinese people were killed during a prolonged war with imperial Japan in the 1930s and 40s, which became part of a global conflict following Tokyo’s attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.
The ruling Communist Party has held a series of blockbuster events in recent years to commemorate its wartime resistance.
On September 3, China’s military will showcase its latest equipment, “reflecting the evolution of modern warfare”, said Major General Wu Zeke, an official at China’s military commission.
“All of the weapons and equipment taking part in this review were selected from domestically produced, currently active main battle systems, with a significant proportion being newly unveiled equipment,” Wu told reporters at a briefing.
These will include strategic heavy weapons, hypersonic precision systems, as well as unmanned and counter-unmanned equipment making their first public debut, he added.
The parade, which will last around 70 minutes, will “fully showcase our military’s powerful capability to prevail in modern war”, Wu said.
It will also feature ground troops marching in formation, armoured columns, aerial echelons and other high-tech fighting gear.
The Kremlin has confirmed Putin will attend, and Chinese officials said other world leaders are also expected to take in the scene.
China in March raised its defence spending for 2025 by 7.2 percent.
The increase comes as Beijing’s armed forces undergo rapid modernisation and eye deepening strategic competition with the United States.
China has the world’s second-largest military budget, but lags well behind the United States, its primary strategic rival.</p><small>2025-08-20 07:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68a4de08c4e6c.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931920/medium-level-flood-in-river-indus-at-taunsa' target='_blank'><strong>Medium-level flood in river Indus at Taunsa</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Taunsa Barrage on the Indus River is having a flood situation where water flow has reached a critical 500,000 cusecs and it is expected to rise further.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Tuesday issued a high alert as flood situation intensifies across Punjab as the water in rivers is rising due to ongoing monsoon rains that lashed the upper regions of the province.
The PDMA directed the district administration to immediately evacuate the citizens living on or near the riverbeds in Taunsa and launch emergency rescue operations. All relevant administrations should remain present in the field to coordinate relief efforts.
Commissioners of Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur, along with deputy commissioners of Layyah, Kot Addu, Dera Ghazi Khan, Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur have been put on high alert.

Boats used to rescue people in Mianwali; more rainfall expected across Punjab

The flood threat is compounded by heavy thunderstorms predicted across most districts of Punjab from Aug 19 to 22. Rainfall is expected in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Lahore, Gujrat, Sialkot, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, and Rajanpur, raising concerns about urban flooding in major cities and flash flooding in the seasonal streams and drains.
The river situation across Punjab is becoming increasingly precarious. At Tarbela, the Indus is flowing at low-level flood with 309,000 cusecs while Kalabagh is experiencing medium-level flooding of 440,000 cusecs. Chashma reports a medium-level flood situation with 492,000 cusecs, and Taunsa shows 489,000 cusecs with medium-level flooding.
The Ravi River at Jassar in Narowal has a low-level flood at 53,000 cusecs, with forecast predicting low to medium-level flooding within the next 24 hours. The Sutlej River at Ganda Singhwala and Sulemanki is also at low-level flood with 64,000 and 71,000 cusecs, respectively while Nullah Dek and Basantar near Shakargarh are similarly affected.
In response to the escalating situation, the Punjab government has established flood relief camps in the affected areas to provide basic facilities and medicines.
PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathia urged the citizens to take precautionary measures, relocate from riverbeds to safe locations and avoid recreational activities near the water bodies.
He advised the public to use the PDMA helpline 1129 for emergencies and stay informed through announcements and local channels. He said that no negligence would be tolerated in protecting lives and properties, and citizens were called upon to cooperate fully with administration efforts during this critical period.
In Mianwali, the water flow in the Indus is increasing and there is a medium level flood in the river at Mianwali. The inflow at Jinnah Barrage was recorded at 440,586 cusecs while the outflow was 434,278 cusecs.
After the flood warning for the coming days, the district administration along with revenue staff and rescue personnel got active in the Katcha area of the district.
In Mianwali tehsil, flood affected villages are Mooch, Hindalwala, Muhammad Sharifwali, Shamiwala, Rokhri Katcha, Tarrikhel and Ballokhel.
In Piplan tehsil, the villages affected by flood are Dhingana, Katcha Gujrat, Piplan Katcha and Kundian Kacha. In tehsil Isakhel, the affected villages are Qamar-Mushani, Isakhel Khacha, Cheena Pura, Darazwala and Katalewala.
It may be noted that a few days ago, floodwater inundated crop fields spread over thousands of acres in tehsils of Mianwali, Isakhel and Piplan. Hundreds of people were evacuated along with their cattle and belongings.
As soon the floodwater decreased, the residents of the affected areas returned to their homes. The flood control centre and flood relief camps are being made functional to help the flood affected people.
Mianwali Deputy Commissioner Khalid Javed Goraya along with members of various departments is visiting the affected areas daily, urging the people to move to safer places. He is inspecting the flood relief camps and directing the staff to remain alert to serve the flood victims.
As per Rescue 1122, it rescued 81 people during the last two days.
The rescue teams are alert in the affected areas and they are rescuing the people using 18 boats in the operation.
In Toba Tek Singh, Commissioner Maryam Khan on Tuesday visited the flood relief camps set up in the low-lying areas of the Chenab River in Jhang and reviewed the facilities provided there. She inspected the availability of medicines, attendance of doctors and staff at the flood relief camps.
Jhang DC Ali Akbar Bhinder apprised her that Rescue 1122, health and livestock departments, and revenue staff were on duty on round the clock at the flood relief camps while Rescue 1122 staff are fully alert in low-lying areas so that immediate relief operations in any emergency.
Commissioner Khan said the residents living in the Chenab river basin should be informed about the water level and flood situation moment by moment. She further directed that arrangements for tractors and trolleys should be ensured for the timely evacuation of people from the low-lying areas so that any loss of life could be avoided.
In Okara, the irrigation department has briefed MPA Mian Noorul Amin Nasir Wattoo and Assistant Commissioner Faisal Walid that there is a low-level flood at Head Sulenmanki in Sutlej.
On query, it was told that the medicines and food for humans and fodder for animals were arranged while shifting of affectees to safer side was properly managed by the district administration with the cooperation of Rescue 1122 and local volunteers.
The floodwater is likely to damage crops but there is no serious threat to the people.

“Seventy-six citizens of the country… lost their lives in the incident, and three others were seriously injured,” Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi, Herat provincial government spokesman, said in a statement.
Police in Guzara district outside Herat city, where the accident took place on Tuesday night, said the bus collided with a motorcycle and a truck carrying fuel, sparking a fire.
The bus was carrying Afghans recently returned from Iran to the capital Kabul, Saeedi told AFP on Tuesday.
At least 1.5 million people have returned to Afghanistan since the start of this year from Iran and Pakistan, both of which have sought to force migrants out after decades of hosting them, according to the UN migration agency.
The state-run Bakhtar News Agency said Tuesday’s accident was one of the deadliest in the country in recent years.
Traffic accidents are common in Afghanistan, due in part to poor roads after decades of conflict, dangerous driving on highways and a lack of regulation.
In December last year, two bus accidents involving a fuel tanker and a truck on a highway through central Afghanistan killed at least 52.</p><small>2025-08-20 06:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/200758339e89d96.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932013/heavy-monsoon-spell-forecast-for-sindh-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy monsoon spell forecast for Sindh, Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday forecast torrential rains in Sindh, parts of Balochistan, and other regions of the country in the coming days, advising the provincial disaster management authorities to make necessary arrangements.
According to the Met Office, strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are continuously penetrating the country, particularly the southern parts.
Under the influence of these conditions, widespread rain-wind/thundershowers, with scattered heavy falls, at times very heavy, are expected in Mithi, Tharparkar, Umer Kot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar, and Jamshoro, while scattered showers are likely in Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, and Jacobabad till August 22 with occasional gaps.
In Balochistan, rain-wind/thundershowers, with scattered heavy falls, are expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibi, Zhob, Qila Saifullah, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Kech, Gwadar, and Panjgur till August 22 with occasional gaps.
Subdued rain-wind/thundershowers are expected at isolated places in Islamabad, Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and upper Punjab (Rawalpindi, Attock, Murree/Galliyat, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Lahore, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, and Rajanpur), as well as in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, and Swabi) till August 22.

LOCALS work to restore a water channel in the Huracho area of Shigar.—Dawn

GILGIT: Thousands in Gilgit-Baltistan remained without potable water, electricity, and road access on Tuesday, as life returned to normalcy in the aftermath of flash floods that had ravaged the mountainous region since July this year.
On Tuesday, there were no floods in the GB rivers, and local volunteers had started to restore water channels and roads in several parts of the region. However, several roads remained blocked, including the Naltar Highway and the Ghizer-Shandur Road. The Baltistan Highway, which was blocked in the Roundu valley of Skardu, had finally been reopened on Tuesday, said officials.
Meanwhile, due to roadblocks, drinking water, irrigation, and road communication issues have compounded in the flood-affected areas, particularly in Ghizer, Skardu, Ghanche, and Gilgit. Similarly, residents complained of a severe water shortage in Danyor, Skardu and Ghanche.
A resident of Mazher Haldi village in Ghanche district in Baltis­tan said that their village had suffered four floods since mid-July. The repeated disasters have left the community in ruins, with hou­ses swept away, agricultural lands destroyed, and families forced to abandon their homes, he added.

Residents complain of water shortage in several districts

The district administration has provided temporary tents, and the affected families have been relocated to Payo Thang Haldi. However, the villagers have urged the authorities to declare a flood emergency in Haldi. The displaced residents taking refuge in Payo Thang Haldi were living without clean drinking water, electricity, proper sanitation, and food supplies. The destruction of the water supply lines, electricity connections, and road networks had made their survival even more difficult.
 
 

Meanwhile, the Ghizer Rescue 1122 teams continued their rescue activities in the flood-affected areas of Daen village for the fifth consecutive day. Patients and other vulnerable groups had been safely transported from Daen to safe locations in rescue boats.
As the weather becomes normal, locals citing indigenous knowledge said the weather starts changing from August 15, and snow starts freezing on the mountains by mid-August. On Tuesday morning, there was a little snowfall on the mountains as well.
A day earlier, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said Ghizer was the most-affected district, as the mountainous reg­ion faced one of the worst floods that had killed 39 people, including tourists, since July. These disasters have caused damage to the tune of Rs30 billion, he had said.
“At least two dozen people have been injured so far; 35 small and large bridges have been washed away; a dozen mosques and ‘Jamaat Khanas’ have been damaged, and more than half a dozen buildings of educational institutions have been damaged,” he said. About 350 houses were completely destroyed and at least 600 houses had sustained partial damage, he had added.

The investigation will be led by former federal secretary Shahid Khan, following complaints from industrial and CNG consumers who received sudden bills for past gas dues, dating back to 2015.
Sources confirmed that the prime minister has constituted a special inquiry committee to examine the matter. The dispute centres around the Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Company Ltd (SNGPL), which issued revised bills for the period between April 2015 and June 2022. These bills were based on updated notifications from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to these notifications, the industrial sector owes Rs14.4bn, the power sector Rs40bn (ultimately payable by electricity consumers), the CNG sector Rs3.8bn, and the fertiliser sector Rs2.4bn. The total payables amount to Rs59.8bn, including Rs51.3bn in differential gas charges and approximately Rs8bn in general sales tax (GST), in addition to late payment charges.
 
 

The issue has sparked concern, particularly among the industrial sector, which claims to have secured stay orders in the past to avoid such payments. Around 2,950 industrial consumers and 1,200 CNG consumers have protested, arguing they have strong legal grounds to challenge the additional charges. These groups assert that over the past decade, they have either exported or sold products and had no means to pass on the extra billing costs.
This billing dispute is further complicated by a Rs76bn subsidy claim against the government. The differential in Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) prices for export-oriented industries and the fertiliser sector is subsidised by the government, but the amounts recoverable from consumers have been billed.
Both Ogra and SNGPL have blamed each other for the legal errors. SNGPL sources explained that Ogra issued actualised RLNG prices for the period from April 2015 to June 2022 in December 2024, but later removed the revised notifications from its website following amendments requested by Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL). Ogra subsequently re-issued the RLNG prices on March 28, 2025, covering a period of 84 months. SNGPL has charged the differential amount to RLNG consumers under the gas sales agreement (GSA) clause 3.
The sources further argued that Ogra should not have revised the RLNG rates from ten years ago. Instead, they suggested the authority should have pursued recovery of the differential amount between the provisional RLNG prices and the actualised rates on a prospective basis, similar to how the fertiliser sector handled its payments.
They warned that retroactive claims could be nearly impossible to collect, with consumers likely to seek stay orders in court. This could undermine confidence in the regulated gas sector and fuel the growth of private entities outside the regulatory framework.
Ogra spokesperson Imran Ghaznavi defended the regulator’s actions, stating that it had been determining monthly provisional RLNG prices, which were now actualised. He clarified that, according to the Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) and the SNGPL Consumer Service Manual, the differential between the provisional and actual RLNG prices was recoverable in future bills, not in a single bill.

The rains also delayed export shipments as goods carriers were unable to move due to flooded roads and overflowing nullahs.
The industrial sector, which typically operates in three shifts, faced significant disruptions. The morning shift was only partially affected, but the torrential downpour in the afternoon led to widespread flooding, which caused a complete halt to the second and third shifts. Many industrialists had to reschedule export shipments planned for the evening, while some were forced to delay deliveries until Wednesday.
Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Junaid Naqi said that 20-30 per cent of workers in over 4,000 industries in Korangi could not make it to work due to the rains. Those who did arrive opted to leave early as the rains worsened in the afternoon.
“Overall, productivity in the area was 50pc lower due to workers leaving early,” Naqi said, adding that many workers were stranded on the roads due to the submersion of main thoroughfares.
 
 

In addition, many workers’ children were also reportedly stuck at their educational institutions until late at night, further compounding the situation. Industrial operations typically run across three eight-hour shifts, but the absence of workers due to the rains led to the cancellation of afternoon and night shifts.
Site Association of Industry (SAI) President Ahmed Azeem Alvi reported that while production remained normal in over 3,500 units, many workers left by 4pm, only to find themselves stuck in traffic caused by flooded roads and overflowing gutters. “Women workers in particular faced severe difficulties due to the lack of public transport in the evening,” Alvi said, adding that the cancellation of shifts would pose problems for export-oriented industries.
Alvi also pointed out that some workers had been forced to stay at the factories due to road closures and transport shortages. “It’s disappointing that no city authority has taken responsibility for managing the drainage system, despite Karachi’s vital role in generating revenue,” he said.
Sheikh Mohammad Tehseen, President of the F.B. Area Association of Trade and Industry (FBATI), said attendance at over 1,000 units in F.B. Area was down by 20-25pc. He predicted that Wednesday would be even more challenging, as many workers who had struggled to return home on Tuesday may be unable to make it to work depending on the weather. “If the rains continue for another two or three days, industrial production will be severely impacted,” Tehseen warned.
In the retail sector, trading activity in the old city area, home to over 10,000 shops, was almost negligible. Sharjeel Gopalani, Patron-in-Chief of the All City Tajir Itehad, said that many shop owners stayed home after the morning rains, while those who did show up left by 3pm as rainwater flooded markets.
Haji Shahjehan, President of the Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market, reported that the footfall of customers in the New Subzi Mandi Super Highway wholesale market had been very low due to the heavy downpour. Additionally, supplies of vegetables from the upcountry were delayed.
With more rain forecast for the coming days, the industrial sector and retail markets in Karachi face an uncertain future, as widespread flooding continues to hamper both production and transport.
North Karachi Association of Trade and Industry (NKATI) President  Faisal Moiz Khan said 80pc of the 4,500 units in the area halted production due to worker absenteeism. With 70pc of NKATI’s industries export-oriented, the suspension of second and third shifts will cause major disruptions. He added that rain and road closures have severely affected the supply chain for goods and raw materials.

“Prime minister’s upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC Phase-II, with both sides expected to set clear priorities and agree on tangible, measurable outcomes,” said an official announcement quoting Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, focal person on the multi-billion-dollar bilateral initiative, as saying at a high-level meeting.
The meeting was convened to review preparations for the forthcoming session of the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) of CPEC, as well as the prime minister’s scheduled visit to Beijing.
While the JCC is expected to meet in October, official sources said the prime minister will travel to Beijing at the end of this month to attend the Shanghai Coope­ration Organisation (SCO) summit (Aug 31-Sept 1). On the sidelines, he is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Both sides expected to set clear priorities, agree on tangible outcomes for the new phase

The planning minister stressed that the future of CPEC “must be anchored in quality rather than quantity,” emphasising that only carefully selected, high-impact projects should be advanced to ensure sustainability and institutional strengthening.
He also disclosed that during his recent visit to China, he had conveyed PM Shehbaz’s invitation to President Xi to visit Islamabad in 2026 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China.
 
 

Underscoring the need to expand Pakistan’s trade and export footprint in China, the minister directed the authorities concerned to resolve visa processing delays on priority to facilitate genuine businesspersons. He also instructed the preparation of an outcome-focused plan to diversify exports, enhance industrial linkages, and maximise benefits from market access under CPEC.
On human resource development, Mr Iqbal highlighted the importance of utilising the 10,000 training opportunities offered by China across multiple sectors. He stressed the need for a transparent framework to ensure that the right people receive training aligned with institutional needs, enabling Pakistan to secure durable capacity-building gains.
The meeting also reviewed progress in priority areas, including the Multan-Sukkur Motorway, IT graduate training, computational infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI), industrial relocation, industrial parks, mining, special economic zones, and agriculture.
It was decided to conduct data-driven studies on China’s industrial relocation trends and to map market segments where Pakistan has export strengths.
The minister noted that with China importing goods worth over $2 trillion annually, Pakistan should strategically aim to capture at least $30-50bn of this trade by building competitiveness and sectoral readiness.
He directed completion of an outcome-oriented study to identify high-potential export sectors, with the goal of creating an exportable surplus, attracting sustained investment, and strengthening the balance of payments over the medium term.
Calling for policy continuity and institutional reforms, the minister stressed the need for close engagement with the private sector, academia, and research institutions in areas such as industrial cooperation, technology, agriculture, energy, and human resource development.
According to projections, AI could contribute Rs24.9tr ($88.31bn) to Pakistan’s economy by 2030, raising the projected GDP of Rs171tr by 14.56pc. Agriculture, which makes up 24pc of GDP, could see 20+30pc productivity gains through AI-powered precision farming, while manufacturing and mining (15.1pc of GDP) may achieve 20-25pc improvements via automation.
Similarly, fintech (2pc) and the software industry (1.5pc) are projected to grow 20-30pc, while energy (3.8pc), defence (3.5pc), law & judiciary (1pc), and international collaborations (2pc) also hold 10-20pc growth potential, the minister said.

“On August 20 of this year, Mr Wang Yi, a member of the political bureau of the Chinese ruling party and foreign minister, and Mr Ishaq Dar, deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Pakistan, will travel to Kabul to attend a trilateral meeting,” the Afghanistan foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.

“The participants of the meeting are expected to exchange views on the future of relations based on common interests, mutual understanding, and broad cooperation,” the ministry said. The gathering, the first of its kind hosted in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control of Kabul, will bring together Wang, Dar and Afghan Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for a day-long dialogue.

Chinese diplomat to visit Islamabad on Thursday to co-chair high-level moot

Mr Wang will also hold bilateral meetings with senior Taliban leaders on political and economic cooperation. The last round of trilateral talks among the three countries’ foreign ministers was held in Beijing on May 21.
Islamabad visit
Following the Kabul meeting, the Chinese foreign minister is scheduled to travel to Islamabad to attend the Pakistan-China strategic dialogue on Aug 21, Dawn.com reported.

• Other telcos also experience data service disruptions
ISLAMABAD: Heavy rainfall in Karachi caused widespread disruptions to PTCL internet and Ufone services, affecting subscribers across the country.
Since other telecom operators purchase wholesale internet from PTCL, users of Jazz, Zong and Telenor also experienced data service disruptions.
Netblocks, a global internet watchdog, confirmed a major disruption to internet connectivity across Pakistan, with PTCL being significantly impacted. National connectivity dropped to 20 per cent of ordinary levels.
Responding to a query, a PTCL spokesperson acknowledged the issue. “Our teams are diligently working to restore the services as quickly as possible. We regret any inconvenience caused,” the spokesperson said but did not mention the cause for the nationwide outage.
Sources in the Ministry of IT and Telecom suggested that the disruption might be due to a technical fault at the landing station of submarine cables in Karachi’s Clifton area.
“No submarine cable issue has been reported, so the problem is likely at the landing station and some technical fault in the main hub,” and official said. “As a result, it’s a nationwide outage now with upstream traffic facing issues too.”
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said in a statement that technical teams were working to resolve the issue.
IT Minister Shaza Fatima attributed the disruptions to power outages and network congestion, with many towers down in Karachi.
“The other localised issue is temporary choking of the network as too many people were stranded at the same spot and almost everyone was either making calls or receiving them. And now with PTCL going dead, all connectivity has shifted at telephony creating more choking,” Ms Fatima added.
Karachi’s 12 million mobile phone subscribers were affected, with the load shifting to the remaining three telcos after Ufone’s service disruption.
A PTA official noted that running generators for 12 hours was not feasible, and supplying diesel to towers was challenging in the current situation.
He added that more than 200 telecom sites (towers) were damaged in the flood in KP and most of the towers were restored in flood-affected areas of Swat, Buner, Shangla, etc, and the teams were ensuring restoration of remaining sites.
As heavy urban flooding hit Karachi, residents faced telephony disruptions in many areas, losing connections with each other.
Saher, a Gulistan-i-Jauhar resident, expressed concern: “I received one call from my husband, Jamal, saying he was stuck on the street, but his phone isn’t connecting since sunset. I’m really worried.”

• Villages in flood-hit districts cut off due to landslides; bridges washed away in downpour
• Tarar says 25,000 people rescued in past two days, vows unified response to ‘national emergency’
• ISPR chief says nine units of military, paramilitary actively involved in KP, GB relief efforts
ISLAMABAD: As the government vowed to step up relief efforts in the flood-hit districts, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa continued to reel under the impact of torrential rains with more flash floods reported in several districts of the province.
KP Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) said the death toll since Friday had surged to 365, including 225 in the worst-affected Buner, while more than 180 people sustained injuries over the past several days.
On Tuesday, Upper and Lower South Waziristan districts fared the worst: one woman was killed in Upper South Waziristan. Upper South Waziristan’s Servekai subdivision was the hardest hit, where raging torrents washed away roads and bridges. The Tanga road was blocked due to landslides, while the Spalatoi, Bangashwala, and Madina Mor bridges collapsed due to the heavy flow, severing road links with remote villages.
Likewise, heavy rainfall triggered flash floods in the hill streams of Tank district and surrounding areas, sending powerful torrents into the city and submerging several localities. Offi­cials said a flooded stream coming from South Waziristan reached Tank’s Garah Baloch village and submerged the city. The floodwater rose above the Garah Baloch bridge, forcing the closure of the Tank-Waziristan highway to all types of traffic. The main South Waziristan road was also blocked, disconnecting the road link between the two districts.
The floodwater also entered low-lying neighbourhoods, forcing the residents in the vulnerable areas to move to safer places amid a rise in the water level.
Though the district administration, along with rescue teams and heavy machinery, remained stationed at the Garah Baloch bridge to monitor the situation, the officials feared incessant rainfall could worsen the flooding and pose a greater danger to Tank’s urban and rural settlements.
In Abbottabad, the downpour damaged the Lora Nagri Bridge and cut off access to hundreds of villages. The bridge, a vital connection between Tehsil Lora and Rawalpindi and Abbottabad, partially collapsed, causing a complete halt in traffic. The central structure is reported to be sinking, further threatening its integrity.
Swabi toll surges to 24
In Swabi, the death toll in the Gadoon Amazi area surged to 24, including eight children, as the search for people swept away in flash floods continued on Tuesday. Rahim Jadoon, the Topi mayor, told Dawn that 23 people had been buried. Seven bodies were recovered on Tuesday.
Mr Jadoon, present in the affected area, said that as per the locals, about a dozen people were still buried under the rubble: “Over 12 houses collapsed in Dalori,” he confirmed.
 
 

As the entire village of Dalori and its surroundings were reeling from the shock, the locals could not even mourn their dead. “No one is in a position to hold a traditional three-day mourning period, as more and more bodies are being recovered,” locals said, adding, “We are in a complete state of pain and misery.”
In separate development rescuers have recovered the dead body of man who drowned in the Karnal Sher Khan’s area on Monday.
Rangaiz Khan, provincial minister for transport who was elected from the area, said that the district authorities did not have excavators, forcing the district administration and other departments to hire them from private contractors.
 
 

In Mansehra, rescuers, including volunteers and officials of Tehsil Municipal Administration and Rescue 1122, on Tuesday recovered another body from the flood-hit Haleem Bandi Neelband area of the district.
“A total of 20 men, women and children were swept away in the flood earlier this week, and now 18 bodies have been recovered. The search for the remaining two is still underway,” Mazhar Muzafar Awan, Baffa-Pakhal tehsil municipal officer, told reporters.
‘Unified response’
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the government was dealing with this “national emergency under a national response and all relevant departments, including the armed forces of Pakistan, are working in complete unison in this regard”, state-owned Radio Pakistan reported.
He was briefing the media persons along with Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and National Disaster Management Author­ity Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik in Islamabad.
The minister said at least 25,000 people affected due to floods caused by torrential rains had been rescued since Aug 17 and moved to safer places, adding that almost 70 per cent of the electricity infrastructure damaged by floods had been restored.
The NDMA chief said bodies of many missing people, trapped under the rubble, had been retrieved, adding that the authority had already dispatched two relief convoys carrying relief goods to Swabi, Malakand and Buner, while another convoy would leave for Shangla.
‘Search and rescue, and flood relief operations’
The ISPR DG, as per Dawn.com, provided a summary of the efforts by the military in the northern areas in the wake of the monsoon rains. He said that KP received eight units of Infantry and Frontier Constabulary (FC), who were directly involved in search and rescue, and flood relief operations, while GB had one, taking the total to nine units.
He also said that one engineer brigade, two engineer battalions and two urban search and rescue teams were deployed in KP, while two engineer battalions were sent to GB, where they were “working on road opening and removing landslides”.
“Three medical units were deployed in KP, while nine medical camps were deployed in GB. More than 6,304 people have been treated.”
“In search and rescue operations, 6,903 people have been rescued,” he added.
Gen Chaudhry also said that one-day rations were allocated, amounting to 585 tonnes, adding that army aviation was deployed to oversee medical casualty evacuation, emergencies, and transportation of food and medicine.
He highlighted that multiple bridges and roads were repaired, while the telecommunication infrastructure in affected areas, including Shangla and Buner, was being repaired alongside the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.
Speaking more specifically about affected regions, the DG ISPR said that the army deployed two battalions in Buner, two battalions in Shangla, one in Swat, one FC wing each in Bajaur and Dir, and one company in Swabi.
“These are dedicated resources … which were deployed 24 hours for flood relief rescue operations,” he said.
While speaking about logistics support, the DG said, “In Peshawar, there were 2,500 ready-to-eat meals and 20 tonnes of rations. In Nowshera, there are 5,000 ready-to-eat meals and 505 tonnes of rations,” he said, adding that they were being transported by road and helicopters.
He also highlighted that 90 roads were damaged in KP. Of those, nine roads were fully operational and 86 were partially restored, he added.
UNDP sends aid
On the other hand, the UNDP Pakistan said it was actively assessing needs on the ground to bridge immediate humanitarian gaps while also laying the groundwork for longer-term recovery and resilience as the crisis unfolds in the wake of floods across the country.
“Our hearts go out to the families who have lost loved ones, homes and livelihoods,” said UNDP Officer-in-Charge Van Nguyen in a statement issued in Islamabad.
UNDP has provided emergency relief items to assist flood-affected families in the hardest-hit regions of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. These supplies include 180 tents, 103 stretchers, 230 sleeping bags, 130 floodlights and 53 first aid kits, among other essentials.
Muqaddam Khan in Swabi, Nisar Ahmed Khan in Manshera, A.K. Wazir in South Waziristan Lower,  Muhammad Irfan Mughal in Dera Ismail Khan and Rashid Javed in Abbottabad  contributed to this report.

US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles requests to stay in the United States or become a citizen, said it would expand vetting of the social media postings of applicants.
“America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies,” age­ncy spok­esman Matthew Trag­e­sser said in a statement.
“Immigration benefits — including to live and work in the United States — remain a privilege, not a right.” The US Immi­gration and Nationality Act, which dates back to 1952, defines anti-Americanism which at the time primarily focused on communists.
But the Trump administration has already moved aggressively to deny or rescind short-term visas for people deemed to go against US foreign policy interests, especially on Israel.
The latest guidance on immigration decisions said that authorities will also look at whether applicants “promote anti-Semitic ideologies.”
