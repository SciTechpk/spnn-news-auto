The resolution moved in the House by PPP’s Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan deplored the continued provocative steps and statements by the Israeli leadership that threatened the regional and international peace and stability, including the latest statement about forming “alliances” against Muslim nations.
Addressing a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country “will create an entire system — essentially a kind of hexagon of alliances — around or within the Middle East”, Times of Israel reported.
Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus, and “unnamed Arab, African and Asian countries”, the report added.
“The intention here is to create an axis of countries that see reality, the challenges, and the goals in the same way, in contrast to the radical axes,” he was quoted as saying.
“Both the radical Shia axis, which we have hit very hard, and also the emerging axis — the radical Sunni axis,” Netanyahu added.

 

The Indian PM is also set to visit Israel this week.
In its resolution passed today, the Senate also condemned any attempts by Israel to undermine the “sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of brotherly Islamic countries and rejected” the announcement made by Israel recognising the independence of the so-called Somaliland region of Somalia.
On Dec 26, 2025, Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, sparking strong condemnation from Pakistan, 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
The Senate also condemned in the strongest possible terms the Israeli occupying power’s continued violations of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, as well as its blatant disregard of international law, the UN Charter, relevant UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, and the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
The House took strong exception to the “vile proclivity of the leadership of the Israeli occupying power towards diminishing the unity and integrity of Muslim Ummah on political and ideological grounds”.

 

It rejected any attempt by Israel to change the legal or historical status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the status of the holy sites; enforce any new legal and administrative reality in the occupied territory, especially the Occupied West Bank; expand its illegal settlement activities in the occupied territory, and encourage settler violence; or forcibly displace Palestinians from their land.
The Senate urged the international community to “end Israeli impunity and to hold it accountable for its crimes against humanity, as well as its provocative actions that pose a threat to all regional countries”.
It demanded full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories; increased, sustained, and unimpeded humanitarian assistance to the beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza, including through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA); and an early start of the recovery and reconstruction process in Gaza.
The House reaffirmed historic and unwavering support of the people of Pakistan for the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination and for the establishment of an independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.</p><small>2026-02-25 07:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2510260236a42a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975656/indias-modi-heads-to-israel-to-strengthen-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Modi heads to Israel to ‘strengthen cooperation’</strong></a><br><p>India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi flew to Israel on Wednesday for a two-day visit to deepen ties with a key trade and defence partner, stirring criticism at home.
“Our nations share a robust and multifaceted strategic partnership,” Modi said in a departure statement, saying he will meet his counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu and address the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.
“Ties have significantly strengthened in the last few years.”
New Delhi has steadily expanded co-operation with Israel across the defence, agriculture, technology and cyber-security sectors while balancing diplomatic interests in the Middle East.
Talks opened in New Delhi on Monday for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s government said in a statement, noting that total merchandise trade was $3.62 billion in 2024–2025.
Modi said he would hold talks with Netanyahu to “discuss ways to strengthen co-operation”, as well as meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1992. Ties deepened after Hindu-nationalist leader Modi took office in 2014.
Modi visited Israel as prime minister in 2017, before Netanyahu made a reciprocal visit to India the following year.
Both right-wing leaders have called each other a “friend”.
In September 2023, grand plans were unveiled in New Delhi for an India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor – to link railways, ports, electricity, data networks and pipelines, including through Saudi Arabia and Israel.
Those plans were stalled by Hamas’s October 7 actions against Israel, which responded with a devastating war in the Gaza Strip, killing over 71,000 Palestinians.
One of India’s largest conglomerates, Adani Group, operates the Mediterranean port of Haifa, while Israeli military drone technology was deployed against Pakistan during the conflict between the two nuclear powers in May 2025.
At the same time, India maintains strong relations with Gulf nations and Tehran, including developing Iran’s Chabahar port — a trade gateway to Afghanistan, where New Delhi has built a relationship with Taliban authorities.
Modi displaying ‘moral cowardice’: Congress
On the other hand, the opposition Indian National Congress launched a scathing attack on Modi over his visit to Israel.
Senior Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi — sister of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi — said she hoped Modi would mention the killing of “thousands of innocent men, women and children in Gaza” when he addresses Israel’s parliament and demand “justice for them”.
“India has stood for what is right throughout our history as an independent nation, we must continue to show the light of truth, peace and justice to the world,” she said on X.







Congress parliamentarian Jairam Ramesh said Modi will be displaying “moral cowardice” when the entire world is critical of his “dear friend” Netanyahu.
He said Modi was “brazenly embracing” his Israeli counterpart, who has “reduced Gaza to rubble and dust and who is orchestrating the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank”.
“On May 20, 1960, Jawaharlal Nehru was in Gaza and met with the Indian contingent of the UN Emergency Force there,” Ramesh recalled.







Days ago, Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus and unnamed Arab, African, and Asian countries as part of a “hexagon of alliances” against “radical axes” of Muslim nations.
India, the world’s most populous nation with 1.4bn people, is majority Hindu, but an estimated 220 million Indians are Muslim.

The attack occurred on Tuesday at around 7pm when a suicide bomber detonated explosives near the checkpost, located a short distance from the bridge connecting Dera Ismail Khan with Punjab. CCTV footage reportedly showed the attacker approaching the post before carrying out the blast.
Two police personnel were martyred in the explosion, while four others sustained injuries. All injured personnel were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, where their treatment is ongoing.
Following the attack, security was placed on high alert in both DI Khan and Bhakkar districts. Punjab police sealed the road near the Dera Darya Khan bridge and suspended all traffic as a precautionary measure, while a search operation was launched in the surrounding areas.
The continued closure of the inter-provincial route has caused significant inconvenience to travelers and transporters. Vehicles remained stranded for hours, and passengers were forced to seek alternative routes at additional expense.
The disruption comes days after the same route remained blocked for several days due to protests by the PTI, which had already affected the movement of goods and people.
Traders in DI Khan said repeated closures had disrupted supply lines from Punjab, particularly from Lahore and other major commercial centres.
President of the Markazi Anjuman-i-Tajiran, Sohail Ahmed Azmi, said the prolonged suspension of traffic was compounding the difficulties faced by the business community. He warned that with Ramazan underway and Eidul Fitr approaching, any further delay in the transportation of goods from Punjab could result in financial losses and possible shortages in local markets.
Azmi urged the regional police authorities in Bhakkar to restore traffic after conducting necessary security checks, stating that while security concerns were understandable in the aftermath of the attack, the extended closure of the highway was adding to public hardship.
Officials have yet to announce when the route will be reopened.
KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.</p><small>2026-02-25 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25114728b004ecb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975661/5-key-moments-from-trumps-record-breaking-state-of-the-union-address' target='_blank'><strong>5 key moments from Trump’s record-breaking State of the Union address</strong></a><br><p>For the first State of the Union address of his second term, United States President Donald Trump decided to go long, broaching everything from the economy to Iran during his one-hour-and-47-minute speech to Congress.
Here are five key moments from the longest-ever State of the Union address:
Supreme Court tension
Upon entering the US Capitol, Trump shook hands with several Supreme Court justices in attendance — three of whom had ruled days earlier to strike down the global tariffs he had made his signature economic policy.
Trump voiced his displeasure during the speech, calling the ruling “very unfortunate,” as the justices watched on from the front row.
The president did not dwell long on the subject, however, and said his administration was already planning a legal workaround to keep the duties he insists will be paid for by foreign countries.

 


Team USA unifies
During a speech marked by political divides between Trump’s Republicans and opposition Democrats, one of the few moments of unity occurred when the gold medal-winning US men’s Olympic hockey team entered the room.
The entire audience rose and applauded, chanting “USA! USA!” in unison, to recognise the Olympians, who clinched America’s first ice hockey gold in 46 years.



Democratic lawmaker expelled
Congress plays a key, performative role during the State of the Union, applauding and standing up in agreement with the president or sitting still to voice their displeasure.
Dozens of Democrats skipped the event altogether, and those in attendance largely stayed seated except on rare occasions.
Several wore white to pay homage to the suffragette movement celebrating women’s right to vote, or donned pins demanding accountability over those named in the files released on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
In one notable act of resistance, Democratic lawmaker Al Green was expelled after holding up a sign reading “Black people aren’t apes!” in response to a racist video of the Obamas shared by Trump.



Ilhan Omar heckles Trump
Tensions soared when House Democrat Ilhan Omar, who has frequently sparred with Trump, shouted at the president while he spoke.
“You should be ashamed of yourselves,” Trump told Democrats in attendance, who had refused to stand up throughout his address.
“You have killed Americans,” Omar shouted in response, in reference to the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents dispatched to Minneapolis last month.
The lawmaker, whose district represents Minneapolis, later left the speech before Trump had finished.



Longest speech ever
At one hour and 47 minutes, Trump delivered the longest State of the Union speech in US history, beating the previous record of one hour and 20 minutes set by former president Bill Clinton in 2000.
The speech even outlasted Trump’s address to Congress last year shortly after taking office, which lasted one hour and 40 minutes.

The formulation, which projected readiness for talks while keeping the option of military force deliberately ambiguous, reflected his broader doctrine of “peace through strength.”

Trump argued that a rebuilt US military and higher defence spending by Nato allies had strengthened Washington’s hand.
At the same time, he asserted that Iran was developing missiles capable of reaching the United States and complained: “We haven’t heard those secret words (from Iran): ‘We will never have a nuclear weapon.’”
He blamed Tehran for pursuing a “sinister nuclear program” and claimed that earlier US strikes had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear weapons capabilities.
Trump’s Tuesday night State of the Union address lasted one hour and 47 minutes — the longest before a joint session of Congress in at least six decades, according to the American Presidency Project.

As American television commentators noted, the president turned the annual constitutional ritual into an extended political performance aimed at boosting his approval ratings and energising Republican voters ahead of this year’s midterm elections.
Trump also briefly brought South Asia into the address, highlighting his peacemaking role in ending the May 2025 war between Pakistan and India, claiming that his efforts “saved millions” of lives by preventing the conflict from turning nuclear.
“Pakistan and India … it would have been a nuclear war. Thirty-five million people, the prime minister of Pakistan said, would have died if not for my involvement,” he declared.
Repeating his claim that he had halted eight wars in his first 10 months in office, he snapped at sceptics in the chamber: “Isn’t it funny? Sick people,” while glancing toward those who laughed.
Despite weeks of the largest US military buildup in the Middle East in two decades, Trump did not signal whether he was prepared to order a strike on Iran. He waited more than an hour before addressing the issue and avoided any reference to the scale of American deployments in the region, underscoring a speech that, even on foreign policy, largely followed a domestic political script.
Trump accused Tehran and its allies of being responsible for roadside bombings that “have killed US service members and civilians.“ He also referred to the killing of General Qasem Soleimani, saying “we took out Soleimani” and that it had a “big impact”.

Within the same sweep of foreign affairs, he hailed what he called a “colossal victory for the security of the United States” in Venezuela and introduced Enrique Marquez, an opposition lawmaker freed from prison after the US abduction of President Nicolás Maduro, telling a relative in the gallery: “I’m pleased to inform you that not only has your uncle been released, but he is here tonight.”
The address began with a campaign-style flourish — “Our nation is back: bigger, better, richer, and stronger than ever before!” — and quickly led to a sharply polarised spectacle.

When Trump asked those who believed “the first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens” to stand, Republicans rose and applauded for several minutes while Democrats remained seated, prompting him to say: “You should be ashamed of yourselves, not standing up.”
Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib repeatedly shouted, “You have killed Americans!” and “You should be ashamed!” as the speech continued, while Al Green was escorted from the chamber earlier after waving a protest sign reading “Black People Aren’t Apes,” an apparent reference to a video Trump had reposted on Truth Social depicting the Obamas as apes.
Trump directed much of his gaze toward the Republican side, basking in applause, but as he moved into immigration, crime, election security, and gender issues, he increasingly addressed Democrats directly, saying:
“These people are crazy, I’m telling ya, they’re crazy … Democrats are destroying our country, but we’ve stopped it just in the nick of time.”

On immigration, he renewed attacks on Somali Americans, referring to “the Somali pirates who ransacked Minnesota” and arguing that “importing these cultures through unrestricted immigration and open borders brings those problems right here to the USA, and it is the American people who pay the price”.
On economic policy, he criticised a recent Supreme Court decision against his tariffs as “very unfortunate” and said the duties would remain in place under “fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes,” adding: “Congressional action will not be necessary.”
Turning to prices, he blamed Democrats for inflation and told Americans: “Just hold on a little while we’re getting it down, and soon you will see numbers that few people would think were possible to achieve.”
He also urged passage of the SAVE America Act, requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration, a measure Democrats have pledged to block in the Senate.
At another point, Trump took aim at New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani as the “new communist mayor of New York City,” before adding in a softer aside: “I think he’s a nice guy. Bad policy, but nice guy.”

For much of the evening, the visual tableau — a president speaking almost exclusively to one side of the chamber while the other jeered — mirrored the substance: an address that fused campaign mobilisation at home with selective, carefully timed signals abroad, particularly on Iran, where the decisive choice between diplomacy and force remained conspicuously unstated.</p><small>2026-02-25 06:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/251101075c614f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975658/kse-100-gains-over-800-points-in-early-trading' target='_blank'><strong>KSE-100 gains over 800 points in early trading</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, gained 838.67 points from its previous close of 166,258.54 by 10:40am on Wednesday.
This 0.5 per cent rise during early trading comes as the market began to pick up after losing 400 points by 10am.
Volatility persisted in the market on Wednesday, following Tuesday’s particularly turbulent session that saw the index swing from an intraday gain of 1,546 points to a steep decline of 3,783 points as selling pressure intensified.
So far today, the index has touched a high of 168,191.64 and a low of 165,819.42, underscoring continued instability in trading activity.
The top active stocks so far were led by Cnergyico PK Ltd., which rose 12.69pc to Rs7.46 at a volume of 48,242,450, followed by First National Equities Ltd., which rose 3.40pc to Rs1.52 at a volume of 23,490,831, and National Bank of Pakistan, which rose 5.96pc to Rs266.25 at a volume of 16,963,676.
The top advancers so far were led by Media Times Ltd., which rose 15.25pc to Rs5.44, followed by Cnergyico PK Ltd. and Telecard Ltd., which rose 10.87pc to Rs9.28.

As analysts debate whether the recent market downturn reflects a natural correction or is the result of rising geopolitical uncertainty, an equally important factor to watch may be the impact corporate earnings reports could have on investor sentiment.</p><small>2026-02-25 06:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/25104013c648a89.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975657/iftar-sehri-timings-for-ramazan-78' target='_blank'><strong>Iftar, Sehri timings for Ramazan 7/8</strong></a><br><p>Times for today’s Iftar (Ramazan 7) and tomorrow’s Sehri (Ramazan 8) for the federal and provincial capitals are listed below:

A joint statement by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Brazil, France, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Egypt, Pakistan, Luxembourg, Norway, Palestine, Portugal, Qatar, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, United Arab Emirates, the League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation said that recent changes made by Israel to reclaim land in the occupied West Bank as “state property” are “wide-ranging” and accelerate illegal settlement activity and further entrench Israeli administration.
Earlier this month, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of international law, which states that an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories. The measures would increase Israeli civilian authority in Areas A and B of the West Bank, which together constitute roughly 40 per cent of the territory.
“These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” said the joint statement, also shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on X.







“We are clear that Israel’s illegal settlements, and decisions designed to further them, are a flagrant violation of international law, including previous United Nations Security Council Resolutions and the 2024 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice.”
“These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” added the joint statement.
The statement, referring to the Trump-brokered Gaza ceasefire and the subsequent 20-point plan for Gaza, said it threatens any meaningful prospect of regional integration.
“We call on the Government of Israel to reverse them immediately, to respect its international obligations, and to refrain from actions that would result in permanent changes to the legal and administrative status of the occupied Palestinian Territory,” the statement said further.
According to the statement, the decisions made by Tel Aviv follow the “unprecedented acceleration” of Israel’s settlement policy and such actions amount to a “deliberate and direct attack” on the viability of a Palestinian state and the implementation of the Two-State Solution.
“In that context, we reiterate our rejection of all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem. We oppose any form of annexation.”
The statement called upon Israel to put an end to settler violence and hold those responsible accountable.
“We reaffirm our commitment to taking concrete steps, in accordance with international law, to counter the expansion of illegal settlements in Palestinian territory and policies and threats of forcible displacement and annexation.”
The nations stressed the importance of preserving, in the holy month of Ramazan, the “historic and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its Holy Sites”, recognising the special role of the historic Hashemite custodianship in this regard.
“We condemn repeated violations of the status quo in Jerusalem, which constitute a threat to regional stability.”
Earlier, the Palestinian Presidency slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, Wafa news agency reported.
Palestinian group Hamas also condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.
Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership.</p><small>2026-02-25 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699e654c13b49.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975630/federation-demolition' target='_blank'><strong>Federation demolition</strong></a><br><p>THE dismantling of democratic structures and institutions within the past decade will likely take many more decades to recover from. During this time, we’ve already seen a muzzle on the press, a scalpel to the courts, and are now deliberating a wrecking ball for the Pakistani federation. The idea of carving the country into more provinces is neither new nor original, and yet it resurfaces like a political influenza every so often. Just recently, it has given us a sustained campaign by the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party for 16 provinces, squabbles in the Sindh Assembly over a resolution against dividing Sindh, bickering between the PPP and PML-N over whose province should be bifurcated first, and wild rumours in Islamabad of what a potential 28th Amendment may look like.
People usually make this case for two reasons. One stems from a bottom-up demand for an ethnolinguistic group to be recognised, such as in South Punjab. The other is a top-down argument for efficiency that, in fact, cloaks a centralisation impulse within the language of decentralisation. The details may vary, but the broad idea is that the present structure is too top-heavy; that the provinces — supposedly empowered after the 18th Amendment — are too unwieldy as units. Breaking free from such provincial capture is presented as the ultimate technocratic solution.

 

The diagnosis is correct. Pakistan is highly centralised at both the provincial and — as is conveniently ignored in such analyses — federal levels, where the 60 or so cabinet positions belie any claims of right-sizing. It is also an established fact that decentralisation produces better results for more people in more places, and that it requires far greater devolution to the grassroots than is currently the case. However, if devolution is really the aim; if more responsive, more accountable governance is really the goal, then there is a perfectly usable and proven mechanism available in the form of local governments (LGs).
Over multiple decades now, every serious analysis of Pakistan’s governance landscape has reached the same conclusion: it is impossible to establish grassroots democracy or improve service delivery without a third tier of government. In this, there is no conceivable gain to be had from extra provinces that cannot be had from politically, administratively and fiscally empowered LGs. Assuming no ulterior motives or intellectual dishonesty, why would proponents of decentralisation not be rallying for meaningful devolution to the third tier rather than dismembering the second?

LGs need to exist as a logical extension of the federal structure.

Besides the bureaucracy — which has long occupied the vacuum left behind by LGs — it is a historical fact that our political leadership has resisted meaningfully backing the third tier, viewing it as a threat instead of a democratic opportunity. It is still entirely within their burden of responsibilities to generate enough cross-party momentum to reach a consensus. This is, admittedly, a challenge in the current political climate; and yet somehow seems less of a challenge than the creation of new provinces.
Beyond the technical shallowness of this idea, it is also devoid of any political memory. It completely disregards the political symbolism of the province and what it means to those who call it home. This is not meant as sentimentalism; it’s a lesson in history that lawmakers would do well to remember before taking an axe to the structure of the country. As much as centralising forces have categorised this as a thought-crime, it remains true that Pakistan was envisioned as a state comprised of multiple na­­tions. The ethnolingui­stic boundaries of our provinces matter. Re­­cognising, respecting and nourishing them makes the federation stronger, not weaker.
Provinces are also the bulwark of political resistance. This is why dictators love by­­passing them. This is also why, as any student of history knows, LGs have flourished during times of dictatorship, and have long been used to create an illusion of decentralisation, while circumventing the provincial tier and its political leadership. It falls to the guardians of Pakistan’s democratic structure to preserve the integrity of the second tier and take ownership of the third. In other words, LGs need to exist not as a replacement of the federal structure, but as a logical extension of it.
Political temperatures in this country are already soaring — especially at the peripheries of KP and Balochistan — and any tinkering with the federal structure will inevitably be seen as another power grab by the centre. The delicate balance of this federation has been built on hard-won battles and bitter lessons. It would be a waste for the architects of the 18th Amendment and the Charter of Democracy to throw it all away for short-term political gain.

Videos that went viral on social media show the delivery rider, 26-year-old Farhan Ali, standing on his bike in front of a house near the main Saba Avenue signal when the speeding car flipped over and crashed into him. The delivery rider died in the incident.
On Tuesday, South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the police “detained” the injured car driver, identified as Hasan Banghwar, and brought him to the Sahil police station for legal proceedings after his treatment.
He said he was released on ‘personal surety’ with the consent of the parents of the deceased.
Sahil SHO Hikmatullah said the police asked the deceased’s parents to give a statement to lodge an FIR. However, they told the police that they were taking the coffin to Thatta for burial and would approach the police later.
He said the car involved in the accident and the motorbike had been seized by the police.
He said investigations were under way and formal legal proceedings would be initiated depending upon the parents’ willingness to pursue the case legally.

While the planning ministry’s Household Integrated Economic Survey revealed that poverty had surged to a record high, separate news reports disclosed that the Punjab government has acquired a multimillion-dollar luxury jet, seemingly for VVIP travel. The paradox could not be more revealing.
In a country where 29 per cent of the population — around 70 million people — survive below the poverty line of Rs8,484 per month, according to the HIES, the ruling elite has no qualms about indulging in a life of luxury at taxpayers’ expense. This is obscene for a country where millions of children are out of school. Moreover, the country is heavily indebted to external lenders. But despite the IMF’s bailout, the economy is in the ICU. Unfortunately, that hardly matters to those at the helm.
It is not just about acquiring a luxury jet, reportedly for the chief minister; it also demonstrates the priorities of the ruling elite and the impunity they enjoy. Spending extravagantly on Punjab’s top echelons, as reported in the media, is criminal at a time when the people are overburdened with taxes. Billions of rupees are being spent on projecting the chief minister whose mandate is arguably questionable. The Punjab government’s silence over the plane scandal reflects the arrogance of power.
Massive advertisement campaigns — paid for by taxpayers — have also been used to tame the media in order to create the illusion of development and good governance. But the plane scandal has laid bare this fallacy. TV advertisements regarding government performance cannot cover up the growing economic and social disparity in the province and outside as shown in the government’s own report. Poverty has surged in Punjab from 16.5pc to 23.3pc within seven years mostly in the backward southern districts and rural areas. More and more people have been falling under the poverty line in the country for the past one decade; the latest poverty figure is the highest. The unemployment rate is more than 7pc — the highest in the past 21 years. Meanwhile, the gap between the rich and poor has widened significantly.

The ruling elite has no qualms about indulging in a life of luxury at taxpayers’ expense.

Economic and social disparities are characterised by the sharp urban-rural divide, extreme wealth concentration and severe regional imbalances. Reports say that 39.5pc of the country’s population faces multidimensional poverty, with the top 10pc owning around 60pc of the national wealth, while 36pc of children from five to 16 years are out of school primarily in the rural areas and underdeveloped provinces. Gender disparities are more acute with half of the rural women never having attended school. Disparities exist in access to healthcare and basic services, with marginalised communities in remote regions facing the most neglect.
Most alarming is the stark disparity among the provinces. While Punjab is much better off compared to the other provinces, KP and Balochistan have poverty rates of 35pc and 47pc respectively. Such disparity reflects the unequal distribution of resources among the provinces. While Punjab gets the lion’s share, Balochistan and KP’s former Fata districts get a trickle. This unfair distribution of resources has been a major reason behind the growing unrest in these two politically unstable regions.
An earlier report by the Population Council pointed out that most of the economically vulnerable districts are in Balochistan and in the former tribal districts in KP. These districts lack even basic health and education facilities. The unemployment rate is the highest in these areas, which lack economic development.
According to the report more than 65pc of the population in Balochistan’s vulnerable districts inhabit temporary or makeshift homes; 50pc do not even have toilet facilities; and 40pc must do without proper water facilities. In these most vulnerable districts, people are deprived of easy access to roads, transport facilities and even phones. It’s different in Punjab, where there is much better access to these facilities, especially in the northern and central areas.
In the former Fata districts, the majority of the population lives below the poverty line. Prior to the merger of Fata into KP, the federal government had promised an annual release of Rs100 billion for a decade to spur development in the war-torn tribal region, bringing it at par with other parts of the country. But only a fraction of the promised funds has been released by the centre since the merger in 2018. Punjab and the two other provinces have refused to pay their share to that fund as was originally promised. The irony is that Punjab can reportedly spend Rs11 billion to acquire a VVIP jet but is not willing to contribute to the development of the war-ravaged region.

 

There is a strong correlation between poverty and militancy. It’s not a coincidence that the economically backward regions of KP and Baloch­istan are most affected by the ongoing insurgency. Deprived of basic economic and democratic rights people there are becoming increasingly alienated from the state. Unfortunately, the state has done nothing to address these issues, relying, instead, on brute force to deal with the problem. Against this backdrop, it is hardly surprising that the youth in large numbers are easy recruits for militant groups in Balochistan. More importantly, shrinking democratic space has made it extremely difficult for the people to get their economic rights. These vulnerable areas in KP and Balochistan are rich in minerals and the central government is hopeful about drawing foreign investors to the sector. But nothing is being done to improve the lives of the people. Discontent is turning matters volatile.
Growing regional disparities, denial of democratic and economic rights and the widening gap between the rich and poor have created a dangerous situation. Yet, the ruling elite doesn’t realise the gravity of the situation. The acquisition of an expensive jet for the Punjab CM in times of worsening poverty is just one aspect of an elite-dominated power structure.

The country’s prime minister has spoken of his commitment to achieving this goal, while most recently, the American ambassador to Israel also reaffirmed his belief that Tel Aviv has a right to establish a state based on biblical geography.
Talking to American conservative journalist Tucker Carlson last week, Mike Huckabee said “it would be fine” if Israel took all the land — corresponding to the supposed biblical borders — from the Nile to the Euphrates. This would mean devouring all of occupied Palestine while also occupying Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. In the same interview, he said that the occupied West Bank’s Area C “is Israel”, contradicting the global consensus that it is Palestinian territory. But such outbursts are not unexpected from the ambassador, who is an ordained Evangelical minister and a rabid Christian Zionist.
However, it is worrying that an official representative of the US is making such fanatical statements. Mr Huckabee later said it was a “hyperbolic statement”, but the damage has been done, with several Arab and Muslim states expressing outrage at the idea of giving up more of their land to the Zionists. American diplomats have reportedly made calls to assuage Muslim anger.

 

Whether or not the ambassador’s remarks were hyperbolic or reflected the new bitter truth, it is a fact that on the ground, Tel Aviv is doing everything in its power to make ‘Greater Israel’ a reality. This includes plans for the permanent colonisation of Gaza and the West Bank, while Israel has also expanded its occupation of Syrian and Lebanese territory. Therefore, ‘Greater Israel’ is on its way to becoming a self-fulfilling prophesy.
Sadly, the Muslim world is too divided and weak to resist such dangerous adventurism by the Zionists, while powerful and fanatical lobbies within the US are ready to bankroll and politically support this perilous scheme. Making angry noises alone will not do. Muslim and Arab states need to take firm steps not only to end the occupation of Palestine, but also to make Israel vacate the land it has occupied in Syria and Lebanon. Unrestrained, Israel may indeed achieve its ‘promised land’.

The group made a net loss of Rs9.7 billion for 2025.
The mobile segment of the group, Ufone posted a revenue growth of 14pc year-on-year, its operating profit reached Rs17.6bn that is 283pc against 2024, yet the company still remains in net loss, which reduced significantly by 89pc.
The group loss was primarily driven by accelerated expected credit loss (ECL) provisioning at Ubank following revisions to the Prudential Regulations.
Ubank has strengthened its balance sheet by adopting IFRS 9, resulting in increased impairment allowances for ECL following updated regulatory requirements.
The group’s consolidated revenue increased by 12pc year-on-year, driven by strong performance in fixed broadband, enterprise, wholesale and mobile services. The consolidated operating profit grew 216pc year-on-year, underscoring strong operational performance.
Revenue grew by 12pc, led by 50pc growth in Flash Fibre and 16pc growth in business solutions compared to the last financial year.
The carrier and wholesale business has maintained momentum with 28pc growth.
PTCL’s operating profit reached Rs18.2bn, up 49pc YoY and posted a net profit of Rs1.4bn despite one-off booking of additional pension liability amounting to Rs6.9bn pursuant to the decision of the Supreme Court.

• ATC declares 30 PTI workers proclaimed offenders in Nov 26 protest cases
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Tuesday sought final arguments on an application seeking the closure of the X (formerly Twitter) account of the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Imran Khan.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir heard the matter. Advocate Muhammad Ali Bukhari appeared on behalf of the PTI founder, while Barrister Zafarullah Khan represented the petitioner. Advocate General Islamabad Ayaz Shaukat also appeared before the court.
At the outset of the hearing, Mr Bukhari informed the court that PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja could not appear due to ill health. He stated that the court had earlier directed that a meeting be arranged with the PTI founder in jail; however, he complained that jail authorities had not facilitated the meeting.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority lawyer told the court that a report had already been submitted in the case. Justice Tahir asked Barrister Zafarullah what relief the petitioner was seeking. The petitioner’s counsel responded that they were ready to advance arguments and requested that copies of replies be provided to the other side.
Mr Bukhari contended that neither the PTI founder nor the party had received the reply. He requested time to first meet the PTI founder in jail before submitting a formal response. The court asked whether PTI intended to file a reply in the matter. Justice Tahir observed that the party was also a respondent and needed to clarify its position.
After brief exchanges, the court adjourned the hearing until the first week of May and sought final arguments from the parties.
Pre-arrest bails
In a separate development, the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka approved pre-arrest bail applications of the PTI founder in six cases, and of Bushra Bibi in one case.
During the hearing, prosecutors Raja Naveed Hussain Kiani, Mazhar Bashir and Assistant Inspector General (Legal) Tahir Kazim appeared on behalf of the state, while Barrister Salman Safdar represented the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi.
Barrister Safdar argued that the delay in deciding the bail applications was unprecedented in his legal career.
He said that 63 adjournments had been granted to the state. On 30 occasions, the court had directed jail authorities to produce the accused, but compliance was not ensured. He added that five show-cause notices had been issued to the jail superintendent.
The prosecution opposed the bail pleas, arguing that there was solid evidence against the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi and that they were not entitled to relief.
During proceedings, the court asked whether the receipt related to the Toshakhana case had been recovered. The prosecution replied in the negative. Judge Majoka further questioned whether the allegedly fake receipts shown in the media had been sent for forensic examination.
After completion of arguments, the court granted pre-arrest bail against surety bonds of Rs50,000 each.
Meanwhile, an Anti-Terrorism Court declared 30 PTI workers as proclaimed offenders (POs) in cases registered at Khanna police station in connection with the November 26 protest.
At the previous hearing, proceedings had been initiated against 31 workers. However, after one PTI worker appeared before the court, proclamation proceedings against him were terminated.

LAHORE: Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb strongly condemned PTI activists and others for running a vilification campaign against Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz over the Punjab government’s decision to acquire a luxury jet.
CM Maryam has faced severe criticism from the opposition and some journalists regarding the government’s purchase of a luxury aircraft for her personal use.
“Elements engaged in character assassination against the CM on media and social media are affiliated with the PTI. The national media should expel and reject those operating under PTI’s foreign funding,” Ms Aurangzeb said in a statement on Tuesday.
She added that the PTI’s toxic mindset was spreading filth across social and mainstream media platforms, which was deeply regrettable.
The senior minister said the seeds of this vile, poisonous, and repugnant mindset were sown during PTI’s tenure. “This reflects the continuation of the PTI founder’s offensive thinking. The media should condemn the character assassination campaign against Maryam Nawaz Sharif,” she urged.
She further said that whenever legal action was taken against such campaigns, an outcry was raised in the name of curbing freedom of expression.
Meanwhile, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari described the PTI’s “gutter mentality” as a cancer clinging to the country and society.
The Punjab government acqui­red a luxury Gulfstream 19-seater jet worth between $38 million and $42 million (over Rs10bn) for the chief minister’s use.

 

Initially, the Punjab administration remained tight-lipped about the acquisition, but later claimed that it was part of a proposed airline project.
When questions arose about the absence of a roadmap for the airline, the government later stated that the previous plane used by CM Maryam had become old and needed replacement with a “safe new jet”.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram criticised the purchase as an “extravagant expenditure amid economic hardship”, arguing that it contradicted the government’s public calls for austerity while citizens face rising inflation, unemployment, and financial strain.
He argued that spending billions on a VIP aircraft is unjustifiable when a large portion of the population lives below the poverty line and the country relies heavily on foreign loans. He warned that PTI would hold those responsible accountable for what he termed misuse of public funds.
Adviser to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister on Finance Muzammil Aslam pointed out that, while the federal PML-N government sold 75 per cent of Pakistan International Airlines shares for just Rs10 billion, the Punjab government purchased a jet for Rs11bn.
Similarly, Jamaat-i-Islami Emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that while the prime minister celebrated the PIA sale, his niece, CM Maryam Nawaz, went ahead and purchased a luxury aircraft for “elite” travel.

He was speaking at a conference titled, Pakistan-Iran Relations: An enduring Partnership in a Changing Region, organised by the Centre for Afghanistan, Middle East and Africa (CAMEA) at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI).
Mr Moghaddam noted that terrorism and separatist movements are serious challenges, which required enhanced cooperation and coordination between the two neighbours.
The Iranian ambassador said that collaboration between the two countries has been reinforced through regional engagement, mutual diplomatic suppo­­rt, and common membership in importa­­nt multilateral platforms such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, Or­­­ganisation of Islamic Cooperation, Eco­­nomic Cooperation Organisation (ECO), and the Developing Eight Orga­nisation for Economic Cooperation (D-8).
He said that currently, relations bet­ween the two countries are experiencing one of their most constructive phases.
The exchange of more than 25 high-level delegations over the past two years, along with the signing of 25 agreements and memoranda of understanding across diverse sectors, reflects the upward trajectory of cooperation and the shared recognition of the strategic importance of bilateral relations.
Two presidential visits from Iran within this period, in addition to visits by the speaker of Parliament, the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, foreign ministers, and other senior officials, underscore the depth and dynamism of mutual interaction, Mr Moghaddam said.

 

He said that Iran-Pakistan relations rest upon a solid foundation of shared history, cultural affinity, and common strategic interests.
He said the two neighbouring countries share a long common border and together represent a population of nearly 350 million people. Robust people-to-people ties, a strategically significant geographic location, substantial complementary, and non-competitive economic structures create extensive opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation.
Speaking on the occasion, retired Ambassador Khalid Mahmood said Iran’s support for Pakistan during the 1965 and 1971 wars was a testament to their close ties.
There have been difficult phases in the relationship, which have strained the relationship at times, but now the two countries are closer to each other than ever before, although challenges remain, like terrorism and sectarianism.
Dr Amina Khan said that Pakistan and Iran share a long-standing bilateral relationship grounded in historical ties, geographic proximity, and intertwined security and economic interests.
In recent years, she said bilateral relations have remained positive and forward-looking, characterised by sustained high-level engagement, close coordination on regional and international developments and commitments to the principle of sovereign equality.

THE never-ending queue had already spilled beyond the glass doors when Jawad Ahmad Rizvi arrived at Lahore airport for his flight to Dubai. The line snaked past the entrance, with passengers clutching their passports and boarding passes, shifting their luggage inch by inch.
“On my arrival, I found the queue extending beyond the entrance of the main terminal, making me wonder how many people were travelling by air these days.
“As the queue was moving slowly, it took me about 20 minutes to put my luggage on the scanner belt, and an additional 15 minutes for the belt to clear,” he told Dawn.
The checks did not end there. Mr Rizvi said that after the luggage was cleared by the scanner, a security official checked his and other passengers’ passports a second time — the first check being conducted upon their entrance to the terminal.
“The official asked me, where are you going, for what purpose, what do you do, and how much cash do you have?”

After obtaining a boarding pass, another “long queue at the passport control counter [awaited me], which was really tiresome. The authorities need to set up more counters to break the long queues.”
Over the past few months, passengers travelling abroad from Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad have increasingly complained of long queues, repeated questioning and prolonged immigration clearance.
The tightening of checks follows a wider crackdown on human smuggling in the wake of several boat tragedies involving illegal migrants, as well as complaints from Gulf countries about the number of beggars travelling there.
In response, authorities have stepped up scrutiny at airports, intensifying document verification and offloading hundreds of passengers who did not pass strict checks. According to the interior ministry, at least 51,000 passengers were offloaded at airports in 2025, mostly at Lahore and Karachi, over insufficient or unverified documentation.
Lahore: scrutiny and space constraints
At Lahore’s Allama Iqbal Inter­national Airport, at times, queues stretch outside the terminal buildings during peak departure hours.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has acknowledged that it has been carrying out stricter screening of passengers travelling to destinations including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Malaysia, Qatar, Egypt and various European countries, in an effort to curb human smuggling and travel by beggars.
When Dr Amir Butt intended to travel from Lahore to Baku, he found himself caught in that net.
“To my surprise, I found unusually long queues at the immigration counter. Finally, when my turn came, the FIA official at the passport control counter asked me that since I was going to Baku for the fourth time in the last few years, was there any specific reason for that?
“I told him the trip to Baku does not cost me much. He then asked me to see another FIA official in a room next to the counter, where I was further quizzed about my profession and the purpose of my trip. After that cumbersome process, I was allowed to board the plane,” Dr Butt told Dawn.

“The FIA official [looks] at you as if he or she [has] seen a human for the first time, then looks at [the] passport, then stares at you, and looks at your passport again… This process continues for 3 to 4 mins… [while the government] is investing $1 billion in artificial intelligence!”

When approached, an FIA official defended the heightened scrutiny.

“Security checks, like those manned by the Airports Security Force (ASF) and Customs, as well as baggage checks, the check-in flight counter and passport control counter were already in place at the airports. But the long queues and delays at immigration counters have cropped up since the agency placed a strong security check to weed out potential illegal immigrants and beggars,” he said.
He added that there were clear instructions from the interior ministry that passengers with invalid, incomplete or bogus documents should not be allowed to travel abroad.
“Every FIA official at immigration gets more conscious of this fact and takes extra time in screening the passengers. There is a need for more counters with dedicated staff to avert long queues,” he said, pointing to a shortage of immigration personnel and limited space at Lahore airport.
Yet, FIA Lahore immigration head Avais Shafiq denied that there were long queues at immigration counters. “I haven’t seen any queues at immigration counters. They are outside the airport entrance where the ASF checks them,” he maintained.
In 2025, Lahore airport handled 6.86 million passengers. The sheer volume, coupled with tighter checks, has put visible strain on infrastructure.
Canadian national Navid Man­­zoor said travelling alone is manageable, but flying with family is another matter altogether.
“In the very first place, not finding the trolley (for luggage), kids getting upset with long queues and multiple checking points … as a whole … the system at the airport should be well organised like that of any developed country. The government can [do so] it has the will,” he said.
Karachi: from chaos to control?


THIS screengrab from a video shows overcrowding at Lahore airport’s departure lounge.—X / anooshayabid

A few weeks ago, social media was flooded with images of overcrowding at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport. Passengers described it as “a place of embarrassment for international travellers and a daily humiliation for Pakistani citizens, thanks to basic operational incompetence.”
The situation, however, has changed drastically over the past few days, and things have started to return to normal.
An official said the FIA’s strict measures contributed to delays, but insisted the agency’s role begins inside the passengers’ lounge.
“It is true that the FIA has taken certain measures, but their sole purpose is to strictly enforce the law and not to cause inconvenience to people,” he said.
“How can the agency be held responsible for overcrowding at entry points, the unavailability of trolleys or the long queues at the airport’s main entrance?”
Recently, the official said, all relevant authorities had come together and devised a joint strategy that helped bring the situation under control. “This achievement is the result of the collective efforts of the FIA, Pakistan Airports Authority, Airport Security Force and the airlines.”
Some travellers, however, still speak of difficulties at Jinnah International. Muaaz Ibrahim said his brother, who has been working in Saudi Arabia for four years, faced an unexpectedly long scrutiny.
“My brother’s documents were checked at the FIA counter for so long that he almost missed his flight. He said that nothing like this had ever happened before, and the experience took him by surprise,” Mr Ibrahim told Dawn.
The FIA says it has made 20 counters operational during midnight hours, when multiple international flights depart, and deployed a full-strength shift from 2am onwards.
“These measures have not only [helped] crack down on illegal travel, but also prevent wrongdoing within the agency itself,” an official said. “I can say with full confidence that these measures have greatly helped in eliminating organised corruption.”


TO AVOID the hassle of additional checking, many travellers are now opting for ‘fast track’ services, for a substantial fee.—Dawn

FIA Karachi Zone Director Muntazar Mehdi, during a recent surprise visit to the airport, expressed satisfaction with immigration operations and said ensuring security while respecting the dignity of passengers remains the agency’s top priority.
Islamabad: speed vs suspicion
Complaints about repeated questioning have not been limited to Lahore and Karachi alone. Passenger Khurram Zuberi recently posted about his experience at Islamabad International Airport.
He said his passport was first checked at the airport entrance, then again by Customs officials, followed by the Anti-Narcotics Force. He then navigated the airline counter, the immigration counter where he was quizzed by an FIA officer, then at the airline gate, and once more before he entered the tunnel leading to the plane.
“The FIA official [looks] at you as if he or she [has] seen a human for the first time, then looks at [the] passport, then stares at you, and looks at your passport again, then looks at your ticket, and looks at your passport again, then looks at you again, and looks at passport again. This process continues for 3-4 min, and all that continues where the [government] is investing $1billion in artificial intelligence!!,” he wrote on X, describing his experience.







Officials at the Islamabad airport, however, paint an altogether different picture.
FIA Islamabad Director Shahzad Nadeem Bukhari claimed that immigration clearance takes an average of one minute and 25 seconds, with 15 counters operational at departure and 14 at arrival.
A dedicated counter facilitates diplomats and Chinese nationals associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects.
Officials argue that vigilant screening has reduced illegal travel attempts relative to overall passenger flow. Islamabad airport handled 7.87 million passengers in 2025, including 5.41 million international travellers.
In 2024, 6,435 people were off­­loaded at Islamabad airport; in 2025, the number rose to 7,115.
Responding to complaints that immigration officers ask questions already answered on boarding passes, the director said staff must ensure passengers know where they are going and for what purpose.
He cited cases in which individuals carried what appeared to be official letters from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to attend a conference in Europe. When questioned, they failed to provide basic details and it later emerged that they had paid Rs2.3 million each to an agent.
Azmat Hussain, a Rawal­pindi resident who recently travelled from Islamabad airport, described a smoother experience.
“As I walked towards the international departure lounge, a security official standing there asked me to show my ticket, and then asked me, ‘Where are you going?’. After I replied to him, I was allowed inside for another baggage scanning.”
He added: “Nobody asked me anything at the immigration counter, so I moved towards the waiting area to board the flight.”
When questioned about the layered approach, an official told Dawn that the process was like a “defence shield”.
“Airport security works … [has] multiple rings: outer ring — entry control, middle ring – initial screening, inner ring — final boarding security. More layers mean more safety,” he said.
“As someone deeply conn­e­cted with ASF history and se­­c­urity culture, one should know that aviation security is about prevention, not reaction,” he added.
Between dignity and deterrence
The Pakistan Airports Auth­ority (PAA) maintains that in­frastructure at major airports is operating within defined capacity, and that immigration staffing falls under the FIA’s mandate.
The ASF says enhanced vigilance, including vehicle checks and additional personnel, may lengthen procedures but is necessary in light of recent security concerns.
Yet, public frustration persists, and it is not just limited to the common man; even Senator Sherry Rehman recently posted about her experience at Islamabad airport.
“What is happening at Pakis­tan’s airports? At Islamabad airport this morning, the second gate for women was routinely closed, while a long line of women stood waiting only on the one open gate. They opened the second gate earmarked for women when I insisted that these passengers, too, are entitled to public services,” she posted on X earlier this month, before boarding an international flight.







“Unfortunately, when I went back to check 10 minutes later, the gate was firmly closed again. It was opened yet again after I stood there and repeated the whole exercise, but now that I’ve boarded, I’m pretty sure it’s closed again. This is a fight I regularly have at Karachi airport too, but there is no change in behaviour.”

The petitioner challenged the Dec 30, 2025 rejection of her election dispute by the election tribunal, where she had earlier levelled allegations of large-scale electoral fraud, manipulation of results and the illegal replacement of the returning officer (RO).
The appeal has been filed under Section 155 of the Election Act, 2017, naming Nawaz Sharif as the principal respondent, along with 20 others, including the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and various ROs.
According to the petition, polling on election day proceeded smoothly at all polling stations in the presence of her polling agents. Ballots were duly counted, Form-45 was prepared, and copies were handed over to her polling agents at most polling stations.

Incarcerated PTI leader moves SC; alleges massive rigging, illegal change of RO in NA-130 election

The appellant contended that although she had been confined in jail since May 2023 on what she described as “sham charges”, her election agent was present at the office of the respondent RO to participate in the consolidation process of results, as envisaged under Rule 85 of the Election Rules, 2017.
The petition stated results received on the basis of Form-45 from 334 out of 376 polling stations showed that 207,517 votes were cast in the constituency. Of these, the appellant received 99,428 votes, while the alleged returned candidate, Nawaz Sharif, secured 78,533 votes, indicating that the appellant had won the election by a margin of 20,895 votes in all the polling stations except the remaining 32. It was further stated that 3,123 votes were declared invalid, as per Form-45.
However, during the provisional consolidation process, the petition alleged that some unknown persons forcibly entered the RO’s premises and later disappeared.
Subsequently, it was alleged, a new RO (respondent No. 19) was illegally appointed by the ECP (respondent No. 21) without following due process. Under the instructions of the new RO, local police allegedly restrained the appellant’s election agent from participating in the consolidation proceedings and forcibly removed him from the office around 12:30am on Feb 9, 2024. This situation, the petition claimed, continued until the completion of the consolidation process.
The change of the RO during the consolidation and preparation of the provisional result, the petition maintained, was without lawful authority and amounted to unlawful interference in the election outcome for NA-130. It alleged that this was carried out in connivance with other respondents with mala fide intent to benefit Nawaz Sharif.
The petition alleged that based on Form-45 provided to the appellant’s polling agents and information circulating in electronic and social media, the appellant had won all polling stations in the constituency by a substantial margin. It claimed that the newly appointed RO prepared a false, manipulated and fabricated provisional result on Form-47 with mala fide intent and active connivance of the returned candidate to unlawfully secure his success by abusing authority.
Terming the election tribunal’s dismissal of her petition as contrary to law and facts, the appellant pleaded that the decision was not sustainable in the eyes of law.
She alleged that Nawaz Sharif in collusion with the new RO and election staff, manoeuvred his success through illegal and corrupt practices by fabricating and manipulating vote counts in the provisional as well as consolidated results, namely from Form-47 to Form-49.

ISRAELI soldiers fired more than 900 bullets at a convoy of clearly marked Palestinian emergency vehicles in Gaza before advancing to kill the surviving aid workers, some of whom were shot “execution-style” at close range, in March last year, a new joint investigation has revealed.
According to Al Jazeera, the report released on Monday by independent research agency Forensic Architecture and audio investigation group Earshot offers the most detailed reconstruction to date of the massacre in Tal as-Sultan, a neighbourhood west of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, on March 23, 2025.
Fifteen aid workers were killed in the attack, including paramedics from the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), firefighters from the Palestinian Civil Defence (PCD) and a staff member of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). The slain aid workers were then buried along with their vehicles.
The Israeli military first called the vehicles “uncoordinated” and later a “professional error,” but forensic analysis indicates a coordinated ambush with no return fire, aimed at killing survivors.
Science of the massacre
The investigation uses “situated testimony” and audio ballistics to determine the gunfire’s distance, weapon type, and direction.
Investigators analysed footage recovered from the phone of slain paramedic Rifaat Radwan, a PRCS paramedic who began recording at 5:09am, when the ambush began. In a video lasting five and a half minutes, at least 844 gunshots were recorded. Combined with other recordings, the total documented count reached at least 910 gunshots.
In the video from one of the last ambulances, Radwan is heard asking his mother for forgiveness and reciting the shahada before dying.
According to Earshot’s analysis, 93 per cent of these shots featured a specific acoustic signature: a “supersonic shockwave”, followed by a muzzle blast. This combination confirms that the camera — and the aid workers huddled around it — were directly in the line of fire.
“The density of gunfire … frequently exceeds 900 rounds per minute,” the report states, noting that, at one point, five shots were fired in just 67 milliseconds. This rate of fire confirms that at least five shooters, likely many more, were firing simultaneously from an elevated sandbank approximately 40 metres away.
“Israeli soldiers ambushed and subjected Palestinian aid workers to continuous assault by gunfire for over two hours”, between 5:09am and 7:13am, the report says.
From ambush to execution
The report challenges the Israeli narrative of a chaotic “combat zone”. Instead, it describes a methodical massacre of Palestinian aid workers on their way to help people injured in Israeli strikes.
The report states there was no exchange of fire or immediate threat to the soldiers, contradicting claims that the incident occurred in a “hostile and dangerous combat zone.”
By analysing the time delay between the sound of the gunshots and their echoes bouncing off a nearby concrete wall, investigators tracked the movement of the soldiers.
For the first four minutes, the soldiers remained positioned on a sandbank before advancing about 50 metres downhill toward the convoy while continuing to fire, according to audio analysis.
This corroborates the testimony of survivor Assaad al-Nassasra, a PRCS worker, who told investigators: “They were walking between [the aid workers] and shooting.”
The most chilling finding relates to the attack’s final moments, as a phone call by paramedic Ashraf Abu Libda reportedly captured soldiers arriving at the vehicles.
The audio analysis identifies specific gunshots where the distinct “supersonic crack” of the bullet disappears, leaving only the muzzle blast. Ballistically, this indicates the shooter was within 1-4 metres (3-13 feet) of the victim.
The shots coincide with Abu Libda’s final sounds of movement, suggesting he was shot while lying on the ground.
Hiding the evidence
The report alleges that Israeli forces attempted to conceal the massacre by deploying bulldozers to the site, crushing and burying emergency vehicles, and constructing earth berms to block visibility, according to satellite imagery from that morning.
The forensic findings match satellite images obtained by Al Jazeera’s Sanad unit, which reported on March 30, 2025, that at least five rescue vehicles were completely destroyed and buried in sand by Israeli forces on al-Muharrarat Street, the site of the massacre.

US AIR Force tanker aircraft are lined up at Ben Gurion airport, near Tel Aviv.—Reuters

• CSIS report terms current convergence of US military hardware largest since 2003 Iraq war, but smaller than 1991’s ‘Desert Storm’• Ahead of Geneva talks, Iran says it is ready to take any steps towards a nuclear deal
WASHINGTON: As the world’s largest aircraft carrier sails to join a massive military build-up in the Middle East, a new study reveals that the deployment looks to be structured for “limited action” rather than a “large-scale war”.
The assessment comes as US President Donald Trump’s reported consideration of a short, coercive strike to pressure Tehran into accepting his demands has triggered intense debate in Washington and beyond over the likelihood of conflict, the definition of objectives, and the danger of a wider regional war.
In the meantime, oil prices are hovering near seven-month highs, with traders assessing risks to supply from any military escalation as another round of US-Iran nuclear talks looms.
Ahead of Thursday’s planned nuclear talks between Iran and the US, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said on Tuesday that his country was ready to take any necessary steps to reach a deal with the United States.
The talks are set to take place on Thursday in Geneva.
We are ready to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We will do whatever it takes to make this happen. We will enter the negotiating room in Geneva with complete honesty and good faith,” Takht-Ravanchi said in comments carried by state media.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s first option was always diplomacy but that he was willing to use lethal force if necessary.
“If there is an attack or aggression against Iran, we will respond according to our defence plans… A US attack on Iran is a real gamble,” Takht-Ravanchi added.
Trump confident US can easily beat Iran
President Donald Trump on Monday denied reports that the top US military officer had flagged the risks of a major operation against Iran, saying Washington would “easily” beat Tehran in any war.
US media reported that General Dan Caine, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had warned of various risks associated with strikes against Iran including a long-term entanglement.
But Trump said on his Truth Social network that it was “100 percent incorrect” that Caine was “against us going to war with Iran.”







“General Caine, like all of us, would like not to see War but, if a decision is made on going against Iran at a Military level, it is his opinion that it will be something easily won,” Trump wrote.
“He has not spoken of not doing Iran, or even the fake limited strikes that I have been reading about, he only knows one thing, how to WIN and, if he is told to do so, he will be leading the pack.”
The US president, however, accused the media outlets of writing “incorrectly, and purposefully so.” “I am the one that makes the decision, I would rather have a Deal than not but, if we don’t make a Deal, it will be a very bad day for that Country and, very sadly, its people,” Trump added.
In response to a separate report in The New York Times suggesting that Trump is weighing a near-term limited strike — with the possibility of a broader campaign later — Middle Eastern scholar Vali Nasr wrote: “Trump is signaling Iranians via New York Times. He is trying to force a deal by threatening war.”
Nasr cautioned that continued pressure, even after a deal, could push Tehran toward confrontation, quoting Middle East analyst Ali Hashem as saying: “Washington assumes military pressure buys diplomatic leverage. Tehran sees a challenge to ideological survival.”
Build-up
The USS Gerald R. Ford, meanwhile, has reached the US naval base of Souda Bay on Crete, en route to the Persian Gulf.
US Naval Support Activity Souda Bay is home to approximately 1,000 people, including active duty military, US civilian employees, local national employees, contractors, and family members.



Washington currently has more than a dozen warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier — the USS Abraham Lincoln — nine destroyers and three littoral combat ships.
It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers — which carry dozens of warplanes and are crewed by thousands of sailors — in the Middle East.
However, a recent study by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) provides a detailed picture of what current US deployments can and cannot do.
It notes that the naval “armada” in the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean is the largest US maritime presence in the region since five carrier strike groups were assembled at the start of the 2003 Iraq war. The force is sufficient for targeted strikes and for defending US allies and partners.
However, it lacks Marine units, special operations forces for raids or ground missions, and the logistics required for a prolonged air campaign.
The study also stresses that the current deployment is far smaller than the forces used in the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the US conducted major combat operations and regime change.
A surge in cargo aircraft and aerial refueling tankers does not indicate the movement of ground combat units, the report says, making scenarios such as capturing or killing Iran’s leadership unrealistic — particularly given the distance from likely launch points to Tehran.
The available force package is also deemed insufficient for regime change, and the report argues that even a decapitation strike would be unlikely to destabilise Iran’s political system, which has shown resilience under pressure.
For a sustained, multi-week air campaign, CSIS concludes, Washington would need a much larger logistical buildup that would take additional time.

Pakistan have only one point from two Super Eight matches so now must win their final game and rely on other results going their way to have any hope of reaching the semi-finals.
“We know our fate is not in our hands,” he admitted, “But we need to beat Sri Lanka in our last match on Saturday and then hope other results go our way.”
“It’s not ideal, but it’s like this,” Shaheen said during a press conference after the match.

 

He also hailed Harry Brook’s century in the match against England as a “world-class knock”.
Brook reached his maiden T20 International hundred off 50 balls, with four sixes and 10 fours, as England went past their 165-run target with five balls to spare to win by two wickets.
Afridi jolted the England top order with a burst of three wickets before Brook played the ultimate captain’s innings to steer his side home.
“In my opinion this will be the best innings of his life,” Afridi told reporters. “It wasn’t an easy pitch to bat on but he took the game away from us.”
Promoted to number three after a morning conversation with England coach Brendon McCullum, Brook walked in after Afridi dismissed Phil Salt off the first ball of the innings.
Afridi then removed Jos Buttler and Jacob Bethell to leave England wobbling at 35-3 in the power play.
Brook stood firm, adding 45 for the fifth wicket with Sam Curran and 52 with Will Jacks for the sixth.
His century was the second fastest in T20 World Cup history, and the first ever by a team’s captain.
Only West Indies great Chris Gayle, against England in the 2016 T20 World Cup, reached three figures quicker. He took just 47 balls.
Afridi was clobbered for a six and a four as Brook raced through the “nervous nineties” in two balls, going from 90 to 100 before raising his bat.
The tall paceman bowled Brook with a yorker next ball, but did not celebrate wildly – instead he immediately went to congratulate the England captain in a superb show of cricket sportmanship.
“Brook played proper cricketing shots and he desreved a handshake, so I went to him and shook his hand in appreciation,” said Afridi.</p><small>2026-02-24 19:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/242101085b82be1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975479/2-policemen-martyred-as-suicide-bomber-targets-checkpost-in-bhakkar' target='_blank'><strong>2 policemen martyred as suicide bomber targets checkpost in Bhakkar</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Two policemen were martyred in a suicide blast at a checkpost in the jurisdiction of Punjab’s Bhakkar district on Tuesday evening, according to officials.
Bhakkar District Police Officer (DPO) Shahzad Rafiq told Dawn that a suicide attack was carried out near the Dajil checkpost.
He said that two policemen were martyred and one was injured, while three passersby were also injured in the blast.
“The suicide attacker came near the check post and blew himself up, while we were conducting a search operation in the area to maintain law and order,” he added.
The deceased policemen were identified as Muhammad Faheem and Muhammad Shehbaz, and the injured as Arshad. The identities of the injured passersby have not yet been ascertained.
The injured were taken to the District Headquarters Hospital, DPO Rafiq said.
In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the terrorist attack. He expressed grief at the deaths of the officials and offered his condolences to the bereaved families.
He also prayed for the swift recovery of the police personnel injured in the attack.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed deep sorrow and grief over the martyrdom of police personnel in the attack, Radio Pakistan reported.
He said the sacrifices rendered by the police in the war against terrorism would not be allowed to go in vain, and reiterated the government’s resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz strongly condemned the attack on the police checkpost. In a statement, she paid tribute to the martyred policemen and saluted their sacrifice in the line of duty.
The chief minister expressed heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the bereaved families. She directed authorities to ensure the best possible medical treatment for the injured policeman and others wounded in the incident.
The development comes on the same day six law enforcement personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police, were martyred after a terrorist attack on a police vehicle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district.
It is worth mentioning that the Dajil checkpost is at the border of Dera Ismail Khan and Bhakkar.</p><small>2026-02-24 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24234433303b35d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975497/iran-fm-says-nuclear-deal-within-reach-ahead-of-us-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Iran FM says nuclear deal ‘within reach’ ahead of US talks</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday that a nuclear deal was “within reach”, ahead of talks with the United States scheduled for later this week.
“We have a historic opportunity to strike an unprecedented agreement that addresses mutual concerns and achieves mutual interests,” said Araghchi, in a post on the social media site X.







He added that a deal was “within reach, but only if diplomacy is given priority”.
The talks are set to take place on Thursday in Geneva, a senior US official said on Monday, with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner slated to meet with an Iranian delegation for the negotiations.
The two countries resumed negotiations earlier this month as the US builds up its military capability in the Middle East. Iran has threatened to strike US bases in the region if it is attacked.
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said on Tuesday Iran is ready to take any necessary steps to reach a deal with the US.
“We are ready to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We will do whatever it takes to make this happen. We will enter the negotiating room in Geneva with complete honesty and good faith,” Takht-Ravanchi said in comments carried by state media.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s first option was always diplomacy but that he was willing to use lethal force if necessary.
A senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday that Tehran would seriously consider a combination of sending half of its most highly enriched uranium abroad, diluting the rest and taking part in creating a regional enrichment consortium — an idea periodically raised during years of Iran-linked diplomacy.
Iran would do this in return for US recognition of Iran’s right to “peaceful nuclear enrichment” under a deal that would also include lifting economic sanctions, the official said.
“If there is an attack or aggression against Iran, we will respond according to our defence plans … A US attack on Iran is a real gamble,” Takht-Ravanchi added.
Indirect talks between the two sides last year brought no agreement, primarily due to friction over a US demand that Iran forgo uranium enrichment on its soil, which Washington views as a pathway to a nuclear bomb.
Iran has always denied seeking such weapons.
The US joined Israel in hitting Iranian nuclear sites last June, with Trump saying its key nuclear sites were “obliterated”.</p><small>2026-02-24 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/242311281b7cb46.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975399/pm-shehbaz-meets-qatars-emir-says-both-countries-to-work-together-for-regional-peace-and-stability' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz meets Qatar’s emir, says both countries to work together for regional peace and stability</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday met Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, saying that the two countries would continue to work together for peace and stability in the region and beyond.

It is worth mentioning that while the security detail from Peshawar was withdrawn, the ex-CM has a police detail from his native Dera Ismail Khan district. It was not immediately clear who ordered the withdrawal of the security from Peshawar, with incumbent chief minister Sohail Afridi’s press secretary denying that orders to this effect were issued.
According to the sources, a 16-member security squad assigned to Gandapur was recalled late last night. The contingent comprised two jammer operators, eight gunmen and six drivers, who had been working in shifts. All personnel belonged to the police department.
Of them, 14 officials had been deployed for Gandapur’s security, while two were assigned to his brother, MNA Faisal Amin Gandapur.
Sources close to the ex-chief minister said that one jammer and one pickup carrier had been returned to the provincial government. The sources said that Gandapur and his brother had personally spoken with the officer who had conveyed KP CM Afridi’s orders to confirm and authenticate the withdrawal of the police escort.
In a statement, Gandapur said that at 11pm last night, Afridi’s deputy chief security officer (CSO) called his security personnel, saying that it was the CSO’s order to withdraw the security.
“I had one jammer and one double-cabin vehicle provided by the provincial government,” he said, adding, “There were 14 personnel deployed with that vehicle.”
“When these personnel informed me, I told them to pack up everything. This is the actual truth,” he said. He stated that even if this security were now restored, he would not accept it.
“I want to tell the chief minister that there is no need to return this security to me now. I do not need it,” Gandapur said.
Gandapur’s spokesperson, Faraz Ahmed Mughal, insisted that the withdrawal was initiated on the instructions of KP CM Afridi. He said the Chief Minister’s Office contacted the security in-charge and directed that the detail be withdrawn, adding that Gandapur followed the directives within minutes.
Meanwhile, in a statement, the KP chief minister’s press secretary said that there was no truth in reports about Gandapur’s security detail being withdrawn by Afridi.
“No such decision has been taken, nor have any instructions been issued to the relevant authorities in this regard,” he said.
Further, an official at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat clarified that the former CM was asked to return two jammers and the associated personnel, which were required for the use of the incumbent chief minister.
“Under the rules, the former chief minister was not entitled to retain the jammers. He was supposed to return the jammers and vehicle”, the official said, insisting that no security detail had been withdrawn from Gandapur.
“He continues to retain a police escort,” the official maintained.
Gandapur had previously faced multiple security threats, and a hand grenade attack also took place at his residence in the past.
Official sources maintained that decisions regarding security deployment and withdrawal were made in accordance with threat assessments and administrative requirements.
Political observers said that the development was also significant in the context of the recent differences between Gandapur and CM Afridi.</p><small>2026-02-24 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/242108332593216.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975483/afghan-taliban-initiated-unprovoked-firing-along-pak-afghan-border-pms-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing along Pak-Afghan border: PM’s spokesperson</strong></a><br><p>Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, said on Tuesday said that the Afghan Taliban regime initiated unprovoked firing along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Torkham and Tirah.
In a post on the social media platform X, he said, “Pakistan’s security forces responded immediately and effectively, silencing the Taliban aggression.”
He said that any further provocation would be responded to “immediately and severely”. He said Pakistan would “continue to protect its citizens and guard its territorial integrity”.







The development comes after Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes.
The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year.
According to an information ministry statement, issued in the early hours of Sunday, the strikes were carried out in res­ponse to a number of terrorist attacks inside Pakistan — such as the suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad and a number of attacks in Bannu and Bajaur.
“Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij at the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers,” it said.
The information ministry said that in a retributive response, Pakistan carried out “intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban [Fitna al Khw­arij] and its affiliates, and [Islamic State-Khorasan] at the border region of Pakistan-Afghan border with precision and accuracy”.
Fitna al Khwarij is the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“Despite repeated efforts by Pak­istan to urge the Afghan Tali­ban Regime to take verifiable mea­sures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the statement noted.
Souring relations
There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded.
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire.
Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast.
Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault.
Then, on Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district.
In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”.
“Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij, irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted.
On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable.
In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces.
At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR.
The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.</p><small>2026-02-24 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/241917164f6dd9d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975448/aid-groups-petition-israels-top-court-to-halt-ban-on-gaza-west-bank-operations' target='_blank'><strong>Aid groups petition Israel’s top court to halt ban on Gaza, West Bank operations</strong></a><br><p>More than a dozen international humanitarian organisations have petitioned Israel’s Supreme Court to block an imminent order that would force 37 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to cease operations in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, warning of catastrophic consequences for civilians.
Organisations including Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE were notified on December 30, 2025 that their Israeli registrations had expired and that they had 60 days to renew them by providing lists of their Palestinian staff.
If they fail to do so, they will have to cease operations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including east Jerusalem, from March 1.
The petition, described as unprecedented in its scale and joint nature, seeks an urgent interim injunction from Israel’s top court to suspend the closures pending full judicial review.
The 17 petitioners, which include some of the NGOs hit by the ban, argue the Israeli measures are incompatible with an occupying power’s obligations under international humanitarian law.
The NGOs say compliance would expose local employees to potential retaliation, undermine the principle of humanitarian neutrality and violate European data protection law.
“Turning humanitarian organisations into an information-gathering arm for a party to the conflict stands in total contradiction to the principle of neutrality,” the petition states.
According to the United Nations, 133 NGO workers have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the war started on October 7, 2023, including 15 MSF employees.
The petitioners say they have proposed practical alternatives to handing over staff lists to Israel, including “independent sanctions screening” and “donor-audited vetting systems”.
Supplies blocked
The organisations say that they collectively support or implement more than half of all food assistance in Gaza, 60 per cent of field hospital operations and all inpatient treatment for children suffering severe acute malnutrition.
The petitioners say enforcement has already begun in practice, with supplies blocked and visas denied to foreign staff.
“We haven’t been able to get international staff inside Gaza since the beginning of January. Israeli authorities denied any entry to Gaza, but also to the West Bank,” MSF head of mission in the Palestinian territories Filipe Ribeiro told AFP last week.
“For the time being, we are still working in Gaza, and we plan to keep running our operations as long as we can,” he added.
The ban comes as Israel hardens its stance towards humanitarian actors in general, having banned the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, from Israel in early 2025.
UNRWA, which Israel accused of employing people who took part in Hamas’ October 7 attack, also can no longer coordinate with Israeli authorities in the occupied West Bank, as will be the case for the banned, or deregistered, NGOs.
For international NGOs, the current ban goes back to a change in rules for foreign organisations working with Palestinians in March 2025.
The law updated the framework for how aid groups must register to maintain their status within Israel, along with provisions that outline how their applications can be denied or registration revoked.
The absence of coordination with Israel complicates operations by denying Israeli visas to foreign aid workers, or by denying direct contact to plan around Israeli military operations in the Palestinian territory.
The NGOs argued in their petition that Israel, as an occupying power in the West Bank and parts of Gaza, “must facilitate relief for civilians under its control” under the Geneva Convention.</p><small>2026-02-24 15:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24201546aabc79c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975466/govt-amends-identity-card-rules-introduces-qr-codes-as-legal-security-and-verification-feature' target='_blank'><strong>Govt amends identity card rules, introduces QR codes as legal security and verification feature</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday notified amendments to the National Identity Card Rules, 2002 and the Pakistan Origin Card Rules, 2002 to modernise the country’s identity document framework by legally embedding QR-based verification, strengthening authentication controls across digital services, expanding biometric recognition, and updating card formats for key citizen categories.
According to a handout by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), a core reform is the statutory introduction of the QR code — a scannable barcode containing horizontal and vertical lines, dots, and patterns — as a defined security and verification feature.
The rules now legally define QR codes as a secure, machine-readable, two-dimensional barcode capable of storing encoded information and converting it into usable identity verification data when scanned.
The amendments further authorise the use of a QR code or “any other technological feature,” in lieu of the current microchip, enabling Nadra to adopt evolving verification technologies without repeated rule amendments.
In operational terms, this establishes a robust legal basis for quick and secure verification of identity credentials in both offline and online environments. This will also enable all citizens to carry a similar card instead of the currently prevalent two types of national identity cards, one of which comes with a microchip and the other without.
This QR-enabled capability directly strengthens Pakistan’s Digital ID ecosystem and supports interoperability through the National Data Exchange Layer.
QR-based credentials allow rapid front-end validation of identity attributes in service delivery settings, while also enabling back-end systems to confirm authenticity and status through trusted exchanges. This is expected to improve speed, transparency and consistency of identity verification across government entities and regulated sectors, reduce manual handling, and lower the risk of fraud and impersonation.
The amendments also strengthen the enforcement effect of card suspension. The rules now clarify that where a card is suspended, all verification, authentication and related services linked to that card shall stand suspended forthwith.
This closes a key risk area by ensuring that once a card is suspended, it cannot continue to be used through digital verification channels or institutional authentication processes.
In addition, the biometric scope has been reinforced through explicit recognition of fingerprints and iris scans within the rules, reflecting a stronger and more modern multi-modal biometric foundation for identity assurance.
On citizen facilitation, the amendments introduce a major improvement for senior citizens. Where a resident or non-resident citizen has attained the age of sixty years, the rules now provide for the issuance of a card carrying a distinct senior citizen logo with lifetime validity. This significantly reduces renewal burden, improves convenience, and reflects a service-oriented approach for elderly citizens.
The amendments also introduce standardised identification for residents of Azad Jammu and Kashmir by requiring an inscription indicating “Resident of Azad Jammu and Kashmir”, thereby ensuring uniform geographic identification on the document.
The schedules have been comprehensively updated through the substitution of specimen formats for a wide range of document categories. Updated smart formats now cover resident citizens, overseas Pakistanis, child registration certificates, persons with disabilities, organ donors, combined categories, and AJK residents.
These updated formats visibly incorporate QR codes and enhanced security layouts, standardising a modern identity document architecture across categories.
Overall, these amendments strengthen the legal and technological foundations of Pakistan’s identity system by enabling secure QR-based verification, reinforcing the integrity of digital authentication services, improving biometric assurance, reducing fraud risk through immediate service suspension controls, and delivering clear facilitation measures such as lifetime validity for senior citizens.
They also advance readiness for integrated digital governance by supporting structured interoperability through the National Data Exchange Layer and a broader Digital ID ecosystem.</p><small>2026-02-24 15:48</small></div><hr>
