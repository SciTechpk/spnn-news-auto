According to a September 4 notification seen by Dawn.com, the suspended principals include those at schools in Akora Khattak, Aman Garh, Ghoriwala and Haripur-II. Similarly, the principals of schools in Hattar, Karak, Kohat-I, and Kohat-II have also been removed.
The action further extends to the principals in Peshawar-II, Mardan, Shehbaz Azmat Khel, Swabi and Swat, along with the principals of an institution in Takht Bhai and a higher secondary school.
“The vice principals of the concerned schools shall look after the duties of principal as [a] stopgap arrangement in their own pay scale till further orders,” the notification read.
“However, where the vice principals are not available, the seniormost employee (BPS-16/17)/acting vice principal shall look after the duties of principal as [a] stopgap arrangement in their own pay scale till further orders.”</p><small>2025-09-07 11:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07161336291465c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940279/swabi-tiktoker-held-for-making-videos-while-dressed-as-a-woman-police' target='_blank'><strong>Swabi TikToker held for making videos while dressed as a woman: police</strong></a><br><p>Swabi police have arrested a TikToker who was allegedly making videos while dressing as a girl and uploading them to his account to “mislead people, especially the youth”, senior police officials said on Sunday.
Swabi Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Ijaz Abazai and Saidul Amin, Station House Officer (SHO) at Swabi city police station, told Dawn.com that the TikToker was filming videos while dressing as a woman and “striking controversial poses”.
“There was severe resentment and anxiety among society,” SHO Amin said. “Aamir Khan, the in-charge of Bamkhel outpost, traced the TikToker, and police have taken immediate action and arrested the suspect, a resident of Bamkhel.”
A first information report (FIR) has been filed against the TikToker at the Swabi city police station — available with Dawn.com — stating that the police came to know that he was making videos performing obscene acts on social media, “which had a very bad impact on society”.
The FIR was registered under Section 294 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which “makes it an offence to commit any obscene act or sing, recite, or utter obscene songs, ballads, or words in or near a public place to the annoyance of others, punishable with imprisonment up to three months, a fine, or both.”
After being arrested, the suspect confessed to the crime and promised to refrain from such immoral activities in the future.
The TikToker said in a video recorded by police: “I belong to Jafarkhail, a Mohallah of Bamkhel village. I was making videos and uploading to my TikTok account. I will not make such videos in the future.”
SHO Amin said that the content creator had been presented in a local court and “would face the law of the land”.
DSP Abazai said that it was very sad that he was making videos in Swabi’s traditional chail, a chador proudly worn by women in the district. Aziz Manerwal, a renowned writer, told Dawn.com about the significance of the chail.
“No one can deny the importance of the Swabi chail. It has cultural and traditional significance,” he said.
“The women here wear it with great pride. It is said that a battle took place here in history, and when women placed their white shawls on their dead bodies, they would create red dots, and since then, women here have been wearing white shawls with red dots.”</p><small>2025-09-07 11:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68bb03a83e945.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939974/comment-why-the-indus-waters-treaty-matters-globally' target='_blank'><strong>COMMENT: WHY THE INDUS WATERS TREATY MATTERS GLOBALLY</strong></a><br><p>Picture this: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, New Zealand, Pakistan, India and the World Bank sitting around the same table with a shared mission — creating one of the world’s most successful examples of international cooperation.
This isn’t diplomatic wishful thinking; it’s exactly what happened in the 1950s when these nations came together to forge the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
While headlines today focus on border skirmishes and political discord between India and Pakistan, this remarkable partnership of countries quietly built something extraordinary: a regional public good that has fed 300 million people, powered two economies, and survived the Cold War and border skirmishes for over 60 years.
THE STAKES — THEN AND NOW
When Pakistan gained independence in 1947, potential water wars in the Subcontinent posed a global threat. Rather than leaving it to chance, the international community acted decisively.
 
 

Each country brought different strengths — financial resources, technical expertise, diplomatic capital and local knowledge — to build infrastructure and institutions that have lasted over six decades.
Today, both India and Pakistan stand at critical economic junctures. India races to realise its potential as a global economic powerhouse. Pakistan struggles with economic stability amid mounting climate threats, economic instability and regional tensions that have begun eroding half a century of development gains.

Forged by an unlikely alliance of world powers, the treaty is a stunning example of international cooperation that has survived wars and nuclear stand-offs. Now, it faces a new enemy in political collapse and climate change…

For India, continued cooperation isn’t diplomatic nicety. It is an economic necessity. The country’s ambitious manufacturing and technology sectors depend on stable agricultural supply chains and regional trade routes. Water conflicts would disrupt these foundations just as India seeks larger shares of global markets.
Pakistan faces starker realities. Climate change has intensified flooding and drought cycles, making predictable water flows guaranteed by the treaty literally lifesaving. The country’s economic recovery plans depend heavily on agricultural exports and energy generation, both impossible without the water security the IWT provides.
Regional trade between these nuclear neighbours remains far below potential, partly due to political tensions. This precarious situation is exactly what the treaty’s architects sought to prevent, building a system so robust it has defied the odds for over six decades.
WHY THE TREATY WORKS
The IWT represents something unique in international relations: a genuine multilateral success story, where developed and developing nations pooled resources to create lasting regional prosperity. What economists call a “regional public good” — a resource that benefits everyone in a region regardless of contribution — was deliberately constructed through unprecedented international cooperation.
 
 

The scale of commitment was extraordinary. The founding partners, working through the World Bank (WB), invested what amounts to $8 billion in today’s money. This wasn’t charity. It was strategic investment in regional stability and economic development that has paid dividends for decades.
The treaty succeeded because it aligned individual national interests with collective regional benefits. Every participating country gained something valuable: India and Pakistan secured predictable water access, contributing nations advanced regional stability objectives, and the WB established a template for successful development cooperation.
The numbers demonstrate the treaty’s economic impact. The Indus basin supports the world’s largest contiguous irrigation system, feeding millions directly. The Green Revolution that transformed South Asia from food-deficit to food-surplus was built on the foundation of reliable water-sharing provided by the treaty.  Rice paddies in Punjab, wheat fields in Sindh, and cotton farms across the basin all depend on this cooperative framework.
This ingenious treaty not only serves as an economic engine, but also functions as a bulwark against a shared and devastating failure.
THE COST OF FAILURE
Without this framework, agricultural collapse would trigger food insecurity across South Asia and beyond. The treaty prevents what economists call “tragedy of the commons” — destructive competition over shared resources that leaves everyone worse off.
Beyond immediate economic benefits, the Indus Basin represents something more profound: a piece of humanity’s shared heritage that transcends national boundaries. The Indus Valley was home to humanity’s earliest civilisations, where agriculture, cities and trade first flourished 5,000 years ago. The river system that sustained those ancient societies continues to support one of the world’s most densely populated regions today.
The scientific community increasingly recognise major river systems, such as the Indus, as global commons — ecosystems whose health affects the entire planet — joining other critical systems such as the Amazon Rainforest, the Congo Basin, the Great Barrier Reef and Antarctica, which are viewed as a common heritage of humankind. The Indus basin’s glacial systems help regulate regional climate patterns. Its wetlands provide crucial biodiversity habitat. Its agricultural output contributes to global food security.
The treaty’s importance will only grow as climate change intensifies. The Himalayas, source of the Indus system, are warming faster than the global average. Glacial melt patterns are shifting. Monsoon cycles are becoming less predictable. Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity.
 
 

These changes don’t respect national borders. India and Pakistan must adapt together or fail separately. The treaty’s existing framework for data sharing, joint technical committees and dispute resolution provides institutional foundation needed for emergent issues. Article VII of the treaty provides the legal foundation for “future cooperation” and “optimum development” of the rivers, yet it has remained largely unutilised.
Forward-looking economists argue that disaster-resilient infrastructure and cooperative resource management will be key competitive advantages in the coming decades. Countries that maintain stable agricultural production, reliable water supplies and peaceful regional relationships will attract investment and trade partnerships.
The model that averted failure — and managed complex pressures — now serves as a blueprint for the world.
THE GLOBAL BLUEPRINT
The WB’s role demonstrates how international institutions can facilitate regional public goods, while maintaining neutrality. Despite governance structures that give major donors significant voting power, the WB keeps treaty functions strictly neutral and technical. This preserves credibility as an honest broker, while ensuring stakeholders maintain oversight.
 
 

The Bank served as both architect and guarantor of the IWT, channelling international contributions while maintaining operational independence necessary for neutral facilitation. This governance model — combining board oversight with institutional neutrality — has proven remarkably durable, surviving multiple wars, political crises and leadership changes in all participating countries.
This model has global implications. From the Mekong River in Southeast Asia to the Nile in Africa, transboundary water systems worldwide face similar pressures. The IWT offers a template for how international coalitions can facilitate regional public goods that benefit entire regions while respecting national sovereignty.
THE PATH FORWARD
The IWT stands as proof that international partnerships can create enduring regional public goods when they commit sufficient resources and design proper institutions. The choice facing the original coalition partners isn’t about water allocation — it’s about preserving a mechanism that has served global stability for over six decades.
The smart economic choice, the environmentally responsible choice and the globally minded choice all point toward protecting this remarkable achievement. In a world seeking models for successful multilateral cooperation, this eight-nation vision offers a blueprint for the kind of collective action that will define prosperity and stability in the 21st century.
However, the original leadership now faces a critical choice. Their investments in regional stability, their stake in South Asian prosperity, and their share in global trade and resilience all depend on preserving this cooperative framework. As nuclear tensions rise and climate pressures mount, these eight partners must actively intervene to protect not just a treaty, but their own strategic interests in regional peace, economic stability, and the multilateral cooperation model they pioneered.
The IWT isn’t just South Asia’s treasure — it’s proof of what the international community can achieve when it commits to building something bigger than itself.

Apart from Pakistan, the “three-nation tournament” would feature Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, the press release said.
 






It added that the series was organised to “provide all teams with valuable preparation” ahead of next year’s International Cricket Council Men’s T20 World Cup, which will take place in India and Sri Lanka.
Detailing its schedule, it further stated that the hosts would take on Afghanistan on November 17, marking the beginning of the series at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. It also mentioned that “will be Afghanistan’s first-ever T20I in Pakistan”.
“On November 19, Sri Lanka will face Afghanistan at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, while the remaining five T20Is of the tri-series, including the final on November 29, will be played at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore,” the press release said.

Tri-series schedule

Nov 17: Pakistan vs Afghanistan at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium
Nov 19: Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium
Nov 22: Pakistan vs Sri Lanka at Gaddafi Stadium
Nov 23: Pakistan vs Afghanistan at Gaddafi Stadium
Nov 25: Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan at Gaddafi Stadium
Nov 27: Pakistan vs Sri Lanka at Gaddafi Stadium
Nov 29: Series final at Gaddafi Stadium


In his statement included in the press release, Pakistan Cricket Board Chief Operating Officer Sumair Ahmed Syed said: “We look forward to hosting Sri Lanka and Afghanistan for Pakistan’s maiden T20I tri-series. This event will not only offer excellent preparation for next year’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup but also present fans with exciting cricket across venues.
“Earlier this year, [the] PCB successfully delivered the ICC Champions Trophy and the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier. These achievements underline our capacity and readiness to host back-to-back international events at the highest level.”
International cricket had dried up in Pakistan following a 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore. Consequently, the Green Shirts were forced to play international matches at neutral venues such as the United Arab Emirates.
In 2017, international cricket began gradually returning to Pakistan, with the Green Shirts playing against the ICC World XI in a series of three T20 internationals.
Earlier this year, the country hosted the ICC Champions Trophy in February and March, though India played their matches in Dubai. It was the first time that the Pakistan hosted an ICC event after 1996.
A day ago, the PCB also announced that South Africa’s team would be visiting Pakistan in October and November for a series of Test, One-Day International and T20I matches.</p><small>2025-09-07 11:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07151003cd5e877.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940275/kazakh-deputy-pm-to-arrive-in-pakistan-tomorrow-on-2-day-visit-to-further-cement-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Kazakh Deputy PM to arrive in Pakistan tomorrow on 2-day visit to further cement ties</strong></a><br><p>Kazakhstan’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Murat Nurtleu will arrive in Pakistan tomorrow on a two-day official visit to further cement bilateral ties, the Foreign Office said on Sunday.
Pakistan and Kazakhstan maintain friendly diplomatic relations, with bilateral trade worth $239 million, according to its envoy Yerzhan Kistafin.
Nurtleu will undertake an official visit to Pakistan from September 8 to 9, the FO said in a statement, adding that the trip will serve as a precursor to Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s visit scheduled in November 2025.
During his stay, the visiting dignitary will “hold a tête-à-tête” with his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar, followed by delegation-level talks.
 






Nurtleu is also expected to call on President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif, according to the FO.
“The discussions will provide an opportunity to review preparations for the upcoming presidential visit and to deliberate comprehensively on the entire spectrum of Pak-Kazakh bilateral cooperation, with particular focus on trade and investment, agriculture, education, cultural and tourism exchanges, regional connectivity and logistics, and collaboration at multilateral fora.”
Nurtleu will be accompanied by a high-level 13-member delegation, including the Transport Minister Nurlan Sauranbayev. The Joint Working Groups meetings on agriculture and IT will also be held on the sidelines of the visit.
The Kazakh deputy PM’s visit will “further cement the longstanding Pakistan-Kazakhstan ties and contribute to deepening bilateral engagements in diverse fields, for the benefit of the people of the two countries”, the FO statement added.
Kazakhstan is Pakistan’s top export destination among Central Asian countries, but exports dropped sharply by 47.12pc in the fiscal year 2025. It is also among the biggest importers of Pakistani mangoes.
 
 

In July, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan signed an agreement for a joint study on a major railway project intended to connect Central Asia with Pakis­tani seaports via Afghanistan.
Later that month, the Central Asian nation’s senior military officials also attended the Regional Chiefs of Defence Staff Conference held in Islamabad.
In April, Pakistan and Kazakhstan agreed to sign a transit trade accord for the movement of goods through three Pakistani ports — Karachi, Bin Qasim and Gwadar — and to engage other regional landlocked nations for opening multiple trade corridors.
Both sides also agreed to promote tourism by sharing lists of certified tour operators and launching joint promotional activities. In August last year, Ambassador Kistafin highlighted the opportunity of a direct flight from Kazakhstan to Skardu.</p><small>2025-09-07 10:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/071343041f2db52.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940268/microsoft-cloud-platform-hit-by-cable-cuts-in-red-sea' target='_blank'><strong>Microsoft cloud platform hit by cable cuts in Red Sea</strong></a><br><p>Global tech giant Microsoft on Sunday said network traffic for its Azure cloud computing platform was experiencing increased delays in parts of the Middle East due to “undersea fibre cuts” in the Red Sea.
Microsoft did not provide an explanation for what caused the cuts to the submarine lines, but noted its network had been affected since Saturday.
“Network traffic that does not traverse through the Middle East is not impacted,” the company said in a statement.
The internet access monitoring organisation NetBlocks noted that a series of submarine cable outages in the Red Sea has degraded internet connectivity in several countries, including in India and Pakistan.
Global internet and telecom cables have followed shipping routes through the Red Sea, but there has been growing anxiety about the state of the lines after Yemen’s Houthi rebels began attacking passing merchant vessels in late 2023, in actions the group said were in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the Israeli war on Gaza.
The laying and operation of underwater cables have long been the preserve of a consortium of large telecoms operators, but internet giants have largely taken over in recent years as they strive to keep up with ballooning flows of data.
 
 

About 1.4 million kilometres (nearly 900,000 miles) of fibre optic cables are laid on the ocean floor, enabling the provision of essential services such as trade, financial transactions, public services, digital health and education around the world.
Damage to submarine cables is not uncommon.
According to the International Cable Protection Committee, there are an average of 150 to 200 outages per year worldwide, or around three incidents a week.
Fishing and anchoring are believed to be responsible for the vast majority of recorded damage to the lines.
Natural hazards to the cables also include ageing, abrasions and equipment failure.</p><small>2025-09-07 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07122824163a497.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940262/japan-pm-decides-to-quit-as-opponents-seek-leadership-election' target='_blank'><strong>Japan PM decides to quit as opponents seek leadership election</strong></a><br><p>Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Sunday he would step down after less than a year in power in which he lost his majority in both houses of parliament.
“I have decided to resign from the position of president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LPD),” he said, referring to Japan’s ruling party, which has governed almost uninterrupted for decades.
Public broadcaster NHK said Ishiba made the decision to avoid a split in the party, while the Asahi Shimbun daily said he was unable to withstand the mounting calls for his resignation.
The farm minister and a former prime minister reportedly met with Ishiba on Saturday night to urge him to resign voluntarily.
Last week, four senior LDP officials including the party’s number two Hiroshi Moriyama offered to resign.
Opponents of Ishiba had been calling on him to step down to take responsibility for the election results, following the upper chamber vote in July.
LDP lawmakers and regional officials across Japan who want a new leadership election will submit a request on Monday.
The leadership race will be held if the required majority is reached.</p><small>2025-09-07 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0714493644e4030.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940271/italian-teen-who-died-of-leukaemia-in-2006-becomes-first-catholic-saint-of-millennial-generation' target='_blank'><strong>Italian teen who died of leukaemia in 2006 becomes first Catholic saint of millennial generation</strong></a><br><p>A teenager who died of leukaemia in 2006 became the first Catholic saint of the millennial generation on Sunday, in a Vatican ceremony led by Pope Leo and attended by thousands of young worshippers from dozens of countries.
Carlo Acutis, a British-born Italian boy who died aged 15, learned computer code to build websites to spread his faith. His story has drawn wide attention from Catholic youth, and he is now at the same level as Mother Teresa and Francis of Assisi.
Leo, the first US pontiff, canonised Acutis on Sunday along with Pier Giorgio Frassati, a young Italian man who was known for helping those in need and died of polio in the 1920s.
In impromptu remarks to crowds in St. Peter’s Square at the opening of the event, Leo said Acutis and Frassati were examples of holiness and of helping those in need.
“All of you, all of us together, are called to be saints,” the pontiff told the young crowd, which had spilt out of the square down the main boulevard into the Vatican from Rome.
Acutis’ canonisation had been hotly anticipated by many Catholic youths for months. It was originally set for April but was postponed after the death of Pope Francis.
Sunday’s event is the first time that Leo, elected pope by the world’s cardinals in May, has presided over such a ceremony.
Antonio D’Averio, 24, who was at the ceremony, called the canonisation “a hand extended by the Church toward us young people.” D’Averio said he was a computer programmer and identified especially with Acutis’ story.
“He too was passionate about computer science,” said the young man. “For a saint, it’s certainly something new. It’s also something that, in my opinion, was needed.”
‘We want to follow their steps,’ said Clara Marugan Martin, aged 20, who came from Spain for the event.
“We are very pleased to be here because Carlo and Pier Giorgio are two examples of young people full of God, full of grace, and we want to follow their steps,” she said.
Being made a saint means the Church believes a person lived a holy life and is now in heaven.
Other saints who died young include Therese of Lisieux, who died at 24 in 1897 and was known for promoting a “Little Way” of charity; and Aloysius Gonzaga, who died at 23 in 1591 after caring for victims of an epidemic in Rome.
As Acutis progressed along the Church’s official path to sainthood, his body was moved to a church in the hill town of Assisi in central Italy, where St. Francis was from, in line with Acutis’ last wishes.
The new saint’s final resting place, where Acutis is entombed with a wax mould of his likeness placed over his body, wearing his track top, jeans and trainers, has become a popular devotional site, attracting thousands of worshippers every day.</p><small>2025-09-07 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0712511517a4519.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940264/air-force-day-air-chief-sidhu-says-paf-committed-to-advancing-capabilities-in-electronic-warfare-cyber-tech' target='_blank'><strong>Air Force Day: Air chief Sidhu says PAF committed to advancing capabilities in electronic warfare, cyber tech</strong></a><br><p>Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu on Sunday said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) was committed to advancing its capabilities in electronic warfare and cyber technologies.
He made the remarks while addressing the central Martyrs’ Day ceremony held at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, as the nation observes the Pakistan Air Force Day to honour PAF martyrs.
“He (ACM Sidhu) affirmed that Pakistan Air Force would remain committed to advancing its capabilities in space, electronic warfare, cyber technologies, niche domains and indigenous defence production to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation,” said a press release by the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The PAF solemnly observed Martyrs’ Day across all its bases nationwide, ISPR noted.
The day commenced with special prayers and recitation of the Holy Quran, “dedicated to the martyrs of the 1965 and 1971 wars, as well as to all those who have rendered the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty since the creation of Pakistan”.
 






Addressing the ceremony as the chief guest, ACM Sidhu underscored the proud legacy of sacrifice, courage and professionalism that defines the PAF.
He emphasised that Martyrs’ Day “symbolises the extraordinary bravery, impeccable professionalism and unparalleled spirit of sacrifice demonstrated” by the armed forces.
The air chief stressed that well-cognisant of the fast-changing security dynamics, the PAF stood committed to its mission with singularity of purpose.
“The latest link in [the] chain of victories secured by PAF in Marka-i-Haq / Bunyanum Marsoos has once more proved our will and capability to guard the aerial frontiers of our motherland,” he was quoted as saying.
As New Delhi launched deadly air strikes on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam attack, which Islamabad denied, PAF downed six Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
The martyrs of Marka-i-Haq — the term used for the period of conflict with India — along with the country’s military and civilian leadership, were conferred with a total of 488 national awards on August 14. These included eight Sitara-i-Jurat, seven Sitara-i-Basalat, 23 Tamgha-i-Basalat and 79 Imtiazi Sanad for PAF personnel.
 
 

In his address today, the PAF chief reiterated his firm resolve to make “every possible effort for the progress and prosperity of Pakistan in the evolving global environment”, the ISPR statement said.
Paying “heartfelt tribute” to the fallen heroes of PAF, the air chief said, “We owe our heroes an eternal debt of gratitude for their supreme sacrifices, which serve as an enduring example for future generations.“
He further expressed unwavering solidarity with the people of India-occupied Kashmir in their “legitimate and indigenous struggle for the right to self-determination”, the press release added.
ACM Sidhu also laid a floral wreath at the Martyrs’ Monument and offered fateha for the departed souls to pay homage to the martyrs.
To mark the Defence and Air Force Day, the PAF released a new song titled “Shaheen”.
 


President, PM hail PAF’s ‘decisive role’ during India conflict
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the PAF’s “decisive“ role during the military conflict with India in May, when the air force shot down six Indian jets.
“In recent history, the Pakistan Air Force, together with the armed forces, played a decisive role in Marka-i-Haq [and Bunyanum Marsoos] and the way it defeated the enemy on all fronts amazed the whole world,“ PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of Pakistan.
“Undoubtedly, this high-level performance of the Pakistan Air Force was a manifestation of fearless leadership, the skill of the fighter sons, superior strategy, and effective implementation of multi-faceted combat capabilities,“ he added.
 






“The invincible multi-faceted combat capabilities of the Pakistan Air Force are a testament to its innovation in recent years.
“I am particularly proud that the Pakistan Air Force, while keeping its glorious historical tradition alive, defeated an enemy many times larger than itself,“ the premier emphasised.
“Our heroes of the Pakistan Air Force proved with their bravery that no matter how strong and well-armed the enemy is, it can never defeat passion and courage,” he observed.
The prime minister paid tribute to the PAF’s “unparalleled performance”, observing that the martyrs’ “immortal sacrifices are illuminated in history”.
PM Shehbaz said: “Undoubtedly, the founders of the Pakistan Air Force laid its foundation as a high-class and leading institution in accordance with the vision of the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
“Pakistan Air Force continues to perform well in all professional aspects and is no less than any other air force in the world in terms of professionalism,” the premier added.
“We are proud that the Pakistan Air Force has shown its professionalism and immense strength in [the] last decades during air combat.“
 






In his statement, President Zardari said: “Whether it was the 1965 war or the more recent Marka-i-Haq Bunyanum Marsus, our air warriors have always risen to the challenge, giving the enemy a decisive response and filling the nation with pride.”
The president highlighted that the world had “witnessed the remarkable skill and professionalism of PAF”, hailing its evolution into a “modern, capable, and highly professional institution”.
“My heart goes out in deep respect to our martyrs and ghazis whose courage and sacrifices continue to inspire the nation,” President Zardari said.
 
 

He recalled: “In 1965, our air warriors, against overwhelming odds, wrote a story of extraordinary bravery and determination. Their daring actions not only defended our skies but also lifted the morale of an entire nation.
“That spirit of sacrifice and excellence remains alive in every generation of the PAF,” he added. The president paid tribute to the martyrs’ families for bearing the “greatest sacrifice of all”, as well as the warriors for their resilience and dedication.
“I am confident that the Pakistan Air Force will continue to protect our skies and sovereignty with the same resolve and passion that has always defined it.”

The neighbours have not met on either side’s soil in a bilateral series since 2012 and only play each other in international tournaments on neutral ground as part of a compromise deal.
 
 

The two Asian cricketing giants have been clubbed together in the same group and could potentially meet three times in the tournament, which concludes on September 28.
There have been tensions in the build-up after Pakistan and India fought an intense four-day conflict in May — their worst since 1999 — when the two countries stepped back from an all-out war in the aftermath of the April 22 attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
India blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, while Islamabad strongly denied the allegations. New Delhi launched deadly air strikes on Pakistan on May 7, in response to which the Pakistan Air Force downed six Indian jets. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
In a sign of lingering bitterness, an Indian team of retired players withdrew from their semi-final with Pakistan in the World Championship of Legends in July-August in England.
Led by former international Yuvraj Singh, the Indians also refused to play Pakistan in the group stage of the tournament, as clamour grew among fans to boycott the games.
 
 

Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh was part of the veterans team and has strongly opposed the Asia Cup game.
“Blood and sweat cannot co-exist,” Harbhajan told The Times of India. “It cannot be the case that there’s fighting on the border, tensions between the two nations, and we go to play cricket.
“Until these big issues are resolved, cricket is a very small matter.”
India strong favourites
India and Pakistan last met in cricket, again in Dubai, in February in the 50-over Champions Trophy, with India winning by six wickets and going on to lift the title.
They are also defending Asia Cup champions and led by Suryakumar Yadav are clear favourites against their old foes with a 10-3 win record against Pakistan in T20 internationals.
Pakistan will be without star players Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, both dropped from the shortest format because of poor form.
 
 

India won the previous Asia Cup, which was played in a 50-over format in 2023, when they beat hosts Sri Lanka in the final in Colombo. India are strong favourites to retain their crown.
The five full members of the Asian Cricket Council — Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka — earned automatic qualification to the tournament.
They are joined by Hong Kong, Oman and the UAE, teams that secured their spots by finishing in the top three of the ACC men’s Premier Cup.
Group A is made up of India, Pakistan, hosts UAE and Oman.
Group B comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka. The group stage will be followed by a Super Four round, followed by the final in Dubai.</p><small>2025-09-07 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07094451a56cb1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940026/nine-judicial-officers-terminated-for-misconduct-corruption' target='_blank'><strong>Nine judicial officers terminated for misconduct, corruption</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court Chief Justice SM Attique Shah has dismissed from service nine judicial officers, who were restored early this year, as they were found guilty of ‘misconduct, corruption, and inefficiency’ in a fresh inquiry against them.
The dismissed judicial officers include four additional district and sessions judges Malik Amjid Rahim, Manzoor Qadir, Qaiser Rahim and Ms Riffat Aamir; four senior civil judges named Safeer Qaiser Malik, Adil Akbar Khan, Rashid Rauf Swati and Shah Hussain, and a civil judge Tasawar Hussain.
The high court had initiated disciplinary proceedings under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2011 on charges of misconduct, corruption, and inefficiency against the said officers, according to a press release issued here on Friday.
The inquiry into the charges was conducted by a PHC judge, who found the officers guilty and recommended the imposition of a major penalty.

PHC CJ imposes major penalty after inquiry

“Upon receipt of the inquiry report, the chief justice, being the competent authority, issued final show-cause notices and afforded each officer an opportunity of personal hearing,” the release stated.
“After hearing the accused officers, the chief justice found them guilty of the charges and imposed the major penalty of dismissal from service,” it concluded.
 


It merits a mention here that the said officers were reinstated in April this year after eight years of their removal from service orders, which were set aside last year by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Subordinate Judiciary Service Tribunal.
A notification was issued for their reinstatement by the high court stating that in pursuance of the judgment of the Subordinate Judiciary Service Tribunal of July 26, 2024, and recommendations of the administration committee of the high court given in a meeting on April 8, 2025, the competent authority (chief justice) had reinstated the said judicial officers.
However, the notification provided that their reinstatement would be without any back-dated benefits and would be subject to the outcome of de-novo inquiry proceedings against them as well as pending appeals filed by the high court before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
While terminating their services along with two other judicial officers in April 2017, the high court had announced that those judges had violated the disciplinary law.
At that time, Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi was the chief justice of the high court.
The high court had declared that after those judicial officers were found guilty, the chief justice with the concurrence of the administration committee had imposed the major penalty of removal from service on them.
Last year, the service tribunal had ordered reinstatement of 11 judicial officers, including the present nine officers and a district and sessions judge, Sardar Mohammad Irshad and an additional district and sessions judge, Abdul Hakeem Hashmi.
However, as Sardar Irshad had attained the age of superannuation and Abdul Hakeem had passed away, therefore, their names were not included in the reinstatement notification.
These judicial officers had contended before the tribunal that merely over allegations about their general reputation, social contacts and conduct they could not be removed from service.
Full court meeting
A full court meeting of the judges of the Peshawar High Court was held here on Friday under the chairmanship of Chief Justice SM Attique Shah.
The chief justice apprised the judges of the initiatives undertaken to ensure expeditious and comprehensive dispensation of justice.
He emphasised the vigorous application of information and computer technology-based solutions to address challenges relating to court and case management, enhance facilitation for litigants, and safeguard people’s fundamental rights.
The judges reaffirmed their commitment to translating the chief justice’s vision into reality within the shortest possible time.
The chief justice expressed satisfaction over the performance of the district judiciary, acknowledging both the quality and quantity of their output as well as their sense of duty and commitment.
He also appreciated the constructive role of the bar as an integral partner in the administration of justice.
He also recognised the contribution of the court staff, and said that individuals found indulging in malpractice would soon be dealt with firmly.
A comprehensive agenda comprising 20 items was deliberated upon during the full court meeting.
The meeting concluded with a unanimous resolution that the new judicial year would usher in greater achievements and continued success for the institution.

This concept has become a critical junction in today’s urban planning. For most of human history, we have designed in harmony with other species. This is important to keep in mind for architects and developers exploring the spatial, cultural and ecological impacts of the industrialised, built-environment.
However, this is not the case in Karachi. As the urban flooding across the city on August 19, 2025 in the aftermath of torrential downpour demonstrated yet again, Karachi’s ‘urban planning’ has left the city and its inhabitants standing at a perilous juncture. The relentless building of high-rises, destruction of coastal lines, lack of city planning and brazen flouting of building safety laws have led to Karachi literally drowning in infrastructural problems.
So how did Karachi end up in such a mess? The reasons are multi-layered and are the consequence of decades of neglect and misplaced priorities. Over the years, Karachi has seen its master plans being routinely disregarded, zoning laws becoming ineffective, high-rises being built without consideration for safety regulations and rampant commercialisation in urban centres that simply lack the infrastructure to support such relentless ‘growth’.

The havoc wreaked by the recent rains in Karachi was a reminder that the megapolis exists today in a fragile ecosystem, due in large part to rampant urban ‘development’ and aggressive real-estate projects. How did the city arrive at this juncture and can it still be saved?

As a consequence, Karachi has many densely built localities where people have no choice but to live in poorly ventilated, poorly lit, tightly-packed buildings in the middle of urban centres that are already wrestling with issues of traffic congestion and sanitation. Beyond this, the environmental ramifications of such unregulated urban development and the systematic erasure of so many green spaces across the city has only served to increase the likelihood of urban flooding in Karachi.
 
 

Land use in Karachi is entirely determined by land value. As a result, the majority has always witnessed slow violence in the form of pollution, environmental degradation, congestion and degradation of the right to life. It is established that the temporalities of development and urban interventions have not catered to the needs of the majority.
Karachi’s vertical expansion illustrates the city’s isolated high-stakes approach to urban development, where real estate developers are scrambling to exploit the bubble formed over mixed-use land. Enabling legal frameworks and a lack of adherence to master plans have allowed the city to undergo major transformations since the early 2000s, when major road arteries were commercialised by the former mayor of Karachi Naimatullah Khan. The impact of unchecked urban development and commercial pattis [rows of shops] located below high-rise residential buildings is cause for great concern.
But before diving into the specifics of Karachi’s urban development issues, it is imperative to understand how the changes in the city’s social demography and the rise of the nuclear family model catalysed the haphazard ‘development’ path Karachi has been on for decades.
UNDERSTANDING THE URBAN FAMILY MODEL
Contrary to what some may think, high- and mid-rise development in Karachi is not a new phenomenon. Since the time of the British, areas such as Saddar featured commercial strips, with owners residing in the upper floors, culminating in mixed-use urban form that has persisted post-Partition.
These high-rise buildings often housed tight-knit communities, bound by ethnicity, religion or class, creating cross-functional networks of care and trust. This social architecture softened the blows of Karachi’s sprawling heterogeneity.
 
 

As Partition gradually reshaped the city’s demography, the development of high-rise residences laid a particular emphasis on housing particular ethnic groups, such as Sindhis, Parsis, Memons etc. However, this devolved into a utilitarian model based solely on profit, as the real estate economy grew in the city at an alarming pace.
Over the past few decades, residential buildings have evolved into multi-ethnic hubs retaining the built form: commercial pattis tucked between stacked apartments based more on functionality than rigid zoning. This organic ‘development’ shaped Karachi’s economy, creating a kind of vertical densification.
According to Amber Ali Bhai, head of the non-profit Shehri - Citizens for a Better Environment, “It’s basically a mental ghetto of the people, and that’s how they feel comfortable… they feel it’s about safety in numbers.”
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s (MQM) rise in the late 1970s radically altered Karachi’s social fabric, where safety became a heightened concern. The concept of a high-rise — due to more people together, one entrance and a watchman to guard it — grew popular among the middle class. Political violence forced the people of Karachi to retreat behind closed doors and gates.
The shift towards high-rise residential buildings catalysed the transition of joint-family systems into nuclear families, with women gaining more autonomy within the home. Ethnically skewed master plans, once a tool of segregation, lost their importance in the face of undocumented wealth and increased private mobility. Accessibility became a given, as people moved beyond their designated enclaves, perpetuating fractured urban identity.
So, if the city’s master plans have become less and less important over the years, what rubric is being followed when copious amounts of real-estate projects are being green-lit across the city?
 

As demonstrated by these satellite images, Karachi has the lowest green cover among the world’s major cities, making luxury ‘eco-developments’ pure performance, not protection

THE CRUMBLING IMPORTANCE OF MASTER PLANS AND CONVENTIONAL PLANNING
Over the years, Karachi’s master plans have been reduced to suggestions rather than law. The city’s urban and infrastructural development has grown speculative and disconnected from the ecological realities of the region. As the world moves towards efficient city planning, Karachi’s government remains rooted in conventional methods.
These plans are created by the same regulatory bodies tasked with enforcement, such as the Karachi Development Authority (KDA), creating a conflict of interest. The city finds itself grappling with a top-down approach, where high-rises appear in low-density zones and civic infrastructure is either reactive or entirely missing. Karachi’s land-use policy continues to fragment its urban fabric, inviting irreversible damage through poorly conceived flyovers, commercial encroachments and the destruction of green buffers.
Political misalignment has cost Karachi far more than the Sindh Government is willing to admit. Naimatullah Khan’s controversial commercialisation of major road networks in the early 2000s set a precedent for bypassing city-level planning in favour of short term revenue. This divorce between the policymakers and key stakeholders continued with disjointed policies, such as the Sindh High Density Act 2010 that was introduced by the prime minister at the time without due consultation with urban planners.
This results in a governance model where decisions about a city’s future are made without architects, urban planners and the public. Barring key stakeholders from decision-making ensures that development serves capital, not communities. Infrastructure falters, as essential services such as water, sewerage and electricity buckle. This is all the more evident in the poorly planned commercial centres that litter the city.
COMMERCIAL-ORIENTED GROWTH CENTRES
Markets, over the course of history, have been at the gravitational core of cities, surrounded by homes, institutions and power. Karachi mirrors this historical blueprint with a contemporary evolution — its markets are malls. Dolmen City, Lucky One and Dolmen Mall Tariq Road are examples of how new markets serve as hyper-condensed urban cores.
Using satellite imagery over the past 15 years, negative (open) spaces were mapped to showcase urban development around these nodes. Their placement is strategic. Through the absorption of consumer attention, these malls anchor surrounding high-rise development and create retail-service ecosystems that uphold the precedent set by older commercial pattis.
 
 

Yet, in Karachi’s context, this urban density comes at a grave cost. Unlike historic centres that grew in response to public need, the emergence of mall-centric cities reflects French sociologist Henri Lefebvre’s concept of “abstract space”, which is conceived by and for capital, often disconnected from infrastructural and ecological realities.
Water lines remain unchanged, sewerage systems overloaded, while vertical real-estate forests grow around malls, prioritising accessibility for consumption over sustainability. This evolution reshapes the city’s skyline, replacing communal space with transactional zones.
So who is to blame for this unregulated transformation of Karachi’s cityscape and why are the laws designed to prevent such issues proving to be ineffective?
ZONING LAWS AND THE POLITICS OF COMMERCIALISATION
The fault in this regard lies not in our stars, but in ourselves — so let’s illustrate this issue with an example.
On March 13, 2025, the SBCA proposed to amend Chapter 19 of the Karachi Building and Town Planning Regulations (KBTPR) 2002. This clause allowed the redefinition of plots meant for “residential use” to more revenue-driven establishments, including educational centres, healthcare clinics and for other recreational purposes. Framed as “a change for the public good”, it obscured the distinction between residential, amenity and commercial plots, disrupting legal and architectural zone-planning.
 
 

However, the SBCA’s proposition faced widespread criticism for breaching constitutional and administrative jurisdiction. Civil society actors, including Shehri - Citizens for a Better Environment and the Public Interest Law Association of Pakistan (PILAP), among other public-interest petitioners, highlighted to the Sindh High Court that the role of re-categorising land-use is reserved with planning authorities such as the KDA or the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), instead of the SBCA.
Petitioners further referenced Articles 9 and 14 of Chapter 1, Part II of the Constitution of Pakistan, in particular the right to life and privacy — highlighting that this attempt to broaden the scope of “residential use” unilaterally was an unlawful exercise of power that threatened the existing legal framework, public space protection and civic amenities. Bhai stated that these “cul-de-sacs are being turned into cash-cows”, transforming the built-environment of residential neighbourhoods without any public input.
The High Court acknowledged the matter on April 8, 2025 and issued notices to the SBCA, KDA and KMC, halting the implementation of the clause. Met with increasing civic pressure, legal review and questions over jurisdiction, the SBCA withdrew the notification on May 13, 2025.
 

Multiple high-rises can be seen surrounding the area where the Homi Katrak Mansion stands on Abdullah Haroon Road: areas such as this, with high cultural nodes and low-density architecture, have now been surrounded by vertical construction

However, this incident is far from an isolated episode and merely sheds light on a broader pattern of unplanned development and legal circumvention. In the 1980s, zone-planning across Karachi generally allowed neighbourhoods around Gulshan-i-Iqbal and North Nazimabad to develop buildings that were ground floor plus one (G+1) and ground floor plus two (G+2). High-rises were scarce and necessitated civic infrastructure guarantees.
By the 1990s, however, there was a significant shift: commercial corridors were planned along previously low-density areas such as Sharae Faisal, Tariq Road and University Road, opening the door to mid-rise G+4 developments.
During the 2000s, the KBTPR 2002 institutionalised this shift in development by upgrading the Floor Area Ratios (FARs) from 1.75:1 to 3:1, or even 4:1 — which allowed the construction of more total covered floor space on the same plot of land, thus leading to much more vertical development — and enabling developers to escape liability by paying amnesty fees, allowing practices that benefit the builders. As architect Arif Belgaumi notes, “Nobody builds 100 percent of what is allowable, they build 120 percent.”
Once, a single family was housed on a residential plot in areas such as Gulshan, Hyderi or Jauhar. Now, 50 to 60 families, often over 1,000 people, including service staff, occupy the same space in high-rises reaching G+40. This increases the burden on the nearby roads and on G+2/3 buildings, in terms of water, energy and waste management.
 
 

This desire for high-rise construction is a constant cause of concern, because such projected structures hinder wind rotation and sunlight, thereby worsening air quality. Despite these pressures, the SBCA’s intervention is rare.
Despite the Supreme Court ban on using residential and amenity plots for commercial use, 930 conversions have taken place in Karachi since the start of 2024, as per the SBCA’s own admission. This increasing disconnect between law and implementation reveals what urban planner Ananya Roy calls “informality from above”, when the state selectively enforces or suspends rules to enable speculative development under a façade of legality.
This prompts an important inquiry into where our policies go from here, emphasising the role of legal mechanisms in pushing public interest development or facilitating selective evasion of laws. Such regularised inconsistency makes urban governance unpredictable in issuing and amending commercialisation laws.
THE COLLAPSE OF REGULATIONS
The issue of scale plays a critical role in a city such as Karachi, where most of the development takes place under the aegis of the builder mafia, without any Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or structural research and development.
No Objection Certificates (NOCs) have existed since pre-Partition, while EIAs became mandatory in 1994 under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act of 1997. They were designed to ensure sustainable urban development, without causing lethal damage to the ecology. However, they have been reduced to hollow bureaucratic rituals, routinely used to fast-track construction with little oversight.
Belgaumi and urban planner Farhan Anwar deem Karachi’s EIA process as a “bureaucratic formality.” Assessments are typically carried out by builder-hired consultants focused solely on individual plots, ignoring neighbourhood-level impacts. Public hearings are treated as technical requirements rather than spaces for genuine scrutiny. Mitigations are rarely explored, and community feedback is sidelined.
The Bahria Icon Tower on the Clifton Promenade is a prominent example of carrying out construction without paying much heed to EIAs and the legal viability of a project — while also endangering heritage sites for its construction.
 
 

Endangered heritage sites are often scapegoated for disrupting ecology, but it is powerful developer groups that are reshaping Clifton’s landscape. In Old Clifton, developers, supported by the police, reportedly demolished a heritage bungalow to make way for a high-rise, destroying banyan trees and displacing migratory birds in the process. Due to such constructions, Clifton is now a concrete expanse, commodified at the expense of ecological and cultural memory.
Over 200 high-rises along major arteries, such as Sharae Faisal, were built without proper planning, fire exits or emergency systems. The SBCA issued NOCs and completion certificates without site inspections or consulting the KMC. There are countless such examples.
Hence, EIAs and NOCs are no longer safeguards. They legitimise reckless development and ignore transparency and public accountability. The disastrous impact of this is on display across the city.

ECOLOGICAL DISPARITIES
The ecological toll caused by unregulated high-rise developments is undeniable. Bhai notes the increasing vertical growth in KDA schemes. These areas were never designed for such high density. Consequently, parking needs, unfiltered carbon monoxide and unsanctioned commercial activities worsen residential life.
She also highlights the sewerage outbursts under the Clifton Bridge, which lead to unhygienic living conditions. Residents report that in places such as Gulshan, hot, dust-heavy wind flows in one direction, or not at all, while natural light is blocked due to narrow setbacks and cantilevered floors.
Continuing from Amber Ali Bhai’s argument, urban planners also critique not adhering to zonal planning. The vertical construction is widely critiqued because areas meant for G+1 or G+2 are obliterated by the seepage of high rises into them. Belgaumi furthers this critique by emphasising how high-rise construction has eliminated gardens and permeable surfaces, aggravating flood risks and temperature rises. The risk of flooding across Karachi is on display every year during the monsoon season in the city.
As a result, it is the citizens inhabiting these urban spaces that are forced to contend with the hard realities of living in such localities.
SOCIAL RELATIONS IN URBAN BUILT-ENVIRONMENTS
In densely populated Karachi neighbourhoods such as Gulshan and Hyderi, the wall-to-wall vertical expansion has hindered the natural light and ventilation flow. Residents living in bungalows and on lower floors of high-rises are subject to accumulated heat and lack of air circulation.
Architect and urban planner Arif Hasan describes the absence of fundamental necessities and notes, “Everybody has a right to some fresh air and some light.”
 
 

Such eco-spatial limitations then materialise into psychological and physiological concerns, and residents report increased mental strain and respiratory problems. A 2021 survey conducted by the Urban Resource Centre (URC) in Karachi found that nearly 64 percent of respondents living in newer vertical buildings in Gulshan Block 13-D and Hyderi complained of chronic discomfort related to heat and poor air flow.
Using 15 years of satellite imagery, this research mapped the changing landscape of Clifton Block 1 and Gulistan-i-Jauhar in five-year increments. The results reveal an uneven and increasingly stark ratio between green space and high-rise construction, especially in the case of Clifton Block 1.
While Gulistan-i-Jauhar could already be considered dense and a heavily developed neighbourhood in 2010, Clifton Block 1 highlights a sharper trajectory. While green spaces shrink at an alarming pace in both zones, the latter witnesses an aggressive rise in vertical construction, with little thought given to the residents living in its shadows.
The reformation of roads such as Rashid Minhas Road and Bilawal Chowrangi into commercial corridors has not only significantly eradicated green spaces but worsened traffic congestion, noise pollution and water accumulation during the rains.
Over the course of history, zones, including Gulshan-i-Iqbal and Kharadar, were distinguished by their interwoven community living, inclusive of shared alleyways, courtyards and parks that allowed for everyday, informal human interaction. Instead, the proliferation of towering structures and high-rise-living has substituted social engagement with an isolated anonymous lifestyle. The lack of communal spaces has drastically decreased neighbourhood monitoring and reduced social cohesion.
Both the social and ecological ramifications of this kind of construction are resulting in immediate consequences and also more long term issues, and no amount of real-estate projects presented under the garb of ‘sustainability’ can help reverse the damage — instead, they only exacerbate it.
THE GREENWASHING OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT
While Karachi chokes on and drowns in the ecological cost of vertical expansion, a more insidious form of development plays out along its coastline.
Real-estate giants often market projects as sustainable utopias that feature biodiversity parks and oceanfront boardwalks. But this is greenwashing, not conservation. Some are aggressively changing the landscape of Clifton by buying out old historical properties and turning them into vertical dreamscapes. And other developers are developing projects on contested lands. Across Sindh’s coastal belt, from Hawke’s Bay to Thatta, Sujawal and Badin, ecological zones once designated for preservation are now being transformed into peri-urban real-estate hubs.
 
 

This is happening despite initiatives such as the internationally backed Delta Blue Carbon project, which aims to restore mangrove forests and generate carbon credits. Some projects misappropriate the language of climate action, however, without offering genuine environmental benefits. Built on reclaimed tidal lands, they displace mangroves, reduce biodiversity, and fail to contribute to verified carbon offsets.
Gated developments in Korangi Creek and DHA Phase VIII have further narrowed creeks, shrunk fish nurseries and worsened urban flooding. Certain projects at Hawke’s Bay violate environmental laws and erase fisherfolk communities, undermining climate resilience. In a city where EIA systems fail centrally, what chance does Karachi’s fragile coastline have?
Mangroves are among the most carbon-dense ecosystems on earth. Their destruction is not just an ecological loss, it’s a carbon bomb. No amount of rooftop gardens can change that.
MAKING THE CULPRIT PAY
So, as South Asian cities hurtle toward hyper-urbanisation, the question is no longer whether development will continue, but how it can sustain rather than destroy. Karachi’s unregulated vertical growth collides with ecological fragility. Amid this, the Polluter Pays Principle (PPP) offers a path toward accountability.
First introduced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1972 and endorsed at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the PPP has gained new traction at recent UN climate summits as a framework for loss and damage financing. Its logic is simple: those who profit from environmental harm must be financially and legally responsible for mitigation and restoration.
At the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27), then-climate change minister Sherry Rehman championed climate justice and the operationalisation of PPP. But this commitment remains largely rhetorical at home. Pakistan demands justice globally but falls short in regulating local polluters, especially in booming sectors such as construction.
 
 

Cement, for instance, accounts for approximately eight percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. Karachi developers must shift to low-carbon alternatives such as green cement, and the SBCA must enforce this shift, particularly for high-volume projects.
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification offers another pathway. While optional globally, SBCA could mandate a Karachi-specific version, requiring just one to two percent of project budgets for green roofs or solar panels. This small investment brings huge environmental returns.
In a region where the urban poor suffer from climate change the most, the PPP isn’t just policy — it’s a means for justice. If Karachi is to grow upwards, it must also grow responsibly, ensuring that those who profit also protect.
SAVING THE CITY FROM ITSELF
Karachi has evolved into a metropolis that is increasingly hostile to its own residents, where floods, heat and congestion are not natural inevitabilities but man-made crises. To help reverse this tide, Karachi’s development paradigm must shift. This means, among other things, reviving long-neglected master planning processes with genuine community participation, holding polluters accountable and embedding environmental safeguards in real-estate projects.
The illusion of progress in Karachi cannot only be measured by skylines. Instead valuing breathable air, accessible green spaces and social cohesion must be seen as markers of true urban prosperity. Without such a recalibration, the city risks drowning further — not only in rainwater, but in its own failures of imagination.

During a meeting at the CM House on Friday, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah proposed to Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi that technical experts from both Sindh and PR should jointly work out the modalities of the project.
According to a statement issued by the CM House, the chief minister stressed the urgent need to revive the KCR and expressed frustration over the project’s continued delays.
The statement said that the KCR would serve an estimated 650,000 passengers daily and provide critical east–west and north–south connectivity across Karachi. However, it added, the updated feasibility still awaits approval from Chinese authorities as the project is set to be executed under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
 






The chief minister proposed to the minister a collaborative approach, suggesting that the Sindh government and PR jointly develop the project, with involvement from donor agencies and the private sector.
The federal government decided to execute the project under CPEC, and as per the approved plan, the KCR has a 43.2-kilometre route, including 25.51km elevated and 17.7km on ground, and it would have 24 stations — 13 elevated and 11 on-ground.
The meeting was informed that anti-encroachment drives had already cleared over 11 acres of railway land along Drigh Road, Karachi University, Urdu College, and Gillani stations, but “problematic encroachments” remain near Liaquatabad and Urdu College.
 
 

The chief minister assured the minister that the Sindh government would continue to support PR in anti-encroachment operations and urban rehabilitation measures linked with the KCR route.
The meeting agreed that experts from both sides will jointly work out the final modalities of the KCR project, station outsourcing, and new train services.
The railway minister endorsed the chief minister’s proposals and gave assurances of full federal support.

Sabalenka duly atoned for those defeats to end Anisimova’s hopes of a remarkable redemption just two months after her traumatic 6-0, 6-0 thrashing by Iga Swiatek in the Wimbledon final.
 


“It’s crazy, all those tough lessons were worth it for this one,” said Sabalenka after becoming the first woman to successfully defend the US Open since Serena Williams in 2014. “I’m speechless right now.”
Anisimova had won six of nine previous encounters against Sabalenka, a run which included a victory in the semi-finals at Wimbledon.
But a determined Sabalenka, playing in the seventh Grand Slam title game of her career, brought all her experience to bear as she slammed the door on Anisimova’s dream of a maiden Grand Slam title.
“Losing in two finals in a row is great but it’s also super hard,” Anisimova said. “I think I didn’t fight hard enough for my dreams today,” revealing that the lighting under the arena’s closed roof had made it difficult to serve.
“There was no way of adjusting, because I could not see the ball when I was serving, and that was a huge shock to my system,” she said.
 


Tiebreak streak
Sabalenka clinched victory after once again demonstrating her incredible prowess in tiebreaks — winning her 19th consecutive breaker 7/3 to clinch in one hour and 34 minutes.
Anisimova, meanwhile, was left ruing her inability to make the most of break points at key moments, in sharp contrast to Sabalenka who converted five of her six break point chances.
That imbalance was on display early in the first set, when Anisimova failed to convert three break-point openings as Sabalenka took a 2-0 lead.

Yet Anisimova hit back in the third game, lasering a backhand winner into the corner to earn a break point before unfurling a rasping forehand winner to break back before holding for 2-2.
With the momentum behind her and her groundstrokes forcing Sabalenka around the court, Anisimova then broke again for a 3-2 lead.
But that was the catalyst for Sabalenka to raise her game and she broke to love before holding to edge back in front.
Anisimova’s faltering serve again betrayed her in the eighth game, the eighth seed double-faulting twice in quick succession to hand Sabalenka two break points at 15-40.
Sabalenka needed no further encouragement and she duly converted before holding to take the first set.
Sabalenka punished another wayward service game from Anisimova early in the second set and looked in complete control at 3-1.
Yet Anisimova wasn’t quite finished, and she held confidently before breaking back to love to level it at 3-3.
The fightback was short-lived, however, and when Anisimova thumped a wide-open forehand long to gift Sabalenka a 15-40 lead, the Belarusian once again seized her chance for a break.

Sabalenka held for 5-3 and was soon serving for the match at 5-4. Yet she allowed Anisimova off the hook after ploughing a wide-open smash into the net.
Instead of giving her a match point, Anisimova had a break point, which she took to give her a lifeline.
But in the tiebreak, Sabalenka reasserted her control and she sprinted into a 6-1 lead before closing out victory.
Anisimova laments ‘lack of fight’
Anisimova felt she didn’t “fight hard enough” in her US Open final loss and admitted to suffering a recurrence of nerves in her second Grand Slam final.
The 24-year-old American, runner-up at Wimbledon in July, again fell short in her bid for a breakthrough major title.
Anisimova caused problems for Sabalenka with her powerful game, but could not maintain a consistent level against her more experienced Belarusian rival.
“Losing in two finals is great but it is also super hard. I didn’t fight hard enough for my dreams today,” said Anisimova.
 


“I didn’t win today, so of course I didn’t do enough. That’s just the reality, and I have to accept that.
“I feel like if I fought harder, then maybe I would have given myself more of a chance, but I feel like I was really kind of in the back seat today.
“I just felt like throughout the match I wasn’t playing my best tennis.”
After a traumatic 6-0, 6-0 loss to Iga Swiatek at Wimbledon, Anisimova said she was “frozen by nerves” at the All England Club.
 
 

It is an aspect of her game she is continually trying to prove as she challenges for the sport’s biggest prizes. “I feel like with finals I have a lot of nerves, and it’s something I’m trying to work on, but I just wish I played more aggressive,” said Anisimova.
“Of course, she (Sabalenka) was playing amazing. She was playing very aggressive and doing all the right things, so she made it very difficult for me today.”
Anisimova had her chances in the first set against Sabalenka after digging herself out of an early hole with two service breaks for a 3-2 lead. But Anisimova couldn’t consolidate that position, finding it difficult to pick up the ball with the roof closed on Arthur Ashe Stadium after a torrential downpour in the area. Sabalenka won the next four games to take the set.
“I haven’t played on the court during the day with the roof closed, and it was literally, like, white, and I couldn’t see the ball when I was serving,” said Anisimova.
“That was a huge shock to my system,” she added. “It was extremely frustrating for me.”
 


Anisimova was repeatedly playing catch-up in the second set and although she broke Sabalenka with the top seed serving for the match, Anisimova’s challenge fizzled out in the tiebreak.
“Making it to the final is obviously really special, but it would have been a dream come true to make it all the way,” said Anisimova. “I hope I can keep working really hard to give myself more opportunities to be in more and more finals.“</p><small>2025-09-07 04:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68bb037c2093d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939969/smokers-corner-the-water-wars' target='_blank'><strong>SMOKERS’ CORNER: THE WATER WARS</strong></a><br><p>’Hydro-politics’ or ‘water politics’ is nothing new. But thanks to climate change, hydro-politics between countries is witnessing a manifold increase in intensity. On the one hand, climate change is compounding the problem of water scarcity and, on the other, it is triggering heavier rainfalls and flooding.
Various countries share common sources of fresh water. For this, they sign water-sharing treaties. Recognition of these treaties involves the signatory nations and international organisations. There is no single global authority to enforce these agreements, though.
In a 2023 essay, the sustainability specialist Emmanuel Gutman-Gates wrote that the increasing frequency of water-related conflicts and the ‘weaponisation of water’ in specific instances suggest that water politics is a growing source of instability and conflict.
The water dispute over the Indus River, for example, is a major source of tension between India and Pakistan. In April this year, India “suspended” the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) that was signed in 1960 between the two countries. This has escalated the threat of serious confrontation between the two historically antagonistic neighbours. 

From the Indus to the Rio Grande, rivers are no longer just lifelines — they are now battlefronts. As climate change shrinks and floods waterways, nations are turning treaties into weapons and neighbours into rivals

In August, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled that the IWT does not allow for unilateral suspension. But India rejected the verdict. Pakistan’s army chief allegedly responded by claiming that it would take just 10 missiles for Pakistan to destroy any new dams built by India to disrupt the water supply to Pakistan.
 
 

River Indus is Pakistan’s largest river. It originates in Tibet and then goes through India before entering Pakistan. Climate change is disrupting the flow of the river, which is an important water source for both countries. Pakistan has often accused India of using its upstream position to threaten its water supply.
Nevertheless, in May this year, the former irrigation minister Mohsin Laghari wrote in The Nation, “The IWT treaty now risks obsolescence — designed for a bygone era, it is ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of climate change and geopolitical volatility.” The treaty needs to be reframed, but India’s recent act of suspending it has further compounded the issue.
Afghanistan has been facing a scarcity of water. The River Amu Darya is a vital source of water for Afghanistan and its northern neighbours, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The Taliban regime in Kabul is planning to make a canal, which is likely to lessen the flow of Amu into Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan by 15 percent. Both the countries are now negotiating with Kabul to resolve the issue peacefully.
The Kabul River, which flows into Pakistan from Afghanistan, sustains the lives of millions of people on both sides. There have been attempts by Afghanistan to build dams on this river, which Pakistan fears are likely to disrupt the supply of water to Pakistan. However, due to constant political turmoil and civil wars in Afghanistan, no such major dam has been built yet. Nevertheless, Pakistan is eager to sign a water treaty with Kabul sooner than later.
Water reserves in Iraq have hit their lowest levels in 80 years. This is straining Iraq’s relations with its upstream neighbours Iran and Turkey, who are blatantly restricting flows in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Iraq. According to the researcher Hayder Al-Shakeri, the Iraqi government has, however, failed to respond with professional water diplomacy. Corruption among Iraq’s political elite has weakened institutional capacity. This creates openings for Turkey and Iran to press for deals that serve their own priorities.
 


Another long-running hydro-political flashpoint has been over the Jordan River. The tension in this regard is mainly between Israel and Jordan. Both the countries signed a water treaty in 1994 to diplomatically resolve the issue, but climate change, wars in the region and an increase in the populations of Jordan and Israel are severely testing the treaty.
The River Rio Grande, which flows from the US to Mexico, has been rapidly dwindling due to climate change, overuse and outdated water management practices. It is a source of a decades-long dispute between the US and Mexico. Rio Grande is also one of the most endangered rivers in the world. Mexico has fallen behind on its commitments under the 1944 US-Mexico Water Treaty.
 
 

However, this year, the US and Mexico announced that they would ‘upgrade’ the treaty according to current needs and conditions. But experts believe the current framework is still inadequate to fully resolve the issue due to the river drying up at an alarming pace.
Water politics has also become a prominent part of the internal politics of various countries. This includes political and social issues surrounding the management, allocation and distribution of water resources within a country’s borders.
For example, water disputes between states/provinces in India are intensifying due to disagreements over the use, distribution and control of inter-state river waters. It is one of the tensest issues in Indian federalism today. India has just four per cent of the world’s freshwater supplies but holds a massive 18 per cent of the world’s total population.
Pakistan’s two major provinces, Punjab and Sindh, are constantly locking horns over the waters of River Indus. Climate change is intensifying this tussle, especially with monsoon patterns becoming unpredictable. Indus River flows are likely to decrease and the risk of both floods and droughts likely to increase. There is now greater awareness of climate change among most people, but it only receives obligatory lip-service from the governments and the state.
 
 

For example, political opponents are more invested in pulling each other’s legs for failing to control flash flooding in major urban areas. There has been no show of any serious intent by the state and politicians to address the impacts of climate change beyond attacking each other for being incompetent.
In south-eastern Australia, the vast river system and drainage basin, the Murray-Darling Basin, is a flashpoint for internal water politics involving states and farmers. A major government initiative — the Basin Plan — to resolve the issue has continued to be ineffective due to disputes between federal and state governments, with New South Wales and Victoria often reluctant to accept the plan.
In the US, long-running battles over shared water resources have intensified due to the impact of climate change, particularly involving the Colorado River and Rio Grande basins. In Ethiopia, serious water imbalances between regions have been a major issue in the country’s politics.
Environmental activists spent decades to finally make the term ‘climate change’ a frequent part of everyday vocabulary — even among its deniers. Yet, it remains a vague term for many because, despite experiencing its impacts more than ever, no one seems to know how to address it. This is not to suggest that there are no solutions. But most of these require dramatic changes in political policies and in established lifestyle practices, which can create social, economic and political disruptions.
But one wonders: what more can be more disruptive than melting glaciers, increasing droughts, frequent floods, unprecedented rainfalls, dying rivers and water disputes that can lead to outright wars between nations?

In fact, in Islamic tradition, akhlaq (morals, ethics) is a well-developed science, deriving lessons from the Quran and ahadith on how to deal with ethical situations across the spectrum of life.
Moreover, the Holy Prophet (PBUH), whose noble birth we celebrate today, is considered the perfect ethical exemplar, who taught us how to behave in family settings and in the workplace, during war and during peace, individually and socially, etc.
Amongst the biggest ethical evils, as per the Quran and the teachings of the Blessed Prophet, are arrogance and pride, which, unfortunately, are found in abundance in all settings. This can range from states practising arrogance, for example, when the powerful and unaccountable unleash death and destruction upon innocents, as Israel and the US are currently doing in Gaza. It can also include how we treat those with less power and money than us, for example domestic staff, street vendors etc.
 
 

The Quran is very clear on how arrogance is a reviled trait in the eyes of the Almighty. One of the archetypes of arrogance repeatedly mentioned in the Holy Book is pharaoh, whose haughty utterances and actions are thoroughly condemned. For example, in Surah Naziyat pharaoh, a mere mortal, boasts that “I am your lord, most high.” Elsewhere, in Surah Zukhruf, pharaoh wrongly claims that Egypt’s mighty Nile flows under his feet. Compare this to the clear warning in Surah Isra, where man is commanded not to walk on the earth arrogantly.
Authentic ahadith are equally critical of the arrogant. As per one hadith, it is stated that “there is a special section for the arr­ogant people in hell”. At another point it is stated that “the one who is arrogant will be degraded by Allah”, while yet another tradition warns that “the worst kind of pride is considering the creatures lowly”.

The Holy Prophet (PBUH) treated the weakest with dignity.

Throughout his blessed life, the Holy Prophet displayed disdain for arrogance, and preferred humility and simplicity to vanity and ostentation. In fact, apart from his insistence on tauheed (monotheism), the tribal aristocrats of Makkah took exception to the fact that he treated the weakest individuals in that society — slaves, women, children, orphans, those without strong tribal affiliation — with dignity and respect.
How could a ‘low-born’ slave be considered equal in the eyes of the Almighty to a ‘high-born’ merchant of Makkah belonging to a powerful tribe, they wondered. For them, this amounted to ‘blasphemy’. Sadly, these pre-Islamic prejudices, with roots in jahiliya, have survived, as even in our society caste, tribe and financial position can define an individual’s status in society, rather than the strength of their character.
 
 

In fact, these prejudices are not limited to tribal or rural parts of the country; such attitudes thrive even in the cities where wealth — gained by means fair or foul — is the marker of success and status. The poor are an afterthought, not worthy of human dignity. Islam strongly condemns such vile attitudes.
In the view of the Most High, the best among humanity are the “most righteous”, while in a hadith, those with the best character are equated with those with the best faith. In the divine hierarchy, money, family connections and other ephemeral affiliations have no value; only a person’s character counts. And nothing destroys character like arrogance.
The most knowledgeable individual to ever walk the earth — the Holy Prophet, described as the ‘City of knowledge’ in a hadith — was a picture of humility. Thr­toughout history, even apart from prophets, the people of knowledge have always been humble. When they reflect on the realities of the universe — the vastn­ess of the cosmos, the ancientness of time, the deeper mysteries of creation — they realise they know nothing, and prostrate before Allah Almighty, who “tau­ght man which he knew not”. When the people of knowledge express their total helplessness and humility before the Most High, on what basis do the arrogant walk haughtily on the land?
 
 

And when arrogance mixes with ignorance, the results are lethal. After all, as per a saying of Hazrat Ali, “ignorance is death for the living”. Unfortunately, in our society the arrogant and the ignorant — the ‘living dead’ in the light of this saying — appear to dominate, while the people of knowledge are brushed aside as weak and unworthy, or harassed for speaking the truth.
But we must remember that arrogance is a death sentence in this world and the next, as the fate of pharaoh and those of his ilk demonstrates. The only solution, as per the Quran and the Holy Prophet’s example, lies in humility and character-building, while giving dignity and respect to all, regardless of ‘social’ and monetary status.

Several factors contribute to this sobering reality including poor access to healthcare and inadequate resources. Which is why regular vaccine campaigns, undertaken to prevent the onset of many of the illnesses seen mostly in developing nations, are absolutely crucial in a country like ours. In this context, the planned addition of a new vaccine to the Expanded Programme on Immunisation is a welcome development.
 
 

The campaign for the phased rollout of the human papillomavirus vaccine to prevent cervical cancer is set to begin on Sept 15. In Sindh, the aim is to immunise 4.1m girls from nine to 14 years against the virus — although once incorporated fully in the EPI, the focus will shift to nine-year-olds and hopefully become part of a school-outreach programme. The campaign will be rolled out in Punjab, ICT and AJK at the same time; in KP in 2026; and in Balochistan and GB in 2027.
Without regular screening, cervical cancer can go undetected in females, especially as symptoms may be absent in the early stages. And in a country like Pakistan, where routine pelvic examinations are not actively recommended, negligence can cost lives.
 
 

Around 5,000 women in the country are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year; 60pc of them succumb to the disease. And these are only the numbers recorded. It is safe to assume that the actual number of cases for this cancer — the second most common one among women of child-bearing age — is far higher.
By including the vaccine in the EPI, then, it is hoped that awareness levels are heightened — perhaps, the mothers of the young girls that the HPV vaccine will target under the EPI will learn enough about the risks of cervical cancer to take precautionary steps themselves through inoculation or regular screening. It appears to be a goal worth pursuing.

According to a spokesperson for the housing department, development authorities, horticulture agencies, and Wasa agencies would provide resources for relief operations in the affected districts.
 
 

The notification said that development authorities and horticulture agencies would extend all possible support to the districts.
Uninterrupted supply of clean drinking water in flood relief camps would be ensured, while officers had been directed to remain present in the relief camps of the affected districts round-the-clock.
The spokesperson said that officers and employees of development authorities and horticulture agencies would work under Wasa’s disposal so that relief operation could be made faster and more effective.

According to the FIR, seven residents of Kamiraan village, along with 10 unknown persons, were breaking the temporary protective dyke around the village with heavy machinery and tractors at 7pm on September 4.
When the locals intervened, they beat them up, fired in the air and threatened to kill them. However, the men fled when a large police contingent arrived at the scene after being informed by the local residents.
 
 

It is pertinent to mention here that many temporary protective dykes built by locals at various places in the 160 kilometer-long Sutlej belt in Bahawalnagar have broken. Due to this, thousands of acres of land have been submerged and dozens of villages of Minchinabad, Bahawalnagar and Chishtian have been affected by the river and they have been cut-off from the cities.
On Thursday night, another large protective dyke near the bridge connecting Bahawalnagar and Sahiwal at Bhukan Pattan on Arifwala Road broke, not only flooding several settlements, but also raising concerns that Bahawalnagar will be cut off from other cities.

Youth drowns in floodwater

However, the locals were making every effort to repair the dyke. On the other hand, the district administration issued an alert to the relevant departments expressing fears of extremely high levels of flooding in the Sutlej and also appealed to the public to take precautionary measures.
Meanwhile, a teenager died by drowning in the floodwater in Chishtian on Friday.
Rescue officials said that deceased Shahzad (16) worked at the house of a landlord in the Sial settlement of Jhaiduan mouza. They said that the settlement was surrounded by floodwater on all sides, but most of the residents had not moved to safer places.
According to the officials, Shahzad slipped and drowned in the deep floodwater after leaving the house. He was later pulled out by the locals.
Rescue 1122 shifted the body to Chishtian THQ for legal formalities.

The subcommittee of the Senate House Committee headed by Senator Nasir Mehmood met on Friday. The participants stressed that there was no justification for further delay.
Senators Danesh Kumar, Hidayatullah Khan and Poonjo Bheel also attended the meeting.
The committee noted with concern that although the project was approved as far back as 2009 to meet the growing accommodation needs of parliamentarians, it has remained plagued by repeated delays.
 







CDA says work stalled several times due to lack of funds and political gatherings near site

CDA officials said work stalled several times due to lack of funds and political disruptions near the site. In 2015, the contractor demanded a steep cost escalation, leading to prolonged litigation. The committee was told that in 2025 a revised PC-I was approved at a cost of Rs7,170 million, and the contract was awarded to Mian Usman Umer & Company.
The committee observed that the prolonged delays have multiplied costs, adding with Rs3.5 billion already available, there was no justification for further inaction. Senator Mehmood directed CDA to immediately commence work and said timely completion is essential to avoid yet another cycle of cost escalations and litigation.
The committee further directed that the ministries of interior and planning must conduct site visits and submit progress reports to ensure consistent progress and transparency and accountability in the work. The committee will also visit the site.
On the matter of renovation of existing lodges, the committee expressed dissatisfaction over the deteriorated condition of the buildings despite claims of heavy expenditures.
 
 

The members said that thorough inspections will be carried out, and CDA was tasked to provide lodge-wise details of renovation costs, materials used, and justification for excessive spending.
The head of the committee remarked that accountability in the use of public money is non-negotiable and that disproportionate spending on a few lodges will not be tolerated.
The committee directed the chairman CDA to constitute an internal committee comprising well-reputed officers to conduct the initial investigations into the quality of the work and spending of amounts on each lodge during last two years.
The convener of the subcommittee pressed for transparency, demanding that CDA submit an internal inquiry report within 21 days.
The committee also raised the issue of poor cleanliness standards at Parliament Lodges. Members noted that janitorial staffers deputed for the task were not performing their duties effectively. Details of the janitorial contract, staff deployment and associated costs were sought.
The chairman CDA highlighted the additional financial burden on the civic agency due to the absorption of PWD employees after the department’s closure.
He requested supplementary funding to meet salary obligations.
The committee directed the ministries of finance and interior to resolve the matter on priority, stressing that institutional gaps should not hinder operational efficiency.

A spokesman for the FIA said in a statement one of the suspects was posted as Deputy Director at FGEHF. Other suspects are beneficiaries of funds obtained through corruption and fraud, said the spokesman.
According to the initial investigation, the suspects are involved in forgery and fraud by abusing their authority. They were involved in forgery and corruption in the supplementary award of built-up properties (BUPs) of sub-sectors of Mouza Thala Sayedan G-14.
The accused allegedly illegally showed private individuals as co-owners of 5 BUPs, along with the BUPs given to the original owners. Private individuals received funds based on false information.
 
 

The FIA said that the accused committed the forgery with the connivance of government officials.
The aforementioned fraud caused a loss of millions of rupees to the national treasury. The suspects have been arrested and an investigation has been launched against them, said the spokesman.
Meanwhile, FIA’s four sub-inspectors and an LDC involved in poor investigation and breach of discipline were dismissed from their jobs.
The dismissal of five officials came about during the “orderly room” conducted by director general FIA Rifat Mukhtar Raja. The FIA spokesman said that the DG FIA held a hearing on departmental actions against officials involved in malicious and poor investigation and breach of discipline in the orderly room.
The convicted officers were posted in Islamabad, Faisalabad and Lahore zones. The DG FIA said that there is no place for officials involved in negligence, carelessness and poor investigation in the institution. Disciplinary action will be ensured against officials involved in corruption, malpractice and negligence, the DG said.

Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique confirmed the incident to Dawn.com in Khar tehsil’s Kausar Cricket Ground and said the blast was carried out through an improvised explosive device.
“It appears to be a targeted attack,” he added.
Last Saturday, two people, including a police official, were wounded after terrorists attacked a police station in the district’s Laghari area of Lowi Mamund tehsil through a quadcopter.
Sources said police constable Mohammad Habib and civilian Najeeb Khan were injured in the attack, which also damaged a vehicle parked on the premises.
Israr Khan, a public relations officer of the district police, had told Dawn that the injured were immediately shifted to the district headquarters hospital in Khar.
He also said terrorists launched another attack on the police station through a quadcopter but it missed the target.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack. However, police officials blamed it on terrorists in light of Operation Sarbakaf launched by security forces against them a couple of weeks ago.</p><small>2025-09-06 19:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0622304116a30a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940210/five-drown-as-rescue-1122-boat-capsizes-in-multan-amid-flood-evacuation-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Five drown as Rescue 1122 boat capsizes in Multan amid flood evacuation: officials</strong></a><br><p>Five people drowned as a boat capsized in the Chenab River in the Jalalpur Pirwala area of Punjab’s Multan district on Saturday amid a flood evacuation, according to officials.
Multan Deputy Commissioner (DC) Wasim Hamid Sindhu and City Police Officer (CPO) Sadiq Ali Dogar later reached the site for an inspection and were briefed by officials present there.
“The causes of the boat accident are being carefully examined. Initially, five deaths, including children on board the boat, have been confirmed,” DC Sindhu was quoted as saying in a statement. A statement from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) also put the toll at five.
He ordered the rescue authorities to immediately intensify the search operation. “Rescue operations are being carried out to search for more people on board the boat,” Sindhu said.
Meanwhile, CPO Dogar said police teams were providing full support to Rescue 1122 and the initial reasons for the boat accident included the darkness and flooded routes.
The initial report from Rescue 1122 explained that the boat had hit a tree and capsized due to the strong water flow, along with the women and children on board not able to maintain their balance, while evacuating people from floodwaters in Jalalpur Pirwala.
It added that most of the women and children were aboard the boat and the depth of the water was 15 to 20 feet.
The report said personnel launched search and rescue operations and four bodies were retrieved, while the rest of the people were recovered. “Line searching and boat searching are being conducted at different places to search for one child,” it said.
A statement from the department said Rescue 1122 Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer expressed grief over the deaths and ordered the divisional emergency officer to immediately share the incident report.
Multan Commissioner Aamir Karim Khan also expressed grief over the deaths and extended his condolences to the families of the deceased.
Punjab PDMA Director General Irfan Kathia directed that the best medical assistance be provided to the injured.
“Evacuation of victims should be made safe in a flood situation. There should be no overloading in private boats or rescue boats,” he ordered.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz took notice of the incident and extended her condolences to the families of the victims.
 






Rescue 1122 said that it had rescued more than 9,000 people in flood operations from Multan alone, while over 350,000 people and above 300,000 animals had been evacuated in advance.</p><small>2025-09-06 18:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06230538e87ca66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940217/trump-back-in-sports-spotlight-at-us-open-final' target='_blank'><strong>Trump back in sports spotlight at US Open final</strong></a><br><p>Donald Trump will become the first sitting United States president to attend the US Open in a quarter-century on Sunday, as he joins the legions of fans in New York to catch a highly anticipated showdown between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.
Republican Trump has attended numerous sports events to meet with his supporters, but he may not receive the warmest welcome at the US Open in deeply Democratic New York City.
He was once a fixture of the tournament before taking office and in 2015 was booed by some tennis fans not long after launching his presidential campaign.
Ticketholders can expect extraordinary security measures at the sprawling Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre in Trump’s home borough, Queens, where the final tennis major of 2025 is on track for a fourth straight year of record-setting attendances.
While the pricey playground for tennis fanatics and designer-clad social media influencers regularly brings in an array of A-listers, the tournament has not seen a sitting US president since Bill Clinton attended in 2000.
Barack and Michelle Obama attended in 2023, six years after the Democratic president left office.
Second seed Alcaraz said he would try not to think about Trump in the crowd as he bids for his sixth Grand Slam title.
“I don’t want myself to be nervous because of it,” the Spaniard told reporters on Friday after defeating 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals.
“But I think, you know, attending the tennis match, it’s great for tennis to have the president at the final.”
Megawatt spotlight
Trump is far from the first US president to step into the megawatt spotlight of professional sports.
Barack appeared on ESPN to fill out his “March Madness” bracket while in office and George W Bush famously threw out the first pitch at Shea Stadium in 2001, when the Mets took on the Atlanta Braves for the city’s first major sporting event after the September 11 attacks.
But few have embraced sports’ biggest events with the same gusto as Trump, particularly in his second term.
Trump grabbed headlines when he became the first sitting US president to attend the Super Bowl in February, stepping into the media glare of America’s most-watched annual event.
The fans at New Orleans’ Superdome greeted him with a mix of cheers and boos, and he met briefly in the stadium with families of the victims of the New Year’s Day attack on Bourbon Street as well as police officers and emergency workers.
Months later, Trump announced from the White House that Washington, DC, would host the 2027 NFL Draft, an annual mega-event that regularly attracts hundreds of thousands of fans.
He attended FIFA’s Club World Cup final in July, where he sat in box seats at MetLife Stadium with FIFA boss Gianni Infantino and remained on the stage during the trophy lift with winners Chelsea, to the confusion of some of the players.
Days after Alcaraz and top seed Sinner play, Trump is expected to attend the New York Yankees game against the Detroit Tigers on the 24th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.
Later this month, he is expected to attend the Ryder Cup, the biennial international golf competition, on Long Island.
At the US Open, Trump will attend as a “client guest”, organisers said, and will watch from that guest’s respective suite at the famed Arthur Ashe Stadium.
“It is a privilege for the tournaments having the president from every country just to support the tournament, to support tennis and to support the match,” Alcaraz said.</p><small>2025-09-06 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/061057276f80490.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940142/civil-military-leadership-pay-tributes-to-soldiers-and-martyrs-as-nation-observes-60th-defence-day' target='_blank'><strong>Civil, military leadership pay tributes to soldiers and martyrs as nation observes 60th Defence Day</strong></a><br><p>The country’s top military brass, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari have paid glowing tributes to soldiers and martyrs from the armed forces as the nation observes the 60th Defence Day today.
The Defence Day is observed every year on September 6 to commemorate the legacy of the 1965 War, “when the Indian forces crossed international border in the darkness of night to attack Pakistan but the nation foiled [the] nefarious designs of the enemy,” a report by the state broadcaster Radio Pakistan recalled.
The report said the commemoration began with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and 21-gun salute in provincial capitals.
“Special prayers were offered in mosques for the progress and prosperity of the country, and independence of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir from the clutches of India,” it added.
Karachi marked Defence Day with a changing of the guard at Quaid-i-Azam’s mausoleum, performed by a contingent from the Pakistan Air Force.
DawnNewsTV broadcast images showing personnel marching, performing elaborate display drills, singing the national anthem and hoisting the flag at the Karachi landmark.
Air Vice Marshal Shehryar Khan also attended the ceremony.

In his address broadcast on DawnNewsTV, he said: “The people and protectors of Pakistan, whether they are on the battlefield, the frontiers or in the streets of our cities, are always prepared.
“The recent operation Bunyanum Marsoos brought back the memory of September 6, 1965. It proved that if our armed forces and brave people stand together, then no power can defeat us
“… Any act of aggression against Pakistan will be met with a befitting response. The score will not be 6-0, but, with the help of God, 60-0,” he added.
 


During a brief military confrontation with India in May, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians. In retaliation, the Pakistan Air Force downed six Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7.
In Lahore, a changing of the guard ceremony took place at Mazar-i-Iqbal, with Lahore Corps Commander Lieutenant General Fayyaz Hussain Shah attending as the chief guest, according to state broadcaster PTV News.
“The corps commander visited Iqbal’s mausoleum, where he laid a wreath of flowers and recited the fatiha,” the report read.
PTV News added that the occasion was commemorated with a 21-gun salute, as well as a gun salute by a contingent from the Pakistan Army.
‘Courage of fearless heroes continues to inspire future generations’
A statement issued by the military’s media affairs wing in relevance to the day said that on behalf of the armed forces, Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Chief Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu paid tributes and “offered their deepest respect to the valiant martyrs and their families on the 60th Defence and Martyrs’ Day”.
“September 6, 1965, epitomises the unflinching resolve and unshakeable spirit of the Pakistani nation. On this historic day, our brave soldiers, with the support of nation, stood like an insurmountable wall against blatant aggression, thwarting the nefarious designs of an enemy far superior in arms and numbers.
“The feats of heroic valour and sacrifice left an indelible message on the sands of time, that a united nation can never be defeated,” it added.
The statement further stated that the “courage of our fearless heroes continues to inspire future generations and their legacy shall live on forever”.

“Today, the nation honours and salutes its martyrs, its ghazis and their resilient families who have offered unparalleled sacrifices for the security of this great country,” it said.
Recalling that the armed forces had stood resolutely against external aggression and terrorism and “have always supported the people of Pakistan in calamities and natural disasters”, it expressed their resolve to extend all-out support to people affected by the recent floods.
Referring to the calamity, it said the Defence Day would be observed with “utmost humility”.
The statement further read: “Today, we reaffirm our pledge to uphold the sacred responsibility entrusted to us by the nation. Pakistan’s armed forces remain ever vigilant and prepared to defend the country against all kinds of threats. Any attempt to disrupt our hard-earned peace will be met with a befitting and decisive response.”
Messages from political leadership
In separate messages ahead of Sept 6, PM Shehbaz and President Zardari reaffirmed the nation’s commitment to safeguarding its sovereignty, countering external threats, and building a united, prosperous future.
They also recalled the 1965 War with India, noting that Pakistan’s valiant armed forces, with the full support of the people, had thwarted enemy aggression, proving that the country possesses the will and capacity to defend its independence and integrity.
Highlighting the recent Oper­ation Bunyanum Marsoos, Marka-i-Haq, PM Shehbaz lauded the Pakistan Army, Navy, and Air Force for their unmatched professionalism and combat skills under the strategic leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to peace and constructive international engagement but war­ned against ignoring the reality of continuous Indian provocations and shifting regional dynamics.
Expressing solidarity with the oppressed people of occupied Kashmir, the prime minister reiterated unwavering support for their struggle for self-determination, stressing that it cannot be suppressed by force.
He also strongly condemned ongoing Israeli aggression in Palestine and urged the international community to ensure the protection of civilians and uninterrupted humanitarian aid to Gaza.
In a separate message posted on X today, the premier said Pakistan’s policy of peaceful coexistence and constructive engagement with the world, as well as the nation’s commitment to strengthening and modernising defence capabilities.
He asserted that Pakistan remained committed to the policy of peaceful coexistence and constructive engagement with the world.
“Yet, we cannot be oblivious to the reality of persistent Indian provocations and the changing regional environment. We shall continue to strengthen and modernise our defence capabilities, while also confronting the twin menace of state-sponsored terrorism and foreign proxies operating within our borders,” he added.
 






Earlier, President Zardari, in his message, paid tribute to the valiant sacrifices of the nation’s armed forces and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to its defence and sovereignty.
He described September 6 as a glorious chapter in the country’s history and emphasised that the spirit of sacrifice from the 1965 War continued to serve as a guiding light for future generations.
The president highlighted the significance of this year’s Defence Day in light of the recent Operation Bunyanum Marsoos conducted in May 2025 against India.
“Just as our courageous forces demonstrated extraordinary valour and dedication in 1965, our sons once again proved their unmatched bravery during this year’s operation,” he said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that Sept 6 was a “historic day of courage and bravery, when the martyrs, the veterans and the nation together made Pakistan invincible”.
Naqvi said that from Kasur to Lahore and from Sialkot to Kashmir, the Pakistan Army had given a “befitting response to the enemy at every front with unmatched courage and unwavering resolve”.
He underscored that Sept 6 was the renewal of the pledge that the country’s sanctity would never be compromised.
 






In his message today, PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari posted on X that on Defence Day, “we honour our martyrs, their families, our ghazis, and the resilient people of Pakistan whose sacrifices shaped our destiny.”
He added, “Our people have stood the test of time, weathering aggression, terrorism, and calamities with courage and integrity. This legacy of sacrifice and resilience continues to guide our unity and confidence in Pakistan’s future.”

According to Suparco, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are completely safe to observe with the naked eye, binoculars or telescopes.
In a press release on Saturday, the space agency said that the eclipse will be visible in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe, with clear visibility expected in most regions of Pakistan if the weather permits.
“The event will start at 8:30pm and reach its maximum at 11:57pm,” the press release read, stating that the eclipse will conclude at 1:55am.
“This is a great chance for people, especially students and astronomy enthusiasts, to connect with science and explore the wonders of our universe,” a Suparco spokesperson was quoted as saying.
Sunday’s eclipse is also known as a “blood moon”, due to its red hue during the event. When the Sun, Earth and Moon line up, the shadow cast by the planet on its satellite makes it appear an eerie, deep red colour that has astounded humans for millennia.
The Moon appears red during lunar eclipses because the only sunlight reaching it is “reflected and scattered through the Earth’s atmosphere”, said Ryan Milligan, an astrophysicist at Northern Ireland’s Queen’s University Belfast.
The last total lunar eclipse was in March this year, while the one before that was in 2022. A rare total solar eclipse, when the Moon blocks out the light from the Sun, will be visible in a sliver of Europe on August 12, 2026.</p><small>2025-09-06 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07074456786e365.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940014/bise-sets-new-dates-for-matric-exams' target='_blank'><strong>BISE sets new dates for matric exams</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: The Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Rawalpindi on Friday announced new dates for the Matriculation Second Annual Examinations 2025, which were earlier scheduled to start from September 10, will now be held from September 29.
According to BISE spokesman Arslan Cheema, this decision has been taken in view of the flood in many parts of the province and the difficulties faced by students and parents due to the recent flood situation and continuous rains in different parts of Punjab.
He said that the aim of postponing the examinations for about three weeks is to provide better facilities and a conducive environment for the students. 
RBISE Chairman Adnan Khan said that the examinations have been rescheduled, giving top priority to the convenience of the students. The new date sheet will be released in a few days. 
He further explained that the change in the dates will not affect the results of the Matriculation Second Annual and Intermediate Part-II.
