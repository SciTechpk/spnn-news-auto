The first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered on the complaint of Aroob Jatoi, the wife of YouTuber Saadur Rehman alias Ducky Bhai, who has been arrested in a case pertaining to promoting gambling apps on social media.
A total of nine NCCIA officers have been nominated in the FIR, including  Additional Director Sarfraz, Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmad, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Lahore NCCIA Sub-Inspector Yasir Ramzan and Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Mujtaba Zafar, who were said to be missing until the FIA announced their arrest yesterday on charges of misuse of authority and bribery.
Muhammad Usman, the NCCIA deputy director operations in Islamabad, who too has been missing for several days, is also among those nominated in the FIR, which was registered yesterday at 7.35pm.
Others nominated in the case include Islamabad NCCIA Deputy Director Ayaz Khan and Salman Aziz.
The FIR has been registered under Sections 109 (punishment for abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 161 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect to an official act) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 5(2)47 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which deals with criminal misconduct by public servants.
It stated that the NCCIA had arrested Rehman alias Ducky Bhai and the inquiry of his case was assigned to Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz.
The FIR said it was found during the inquiry that Riaz “misused his authority” to
“extort Rs9m” through his frontmen from Rehman’s family. It was further alleged in the FIR that Riaz also colluded with Rehman’s lawyer, Chaudhry Usman, for this purpose.
According to the FIR, Riaz extorted Rs6m on the pretext of “providing relief to Aroob Jatoi” and another Rs3m for Rehman judicial remand, who had been on physical remand.
In August 2025, Riaz extorted Rs6m in cash through his frontman, Salman Aziz, in Sheikhapura, while the remaining Rs3m was obtained via three cheques of Rs1m each through another frontman identified as Shehbaz, the FIR alleged.
It added Riaz Rs5m to a friend of Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmed’s for safekeeping while Rs500,000 was given to Salman Aziz, lawyer Chaudhry Usman and Additional Director Sarfaraz each.
Riaz himself kept Rs2m, the FIR said, adding that it was also found during the inquiry that he had transferred $326,420 from Rehman’s account to his own via Binance.
“During the inquiry, the suspects were found guilty of deceiving detained Saadur Rehman’s family about providing him relief and misusing their authority,” the FIR stated. “It was also found during the inquiry that the suspects were operating as a network and misusing their authorities, taking bribes in cash monthly for facilitating call centres, aggregate companies and individuals involved in online fraud. After keeping their shares, they would give the rest of the amount to the higher-ups.”
Officers at the NCCIA headquarters were sent these amounts via  Muhammad Usman, the NCCIA deputy director operations in Islamabad, and Islamabad NCCIA Deputy Director Ayaz Khan, according to the FIR. Sarfaraz and Zawar in Lahore would hand over Rs 1m to the two officials in Islamabad almost every month, and the latter would then transfer it to the higher-ups, the FIR said.
It added that FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore Assistant Director Syed Zainul Abideen had been assigned the investigation of the case.
6 NCCIA officials presented in court
Separately, the six NCCIA officials arrested by the FIA were presented before a district court in Lahore today. They were brought to the court in handcuffs.
At the hearing, the FIA sought their physical remand from Judicial Magistrate Naeem Wattoo.
“The suspects have to be interrogated for recovery,” the FIA’s lawyer contended.
For his part, the officials’ lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq said details should be shared about the number of FIRs registered against the suspects.
At that, the FIA informed the court that the officials were nominated in just one FIR.
Earlier today, another lawyer representing the six NCCIA officials, Barrister Mian Ali Ashfaq, had submitted an application to the judicial magistrate, seeking his clients’ production before the court.
The application, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, stated that the officials had been formally arrested by the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore.
“Since their arrest, neither the family nor the legal counsels are allowed to meet with the suspects; so much so, FIA officials have also refused to issue [a] copy of [the] first information report (FIR) in which the aforementioned suspects’ arrest has been caused, which is a glaring violation of all the settled norms and principles of fair investigation and fair trial as guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and also the violation of Police Rules, 1934 and Police Order, 2002; as well as different standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the department,” the application read.
It highlighted that the relevant investigating officer or investigation agency was bound to produce arrested individuals before the competent court within the first 24 hours of detention.
“However, in a design, and manner, the suspects are arrested, kept and not being allowed to meet with family members as well as their legal counsels, it is seriously apprehended that the suspects may not be produced before this honorable court which equates to illegal confinement for a longer period and such action on part of [the] investigation officer is a sheer violation of Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 and Articles 10 and 10A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as well as Police Rules, 1934 and Police Order, 2002.
“That the above highlighted unlawful actions, on part of the police, are not only violative of Articles 4, 9, 10, 10A, 13 and 14 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 with respect to right of individuals to be dealt in accordance with law etc., security/ liberty of person, safeguards [against] arrest and detention, right to fair trial, protection against self-incrimination and inviolability of dignity of man etc., but also very inhuman as being against the basic human rights,” the application stated.
It added that courts were the “guardian[s] of liberty of citizens and the abuse of power to rope innocent people in order to humiliate them should equally be kept under scrutiny and such unlawful actions should be curbed”. The application further mentioned that the right of liberty was one of the “most precious rights”, which had been guarded by the Constitution and courts.
In the application, the lawyer sought the court’s directives for the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore deputy director and the FIA director for Lahore to produce the NCCIA officers before it at the earliest in the “supreme interest of justice, equity and fairplay”.
Controversies and transfer
Among the six NCCIA arrested officers, Additional Director Sarfraz was reportedly removed over different controversies last month and asked to report to the NCCIA headquarters, Islamabad. He said he was transferred to the headquarters and he had sought a six-month leave.
The three controversies were about laying hands on a number of YouTubers/social media influencers, including Saadur Rehman, popularly known as Ducky Bhai and Rajab Butt, for their alleged involvement in unregulated online trading and online gambling apps.
The other was the registration of a case against some lawyers who allegedly tried to get a suspect released from the NCCIA. The third controversy related to a tiff between a group of Lahore’s journalists and a serving deputy inspector general of police and some other police officials, as the former moved the NCCIA to act against the latter. According to an official, Chaudhry was transferred in light of different complaints against him.
When approached for comment earlier, an NCCIA spokesperson had previously declined to comment on the missing officers, terming it a “serious matter”.
However, sources had told Dawn that the officers’ disappearance was linked to their investigations into social media influencers and their financial crimes.
Separately, on Friday, the Islamabad High Court had granted the police one more week to trace missing NCCIA Deputy Director Muhammad Usman, who has been missing for several days. The development came during the hearing of a petition filed by Rozina Usman for the recovery of her husband. She alleged that four armed individuals abducted her husband on October 14.
The court was also informed that the petitioner had herself gone missing after initiating the case. The development had prompted the court to seek an updated report from the police on both disappearances.</p><small>2025-10-28 09:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28133708e0e4845.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951761/wb-projects-economic-growth-in-pakistan-to-remain-at-3pc-in-fy-2026-due-to-flood-impact' target='_blank'><strong>WB projects economic growth in Pakistan to remain at 3pc in FY 2026 due to flood impact</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s economy has expanded by three per cent in fiscal year 2025 (FY25), the World Bank said in a report on Tuesday, but cautioned that growth is likely to remain the same in the next fiscal year due to the impacts of the recent floods.
In the report, titled —  Staying the Course for Growth and Jobs — the WB said that the country’s economy “expanded by three per cent in the fiscal year ending June 2025, up from 2.6pc in the previous year.”
Citing the reasons behind the expansion, the WB stated that, “Fiscal tightening and appropriate monetary policy helped anchor inflation and support current account and primary fiscal surpluses amidst a challenging global and domestic environment.”
“Improved confidence supported industry and service sector growth, even as agriculture growth underperformed, in part due to adverse weather and pest infestations,” it added.
However, it cautioned that while the outlook remained favourable, it also “has been tempered by recent floods, which have resulted in significant impact on people and damage to urban areas and agricultural land.”
“Pakistan’s recent floods have imposed significant human costs and economic losses, dampening growth prospects, and adding pressure on macroeconomic stability,” the World Bank Country Director for Pakistan, Bolormaa Amgaabazar, was quoted as saying in the release.

Quid Pro Quo Plus is a military doctrine that entails a retaliatory response to Indian aggression exceeding the initial provocation in scale or severity.
“Pakistan would continue to uphold its policy of ‘Quid Pro Quo Plus,’ thereby reinforcing strategic stability in South Asia,” Gen Jamil said while addressing the concluding session of a three-day workshop hosted by the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS) in Islamabad.
“Pakistan,” he added, “stands fully prepared to respond to any act of aggression, strategic, operational, or tactical, with resolve and capability, ensuring the preservation of deterrence equilibrium in the region.”
The statement follows an ongoing tense period this month, which revived brinkmanship last seen during India’s “Operation Sindoor” airstrikes in May.
It also comes as Indian armed forces prepare for Exercise Trishul, a major drill from Oct. 30 to Nov 10 near the disputed Sir Creek region, with Indian officials warning of “overwhelming retaliation” against any cross-border terrorism. Jamil cautioned that global power politics were upsetting the regional balance of power. “Great power politics has facilitated a discriminatory transfer of advanced and emerging technologies to India, thereby undermining the strategic balance in South Asia,” he said.
“Such preferential access is reshaping the regional security paradigm and transforming the nature and character of warfare across the region.”
He said this international support has emboldened India’s actions.
“Emboldened by these external enablers and strategic partnerships, India has increasingly exhibited adventurist tendencies, particularly evident in the post-Pahalgam incident,” he noted.
Referring to a May confrontation between the two countries following the Pahalgam incident, Jamil said the episode “effectively challenged India’s misplaced notions of escalation dominance and escalation control”.
Pakistan, he said, “once again demonstrated restraint and responsibility, reaffirming the credibility and maturity of its nuclear deterrence posture”.
Jamil warned that India’s “Hindutva-driven nationalism” poses a “grave challenge to regional peace and strategic stability,” which he said reflects “the ideological and strategic imprint of Chanakya’s Mandala Theory” of power politics and regional dominance.
“India’s increasingly offensive military doctrines, coupled with a culture of coercive behaviour, underscore both its intent and capability to project aggression in the region,” he cautioned.

The Democrats — shut out of power in the White House and both chambers of Congress — are seen negatively by 63 per cent of US voters, according to a July poll in the Wall Street Journal, the party’s lowest approval rating in 30 years.
John Kane, a professor of political science at New York University, said the party needs to reconnect with parts of their traditional base, such as lower-income Americans and young voters.
Mamdani, a 34-year-old self-described democratic socialist, has developed a plan aimed at luring working-class people and young adults, for whom famously expensive New York is becoming harder and harder to call home.
His platform’s highlights include a freeze on rent hikes as well as free bus service and day care.
Mamdani’s virulent opposition to President Donald Trump has a strong symbolic appeal for a Democratic base, “which feels almost entirely powerless in the present moment,” Kane told AFP.
He has a more than 10-point lead over his main rival in the November 4 election for mayor, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, a scandal-tainted veteran Democrat who is running as an independent this time.

Still has some juice
“Mamdani is evidence that the American left still has some juice in it in 2025,” said Daniel Schlozman, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University.
But New York — America’s biggest city, and an ethnically diverse and historically Democratic — one does not reflect the United States overall, Schlozman said.
And while enthusiasm over Mamdani is one thing, his success is “a very different matter from Democrats at large winning the elections they need to win to take control of the House next year, maybe the Senate, and the presidency in 2028,” he added.
 
 

Schlozman said Mamdani is a compelling leader who understands that issues of affordability in New York are critical, but cautioned that the national electorate is probably not ready for his policies.
Democrats would need to address affordability in a very different way from him to satisfy voters even in other Democratic-leaning states, much less swing states that can go either way, he continued.
Kane also said that outside large cities, where people are used to seeing all kinds of nationalities and heritages, Mamdani’s origin and religion and his past statements calling the police “racist” might fail to win over some voters.
The candidate was born in Uganda to a Muslim family of Indian origin and became a US citizen in 2018.

Right message, wrong messenger
Then there is also the risk of Republicans seizing on Mamdani to ridicule Democratic policies, just as Trump has dismissed him as a “little communist” who is too willing to spend taxpayer money.
Many in the party “might regard Mamdani as a case of right message, wrong messenger,” said Kane in reference to Mamdani’s policies.
Most moderates in the Democratic Party, such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — who is from New York — have abstained from endorsing Mamdani so far.
“Some moderate Democrats may shy away from Mamdani based on policy stances, while others shy away simply because they don’t view him as an electable candidate at the national level,” said Kane.
Indeed, political experts say that New York differs enough from the rest of the United States that it is not necessarily the best place for a Democrat to launch a national campaign.
In any case, Mamdani could only go so high in US politics — since he was not born in the United States, he cannot run for president.</p><small>2025-10-28 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28114454dfce954.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951753/pakistan-cruise-into-volleyball-finals-after-thrashing-indonesia-at-asian-youth-games' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan cruise into volleyball finals after thrashing Indonesia at Asian Youth Games</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan are guaranteed another medal at the Asian Youth Games after the boys volleyball team thrashed Indonesia 3-1 to cruise to the finals.

Those who commanded its flow commanded destinies, shaping empires, hierarchies, and enduring inequalities. Across centuries and continents, this elemental force has mirrored control and exclusion in equal measure.
In Pakistan, cradled by the mighty Indus (one of the world’s great river systems), the politics of water runs deep, revealing how history, bureaucracy, gender, and infrastructure intertwine in a struggle for authority.
The hydraulic mission
To understand Pakistan’s water politics, one must return to what scholars call the hydraulic mission — a 19th-century global project of control. From British India to Egypt and the American West, colonial and postcolonial states sought to dominate nature through massive dams and sprawling irrigation works. These were not merely feats of engineering; they were declarations of power. The state’s authority quite literally flowed through its canals and concrete.
In Pakistan, this legacy endures. The Tarbela and Mangla dams, the vast Indus Basin irrigation network, and the formidable bureaucracies that govern them are all products of the same hydraulic ambition. The engineers of these systems became symbols of state authority. Their institutions, known as hydrocracies, remain among the most entrenched and powerful bureaucratic structures in the country.
But this infrastructure-led model has a dark underside. As researcher François Molle and his colleagues argue, the “hydraulic mission” often treated infrastructure as an end in itself — legitimising governments while concealing inefficiencies, corruption, and rent-seeking. Pakistan’s irrigation departments, still operating in the colonial mould, epitomise this: sprawling, opaque, and resistant to reform. This has resulted in both institutional weaknesses and deep vulnerabilities.
The 2025 floods, triggered by heavy monsoon rains and glacial lake outbursts since June, starkly exposed these flaws, overwhelming outdated dams and canals, causing over 1,000 deaths, and destroying thousands of homes, mostly belonging to impoverished communities. Moreover, elite-driven decisions such as constructing the Expressway near Jalalpur Pirwala have worsened flooding in southern Punjab, diverting water destructively into already vulnerable settlements.
Water and power: A colonial legacy that still governs
In Pakistan’s rural heartlands, water control is synonymous with political control. From Punjab to Sindh, powerful landlords have long dictated who receives canal water and who does not. They create unauthorised water outlets (or manage to get direct outlets approved that should be impossible), manipulate irrigation schedules, bypass rotation plans, and exploit their influence over irrigation officials to bend the system in their favour. What began as a centralised colonial bureaucracy has evolved into a network of local despots — a form of “decentralised despotism” where water serves as an instrument of patronage and dominance.
This structure reflects what historian Karl Wittfogel once called hydraulic despotism: centralised control over water, breeding political submission. Only now, in Pakistan’s case, that despotism operates through feudal influence and bureaucratic inertia rather than emperors and dynasties.
During the 2025 floods, these power dynamics deepened; influential landowners reportedly controlled the flow of aid and reconstruction resources, while small farmers and marginalised communities were left to shoulder the losses across more than 1.8 million acres of farmland. Established power dynamics continue to determine who receives state relief and rehabilitation — and when. Reconstruction and humanitarian assistance often bypass those most in need, favouring the well-connected instead.
Masculinities of water — The gendered politics of control
Yet, there is another current in this story: a quieter but equally powerful one. As feminist scholar Margreet Zwarteveen reminds us, irrigation and water management are not gender-neutral fields. They are overwhelmingly masculine domains: symbolically, structurally, and professionally. Across much of South Asia, the irrigation engineer has long been imagined as the heroic man mastering nature — a colonial archetype that continues to shape modern institutions.
In Pakistan, women remain largely invisible in water governance, even as they bear the brunt of its failures — fetching water, sustaining households, and working in fields. Their exclusion is not accidental; it is systemic. Engineering departments, decision-making boards, and policy forums remain male-dominated, reinforcing the notion that expertise and authority are inherently masculine. Even well-meaning “gender mainstreaming” initiatives struggle against this entrenched culture of exclusion.
Here, gender intersects sharply with power. The hydrocracy’s authority is not merely bureaucratic — it is patriarchal. The 2025 floods have laid bare this gendered burden: women and girls have faced heightened risks during evacuation and recovery, with limited access to safe sanitation, healthcare, and shelter. In camps across Lahore and south Punjab, as the Ravi River inundated newly built housing schemes in floodplains, women’s voices rose in protest and pain. Yet, the PDMA, revenue departments, and other authorities failed to meet even their most basic needs.
Infrastructure and the rise of new despotisms
As anthropologist Veronica Strang puts it, infrastructure is never merely physical. It is profoundly political. Dams, drains, pipelines, and canals shape social relations, determining who is connected, who is excluded, and who profits.
Today, a new form of despotism is emerging globally: the privatisation of water.
When public water systems are handed over to corporations, control shifts from bureaucrats to markets — from visible authority to unaccountable power. The British experiment of 1989, when water utilities were privatised, offers a telling example: profits soared while regulation weakened and public accountability evaporated. Similar trends are evident in Australia and Latin America, where water trading and corporate consolidation have turned rivers into commodities.
Pakistan stands on the brink of the same trap. Proposals to privatise water institutions and utilities have sparked protests, fuelled by fears that such reforms will deepen inequality and strip citizens of what should remain a shared right. In a system already marred by elite capture and bureaucratic masculinity, privatisation risks creating a new corporate despotism: one even less accountable to the public.
Critics argue that poorly planned road and motorway projects have obstructed natural waterways, intensifying the 2025 floods. These disasters have shown how floodplain encroachments and legally allotted lands involve the powerful’s grip over rivers, water channels, and floodplains, endangering the lives and livelihoods of the poor and lower middle class.
Bureaucracy, gender, and governance
The nexus of water, power, and governance in Pakistan is the product of layered histories. Colonial legacies built the hydraulic bureaucracy. Patriarchal norms cemented its masculine character. Political elites captured its flows for private gain. And now, market forces threaten to commodify whatever little remains of public ownership.
Pakistan’s water crisis, then, is not merely one of scarcity; it is one of equity. It is about who controls, who benefits, and who is silenced. The inequities between provinces, the rural-urban divide, the marginalisation of small farmers, and the invisibility of women all stem from the question of how water is governed and by whom.
The floods of 2025 have only deepened these fractures. As swollen rivers devastated communities and submerged farmlands, bureaucratic inertia and delayed relief compounded human suffering. Inter- and intra-provincial tensions over water management resurfaced, exposing the deep structural divides within the state. While mainstream media captured fragments of the misery, power and control continue to dictate what is revealed, and what is concealed, muting the full extent of the crisis.
A way forward — From control to care
To break this cycle, Pakistan must move beyond the old hydraulic mission — beyond the obsession with concrete, control, and command. The future of water governance must rest on inclusivity, transparency, and local participation. Women’s leadership in water management is a structural necessity. Bureaucratic reform, too, must aim to democratise decision-making, not merely decentralise it into the hands of new elites.
Equally, the march toward water privatisation must be resisted unless supported by strong regulation, equity safeguards, and public oversight. Water cannot be reduced to a commodity. It is a public trust, a shared right, and the foundation of life itself.
As Pakistan faces intensifying climate stress, from melting glaciers to erratic monsoons, its survival will depend on transforming its understanding of power. True resilience will not emerge from new dams or privatised pipelines, but from building a just and inclusive system where every drop serves the people.
Lessons from the 2025 floods, driven by climate-induced heavy rains and glacial outbursts, emphasise the urgency of this transformation. Yet the human toll continues to unfold: families displaced by the Chenab River’s waters still live in makeshift roadside camps, long after the Punjab government declared rescue and relief operations over. Many continue to commute by boat to their drowned villages — conditions largely overlooked by prevailing power dynamics.
The simple truth is that the politics of water is the politics of life. To control it is to shape society itself. The recurring floods are not just a symptom of climate change, but a mirror reflecting deeper structures of power and exclusion. If we look closer, the destruction and deaths unleashed by the 2025 floods reveal something far beyond climate impacts — they expose a crisis of governance, justice, and imagination.</p><small>2025-10-28 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28105728dbd9afa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951751/us-japan-leaders-ink-rare-earths-deal-ahead-of-trump-xi-meet-this-week' target='_blank'><strong>US, Japan leaders ink rare earths deal ahead of Trump-Xi meet this week</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi signed a framework agreement on Tuesday for securing the supply of rare earths, as both countries aim to reduce China’s dominance of some of the key electronic components.

No direct mention was made publicly by the leaders about China, which processes over 90 per cent of the world’s rare earths, making it the source of each country’s concern about its mineral supply chain. Beijing has recently expanded export curbs.
Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to meet on Thursday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in South Korea to discuss a deal that would pause steeper US tariffs and Chinese rare earths export controls.
Japan and the US would use economic policy tools and coordinated investment to speed up the “development of diversified, liquid, and fair markets for critical minerals and rare earths”, and aim to provide financial support to selected projects within the next six months, the White House said.
Both countries would consider a mutually complementary stockpiling arrangement and cooperate with other international partners to ensure supply chain security, it added in a statement.
While dominated by China, the US and Myanmar control 12pc and 8pc of global rare earth extraction, according to Eurasia Group, and Malaysia and Vietnam cover another 4pc and 1pc of processing, respectively.
US energy supplies
Japan has pledged a $550 billion investment into the US economy, part of the wider bilateral trade deal, which could include power generation and liquefied natural gas, among other areas, according to sources familiar with the talks.
Ahead of Trump’s Asia trip, the US called on Russian energy buyers, including Japan, to cease imports, and imposed sanctions on Moscow’s two biggest oil exporters — Rosneft and Lukoil — to push the Kremlin to the negotiation table to end the war in Ukraine.
Japan has stepped up US LNG purchases in the last few years as it tries to diversify away from its key supplier Australia and prepare for supply contract expirations from Russia’s Sakhalin-2 LNG project, which Mitsui and Mitsubishi helped to launch in 2009.
In June, Jera, Japan’s top LNG buyer, agreed to buy up to 5.5 million metric tons per annum of US LNG under 20-year contracts, with deliveries starting around 2030. This is roughly the same amount Japan imports annually from Sakhalin-2.
Most supply from Sakhalin-2, which covers 9pc of Japan’s gas needs, ends in 2028-2033. Japan buys less than 1pc of its oil imports from Russia under a sanctions waiver, with the bulk of its oil supply covered by the Middle East.
Last week alone, Japan’s biggest city gas supplier, Tokyo Gas, signed a preliminary deal to buy 1 million metric tons per annum of LNG from the Alaska LNG project, following a similar announcement from Jera in September.
Jera pledged $1.5 billion for gas assets in Louisiana in its first foray into upstream production in the US, where Tokyo Gas and Mitsui are already present.
To keep electricity prices in check, Japan wants to continue Sakhalin-2 LNG imports, a senior official has said, as it takes only a few days to deliver LNG to Japan compared to around a week from Alaska and roughly a month from the US Gulf Coast.
“The US said it wants Japan to stop importing Russian energy — but this is Japan’s closest LNG source and which is also cheap,” said Nobuo Tanaka, chief executive with Tanaka Global, Inc. advisory.
“I think the question should be framed this way: can the US provide Japan with LNG as cheap as what currently comes from Russia?

Some refiners are tapping the spot markets to meet their crude oil needs, said the sources, who did not want to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
State-run Indian Oil (IOCNS), has issued a tender for the purchase of oil, while conglomerate Reliance Industries (RELINS), has boosted purchases from spot markets, according to sources.
The European Union, the UK and the US have imposed a raft of sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine, including fresh US sanctions on Thursday that target Russia’s two top oil producers, Lukoil (LKOHMM), and Rosneft (ROSNMM).
Indian refiners are poised to sharply curtail imports of Russian oil to comply with the new US sanctions, Reuters reported on Thursday, potentially removing a major hurdle to a trade deal with the US.
Last week, Reliance, the top Indian buyer of Russian oil, said it will abide by the sanctions while maintaining its relationship with current oil suppliers. Reuters also reported that the firm plans to stop importing oil from Rosneft.
“We have not placed orders yet for fresh cargoes and have cancelled some that were booked from traders with links to the sanctioned entities,” said one of the sources.
“We need to ensure that our purchases are not linked to sanctioned entities as banks will not facilitate payments,” a third source said.
A separate source said his firm is waiting to see if it can get cargoes from non-sanctioned traders or entities.
India bought 1.9 million barrels per day in the first nine months of 2025, or 40 per cent of Russia’s total exports, according to the International Energy Agency.
India’s Russian oil imports between April and September fell 8.4pc on year due to narrower discounts and tighter supplies, with refiners seeking more oil from the Middle East and the US, according to trade sources and shipping data.</p><small>2025-10-28 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/28003839fc34a48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951555/pm-shehbaz-meets-saudi-crown-prince-ahead-of-future-investment-initiative-conference' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz meets Saudi crown prince ahead of Future Investment Initiative conference</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday ahead of the Ninth Edition of the Future Investment Initiative (FII9) in Riyadh.
The premier, visiting Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the crown prince, is leading a high-level Pakistani delegation during the trip.
The delegation includes Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and PM’s aides Tariq Fatemi and Bilal Bin Saqib, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
A statement issued on social media platform X by state broadcaster PTV News said the meeting with the Saudi crown prince was held in a “cordial atmosphere”.
“Matters of mutual interest were discussed in the meeting. The joint statement of the meeting regarding discussions on promoting trade, investment, and cooperation in various sectors between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia will be issued shortly,” the statement said, adding that the meeting was attended by FM Dar, COAS Munir and senior cabinet members from both sides.
 






Late on Monday, the premier said it was a “great pleasure and honour” to meet the Saudi crown prince.
“We reaffirmed the enduring strength of the Pakistan–Saudi Arabia brotherly bonds and discussed ways to further expand this historic and time-tested partnership in trade, investment, and economic cooperation,” he said.
He stated that he was grateful for the Saudi crown prince’s “personal commitment and resolute support in advancing our shared vision for deeper collaboration and prosperity for our two nations and peoples”.
 






PM Shehbaz earlier arrived at the King Khalid International Airport where he was received by Riyadh Deputy Governor Muhammad bin Abdulrahman bin Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to Pakistan Nawaf bin Saeed Al-Malki and Pakistan’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmad Farooq.
 






The prime minister left for Riyadh earlier today from Lahore.
 






The invitation for the conference, signed by the crown prince, was given to PM Shehbaz in August by Ambassador of the King­dom of Saudi Arabia Naw­af bin Said Al-Malky.
The FII9 will convene global leaders, investors, policymakers, and innovators to explore the theme, “The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth”. Thematic discussions will address global challenges and opportunities, focusing on key topics such as innovation, sustainability, economic inclusion, and geopolitical shifts.
The Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement yesterday that during his visit, the PM would engage with the Saudi leadership to explore avenues for enhanced cooperation in the trade, investment, energy, and human resource sectors.
“The discussions will also cover regional and global issues of mutual interest and concern,” it added.
On the sidelines of the summit, the PM will also interact with leaders from other participating countries and heads of international organisations.
The FO said these exchanges would highlight Pakistan’s investment potential and its readiness to pursue collaborations in sustainable development, in line with the “Think, Exchange, and Act” model.

They reportedly used the lawmaker’s Vigo, besides their own car, in their escape. The Vigo was, however, found abandoned away from the residence.
Initial information collected by police suggested that the outlaws drove into Dheran village, near Moro town of Naushahro Feroze district by a car, climbed the outer wall of Behan’s residence to jump into it and held all those present inside hostage.
They comfortably collected cash, jewellery and other valuables worth millions of rupees and boarded their car and the MNA’s 4x4 vehicle to escape to their hideout.
Police found the 4x4 vehicle abandoned near the Dars police station, a few kilometres away from the village.
The MNA was not present at his residence when the robbery took place, and there was no mention of any official or private security guards in the initial inquiry report.
Soon after the robbers’ escape, all officers and personnel of the police station concerned, along with a forensic team, IT and geo-fencing staff, footprint tracker unit, as well as some private footprint trackers, rushed to the MNA’s residence and started doing their respective jobs. They were personally supervised by Naushahro Feroze SSP Mir Rohal Khan Khoso.
In his immediate reaction, MNA Behan told journalists that it might have been a conspiracy involving some influential figures of the area.
The SSP expressed his confidence that the police investigators would reach the culprits very soon with the help of footprint trackers.
A formal FIR of the incident was yet to be registered.
National Peoples Party (NPP) Chairman and a senior Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) leaderGhulam Murtaza Jatoi — one of the main political rivals of MNA Behan — visited the shocked lawmaker to express his sympathies over the incident.

• Senator Zehri defends amendment, citing need for clarity in post-divorce child support cases
ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Religious Affairs has sought a review of certain clauses in the Muslim Family Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, particularly the provision stating that the father shall remain responsible for the child until the child attains adulthood.
The ministry made the observation during a detailed discussion on the bill — introduced by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri — at a meeting of the Senate Standing Commit­tee on Religious Affairs and Inter­faith Harmony.
The ministry pointed out that the proposed clause needed reconsideration, as under the existing laws, the father is already responsible in cases where the child is a minor or disabled.
Explaining the rationale behind the amendment, Senator Zehri said that in cases where a husband divo­rces his wife and the child is not fi­­n­ancially stable, there must be clear legal guidance on who will bear the child’s financial responsibility and where such a child would go.
After extensive deliberations, Senator Zehri requested the ministry to provide a detailed written response outlining the context and objections raised regarding the bill. The committee chairman directed that a separate meeting be convened to further examine the matter in consultation with all relevant stakeholders.
 
 

It was also noted that the Law Division had raised certain objections to the bill. Senator Zehri requested that copies of the relevant documents and objections be shared with her, on the basis of which the bill was being opposed.
The committee was also given a detailed briefing on the quota and tender awarding process under the government Haj scheme for 2026, as well as the procurement of goods and services for Haj operations. The ministry informed the meeting that the Procurement Commit­tee comprises seven members and that the process is currently underway. Once completed, all relevant details will be shared with the committee.
The chairman also inquired about the exclusion of a catering company from the tender process on the grounds of lack of experience.
The ministry clarified that such matters are reviewed by the Procurement Committee, which examines all relevant aspects before submitting the process to PEPRA for final evaluation and decision.
It was further informed that companies lacking prior experience are generally awarded smaller tenders initially to help them gain practical experience, as awarding large tenders directly to inexperienced firms may cause operational challenges.

The 1781 battle of Yorktown and the vicious stand-off between Chinese and Indian troops in Galwan in 2020 are thus linked to the state assembly elections currently underway in Bihar. This is the rare north Indian state where the Hindu right is struggling to take power on its own.
Other Hindi-belt states like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have seen BJP taking power on its own steam, but in Bihar it continues to lean on allies, that too playing second fiddle. This, even though the BJP won more seats than the chief minister Nitish Kumar’s party in the 2020 polls. There is lingering apprehension today that the BJP, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s watch, could do with Kumar what it did with allies in Maharashtra — pare them down by splitting their ranks and usurp direct power. Bihar though has been a different kettle of fish.
 
 

The state is among the most fractured regions in caste terms, far more intractable than other BJP-ruled states. In Uttar Pradesh, for example, the Bahujan Samaj Party of Dalits could take power with or without allies. Likewise, the Samajwadi Party of lower caste peasants was able to rule on its own. Unlike Uttar Pradesh where it runs its own government, the BJP has so far failed to gain power in Bihar by itself.
Two historical events have influenced the state’s hugely politicised and intellectually raw earthiness. This was the region after all where Buddha attained enlightenment 2,500 years ago. Buddhism spread from Bihar and marked the most entrenched and durable rebellion in history against Brahminical hegemony over much of ancient India. There was thus already something about Bihar — it derives its name from Buddhist vihars or monasteries — which spurred anti-caste revolt to spread via Buddhism and Jainism.

Bihar is the rare north Indian state where the Hindu right is struggling to take power on its own.

The other significant event in Bihar, which continues to stalk its fragmented social relations, was the land revenue arrangement installed by British governor-general Lord Cornwallis. The Permanent Settlement created a violent system of zamindars with hereditary rights. They extracted from the peasants all that could fill the coffers of the East India Company and enough for themselves to buy muscle power to ply the ruthless system.
Think about it. Had Cornwallis not been routed by George Washington in Yorktown, Bihar might have been spared the pain of his socially disruptive extortion. Who knows, perhaps Tipu Sultan would have carved a different role for India, not unlike what George Washington did for America, as an ally of the French and tormentor of British rule. Cornwallis vented his spleen at the French for supporting Tipu who he defeated in Srirangapatnam in 1792. The unabated exploitation of Dalits and tribespeople Cornwallis created in Bihar would erupt in political movements — now dressed as Naxalites or again as the middle caste-led advocate of ‘total revolution’.
Political earthiness apart, acid verse too abounds about elections in India. One such by Ashok Chakradhar describes a famished tiger that far from eating up a lamb and its mother, wishes them health and longevity, instead. The lines end tartly: “Itna keh kar sher kar gaya prasthaan. Bakri hairaan. Beta taajjub hai. Bhala ye sher kisi per rahem khanewala hai. Lagta hai jangal mein chunaav aane wala hai.” (The goat shared its bewilderment with the baby. Hungry tigers don’t usually bungle. It must be election time in the jungle.)
Likewise, the late Raahat Indori conflated military tensions on the border with elections. “Sarhad par bahot tanaav hai kya? Kuchh pata karo, chunaav hai kya?” (There’s tension on the borders, but why? Go find out if an election is nigh.) Cynicism apart, the state assembly polls underway in Bihar, the second most populous of the so-called Hindi-belt states, where the BJP derives much of its strength from, do have a military connection.
Two days after the horrific attack in Pahalgam on April 20, a livid Narendra Modi showed up at a public rally in Bihar, not at the site of the communal carnage in Kashmir as might be expected of him. From the rally in Bihar, Modi declared his fight to the finish against terrorism. Significantly, he made the most critical point about the prospects of war in English. Bihar was the platform not the audience. About 20 days later, Operation Sindoor was unleashed only to be quickly suspended with a tentative and, by many accounts, puzzling ceasefire. In Bihar’s election campaign though, the short sharp exchange with Pakistan appears to be offering little purchase in the two-stage Nov 6 and 11 elections for the 243 assembly seats.
Curiously, in the October 2020 Bihar elections too, the prime minister tried to stoke the memory of the killings of Indian soldiers by Chinese troops along the disputed Sino-Indian border at Galwan. At three brief halts in Sasaram, Gaya and Bhagalpur, Modi spoke of the clash with China, in which soldiers — notably of 16 Bihar regiment — had been killed. Modi accused the opposition of supporting those “conspiring” against India.
Bihar happens to be where L.K. Advani’s communally divisive 1990 ‘rath yatra’ to Ayodhya was brought to heel by Lalu Prasad Yadav, the state’s chief minister at the time. Yadav’s much-applauded courage, however, triggered the fall of the BJP-supported V.P. Singh government. The BJP gained traction from the event. By December 1992, the Babri Masjid was destroyed in the presence of Advani. By 1996, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the BJP’s first prime minister. Bihar’s chief minister Nitish Kumar crucially supports Modi as he did Vajpayee. Should he flap his wings post elections, it might usher a tornado in Delhi. Rahul Gandhi is watching.

• Retired Gen Ehsanul Haq says Zaeef insisted on remaining in Islamabad, despite warnings from Pakistani officials
ISLAMABAD: Over 20 years after his now-infamous handover to American forces following their invasion of Afghan­istan, a former Pakistani spymaster has claimed that it was his own countrymen, and not Pakistan, that handed over former Taliban ambassador Abdus Salam Zaeef to the US.
The claim, which comes in the midst of an escalating fracas with a resurgent Taliban in Kabul, was made by retired Gen Ehsanul Haq, who took over the reins of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) following the September 11, 2001 attacks.
For years, it was believed that Zaeef — who was the Afghan Taliban regime’s envoy to Islam­abad at the time of the 9/11 atta­cks — was handed over to the Americans in violation of international law.
In his book, My Life With The Taliban, the former envoy had asserted that he was given into US custody in Peshawar, and this account has never been publicly challenged by any Pakistani official.
However, when asked about Zaeef’s claims during a recent seminar, the former four-star general recounted how the previous Taliban regime came to be ‘de-recognised’, and how Pakistani officials tried for months to convince the envoy to leave Islamabad to avoid the situation he later faced.
Zaeef spent just under four years as a captive in the infamous US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, and was eventually released in 2005.
 
 

When approached for comment, Zaeef said he rejected the former general’s statement.
In his remarks at a recent seminar on Pakistan and Afgha­n­istan relations — organised by the Khyber Margalla Founda­tion, an Islamabad-based organisation of government servants, retired officials and professionals from Khyber Pakht­unkhwa — Gen Haq recalled that Zaeef was told that he should leave Islamabad. If he did not accept, he would be taken to Torkham and deported, the former general said.
“When he was being flown in a helicopter, our people again told him that if you agree, we will drop you somewhere else rather than taking you to the border for deportation.”
“Ultimately, he was taken to the Torkham border and asked to cross over. No one in Pakistan handed him over to the US. When he crossed… Afghan aut­h­orities arrested and han­d­ed him over to American forces. Then he was transferred to Guant­anamo. Pakistan has not done it,” the ex-ISI chief said.
 
 

Although Pakistan had recognised the Taliban regime and accepted Zaeef as Kabul’s amb­a­ssador, the recognition was withdrawn in the wake of 9/11.
The former spy chief — who has also served as the head of Military Intelligence and ret­ired as Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee — recalled that despite the breakdown of ties, Zaeef continued to reside in the ambassador’s official residence, where the foreign media would remain camped out.
He also recounted how Tali­ban leaders started leaving Afgh­anistan after the US began bombing Kabul in October 2001. They had plans to form a government-in-exile in Pakis­tan, with Zaeef as its head, he said.
“A decision was made to ask Mullah Zaeef to leave Pakistan. There were five million Afghans living in Pakistan that time and we did not hand over any Afghan to the US,” he said.
Gen Haq said Pakistani officials had advised Zaeef to move to a refugee camp, or any other place, to live as a common Afg­han and stop what he was doing. “This message was conveyed to him through the foreign ministry and other relevant govt functionaries.” However, the former ISI chief said, the erstwhile env­oy refused to leave Islamabad.
“Our people would keep on ask­ing him for months to shift from Islamabad. Other countr­ies would also lodge protests that there are UN resolutions and Pa­­k­­istan had de-recognised the Af­g­han govt [but he is still] he is sitting in Islamabad,” he recalled.

In a separate incident, dozens of armed men invaded a town in Kacchi district and set the police station on fire, before escaping after a heavy gun battle with the police.
Speaking about the roa­d­side explosion, officials said the improvised explosive device, which was pla­n­ted in a motorbike, went off next to a security vehicle when the DC’s convoy reac­h­ed Thana road in Turbat.
“At least nine Levies personnel present in the security vehicle, as well as a passerby, were injured in the powerful blast,” Nazeer Ahmed, Turbat deputy superintendent of police, told Dawn.
The deputy commissi­oner, who was travelling in a bulletproof vehicle, rem­ained safe in the explosion.
 
 

Soon after the blast, the security forces and the police rushed to the site, and the injured Levies personnel and the sole civilian were rushed to the district hospital in Turbat. “The condition of two personnel is serious,” the police said, quoting hospital officials.
The explosion destr­oyed the security vehicle, while the bulletproof vehicle of the DC also received damage. At least a dozen buildings and five vehicles parked in the vicinity also sustained damage.
Police station torched
Separately, dozens of militants attacked Bhag, a town in Kacchi district, and set the Levies station and other government buildings on fire.
Officials said two assailants were also gunned down — one body was tak­en into custody by the Counter-Terrorism Depart­ment and the other was tak­en away by the fleeing militants.
In the attack, a police official was also killed, while another sustained injuries and moved to Sibi for treatment. Officials said up to 50 armed men arrived in Bhag at 4:15pm on motorbikes, attacking a pickup truck and police and Levies stations. They took the Levies personnel hostage and started firing at the police station. However, the police deployed in the area immediately retaliated, leading to a heavy exchange of fire.
In the shootout, Bhag SHO Lutaf Khosa received multiple injuries and lost his life. “Our police officer was martyred and a police constable [Muhammad Afzal Khosa] was injured in the heavy exchange of fire,” Maazur Rehman, Ka­c­chi SSP, told Dawn. He said two militants were also killed.
According to the SSP, armed men broke into the judicial lockup and took away six undertrial prisoners. He said the tehsil office was also attacked by the militants who ransacked the record of ‘Patwarkhana’ and its furniture. They tried to enter a National Bank branch but the police foiled their attempt, said the SSP.
He said the police station was completely gutted. The building of the National Bank was also damaged as heavy weapons were used in the attack.

• Province cites slow, inadequate response from federal cybercrime agency
LAHORE: Unhappy with the performance of the National Cybercrime Inve­stigation Agency (NCCIA), the Punjab government has decided in pri­nciple to set up its own wing to deal with the rising incidents of cybercrime in the province.
The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Mar­yam Naw­az here on Monday. “The Cybercrime Wing will be establis­hed in Pun­j­ab to curb the misuse of digital platforms,” the meeting decided.
A senior official told Dawn that Punjab had been facing difficulties as its complaints were not properly addressed by the NCCIA and often took too long to be disposed of.
“Keeping in view the sharp rise in cybercrime in the most-populated province of the country, Punjab feels the need to have a separate wing to deal with the menace,” he said.
After the NCCIA was established in May this year — replacing the Fede­ral Investigation Agency’s (FIA) Cybercrime Wing — the Pun­jab government tried to develop a “working relationship” with the federal authority, but it did not yield results.
The Punjab government has been facing increasing challenges on social media, particularly the targeting of the Sharif family by pol­itical opponents. Even provincial ministers, including Information Minister Azma Bokhari, have filed compl­aints with the NCCIA agai­nst individuals invol­ved in online character assassination.
Ms Bokhari recently ann­o­unced plans to move the NCCIA against TV anchor Mubasher Lucman under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) for alleged defamation.
Questions, however, are being raised about whether the proposed provincial cyb­­e­rcrime wing is inten­d­ed to target political rivals.
Meanwhile, the NCCIA itself has been struggling with severe manpower shor­t­ages as thousands of complaints pour in each month. With a large backlog and limited resources, the authority has been unable to process cases efficiently.
 
 

“In the NCCIA, compla­ints arrive in thousands eve­ry month. Most are related to account hacking, harassment, and financial fraud,” an official told Dawn.
“In harassment cases, many inv­olve the uploading of objectionable photos or videos — often by ex-husbands, ex-fiancés, or boyfriends — to blackmail victims. But the NCCIA lacks the staff and resources needed to handle such a massive volume.”
He said evidence collection also remains a major challenge due to non-cooperation from some social media platforms, including Faceb­ook, WhatsApp, Google, and Gmail.
“There is no treaty betw­een the government and these companies, so they are not legally bound to share data with the NCCIA. Only in cases involving life threats or ransom do they respond promptly. Besides, the authority is not equipped with the latest software required to trace and verify digital evidence,” he added.
Over the past few years, the number of cybercrime complaints has increased manifold, but the government has not taken steps to strengthen the capacity of the investigating agency, including training officers in countries that have advanced cybercrime systems.
“The government should build the cybercrime setup on the pattern of the FBI,” the official suggested.

Back in 2022, he was killed under mysterious circumstances in Kenya, far away from Pakistan. That year was a chaotic one in Pakistan, chaos which is easier to ascribe to politics than to point out more uncomfortable truths; and it also claimed Arshad Sharif’s life.
Once the grief and horror over his death passed, the conversation returned to prosaic matters such as inquiries, commissions and justice. I call them prosaic because when journalists die in Pakistan, everyone pushes earnestly for answers, despite knowing that justice will never be done and no one will be held accountable. The same storyline was faithfully adhered to this time around. In the three years since, we have seen journalist organisations promising — politician-like — to push for investigations, as well as politicians and also other powerful people. Some promises were made publicly and some in secret but none were fulfilled. Three years on, very few questions have been answered.
 
 

But such tragedies are the norm in Pakistan. Here popular leaders are given the death penalty, others are targeted by militant groups and those from the smaller provinces are even disappeared. It is no wonder then that journalists are not treated more kindly. Just in the past couple of decades, Hayatullah was disappeared and killed in what was then Fata; Saleem Shahzad was disappeared and found dead near Islamabad and Wali Khan Babar was targeted in Karachi — just to name a few. Three years ago, it was Arshad Sharif.
But his death seemed to and continues to feel like a turning point. Partly because it came in a year that was a turning point in so many ways, but also because of the manner in which it happened. Before Arshad Sharif, many of us were always bystanders to the violence which affected one of our own. The threats that came before, the harassment that Babar or Shahzad faced was usually limited to a close circle but with Arshad Sharif it played out like a film. The FIRs, the letters he wrote, his exit from the country, his resignation from his job and then his vlogs, we all had a ringside seat to the events.

What journalist colleagues in smaller towns and cities go through is hard to even imagine.

Equally, what made it a turning point was that his death told us journalists that borders now no longer keep us safe. To be accurate, the message had been sent earlier with the death of Sajid Husain in Sweden in 2020 — but Arshad Sharif’s demise in Kenya emphasised it more. It is no longer necessary that once the borders of Pakistan are crossed, threatened journalists will be able to breathe freely. Once this was a guarantee of safety but not anymore. Despite this, many others from the community have left the country and settled abroad.
And for multiple reasons, journalism and the ability of journalists to do their job has been in a free fall since 2022; it was not much better before it either but the speed at which the environment has become worse is increasing. So much has been written about this already that little can be added to it. But as our job is sometimes to state the obvious, let me point out that this past week, as Arshad Sharif’s death anniversary was being commemorated, Matiullah Jan, another colleague from Islamabad, was in the news because the ludicrous case against him for ‘attacking policemen’ while ‘under the influence’ and for ‘possession’ of heroin was also proceeding. News reports say he will be indicted on Oct 31. The allegations are so ridiculous that even those in the government cannot defend them but the case goes ahead, for we now live in times better suited for magical realism than the real world.
So even as the case will progress, we will complain and yet be grateful that Matiullah Jan was thus accused and is out on bail. At least, he was produced in court after being formally charged, even as he has every right to be angry about the indignity of this case and also hear the inanities uttered by those who claim to lead and represent us.
The harassment of journalists has indeed taken on new hues, in recent years. Just in the past year, Matiullah and Asad Toor both lost access to their bank accounts as did others around them. Friends, relatives and even ordinary vendors they interacted with, everyone paid the price for having pesky journalists in their lives. There are others also in a similar predicament. What colleagues in the smaller towns and cities go through is hard to even imagine, as most of us in Islamabad worry about the next red line we are told not to cross; the next big event that is not to be covered; or express horror at the next colleague to be banned from the airwaves.
And if there is any outrage or protest, the reply comes in the shape of a lecture on good or bad journalism and the difference between a good journalist and a propagandist. As if somehow, the label of a bad journalist justifies kidnapping, criminal cases, disappearances and death.
In the midst of all this, some journalists last week did remember Arshad Sharif’s death and the justice he and his family continue to be denied. As occasionally a voice is raised for Saleem Shahzad or Nazim Jokhio. The list was long before Arshad Sharif’s name was added to it and it will keep growing. But whether those in power ignore the issue or speak of it only to deflect the matter, what they don’t realise is that in the people’s imagination the culprits were identified long ago. When the truth is withheld and the facts obscured, the people’s court doesn’t wait forever to make its own judgement. These judgements have little need for an order from the Supreme Court or an inquiry commission. For ordinary people, they have already reached their decision in Arshad Sharif’s case. And it will not be easy to change their minds.
The writer is a journalist.

Mr Bhutto-Zardari called on Maulana Fazl at his residence to discuss political and parliamentary matters. JUI-F sources said that the focus of the discussion was to formulate a collective strategy related to new legislation and develop parliamentary cooperation between the PPP and the JUI-F.
They claimed that Mr Bhutto-Zardari stressed the importance of the role of opposition parties in the upcoming legislation — a probable reference to a new constitutional amendment that is on the cards. Maulana Fazl expressed concerns over the attitude and relationship between the government and the opposition parties.
The meeting comes a day after a senior JUI-F leader said his party would march on Islamabad and organise a series of nationwide gatherings against flawed government policies.
In the meeting, the PPP leaders also emphasised joint action on national issues, such as security and stability, the economy, and electoral reforms. Both sides discussed the role of parliamentary parties regarding the Afghanistan crisis.
It may be noted that Pakis­tan and Afghanistan enga­ged in brief but intense skirmishes over the issue of cross-border terrorism. Cur­r­e­ntly, talks between the two are underway in Turkiye.
The PPP delegation included Syed Nayyar Hussain Bukhari, Humayun Khan and Jamil Soomro, while the JUI-F delegation included Maulana Asad Mahmood and Mufti Abrar.
‘No interest in JUI-F’
PTI leader Salman Akram Raja, separately, said the PTI did not see a possibility of the JUI-F supporting it for the NA opposition leader slot.
In response to a question regarding chatter of a new NA opposition leader and whether the JUI-F will support the PTI, Mr Raja said, “Cons­idering the past, I don’t think they will go with us at the end, and whether they form an alliance with the PPP or the PML-N, I cannot say anything about it, but we (PTI) don’t really have any interest in it.”

• Maintain Islamabad would prefer deployment to be under UN mandate; cite country’s strong track record in peacekeeping missions
• Indonesia, UAE, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Azerbaijan among nations being asked to send troops; Tel Aviv opposes deployment of Turkish forces
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is expected to soon announce whether it will contribute troops to the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) being assembled for Gaza, officials said, amid indications that the government is leaning toward participation.
Officials familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said discussions within the government and military establishment were at an “advanced stage”.
According to them, the tone of internal consultations suggests that Islamabad is inclined to take part in the mission.
A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the ISF, composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries.
 
 

The force’s mandate would include maintaining internal security, disarming Hamas, securing border crossings, and assisting with humanitarian relief and reconstruction under the supervision of a transitional Palestinian authority.
While the Trump administration has ruled out sending US soldiers into the Gaza Strip, it has been speaking to Indonesia, the UAE, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Azerbaijan to contribute to the multinational force.
However, on Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar openly opposed Turkiye’s inclusion in the ISF, over Turk­ish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s “hostile approach against Israel”.
On Sunday, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu had said his country would decide which foreign forces to allow in Gaza, and hinted that he would be strongly opposed to any role for Turkish security forces.
According to a report in the Israeli press, members of the Israeli parliament’s Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee were told during a closed-door briefing last week that the ISF — comprising soldiers from Indonesia, Azerbaijan and Pakistan — would “be tasked with maintaining internal security and policing in Gaza, as well as assisting Israel in securing the borders and preventing weapons smuggling into the territory”.
These reports come as Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir visits Egypt and Jordan, two countries deeply involved in post-ceasefire developments related to Gaza.
While the military has described his visits as focused on promoting defence ties, sources said the fragile implementation of US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan featured prominently in his discussions with regional leaders.
During his meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi, Field Marshal Munir praised Egypt’s pivotal role in calming tensions and achieving stability in the Middle East, according to a statement by the Egyptian presidency. He also lauded Egypt’s “tireless efforts” to end the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.
Egypt, a primary mediator alongside Qatar and the United States, hosted the pivotal Sharm el-Sheikh summit on Oct 13, where the plan’s first phase was signed.
According to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), President Sisi expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s “positive and proactive contributions” to matters of importance for the world and the Muslim ummah.
Analysts believe the army chief’s discussions in Cairo point to Pakistan’s potential involvement in the stabilisation force and the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre being set up to oversee the peace plan’s implementation.
In Jordan, during Field Marshal Munir’s meetings with King Abdullah II and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maj Gen Yousef Ahmed Al-Huneiti, the Jordanian leadership acknowledged Pakistan’s “contributions toward peace and regional security,” according to ISPR.
Officials in Islamabad argue that Pakistan’s potential participation stems from both moral responsibility and diplomatic necessity. They noted that Pakistan was part of the original eight-country peace proposal conceived in late 2024, and backed by several Muslim-majority states, that formed the basis of the US-brokered Gaza peace plan finalised earlier this month.
Since the stabilisation force was a key pillar of that plan, officials said, Pakistan’s participation would signal consistency and credibility.
“We were among the ori­ginal backers of the peace architecture for Gaza. To step aside now would mean abandoning an initiative we helped shape,” said one senior official. “There’s a moral obligation, not just a political one.”
Another argument giv­en by the government circles supporting Pakistan’s inclusion in the ISF is its strong track record in int­ernational peacekeeping.
Pakistan is one of the largest troop contributors to United Nations peace missions, having deployed more than 200,000 personnel to over 40 operations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
Officials contend that this experience not only equips Pakistani forces to manage volatile post-conflict environments but also lends credibility and legitimacy to the ISF.
Beyond moral and operational grounds, foreign policy imperatives also underpin the government’s case for participation. Officials argue that joining the Gaza stabilisation force could strengthen Pakistan’s relations with the United States.
Islamabad’s ties with Washington have been on a gradual mend since Trump’s return to the White House, following years of friction over Afghanistan and counterterrorism. Participating in a US-supported multilateral initiative, they said, could further this thaw and open avenues for economic cooperation, defence support and regional influence.
However, officials cautioned that there is still no clarity on the legal framework for the deployment.
“Ideally, we would like this deployment to take place under a UN mandate,” an official said.
Still, such a deployment would not be without risk. Gaza remains highly volatile, and domestic opinion in Pakistan presents an additional challenge.
Many Pakistanis, deeply sympathetic to the Pales­tinian cause, may perceive participation in a US-desi­gned stabilisation mission as serving Israeli interests or even as a betrayal of Palestinian resistance. “It’s a difficult but defining choice,” said another official.

• Insiders say Haq likely to resign seeking ‘honourable exit’, sit on opposition benches
ISLAMABAD: Azad Jammu Kashmir Prime Minister Anwarul Haq’s days seem to be numbered, as the coalition partners in the federal government — the PPP and the PML-N — ratchet up pressure on the embattled premier to step down from the post, or face a no-confidence motion in the assembly.
The coalition partners met at the Presidency on Monday to discuss possible options for the formation of the AJK government to be led by the PPP. The PML-N panel, led by Ahsan Iqbal and comprising Rana Sanaullah and Amir Muqam, called on President Zardari to discuss the AJK affairs with the PPP in light of the current situation.
Talking to reporters after the meeting, PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal said his party would support the no-trust motion against the AJK PM but would not become part of the government. He said the PPP will form the government after the success of the no-confidence motion, while they would sit on the opposition benches.
PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah said the PML-N’s parliamentary party has expressed distrust over the incumbent AJK government. He said the current AJK government failed to perform its duties, adding that free and fair elections would be held in the region after completion of the AJK assembly’s term next year.
 
 

“The incumbent government has become a problem itself instead of a problem-solver,” PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira said. Mr Kaira slammed PM Haq’s administration and said political stability in AJK was the need of the hour.
He also welcomed the PML-N’s decision, which further strengthened the PPP’s position to oust the sitting premier. Mr Kaira said that both sides respected each other’s decisions as they aimed to bring political stability to the region.
Numbers game
The PPP has 27 members in the AJK Legislative Assembly after 10 lawmakers joined the party on Sunday, and with the PML-N’s backing, it has garnered the support of at least 36 lawmakers to oust the incumbent premier. The PPP also claims Sardar Atiq of the Muslim Conference and Sardar Hasan Ibrahim of the Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party will also support it.
The AJK Legislative Assembly has 52 members and to achieve a simple majority, a party requires the support of 27 members. In light of this situation, sources said the incumbent PM was advised to opt for an “honourable exit” as he had lost the support of the majority.
With the PPP having 27 members in the house, he has three options: dissolve the assembly to prevent the party from coming to power, step down, or face a no-trust vote.
The final decision, however, will be taken today (Tuesday), but the premier is likely to step down, the source added. He also dispelled the impression that the PM was waiting for the announcement of a nominee for the coveted slot in the hope that such a decision would polarise the alliance against him.
The source further said that PM Haq and his six associates would sit on the opposition benches after he quits.

By late evening, officials said a final agreement still remained elusive.
Sources familiar with the closed-door discussions said that while “most of the points had been mutually agreed between the two sides”, the mechanism for verifiable action against terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory continued to be the main sticking point.
“We kept hoping that we would be able to sign a mutual document with Afgha­nistan soon, followed by a joint statement, but it still remains out of our reach,” one source said, sounding dejected, yet unwilling to abandon hope.

Mechanism for verifiable action against terrorists operating from Afghan soil remains main issue between Islamabad and Kabul

The atmosphere early in the day had been markedly positive. Participants des­c­­ribed “encouraging progress” and “serious engagement” from both delegations.
As the day wore on and talks stretched into the evening, optimism began to fade. “It is a difficult phase,” a source admitted, reflecting the growing sense of frustration within the room.
By nightfall, it appeared that the process had once again hit a roadblock. According to the participants, the Afghan Taliban delegation continued to resist putting anything in writing, particularly on the issue of providing verifiable guarantees to end support for the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“The hosts understand Pakistan’s concerns,” one Pakistani official said, “but people in Kabul and Kandahar are not willing to commit.”
This hesitation has left the Pakistani side increasingly frustrated. “Pakistan’s principled stance has been clear from the outset,” a security source said. “The Taliban must end their patronage of the TTP and prevent Afghan territory from being used for terrorism against Pakistan.”
The source added that despite “some negative and external influences” — a reference to India, Pakistan and the mediating countries remained “sincere and serious” in their efforts to move the dialogue toward a positive outcome.
The tone at the start of Monday’s proceedings contrasted sharply with the pessimism that followed Sunday’s session, when Pakistani officials told reporters that Islamabad had presented its final position to the Taliban delegation — a statement widely interpreted in local media as signalling the possible collapse of the talks.
In contrast to those reports, members of the Afghan negotiating team had on Sunday night and Monday morning continued to express optimism.
They maintained that the dialogue in Istanbul could still yield results, describing the remaining disagreements as “few” and “resolvable”.
“The Afghan side has made it clear that tensions benefit no one,” one member of the delegation said. “We are hopeful that these talks will produce a positive outcome.”
Mediators from Turkiye and Qatar were said to share this sentiment, stressing the importance of maintaining engagement and preventing the process from unraveling.
Despite the lingering stalemate, diplomatic sources described Monday’s session as “not without significance”.
“Even if the talks didn’t produce a breakthrough, the fact that both sides stayed engaged for three straight days is important,” one mediator said. “It shows that neither wants the process to collapse.”
By late evening, negotiators in Istanbul were weighing whether to extend discussions into a fourth day.

“Flood-related supply disruptions and temporary border closures have put upward pressure on prices of a few essential commodities”, said the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in its Monthly Economic Update & Outlook – October 2025. However, it claimed inflation would remain in the target range of 5-6pc this month, which had already reached 5.6pc in September, against the MoF’s forecast of 3.5-4.5pc made on Sept 30.
The MoF said net federal revenues surged by 231.4pc to Rs3.27 trillion in the first two months (July-August) of FY26, compared to Rs986.7 billion in the same period last year. This was driven by a 721.1pc jump in non-tax revenues and a 14.1pc rise in FBR tax collections.
“The surge in non-tax revenues was mainly led by higher State Bank of Pakistan profits, supplemented by increased receipts from dividends, defence receipts, Windfall Levy against crude oil, the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess, and the petroleum levy. During July-Sep FY26, FBR’s tax collection rose to Rs2.884tr, up 12.5pc.

Finance ministry warns of inflation from supply disruptions, trade hurdles

On the expenditure side, total outlays increased modestly by 7.6pc to Rs1.76tr. “Consequently, the federal fiscal balance recorded a surplus of Rs1.509tr, compared to a deficit of Rs648.8bn last year. The primary balance also improved sharply, posting a surplus of Rs2.939tr, up from Rs49.4bn in the corresponding period”, it said.
It said the climate shocks weighed on agriculture, but the sector showed early signs of resilience. According to a preliminary assessment, the recent flood has caused Rs430bn losses to the agriculture sector, damaging crops like rice, cotton, sugarcane, maise, fodder and vegetables. “Nevertheless, recent indicators suggest that recovery efforts are underway, supported by increased agricultural credit, higher machinery imports, and improved fertiliser off-take”, it said.
On the other hand, the MoF hoped for improved export prospects, driven by stronger economic momentum in Pakistan’s export destinations. “The Composite Leading Indicator position of the US, UK, China and the euro area has further strengthened compared to the last month, with all moving above or near their long-term potential levels, signalling improved export prospects for Pakistan”, it said.
The monthly report said Pakistan’s economy maintained its recovery path despite flood-related disruptions. “Industrial activity remains resilient, supported by a rebound in Large-Scale Manufacturing, particularly in cement, automobiles, and allied sectors, while exports and remittances are showing steady improvement”, it said, adding the external sector remained stable, with a current account surplus recorded in September, amid robust remittance inflows.
It highlighted the successful IMF review under the Extended Fund Facility and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility, noting that it reaffirmed confidence in Pakistan’s reform trajectory and prudent macroeconomic management. “Continued progress in privatisation, digital governance, and CPEC Phase 2.0 joint ventures underscores the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation, structural transformation, and sustainable, inclusive growth”, the report added.
The MoF said the government would remain firmly committed to maintaining fiscal discipline and providing targeted social protection within a sound and forward-looking macroeconomic policy framework.

Barrister Mian Ali Ashfaq told Dawn.com the six were “taken into FIA custody and arrested on charges of misuse of authority and bribery”.
He said they would be produced in a district court on Tuesday and he would represent them.
Ashfaq said the six were Additional Director Chaudhry Sarfraz, In-charge Zawar, Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Yasir Gujjar and Mujtaba Kamran.
Chaudhry was reportedly removed over different controversies last month and asked to report to the NCCIA headquarters, Islamabad. He said he was transferred to the headquarters and he had sought a six-month leave.
The three controversies were about laying hands on a number of YouTubers/social media influencers, including Saadur Rehman, popularly known as Ducky Bhai and Rajab Butt, for their alleged involvement in unregulated online trading and online gambling apps.
The other was the registration of a case against some lawyers who allegedly tried to get a suspect released from the NCCIA. The third controversy related to a tiff between a group of Lahore’s journalists and a serving deputy inspector general of police and some other police officials, as the former moved the NCCIA to act against the latter. According to an official, Chaudhry was transferred in light of different complaints against him.
On Friday, the Islamabad High Court had granted the police one more week to trace missing NCCIA Deputy Director Muhammad Usman, who has been missing for several days. The development came during the hearing of a petition filed by Rozina Usman for the recovery of her husband. She alleged that four armed individuals abducted her husband on October 14.
The court was also informed that the petitioner had herself gone missing after initiating the case. The development had prompted the court to seek an updated report from the police on both disappearances.</p><small>2025-10-27 19:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/272316369324f31.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951592/9th-pakistan-bangladesh-jec-meeting-held-in-dhaka-after-2-decade-hiatus' target='_blank'><strong>9th Pakistan-Bangladesh JEC meeting held in Dhaka after 2-decade hiatus</strong></a><br><p>The 9th Session of the Pakistan-Bangladesh Joint Economic Commission (JEC) was convened in Dhaka on Monday, after a hiatus of 20 years, marking another important milestone in strengthening bilateral economic and development cooperation between the two countries.
The meeting was co-chaired by Federal Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik and Bangladesh Finance Adviser Dr Salehuddin Ahmed.
At the conclusion of the session, both sides signed the Agreed Minutes of the 9th JEC, reflecting “significant progress” in multiple areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment and industries, agriculture, transport and communications, education, information technology, banking, health, tourism, energy, climate change, information and broadcasting, and the textile sector.
The two sides emphasised the importance of enhancing cooperation between the national shipping corporations, with Pakistan offering the use of Karachi Port Trust as a gateway for Bangladeshs’s trade with regional countries, including China and the Central Asian States.
The two countries also agreed to work actively toward establishing direct air connectivity, recognising its vital role in promoting tourism and business exchanges.
A significant development during the session was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in Halal Trade between the Pakistan Halal Authority and the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute, paving the way for enhanced collaboration in standardisation and certification of Halal products.
Pakistan also highlighted the establishment of the Pakistan-Bangladesh Knowledge Corridor, which includes an offer of 500 new and fully funded scholarships for Bangladeshi students.
Furthermore, the delegation said Pakistan has increased the number of training slots under the Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme from five to 25.
Both sides agreed to cooperate in the areas of medical and religious tourism, and to promote greater cultural exchanges between the two countries.
It was decided to organise the inaugural meeting of the Joint Working Group on Trade. It was also discussed to establish joint working groups in key sectors such as maritime affairs, and information technology, which will hold regular meetings to ensure sustained progress.
The two sides agreed to explore a concessionary trade arrangement and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening trade, agricultural and industrial cooperation to promote sustainable and inclusive growth in both countries.
The 9th JEC concluded in a “spirit of friendship and mutual respect, reaffirming the shared commitment of Pakistan and Bangladesh to further deepen bilateral relations and regional economic integration”.
Malik thanked the government of Bangladesh and the finance adviser for the hospitality extended to him and his delegation during the visit.</p><small>2025-10-27 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/271655107432e9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951573/trump-dismisses-2028-vp-run-as-too-cute-leaves-door-open-to-third-term' target='_blank'><strong>Trump dismisses 2028 VP run as ‘too cute,’ leaves door open to third term</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Monday ruled out running for vice president in the 2028 election but declined to definitively say he would not seek a third term, keeping alive speculation about how he might seek to extend his time in office.
Trump has repeatedly flirted with the idea of serving beyond the constitutionally mandated two terms, joking about it at rallies and teasing supporters with “Trump 2028” hats. Some allies have taken those signals seriously, suggesting that they are exploring legal or political pathways to make it happen — a possibility dismissed by most constitutional scholars.
The 22nd amendment to the US constitution bars anyone from being elected to the presidency a third time.
Some supporters have suggested that one way around the prohibition would be for Trump to run as vice president, while another candidate stood for election as president and resigned, letting Trump again assume the presidency.
“I’d be allowed to do that,” Trump said today in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew from Malaysia to Tokyo.
But he added: “I wouldn’t do that. I think it’s too cute. Yeah, I would rule that out because it’s too cute. I think the people wouldn’t like that. It’s too cute. It’s not — it wouldn’t be right.”
 


Scholars say Trump is barred from running for vice president because he is not eligible to be president.
The 12th amendment to the US constitution reads, “No person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States.”
‘I have my best numbers ever’
Referring to the possibility of a third term, Trump said: “I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever.”
When pressed by a reporter whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean you’ll have to tell me.”
Asked about whether he would be willing to fight in court over the legality of another presidential bid, Trump responded, “I haven’t really thought about it.”
Trump, 79, would be 82 in 2028 if he sought another term, which would make him the oldest US president in history. Despite his age, he has maintained a rigorous public schedule, frequently engaging with reporters even during long international trips, underscoring his stamina and active involvement in daily presidential duties.
Throughout the 2024 campaign, Trump made former president Joe Biden’s advanced age a focal point, often highlighting verbal and physical missteps as evidence that his Democratic rival was too old to effectively lead the country.
Trump also said Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were “great people” who could seek the presidency in 2028.
“I think if they ever formed a group, it’d be unstoppable,” he said. “I really do. I believe that.”
Rubio, standing behind Trump in the plane cabin, chuckled and bowed his head sheepishly as Trump predicted a bright political future for him and nodded when Trump brought up Vance.
Trump’s statements about a third term have muddied the Republican Party’s future, with jockeying already under way among potential Republican successors even as some Trump allies back the idea of him remaining in office.
In an interview last week with The Economist, Steve Bannon, the pro-Trump podcaster who briefly served as Trump’s White House chief strategist in his first term, said there was a plan to circumvent the 22nd amendment and suggested he was involved in developing it.
“Trump is going to be president in ’28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,” Bannon said. “At the appropriate time, we’ll lay out what the plan is. But there is a plan.”
He added that Trump was an “instrument of divine will”, echoing language Trump himself has occasionally used.</p><small>2025-10-27 17:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/272213400aa23fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951589/pakistan-look-to-bounce-back-from-asia-cup-hurt-in-south-africa-t20is' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan look to bounce back from Asia Cup hurt in South Africa T20Is</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s build-up towards next year’s T20 World Cup will continue on Tuesday when they take on South Africa in the opener of the three-match series at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.
The national side goes into the series after faring decently in their biggest test at the Asia Cup last month — beating all sides they came up against except world number one and archrivals India, who handed them defeats in all three encounters including the final.
South Africa, in contrast, arrive as a depleted outfit on paper — the presence of star batter Quinton de Kock, featuring in a Twenty20 International for the first time since June 2024, standing out in a largely second-string squad led by Donovan Ferreira, who has just nine T20Is to his name.
Hence, Pakistan can be safely called favourites to take the series trophy, which would help restore their damaged confidence following the triple-drubbing from India.
 






The hosts too haven’t shied away from striking a balance between experimentation and experience. Former skipper Babar Azam has returned to the T20I ranks following a four-month absence, while Fakhar Zaman waits in the reserves.
“He’s a world-class player,” Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said of Babar in the pre-series press conference on the eve of the match. “His presence always benefits the team. He’s played over a hundred T20s, led Pakistan many times, and scored heavily. His experience will strengthen our batting line-up.”
Pacer Naseem Shah, who missed both the tri-nation series and the Asia Cup, is also set to make his comeback. Uncapped spinner Usman Tariq and exciting middle-order batter Abdul Samad have been drafted in as part of Pakistan’s search for depth and flexibility ahead of the global showpiece next year.
Pakistan have also axed Mohammad Haris, despite the team management previously backing the wicket-keeper batter before he fell out of favour to make way for Usman Khan. The decision has raised concerns of inconsistent selection.
 






“We were looking for a wicket-keeper-batter who can play in the middle order, especially against spin,” Salman said, defending Usman’s inclusion. “Even though his international record isn’t great yet, you must’ve seen in the PSL that he bats well against spin in middle overs. We needed that kind of player who can both keep wickets and handle spin in that phase.”
Pakistan have undergone a T20I revamp since the appointment of Mike Hesson as the side’s white-ball head coach in June, with an increased emphasis on strike-rates under the New Zealander. Hard-hitting has been a central theme of their approach in the 21 matches under Hesson so far.
But with the strategy largely failing to yield consistent results, there is a growing realisation that a more adaptable approach is needed.
“Given the kind of conditions we’ve been playing in, we need batters who can build innings and rotate strike, and then accelerate when required,” Salman said. “Middle-overs batting against spin is another key area. We need to improve strike rotation there, and we’ve worked on that during our recent camp.”
 






The pitch at Rawalpindi is expected to be a batting paradise, which could also allow South Africa to challenge Pakistan with big totals and put the hosts under pressure.
For the visitors, too, the series offers an opportunity to fine-tune their combination ahead of the T20 World Cup.
“It is important to build up toward the World Cup,” Ferreira said. “I think this is the big stepping stone for us toward the World Cup.”
Ferreira was named skipper after veteran batter David Miller was ruled out due to injury. Gerald Coetzee and Kwena Maphaka have also missed out through fitness issues, while the Proteas have rested regular T20I captain Aiden Markram, batters Tristan Stubbs and Ryan Rickelton, and spearhead Kagiso Rabada.

Mir, who was associated with Metro News television, was heading home in a car driven by his elder brother last month when six assailants riding two motorcycles fired a volley of bullets on his vehicle on the National Highway. The anchorperson sustained multiple bullet wounds and was taken to a private hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.
Journalists had strongly condemned the inaction by the police for failing to arrest the attackers and demanded their immediate arrest. Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, many members of his cabinet and leaders of political parties had expressed their sorrow, with CM Shah directing the inspector general of police (IG) to immediately arrest the killers.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, IG Ghulam Nabi Memon and Additional IG Javed Alam Odho held a press conference today on updates regarding the case.
“Four people have been arrested in the murder of journalist Imtiaz Mir,” Lanjar said, adding that a joint operation was carried out by the Karachi police and a federal intelligence agency.
“The culprits belong to a banned organisation that used to take instructions from abroad,” he added.
Lanjar termed it a breakthrough in the murder case, adding that the bike used in the attack was also recovered.
The home minister said that Mir had given an interview in which he talked in “favour of Israel”, adding that it appeared to be “an exact motive” of the murder.
He said a sub-organisation of the proscribed Zainabiyoun Brigade was involved in the case.
Lanjar added that the primary suspect lived in a neighboring country, without specifying who he was referring to. The home minister alleged that the neighboring country was “providing funding and spreading chaos” in Pakistan.
Mir’s brother Riaz Ali had registered a case under Sections 34 (common intention) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Saudabad police station, nominating a man and his sons for the attack.
The complainant said that the attack was carried out at the behest of Umer Daraz and his two sons — Ahmed Bux and Aftab — with whom they had a land dispute in their native town in Jacobabad.
Saudabad Station House Officer Ateequr Rehman had told Dawn that both parties belonged to the same tribe. He recalled that the late anchorperson had also lodged an FIR against the same suspects at the Shah Latif Town police in 2023.
According to a report published last month by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.</p><small>2025-10-27 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/271822260e006c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951578/jordanian-king-lauds-pakistan-militarys-role-in-regional-peace-during-meeting-with-coas-munir' target='_blank'><strong>Jordanian king lauds Pakistan military’s role in regional peace during meeting with COAS Munir</strong></a><br><p>Jordan’s King Abdullah II on Monday lauded the Pakistan military’s contributions towards regional peace and security in a meeting with Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Monday, according to the military’s media wing.
A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the army chief is currently on an official visit to Jordan and called on the Jordanian king for a meeting, with Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II also present.
The ISPR said both dignitaries discussed matters of mutual interest, with a particular focus on enhancing bilateral cooperation in defence and security, and exchanging perspectives on regional developments.
“His majesty appreciated the professionalism and contributions of the Pakistan Armed Forces towards regional peace and stability and expressed his desire to further strengthen defence collaboration between the two brotherly countries,” the ISPR said, adding that the army chief conveyed warm regards from Pakistan’s people, government and military.
He also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to deepening fraternal ties with with the Hashemite kingdom.
 






During the visit, COAS Munir also called on Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Jordan Armed Forces Major General Yousef Ahmed Al-Huneiti at the General Headquarters, Amman, where he was welcomed and presented with a guard of honour on his arrival.
“During the visit, both dignitaries reaffirmed the deep-rooted and historic ties between the Armed Forces of Pakistan and Jordan. Major General Yousef Ahmed Al-Huneiti also acknowledged Pakistan Armed Forces’ remarkable contributions towards peace and regional security,” the ISPR said.
The army chief visited Jordan after touring Egypt. He and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday stressed the need for stronger strategic coordination and broader cooperation in security, technology and the economy.
The meeting came amid a broader push by both countries to upgrade ties.
Field Marshal Munir had also met senior defence officials on Fri­d­­ay, where he reaffirmed Pakis­tan’s commitment to closer defe­nce and military cooperation.</p><small>2025-10-27 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/27134919e917503.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951561/central-bank-keeps-policy-rate-unchanged-at-11pc' target='_blank'><strong>Central bank keeps policy rate unchanged at 11pc</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday decided to keep the key interest rate unchanged at 11 per cent as policymakers weighed the impact of recent floods and higher food prices on inflation.
“The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent in its meeting held on October 27, 2025,” the SBP announced in a post on social media platform X.
 






A monetary policy statement, issued shortly after the announcement on X, said the MPC noted during the meeting that headline inflation “rose significantly” to 5.6pc in September, whereas core inflation remained unchanged at 7.3pc.
Regarding the rise in headline inflation, the statement said, “This largely reflected the expected flood-induced increase in food prices; an uptick in energy prices; and sticky core inflation”.
The MPC observed that, unlike previous flood episodes, the recent surge in food prices appeared to be milder than anticipated earlier, the statement said, adding that this was reflected by the “recent slowdown in price increases of major food items in high frequency SPI (sensitive price index) data, such as wheat and allied products, sugar, and perishable items”.
“Nonetheless, the Committee expects inflation to exceed the upper bound of the target range for a few months in H2-FY26, before reverting to the target range in FY27. This outlook is subject to risks from volatile global commodity
prices; magnitude and timing of future energy price adjustments; and uncertainty around prices of wheat and allied products and perishable food items.”
Moreover, “the MPC assessed that the impact of the recent floods on the broader economy appears to be somewhat lower than anticipated at the time of its previous meeting. The crop losses are likely to be contained, whereas supply disruptions turned out to be minimal”, the statement added.
It said that economic activity had gained further momentum, as depicted by “robust growth in high-frequency economic indicators”.
Based on these developments, the overall macroeconomic outlook had improved from the previous assessment, the statement said, adding that at the same time, the MPC noted “uncertainties around this outlook arising from volatile global commodity prices; challenging export prospects amidst the evolving tariff dynamics; and potential domestic food supply frictions”.
“In this backdrop, and given the still-unfolding impact of the earlier reduction in the policy rate, the MPC viewed today’s decision as appropriate to maintain the ongoing price stability.”
Moreover, the MPC noted some “key developments” since its last meeting. Outlining these developments, the statement firstly highlighted that real GDP growth in FY25 had been revised by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics to 3pc from the previous estimate of 2.7pc.
“Second, initial estimates of major kharif crops by the Federal Committee on Agriculture remained close to last year’s production, despite the recent floods.
“Third, despite the repayment of a $500 million Eurobond, SBP’s foreign exchange reserves continued to increase.
“Fourth, Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) on the EFF (Extended Fund Facility) and the RSF (Resilience and  Sustainable Facility) reviews.
“Fifth, inflation expectations of both consumers and businesses eased in the latest SBP-IBA sentiment surveys.
“Lastly, global commodity price movements depicted mixed trends, with oil prices displaying heightened volatility.”
In light of these developments, the MPC viewed the real policy rate to be “adequately positive to stabilise inflation within the target range of 5–7pc” over the medium term, the statement said.
It added that the MPC also reiterated the “important role of the continued build-up in external and fiscal buffers to absorb future shocks and in facilitating the ongoing pickup in economic activity, without adding excessive pressures on inflation and the external account”.
Moreover, the MPC also emphasised the importance of continuing the “coordinated and prudent monetary and fiscal policies”, and undertaking the required structural reforms to ensure ongoing progress towards sustainable economic growth.
The policy rate has remained unchanged at 11 per cent since May, even as trade and industry continue to press for a substantial reduction to support economic activity.
Most analysts and researchers had expected the central bank to keep the policy rate unchanged. Bankers and market experts cited two major reasons for maintaining the status quo — the recent floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab that damaged crops and infrastructure, and rising inflationary pressures.
Fears of higher inflation have discouraged the central bank from considering a rate cut despite weak growth and a wide gap between inflation and the real interest rate.
SBP data shows that private-sector credit demand remains subdued, with businesses largely avoiding new borrowing even after the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Economic growth has remained sluggish over the past three years, deepening social and fiscal challenges. Nearly 97 million people are estimated to be living below the poverty line.
The government continues to struggle to revive growth and attract both domestic and foreign investment, particularly in manufacturing and agriculture. Industry leaders argue that high borrowing costs and an onerous tax regime have hurt competitiveness more than market pressures at home or abroad.
