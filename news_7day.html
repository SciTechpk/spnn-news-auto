The first drone was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops.
The second unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in the Satwal sector of Poonch division.
Security sources said the swift action by the Pakistan Army foiled the enemy’s nefarious attempt at spying and once again demonstrated the force’s vigilance, professionalism, and combat readiness.
“The Pakistan Army is fully prepared to respond promptly and effectively to any aggression by the enemy,” a military source said.

Troops continue to trade fire in Leepa Valley

The downing of the drones occurred amid continued exchange of fire along the LoC in Leepa Valley since Friday night, breaking a period of relative calm in the region.
The Indian army, which often stokes tensions under the BJP government, claimed that its troops and Pakistani forces had exchanged fire overnight. While the Pakistan Army did not release a formal statement, military sources confirmed that Pakistani troops were responding to Indian shelling.
 
 

A video clip shared by military sources showed two Indian posts being precisely targeted by Pakistani forces in the Leepa sector. No casualties were immediately reported.
Tuesday’s incidents add to a string of similar aerial violations by Indian surveillance drones over the years, most of which have been swiftly countered by Pakistani forces.
In 2020 alone, three Indian quadcopters were downed after intruding into Pakistani territory. On May 29, a drone was shot in the Nekrun sector of Neelum Valley after crossing 700 metres from India’s Kanzalwan sector.
Just two days earlier, another was intercepted in the Rakhchikri sector of Poonch district after breaching airspace by 650 metres. On April 9 the same year, a drone was destroyed in Sankh sector of Haveli district after intruding 600 metres.

The terrorist attack in Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir and the massacre of some two dozen tourists seem to have provided the excuse the Modi government has been looking for to escalate its warmongering. Jingoism has reached new heights. Rational voices are being drowned in a cacophony of insanity. The Line of Control is already heating up with the exchange of fire between Indian and Pakistani troops.
New Delhi is building a case for its aggression by trying to blame Pakistan for the Pahalgam terrorist attack. But it has failed to substantiate its allegation. The major reason for India’s vehemence is that the terror attack has shattered the narrative that the situation in occupied Kashmir is completely normal and that the people have accepted New Delhi’s decision to abrogate the held territory’s autonomous status. The Modi government is not willing to accept its own intelligence failure.
 
 

Some Indian analysts say that such a daring attack in one of the most protected areas could not be possible without local support for the militants. The fact is that even the use of brute force has failed to crush the Kashmiris’ struggle for their right of self-determination. According to the New York Times, “India has not officially identified any group as having carried out the massacre, and it has publicly presented little evidence to support its claim that Pakistan was behind it.”
While Indian officials maintain that their investigation is still continuing, the Modi government has already implicated Pakistan in the terrorist attack.
To back their assertion, according to international media reports citing officials, “In the briefings to diplomats at the foreign ministry, Indian officials have described Pakistan’s past patterns of support for terrorist groups… .” Interestingly, within hours of the terrorist attack, New Delhi announced a series of punitive actions against Pakistan. While addressing an election campaign in Bihar, the Indian prime minster warned of “unimaginable punishment for the attackers and their backers”.

Indian leaders in their hubris seem to forget the perils of military escalation.

It’s apparent that the Modi government’s war cry against Pakistan is an attempt to divert the world’s attention from its own failure in the occupied territory. There are strong indications that India plans to launch military strikes on multiple targets despite the absence of any evidence of Pakistan being linked to the latest terrorist attack.
 
 

Even a limited military strike by India could lead to a wider conflagration. The Indian calculation that military actions against Pakistan could be kept below the nuclear threshold is fallacious. It would be an extremely dangerous escalation in one of the world’s most volatile regions. The two South Asian nations have been on the brink of conflict many times previously. But the situation today appears to be far more serious with the cessation of all diplomatic channels between the two countries.
India’s decision to unilaterally suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, whic has survived three wars between the two countries, is ominous. Although it may not be possible to block the water flow, Pakistan sees India’s reckless action as a “declaration of war”. Islamabad has announced its own retaliatory actions.
New Delhi seems to have forgotten the lesson of its 2019 air incursion and Pakistan’s swift response that downed an Indian fighter plane. It was American diplomatic intervention that prevented the further escalation of a situation that could have gone completely out of control, with disastrous consequences for regional peace. Indian leaders in their hubris seem to forget the perils of military escalation in a highly combustible environment. The belief that war can produce quick results is extremely dangerous. It’s much easier to start a war than to end it. However powerful a country may be, it cannot command the outcome.
There are so many lessons to be learnt from various wars in recent history, which ended in humiliation even for the most powerful countries. One cannot but agree with the words of an international diplomat that “the more the conflict goes on, the more difficult it will be to have a diplomatic solution”.
The illusion of achieving quick military success often leads to endless quagmires. It is particularly pertinent in the India-Pakistan case. The two countries have been locked in a forever war — overt as well as covert. They have long been blaming each other of fighting a proxy war. The slogans of punishing Pakistan or punishing India only close the door for the resolution of outstanding issues.
 
 

What happened in Pahalgam must be condemned, but the tragedy should not be used for warmongering. There is also a lesson for Pakistan, where, too, there is no shortage of warmongers flaunting the country’s nuclear capability or making some other irresponsible remarks, as the defence minister did. It’s not in our interest to exacerbate the situation. There is a need to adopt a more rational approach even in the face of provocation. There is a need to step back from the brink.
The outcome of war is always uncertain, and fighting often produces unintended consequences. There is a tendency for wars to expand, become costlier and last longer than expected. The breakdown of diplomatic ties between India and Pakistan has certainly made communication more difficult, but there are other international channels that should be used to bring down the temperature and create an atmosphere for dialogue.
In 2002, there was imminent threat of a full-fledged war between the two countries, but sanity prevailed. Not only was war prevented, but a more substantive peace process between India and Pakistan was also witnessed. Unfortunately, the war hysteria orchestrated by the ultranationalist Modi government has closed all avenues for negotiations.
India is under the illusion that it has the military superiority to dismantle Pakistan. New Delhi has chosen this time to escalate matters when the world is preoccupied with other major conflicts. But it must understand that the flames of war could also cost India dearly.

A day earlier, India gave its military “operational freedom” to respond to the deadly attack in occupied Kashmir last week.
Speaking to the media hours after the development, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”
He said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region” which was completely “reckless”.
 


“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,” he said, adding: “We have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.”
Being a responsible state, he said Pakistan “openheartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation” by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.
“Unfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,” the minister stressed.
He said the “evasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India’s real motives.”
“Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,” the minister added.
Tarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.
“The international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India,” Tarar emphasised.
He reiterated the nation’s resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs.
India okays ‘operational freedom’ to military
A week after the Pahalgam attack, Modi held a closed-door meeting today with army and security chiefs, during which he told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source who was not authorised to speak to the media told AFP on Tuesday.
The government released video images of a stern-faced Modi meeting with army chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.
Also on Tuesday, India’s army said it had repeatedly traded gunfire with Pakistani troops across the Line of Control (LoC). The two neighbours have been trading fire across the LoC for five days now, with each blaming the other for provocation.
The Pakistan Army did not confirm the shooting, but state media reported on Tuesday it had shot down an Indian drone, calling it a violation of its airspace.
It did not say when the incident happened, and there was no comment from New Delhi.
India alleged the “Pakistan Army resorted to unprovoked small arms firing across the LoC” overnight from Monday to Tuesday, the fifth night in a row that fire was exchanged there.
The Indian army said its troops had “responded in a measured and effective manner to the provocation”. There were no reports of casualties.
PM Shehbaz urges UN chief to ‘counsel India’ to ‘exercise restraint’
Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres held calls with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and India’s foreign minister to express “deep concern at rising tensions”, his spokesman said on Tuesday.
The UN chief “underscored the need to avoid a confrontation that could result in tragic consequences. He offered his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
During the telephone call, the prime minister affirmed that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, while highlighting the significant sacrifices rendered by the country in the global war against terror.
While rejecting Indian accusations against Pakistan as “baseless”, the prime minister categorically rejected any attempt to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam incident and reiterated his call for a transparent and neutral investigation into the incident.
He expressed serious concerns over India’s attempts to delegitimise the Kashmiri freedom struggle by using the bogey of terrorism, as well as its widely documented state-sponsored terrorism in occupied Kashmir.
He particularly highlighted India’s weaponisation of the waters of the Indus Basin as unacceptable, while noting that water was the lifeline of 240 million people.
 
 

While underscoring that Pakistan would defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity with full force in case of any misadventure by India, the prime minister encouraged the UN chief to counsel India to “act responsibly and exercise restraint”.
He emphasised that the unresolved issue of Jammu and Kashmir remained the root cause of instability in South Asia, and urged the UN chief to play his role for its just resolution, in accordance with relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.
The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment towards fostering international peace and security as a responsible member of the international community and a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.
The UN chief appreciated Pakistan’s efforts for peace in South Asia and said that the world could not afford any escalation in the region at the crucial time.
Relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours have plummeted after India accused Pakistan of backing an attack in occupied Kashmir on April 22 in which 26 men were killed.
Islamabad has rejected the charge and both countries have since exchanged gunfire and diplomatic barbs, as well as expelled citizens and ordered the main land border crossing shut.
Last week, Modi vowed to pursue those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.
“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said on Thursday.
“We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.
The bellicose statements have prompted worries of a rapid spiral into military action, with several nations, including neighbouring China, calling for restraint and dialogue.
Freedom fighters in the Indian-occupied area have waged a battle since 1989, seeking independence or a merger with Pakistan.
Pakistan and India both claim Kashmir in full since their independence from British rule in 1947.
Indian police have issued wanted posters for three men accused of carrying out the attack — two alleged Pakistanis and an Indian — who they claim are members of the Lashkar-e-Taiba group, a UN-designated terrorist organisation.
They have announced a two million rupee ($23,500) bounty for information leading to each man’s arrest and carried out sweeping detentions seeking anyone suspected of links to the alleged killers.
The worst attack in recent years in occupied Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when a person rammed a car packed with explosives into a security forces convoy, killing 40 and wounding 35.
Indian fighter jets carried out air strikes on Pakistani territory 12 days later. The next day, the Pakistan Air Force undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.
Iran has already offered to mediate and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”.
US President Donald Trump downplayed tensions, saying on Friday the dispute will get “figured out, one way or another”.</p><small>2025-04-30 04:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/30092811b3e681f.jpg?r=092815' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907452/wind-rain-likely-to-tame-heatwave-in-country' target='_blank'><strong>Wind, rain likely to tame heatwave in country</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday predicted wind and thunderstorm along with rain and isolated hailstorm in upper and central parts of the country, including the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, from May 1 to 4, and said the current heatwave conditions are likely to subside.
The Met Office forecast a westerly wave to reach the upper parts of  the country on the evening of April 30, while moist currents are likely  to penetrate northeast Punjab from May 1.

Barrister Aqeel Malik, the minister of state for Law and Justice, told Reuters that the government was working on plans for at least three different legal options, including raising the issue at the World Bank, which is the treaty’s facilitator.
It is also considering taking action at the Permanent Court of Arbitration or at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where it could argue that India has violated the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, he said.
“Legal strategy consultations are almost complete,” Barrister Aqeel said, adding that a decision on which cases to pursue would be made “soon”, and would likely include pursuing more than one avenue.

Barrister Aqeel says issue will be taken up on multiple fronts; SCBA forms body to provide legal assistance in the matter

Indian officials did not immediately respond to a Reuters request seeking comment.
 
 

New Delhi had last week held the World Bank-mediated Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 in abeyance after an attack in the Pahalgam tourist resort in occupied Kashmir, saying the suspension would last until “Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”.
Islamabad flatly denies any involvement in the attack, and in response to New Delhi’s actions, also suspended all trade and closed its airspace to Indian airlines.
Barrister Aqeel added that a fourth diplomatic option that Islamabad was considering was to raise the issue at the United Nations Security Council.
“All the options are on the table and we are pursuing all appropriate and competent forums to approach,” he told Reuters.
“The treaty cannot be suspended unilaterally and cannot be held in abeyance, there is no provision within the treaty,” said Malik.
Government officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately because the treaty has allowed it to only build hydropower plants without significant storage or dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan.
But things could start changing in a few months and farmers, already hit by climate-change related water shortages, have raised concerns.
SCBA body to assist govt
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has constituted a committee to provide legal assistance to the federal government to help raise the issue of Indus Water Treaty of 1960 at appropriate forums.
The committee will be chaired by its president along with SCBA Secretary Salman Mansoor, Balochistan High Court Bar Association President Mir Attaullah Langove, Sindh High Court Bar Association President Barrister Sarfraz Metlo, as well as Barrister M.H. Subhani and Hafiz Ahsan Khokhar.
In a statement, the country’s apex body of lawyers said it remains steadfast in its role as a watchdog for the protection of fundamental rights, adherence to international treaties and the preservation of national dignity and sovereignty.
 
 

Beyond being a formal accord, the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 is essential to Pakistan’s very existence and prosperity.
The treaty, which was mediated by the World Bank, expressly asserts that none of its signatories can unilaterally terminate, withdraw from, or hold it in abeyance, the statement said.
Yet, India has suspended this very treaty in contravention of international laws, the statement said, adding that the association viewed the unilateral suspension of the treaty as an unnecessary move, aimed at disrupting the downstream water flow.

In an official statement issued on Tuesday, the Pakistan High Commission condemned the latest attack, which took place at approximately 5:18am on April 27.
The assailant, identified by British police as Ankit Love, reportedly hurled stones and splashed saffron paint on the outer wall of the High Commission, shattering several windows and staining the building’s nameplate. He was apprehended shortly after the incident by the Metropolitan Police.
The High Commission linked the act of vandalism to a larger, more aggressive protest that occurred days earlier on April 25, involving members of the Indian and British Indian community.

UK minister calls for calm among diaspora communities

Protesters shouted anti-Pakistan and Islamophobic slogans, and clashed with law enforcers.
 
 

“We expect that the British law enforcement agencies would prosecute Ankit, as well as the raucous protesters detained on Friday, in accordance with the relevant British laws,” the statement said.
Expressing concern over the escalating hostility, the statement from the mission reminded the UK government of its obligations under the Vienna Convention to protect diplomatic missions. It also reiterated its demand for enhanced security at Pakistani diplomatic posts across the UK.
“This is not the first incident where the High Commission of Pakistan or our Consulates in the United Kingdom have been attacked,” the statement read.
The Pakistan High Commission confirmed it is in contact with British police to obtain further details about Ankit Love, whose nationality has not yet been disclosed.
Reuters adds: Meanwhile, UK Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer has called for calm between Indian and Pakistani communities, after lawmakers voiced concerns that tensions over the Pahalgam attack in India-held Kashmir could spill into the diaspora.
“These issues have long been discussed with passion on British streets  and we call on sides, all community leaders, all involved to call for  calm at a time of tension in the region,” Hamish  Falconer told parliament.
Falconer appeared in parliament to answer an urgent question  on the situation, where lawmakers raised concerns about media reports of  ill-tempered protests outside India and Pakistan’s high commissions in London.
The British government’s long-standing position is that India and Pakistan are responsible for finding a solution to the situation in held Kashmir that takes into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people, he told parliament.

• PPP lawmaker endorses call for Imran’s participation in proposed multi-party moot
ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the right to retaliate, as he concluded his speech in the Senate on the recent tensions with India and diplomatic overtures deployed by Islamabad to contest New Delhi’s allegations in light of the Pahalgam attack.
The Senate session also witnessed a call by PPP lawmaker Syed Masroor Ahsan, who endorsed the idea floated by the PTI seeking the involvement of PTI chief Imran Khan in the multi-party conference to send a “message of unity” in the country.
The idea initially floated by PTI’s Ali Zafar was recalled by PTI’s Aon Abbas in his speech on Tuesday, in which he said PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, and PTI founder Imran Khan should participate in the moot to send a strong message.
 
 

PPP’s Masroor Ahsan, while endorsing the idea, observed that the government should show flexibility and listen to the opposition. “Both sides need to set aside egos,” he remarked. Earlier, at least three senators, Allama Nasir Abbas, Gurdeep Singh and Dost Muhammad, called for the release of Imran Khan from the Adiala jail.
However, PML-N Senator Nasir Butt said Imran Khan would have to face the law and prove his innocence to secure his freedom.
Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI chided former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for his purported silence over the Pahalgam attack and demanded that the political leadership make strong statements over the issue.
Stern response
Meanwhile, FM Ishaq Dar said Pakis­tan would pay back India in the same coin, but it would not initiate an attack.
Sharing details of Pakistan’s diplomatic overtures following the escalation in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, he said foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary have been taken on board about Pakistan’s concerns.
He said he also spoke directly to the prime minister of Qatar. Mr Dar praised China and Turkiye for expressing clear support for Pakistan in the wake of the crisis.
“I walked them through what happened — India’s psyche, its history and our concerns about what intentions it may have in light of that history,” he told the House. Mr Dar said intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.

Referring to the 2019 Pulwama attack that killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel and was blamed on a Pakistan-based militant group, the deputy prime minister noted that New Delhi had used the incident as a pretext to revoke Article 370 of its constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.
The region was subsequently absorbed into India’s union territory framework, a move Pakistan has repeatedly condemned. Ishaq Dar also said that India had been attempting to alter the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which determined the water-sharing mechanism between both countries, for the past two years, citing changing circumstances.
“I have my doubts, much like other people, that this drama was staged to suspend this treaty,” he said while referring to the Pahalgam attack. He said there was no evidence that it was a false-flag operation. “What we do say with full confidence is that Pakistan has nothing to do with this [attack].”
According to Mr Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered an independent investigation into the Pahalgam attack fully knowing that Pakistan had nothing to do with it. He also made it clear that any meddling with Pakistani waters by India will not be tolerated at any cost and will be taken as an act of war.
Meanwhile, the House unanimously passed “The Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention (Implementation) Bill, 2025” and “The National Commission for Minorities’ Rights Bill 2025 brought before it as a supplementary agenda.

While almost everyone in the economics fraternity — and a considerable number outside of it — is aware of the work, not many bother to delve into what he wrote or to contemplate what he said. (It is amusing to see folks, who have never read a word of the book, embarrass themselves by holding forth as if they were an authority on the subject.)
A major aim of Wealth of Nations was to dispel and discredit an economic theory holding sway in Europe since at least the 16th century — mercantilism. One of the basic tenets underlying mercantilist thought was that the wealth of a nation lies in the number of minerals at its disposal, especially valuable ones like gold and silver. The more the stock of mineral wealth, the greater the power and standing of a nation.
 
 

Smith took the mercantilists to task, arguing against their zero-sum thinking that produced endless conflicts in the race to get a hold of precious metals. Instead, he advocated for more trade, instead of closed markets, and argued that a nation’s real wealth did not lie in accumulating minerals.
What reminded me of Smith is the sudden love that Pakistan’s policymakers have developed for minerals, the latest in the line of recycled ideas dangled before the world as a sweet offering, and aimed at attracting much-needed greenbacks to finance our gluttonous consumption and payment obligations. This idea has actually been peddled for long but without much success. (The April 1956 issue of Pakistan Affairs, for example, carries the statement of a leading government luminary about exploiting Pakistan’s mineral wealth).
This is besides the other sweeteners we have offered to the world, like ‘the gateway to Central Asia’, ‘connectivity hub’, ‘regional transport and logistics hub’, ‘front-line state against terror’, ‘best-kept tourism secret’, ‘CPEC game changer’, etc.
Despite all the enticing offers, and whatever mineral wealth we have found and already utilised, the trajectory of GDP growth in Pakistan remains topsy-turvy, and human capital indicators have been persistently poor. This shows that the presence of mineral deposits does not in itself guarantee sustainable development or economic growth. In fact, they could well be the purveyors of trouble, as the residents of Sui discovered over time, and the residents of Waziristan have recently been finding out.

The presence of mineral deposits does not in itself guarantee sustainable development or economic growth.

Let us contemplate the question of ‘national wealth’. What should policymakers look at in terms of increasing the national wealth? We turn to Adam Smith and his book again: “The annual produce of the land and labour of any nation can be increased in its value by no other means, but by increasing either the number of productive labourers, or the productive powers of those labourers who had before been employed.”
The ‘productive power’ of labourers implies labour productivity. In fact, Smith gave productive labour so much importance that he made capital a subset of it (capital, in turn, helps propel labour specialisation). Almost 400 years before Smith, Ibn-i-Khaldun reached more or less the same conclusion regarding labour productivity and specialisation.
 
 

A final seal of approval on their thought came via Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Romer. His articles in 1986 (’Increasing returns and long-run growth’) and 1990 (’Endogenous technical change’) settled the debate over long-run growth determinants in favour of human capital as the most critical component.
So what should Pakistan’s policy be? Well, start with changing the traditional infatuation with the ‘game changer’ slogan and concentrate on what’s really important. The most critical game changer in any place is its labour force and its productivity, with other factors complementing it in the formation — and growth — of national wealth. And where do we stand when it comes to productive labour and the overall quality of human capital? The less said the better.
It’s not that minerals cannot contribute to national well-being; they can. But for that to happ­­en, there needs to be a complementary system — top-class institutions, technological prowess, quality human capital, excellent management, proper­­ty rights, an efficient legal system, etc — to maximise the potential of mineral wealth. Pakistan, unfortunately, has none of these attributes.
What does all this leave us with? Unless there is some drastic change in variables such as economic management and the quality of human capital, all talk of the country’s fabulous mineral wealth will not help it achieve sustainable growth or show any marked improvement in development indicators.
 
 

At best, given our experience and the present circumstances, the flow of foreign exchange from selling minerals would cater well to our consumption-based growth model and create partial relief in terms of our foreign payment obligations (this assumption holds only if we don’t keep on piling up more foreign debt).
Let me take the reader back to the 16th-century Spanish conquistadors who found a much-sought-after mineral — silver — in the Potosi mines of Bolivia. Its abundance led to Potosi being called the ‘Treasury of the World’. Suddenly, the Spanish empire found itself less pressed by the perennially pressing fiscal demands as huge quantities of silver started flooding its cities, making it easier to print loads of silver coins and help Spain’s colonial expansion. (It was only gradually that they found out that an exponential rise in money supply gives rise to exponential inflation).
What of the residents? Except for wages — which barely helped them survive — it brought misery, forced labour, high mortality rates and environmental pollution. In our times, Africa and its fabulous mineral wealth is perhaps the nearest example of Potosi-type expropriation (remember Leonardo di Caprio’s Blood Diamond, or residents slugging it out in cobalt mines?).
The lesson is that mineral wealth on its own is nothing without complementarities such as quality labour and institutions. So stop dangling it as a miracle cure to our economic ills.

ISLAMABAD: Military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tues­day accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
Lt Gen Chaudhry was sp­e­aking at a press conference convened to show “how India is executing” terrorism inside Pakistan and said terrorism was the “basic thing” in the ongoing tense phase of ties bet­ween the neighbours. Pak­is­tan and India downgra­d­ed ties after tensions spi­ked in light of the April 22 att­ack in Pahalgam, in which 26 people were killed.
“It has been seven days since the Pahalgam att­ack, yet not a single shred of evidence has been provided to substantiate the baseless allegations levelled against Pakistan,” Gen Chaudhry said.
Based on intelligence ava­ilable with the Pakis­tani security agencies, he claimed India had activa­ted its terror networks to carry out attacks inside Pakistan.

“…they tasked all their assets, terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Kha­w­arij (the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan) and the ind­e­pen­dent terrorist cell like one presented today to inc­r­ease their activity,” he said.
He specifically cited the killing of 54 TTP fighters — described as the largest ever in a single incident — during a recent cross-border attack attempt from Afg­hanistan. He said the attack by the TTP’s largest formation, or “Tashkeel”, was “sponsored, facilita­ted, and abetted by India”.
India’s terror network
Gen Chaudhry provided details of Abdul Majeed, a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India, who was arrested last Fri­day (April 25) and linked to one of the terror networks.
“We will present to you how India has been found to operate a terror network inside Pakistan in which explosives, IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and other materials are being provided to terrorists to target not only military but also innocent civilians,” he said. He added that the evidence could be examined by any independent agency.
According to Gen Chaudhry, Majeed was apprehended from a bus terminal in Jhelum, where he was planning to carry out an attack. “An IED, two mobile phones, and Rs70,000 were recovered from him,” he said.

Investigations revealed that the network he was a part of included four Ind­ian military personnel in addition to Majeed. These Indian operatives were part of Indian military intelligence.
Majeed was allegedly recruited by Major Sandeep, an officer stationed in India-occupied Kashmir. His handler was identified as Subedar Sukvinder, a junior commissioned officer (JCO) of the Indian Army. Major Sandeep and Subedar Sukvinder were said to have tasked and guided Majeed. Other network members included Havildar Amit, also known as Adil Aman, and an unidentified Indian soldier.
Intercepted conversations between Majeed and his handlers were also played during the briefing and a timeline of Majeed’s activities and the funds he received was also shared. Majeed is accused of involvement in four sabotage attempts, including a botched one.
The first IED was delivered to Majeed last September in Parnala, Bhimber district. He used it to attack a military vehicle on Oct 13 in Pir Kanthi, Bagh district, injuring three Pakistan Army soldiers. He received Rs180,000 for the attack.
The second IED was delivered on Nov 22 near Head Marala. The drone used in the operation crashed, and its wreckage was retrieved by Majeed. He later used the device to attack a military vehicle in Jalalpur Jattan, resulting in four “casualties.” For this, he received Rs656,000.
On March 18, Majeed planned a third IED attack near Kotli. He became cautious after observing troop movements in the area. The following day, local schoolchildren discovered and reported a suspicious package. Two IEDs were recovered from the site.
Following the recovery, Indian media falsely claimed that five bombs had been discovered in occupied Kashmir, which Gen Chaudhry dismissed as “blatant propaganda.” The fourth IED was delivered near Nadala on April 22. Majeed was instructed to target a bus station in Barnala or Bhimber, but he instead suggested Jhelum due to higher passenger traffic.
“While he was in Jhelum to do this nefarious act of terrorism, he was apprehended by law enforcement agencies,” Gen Chaudhry said. “What’s this happening? And they are serving officers, serving JCOs, serving NCOs. This is what you call state-sponsored cross-border terrorism,” he added.
‘Credible evidence’
In a late-night statement, Federal Minister for Information Atta Tarar warned that India intended to launch military action against Pakistan.
Using the baseless allegations levelled in the wake of the Pahalgam attack as a justification, India could try to launch an incursion within the next 24-36 hours, he said.
The international community should realise that India would solely be responsibility for any destruction in the case of a conflict, he said.
 


Separately, Pakistan Mission to the United Nations on Tuesday said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the Jaffar Express attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”, according to a press release.
As per the statement, Pakistan possessed “credible evidence establishing that the attack on the Jaffar Express passenger train — in which at least 30 Pakistani nationals were slain and dozens taken hostage — was externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”.

For example, on Monday, New Delhi banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels, including portals belonging to major networks such as Dawn News, ARY News, Geo News, etc. Accounts belonging to freelance journalists and cricket commentators have also been blocked. New Delhi has taken this senseless step because it believes that the channels were spreading “provocative and communally sensitive content”.
 
 

Considering the bellicose and inflammatory anti-Pakistan and anti-Muslim content being produced by many mainstream Indian channels, this justification is laughable. Other steps taken by New Delhi include blocking certain Pakistani social media handles, as well as general boycotts of Pakistani culture and sports.
Sadly, it seems that the Indian state, along with parts of its media and civil society, are creating an atmosphere for war. That would explain why the world’s self-proclaimed ‘biggest democracy’ would feel threatened by Pakistani media outlets offering alternative viewpoints. While no doubt there are jingoistic voices on this side of the border too, the sheer size and reach of the Indian media means that war hysteria can very easily grip large segments of the Indian public.
 
 

A week after the Pahalgam tragedy, India has yet to provide conclusive proof linking Pakistan to the attack. Perhaps that is why it is keen to silence Pakistani voices, so that the Indian people are not exposed to alternative viewpoints and are prevented from questioning their government about what really happened in the scenic tourist spot in held Kashmir.
Moreover, Kashmiris in India are facing revenge attacks, with around 2,000 rounded up, while the Pahalgam episode is being used to fan hatred against India’s Muslim citizens. Instead of promoting such madness, the Indian state and media would do well to adopt a more rational approach, and stop spreading anti-Pakistan and anti-Muslim hatred.

He noted that it was also important to define “public interest” when a  judge’s reputation is frequently debated within legal circles and at  different bars, labelling such discussions as being in the public  interest.
Justice Hassan made these remarks while pointing toward senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, who commenced formal arguments on behalf of five judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) before the constitutional bench.
The five-judge bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, was hearing a set of petitions against inter-se seniority of five sitting judges of the IHC namely Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz.
In their joint petition, the IHC judges urged the SC to not treat the three recently transferred judges as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.

Munir A. Malik says temporary transfers are in the very spirit of federalism

The observation by Justice Hassan came when the senior counsel, Mr Malik, contended what constituted the best public interest behind judges’ transfer from one high court to another had to be established. Any transfer done under Article 200 is a temporary in nature in the spirit of federalism, the counsel argued.
Justice Hassan, however, asked the senior counsel to define what exactly should be the period for a judge to serve after his transfer to a high court from another on a temporary basis. The counsel replied that based on the constitutional history of the country, the upper limit of transfer of the judge should be two years.
 
 

Justice Mazhar intervened to say that the other way round could be transfer for an unlimited period if a judge concedes to be transferred since the constitution does not provide any limit or period for the transferred judges to serve.
The counsel said that in case a high court has a backlog of cases of a particular nature, such as criminal cases, due to a dearth of judges having expertise in that subject, the transfer period of a judge should commensurate with the backlog of the cases.
About the term “public interest” in the judicial context, the lawyer said that the public interest should mean better administration of justice, with the underlying purpose of ensuring access to justice. Also, he said, any consideration of the public interest should be taken into account before initiating the process of transferring a judge from one high court to another.
At this, Justice Salahuddin Pan­whar commented that the counsel see­med not disputing the transfer but the seniority of judges due to the transfer.
Justice Mazhar highlighted that even the temporary transfer could affect the seniority of judges. He elaborated that if a judge opted for transfer, he would lose his seniority and become junior to his juniors. The key question of judges’ seniority would remain intact, he noted.
‘JCP power can’t be usurped’
The counsel argued that Article 200 must be read with Article 2A that enshrines the independence of the judiciary and could not be interpreted in a way to collide with Article 175(A), which relates to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) on judges’ appointment.
 
 

Under the garb of exercising Article 200, the counsel emphasised, the president could not usurp the JCP powers on judges’ appointment. All the members of the 17-body JCP were at a par with each other and enjoy the constitutional backing to nominate candidates for their appointment as judges of the superior courts.
This power to nominate “for the appointment of judges” had not been conferred to the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) and chief justice of the two relevant high courts, according to the counsel. He argued “such transfers” were in fact for a temporary period and were in the very spirit of the federalism.
The constitution contemplates five different high courts and the JCP composition varies for each high court while the CJP become only a paterfamilias (head of the institution), he said, adding that the autonomous and independent character of the high court would be compromised otherwise.
 
 

Justice Mazhar, however, reminded him that the CJP was no more “paterfamilias” in the appointment procedure as judges were elevated with a majority vote where every member has a vote of his own.
The counsel argued that a lawyer practising in a particular province would always be considered for the appointment in the particular high court, otherwise the provincial bar would have no say in the meetings of such JCPs.
He was of the opinion the permanent vacancies in the Sindh High Court could not be filled by judges of the Islamabad High Court, he said. The counsel would continue his arguments on Wednesday.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), three terrorists were killed during an operation near Turbat in Kech district. The operation was launched based on intelligence about the presence of militants in the area.
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively eng­a­ged the khawarij location, as a res­ult of which, three terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in a sta­tement, adding that a heavy exc­h­ange of fire took place between sec­urity forces and armed terrorists.
Weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, who the ISPR said were involved in numerous attacks against security forces and the killing of civilians.

PM praises security forces, terms terrorists enemies of peace

“A sanitisation operation was conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area as the security forces of Pakistan are det­e­rmined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country,” it said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for the successful operation in Kech. In a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, he lauded the professionalism and bravery displayed by the troops and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to eradicating terrorism.
The terrorists are enemies of peace in Balochistan and oppon­e­nts of the province’s prosperity, he said, adding that the governm­ent would continue the journey of progress and development. The prime minister also reiterated that the entire nation stands by the security forces in defence of the motherland.
Ziarat IBO
In a separate incident, security forces killed seven   terrorists during an operation conducted on intelligence reports in the Choteer area of Ziarat district.
 
 

Officials said the targeted operation took place between the Chot­eer and Sanjavi areas between Mon­day night and early Tuesday. Armed militants hiding in the area opened fire on the security forces, who retaliated after taking positions.
“Heavy exchange of fire continued for two hours, during which hand grenades were also used by the militants,” an official said, adding that seven bodies were recovered from the area once the firing ceased.
Ziarat Deputy Commissioner Zakaullah Durrani confirmed the deaths and said the bodies were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, Ziarat, by Levies personnel.
He said residents had earlier blocked the Sanjavi-Ziarat road in protest against the presence of militants in the area, suspending all traffic. They initially refused to reopen the road despite negotiations by the assistant commissioner.
However, following talks led by Deputy Commissioner Durrani, the protesters agreed to end their blockade and traffic was restored in the afternoon.

• Marco Rubio expected to speak to Indian, Pakistani counterparts today
• Airports operating as usual, authorities say
NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Nar­endra Modi has given his military “operational freedom” to respond to a deadly attack in India-held Kashmir last week, which New Delhi has tri­ed to pin on Pakistan, wit­hout offering any evide­nce to support the claim.
A full week after the Pahalgam attack, which claimed the lives of over two dozen tourists, Modi held a closed-door meeting with the heads of the three armed services, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.
During the meeting, he told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source told AFP.
No further details have been released from the meeting, which was held at the Indian PM’s resident on Tuesday.
It comes a day after Defence Minister Kha­waja Asif warned of a possible Indian incursion, saying that the next few days were crucial and Pakistan was prepared for any eventuality.
Last week, Modi had vowed to pursue those who carried out the attack, as well as those who had supported it.
“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said on Thursday. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.
 
 

Following the high-level meeting, the Indian media began speculating about a “possible response”.
The bellicose statem­e­nts have prompted worr­ies of a rapid spiral into mil­itary action, with several nations, including ne­i­ghbouring China, cal­l­ing for restraint and dialogue.
Late on Tuesday night, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan “as early as today or tomorrow”.
She said the US was reaching out to both parties regarding the Kashmir issue, and is expected to tell both sides not to escalate things any further.
Ms Bruce said that Rubio was also encouraging leaders and foreign ministers from other nations to reach out over the issue.
Earlier, UN Secr­e­­tary-General Antonio Gu­t­erres held calls Tues­day with Pakistan’s prime minister and India’s foreign minister to express “deep concern at rising tensions”, his spokesman said.
The United Nations chief “underscored the need to avoid a confrontation that could result in tragic consequences. He offered his good offices to support de-escalation efforts,” spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
 
 

According to the PM Office in Islamabad, during their telephone call, PM Shehbaz rejected the Indian accusations as bas­e­less and categorica­lly rejected any attempt to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam incident.
He reiterated his call for a transparent and neutral investigation into the incident, and expre­ssed serious concerns over India’s attempts to delegitimise the Kashmiri freedom struggle by using the bogey of “terrorism”, as well as its widely documented state-sponsored terrorism in the occupied territory.
He also pointed to India’s weaponisation of the waters of the Indus Basin as being unacceptable as it was the lifeline of around 240 million people.
No airport closures
Amid fears of airspace closures due to rising tensions with India, rumours of a possible closure of airports began circulating on social media on Tuesday night.
However, authorities confirmed that this was not true, and both domestic and international flight operations continued as usual.
For example, a flight from Islamabad to Doha departed on Wednesday at around 12.40am.
 
 

According to flight information at Islamabad International Airport (IIAP), another flight arrived from Sharjah at 11:43pm on Tuesday night.
A senior official at IIAP told Dawn the airport was fully functional for both domestic and international flights, while an official from Lahore airport also confirmed that flight operations were running smoothly.

Police are searching for one suspected perpetrator, the news agency TT reported.
Police earlier said they had received calls from members of the public who heard gunshots in the city centre, and that emergency services had rushed to the scene.
“Three people are confirmed dead after a shooting […] The police are investigating the incident as a homicide,” investigators said in a statement.
Witnesses told broadcaster SVT they had heard five shots and had seen people in the area running to take cover.
Ten people were killed in February in the Swedish city of Orebro in the country’s deadliest ever mass shooting, in which a 35-year-old unemployed loner opened fire on students and teachers at an adult education centre.
Sweden has suffered from a wave of gang-related violence for more than a decade that has included an epidemic of gun violence.

The Jaffar Express train was hijacked on March 11 when Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages. Security forces launched a two-day operation, concluding on March 12. Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that all 33 terrorists were neutralised, but no hostages were harmed in the final rescue phase.
During the launch of the “Victims of Terrorism Association Network” by the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism at the UN headquarters in New York, Jawad Ajmal, a counsellor at the Pakistan Mission, expressed concern at the loss of tourist lives int he recent Pahalgam attack, and extended “heartfelt condolences to the near ones of the deceased and wish the injured a speedy recovery.”
According to the press release, Ajmal said that Pakistan possessed “credible evidence establishing that the attack on the Jaffar Express passenger train — in which at least 30 innocent Pakistani nationals were killed and dozens taken hostage — was externally sponsored by its regional adversaries.”
He noted that Pakistan joined fellow UN Security Council members in condemning the attack.
The counsellor further said that Pakistan had been one of the worst victims of terrorism for over two decades. With the loss of more than 80,000 lives and thousands more injured, Pakistan remains inspired by the resilience and strength of its nation.
“We pay tribute to the families of the martyrs from our law enforcement agencies and armed forces, who have made countless sacrifices to defend our motherland,” he added.
“The international community had a responsibility to support survivors of brutal terrorist attacks and the families of victims whose lives were permanently altered by such tragedies.”
He underscored the need for collective action to prevent future attacks, calling for holding terrorists and their handlers accountable and adopting a “uniform, victim-centric approach”.
“If we are to chart a way forward for victims, we must look beyond narrow political interests and geopolitical agendas. We must examine why, despite global strategies, terrorism threats continue to proliferate and give rise to an ever-increasing number of victims,” he stated.
“Pakistan unequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including right-wing extremism, Islamophobia, racially and ethnically motivated terrorism, and, above all, state-sponsored terrorism.”
Ajmal stressed that the world must address the root causes of terrorism and the conditions conducive to its spread. He also emphasised the importance of distinguishing terrorism from legitimate struggles for self-determination.
The counsellor highlighted the “need to address state-sponsored terrorism and underscored the necessity of reaching a consensual definition of terrorism that reflects emerging trends”.
“He added that challenges arising from the use of new tools — such as social media and the dark web — to deepen divisions and incite violence must also be combated,” the press release read.
He further called for efforts to counter disinformation campaigns designed to spread hate speech, xenophobia, and Islamophobia.
Ajmal also highlighted that the international community owes a moral and legal obligation to victims of terrorism to take effective, impartial steps to suppress terrorism wherever it exists and in whatever form.
“The more terrorism there is, the more victims there will be,” he noted.
Last month, the Foreign Office said that the perpetrators of the attack on the Jaffar Express remained in touch with their handlers in Afghanistan throughout the incident.
During the briefing, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan was asked whether Pakistan had shifted its stance when it said that Afghanistan, and not India, was behind the terrorist attacks on Pakistan. He clarified that there was “no shift” in policy. “The facts have not changed. India is involved in sponsoring terrorism against Pakistan. What I was referring to was, in this particular incident, we have evidence of calls being traced to Afghanistan. This is what I said,” he said.
A day later, the DG ISPR called India the “main sponsor” of terrorism in Balochistan.
Lt Gen Chaudhry, who maintained that India was the main sponsor of terrorism in Balochistan, said the terrorists had used Afghan and foreign weapons in the recent incident and previous attacks. “We must understand that in this terrorist incident in Balochistan, and others before, the main sponsor is your eastern neighbour [India].”</p><small>2025-04-29 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2922124738d9244.jpg?r=221336' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907383/suspects-involved-in-ppp-uc-chairmans-killing-in-orangi-arrested-police' target='_blank'><strong>Suspects involved in PPP UC chairman’s killing in Orangi arrested: police</strong></a><br><p>Two suspects allegedly involved in the recent killing of the PPP UC chairman in Karachi’s Orangi Town have been arrested, police said on Tuesday.
PPP Union Council Chairman, Amir Bhashani, was killed on April 17 by armed motorcyclists in a suspected targeted attack near Bismillah Chowk in Orangi Town. The case was registered under terror and murder charges by the Pakistan Bazaar police.
In response, the city council last week demanded that the provincial police and law enforcement agencies promptly arrest the killers of Bhashani and bring them to justice.
According to a statement issued by Karachi District West Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Tariq Illahi Mastoi, “A police team led by SP Manghopir initiated an investigation on different aspects and conducted technical and human intelligence-based action, apprehending two suspects, namely and recovering two pistols.”
During the initial probe, it was transpired that one of the suspects was directly involved in the killing, while another was an informer who had informed his accomplices about the presence of the UC chairman at his office, the statement said.
The planning to carry out the killing was done a week before the murder based on “land and financial matters”, the statement said.
Apart from the prime suspect, two other suspects were also found to be involved in the murder planning, it said.
So far, the investigation has revealed who the real mastermind of the murder is, it added.
According to the statement, the suspects told the interrogators that the prime suspect, along with two accomplices, went to the camp UC chairman’s office in a car on the day of the murder.
It said that the accomplices stepped out of the vehicle and stayed at a nearby restaurant, waiting for two hired assassins while the prime suspect remained seated in the car.
After the arrival of the assassins, the accomplices, with the help of the prime suspect, killed Bhashani, the statement said.
Later on, the suspects left in their car while hired assassins fled on their motorcycle, it added.
While the two suspects were under police custody, concerted efforts were underway to arrest the four remaining suspects in the case, SSP Mastoi said in the statement.</p><small>2025-04-29 18:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2921592732d14b3.jpg?r=215956' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907384/1-killed-3-injured-in-gunfight-between-terrorists-peace-committee-in-kps-lakki-marwat-police' target='_blank'><strong>1 killed, 3 injured in gunfight between terrorists, peace committee in KP’s Lakki Marwat: police</strong></a><br><p>The killing of an elderly man and the injuring of his two relatives and a neighbour by terrorists sparked a fierce gun battle between the assailants and members of a local peace committee in the Begukhel area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district late Monday night, according to police.
The incident reflects the escalating militant presence in Lakki Marwat, where attacks have become more frequent in recent months despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.
“The incident happened last night in the Begukhel village. Members of the peace committee living there had deployed guards around the village for protection when militants decided to attack them. They used RPGs and other heavy artillery to attack, and in retaliation to the attack, the peace committee members also opened fire to resist.
“During the exchange of fire, one local lost his life while two others sustained injuries. The militants fled from the scene following the exchange. We have registered an FIR (first information report) against unknown assailants,” Shahid Marwat, spokesperson for Lakki Martwat Police, told Dawn.com.
A police handout said that the terrorists attacked the villagers near their house, killing Gul Badshah, 65 and injuring his brother Khan Badshah, 56, his son Naseer Khan, 25, and neighbour Munawar Khan, 58.
The attack sparked a fierce gunfight between the armed members of the peace committee and terrorists, which continued for one hour, the handout said.
Per the handout, an injured Naseer told police that the family had heard gunshots at midnight, which compelled them to step out of their houses.
“As soon as we stepped outside, armed men opened fire on us with light and heavy weapons from the eastern side,” he said, according to the handout.
He said that he, his father, uncle and another relative were injured in the attack.
The handout said that later, Naseer’s father succumbed to injuries.
“Members of the peace committee retaliated to the attack and an exchange of fire continued for nearly an hour, he was quoted as saying in the handout.
When the fire exchange stopped, the members of the peace committee took the dead and wounded to the hospital.
The complainant told police that around three dozen terrorists had come to the village to attack the members of the peace committee who used to guard the area at night.
The assailants, he said, also used rocket and grenade launchers, as a result of which the heaps of harvested wheat caught fire and were destroyed.
The complainant added that the main gate of the house was also damaged in the attack.
Police said they were investigating the incident after registering a case against unknown assailants under Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (premeditated murder), 324 (attempt to murder), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage etc.) of the Pakistan Penal Code, Section 5 of the Explosive Substance Act and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
Local elders reaffirmed on Sunday that residents would fight anti-peace elements side by side with police so as to effectively eradicate the menace of terrorism from the Lakki Marwat district.
They showed resolve during a meeting with district police officer Mohammad Jawad Ishaq held at Abbasa police post in Kurrum Par region.
The elders and police officials discussed matters pertaining to law and order and police actions against miscreants and criminal’ gangs.
Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. While security operations brought a period of relative calm, militant activity has resurged in recent years, straining local peace efforts and heightening fears of renewed instability.</p><small>2025-04-29 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2917495265b92f6.jpg?r=214410' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907368/pakistan-navy-employee-killed-another-injured-in-karachi-accident-involving-10-wheeler-police' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Navy employee killed, another injured in Karachi accident involving 10-wheeler: police</strong></a><br><p>An employee of the Pakistan Navy was killed while another was injured in Karachi’s Baldia on Tuesday after a 10-wheeler trailer hit them, police said.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Speaking to Dawn.com today, Keamari Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Captain (retired) Faizan Ali said, “An employee of the Navy died in the accident, while another was injured when a 10-wheeler truck hit them.”
He added that while the driver of the vehicle managed to flee the site of the incident, the vehicle had been taken under police custody.
SSP Ali said that a first information report (FIR) will be registered when a complainant comes to the police, otherwise, “we will register it on behalf of the state through a police officer.”
Another official, Moachko Police’s Asad Zaid, said 35-year-old Ashfaq Ali and 34-year-old Sohail Ahmed were employees of the Pakistan Navy.
“They were riding a motorcycle when a 10-wheeler trailer hit them in Rais Goth near Jamia Farooqia seminary,” the official said. “They suffered critical injuries and were moved to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, where the doctors pronounced Ashfaq dead.”
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Edhi Foundation said that a 25-year-old woman died when a van overturned off the Superhighway near Quetta Darbar Hotel today. “The body was moved to a private hospital,” the statement said.
In pursuance of the continued efforts of the provincial government to control the menace of accidents in Karachi, the city administration on Thursday extended the complete ban imposed on heavy vehicles in the city during daytime for another two months.
A total of nine dumpers and water tankers were set on fire by angry mobs earlier this month near the main road leading to 4-K Chowrangi after a heavy vehicle hit a bike rider, injuring him in the North Karachi area.
An elderly man was killed earlier this month after being run over by a water tanker, police and rescue officials said.</p><small>2025-04-29 16:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/29183746d859c7f.png?r=194941' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Not a shred of evidence provided by India for baseless allegations against Pakistan: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry,  on Tuesday said that India hadn’t provided a “shred of evidence for its baseless allegations” against Pakistan concerning the Pahalgam attack, adding that India was involved in “undertaking cross-border terrorism inside Pakistan.”
Relations between Pakistan and India have plummeted to their lowest level in years following the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 men, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks on civilians in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
 




Says India has not provided evidence for “baseless allegations” against Pakistan
Says India has been found operating a terror network inside Pakistan targeting not only military but also innocent civilians
Says forensic analysis of retrieved materials shows “irrefutable evidence” of Indian terrorism


Following the incident, New Delhi, without providing any evidence, implied Pakistan backed the attackers — an allegation that Islamabad has strongly denied. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
Lt Gen Chaudhry said that seven days had passed since the Pahalgam incident but, so far, India had not provided a “shred of evidence” for its “baseless allegations” against Pakistan.
“We will present to you how India has been found to operate a terror network inside Pakistan in which explosives, IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and other materials are being provided to terrorists to target not only military but also innocent civilians,” he said.

The army’s spokesperson said the evidence he was presenting was just “one small part” of India’s “state-sponsored terrorism”.
“Four days ago, on April 25, an Indian-trained and sponsored terrorist, who was a Pakistani citizen, was arrested near the Jhelum bus stand from whom one IED, two mobile phones, and Rs70,000 were recovered,” he said, adding that further investigation yielded an Indian-origin drone from his house along with Rs1 million in cash.
The DG ISPR said that a forensic analysis of the retrieved materials showed “irrefutable” evidence that could be examined by any credible independent agency.
“The handler was a junior commissioned officer (JCO) of the Indian army, Subedar Sukvinder,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “The Indian officer had sent an IED and instructed the terrorist to collect it from a point.
“The evidence I’m putting forth before you [shows] how India is carrying out terrorism in Pakistan [through] serving officers and JCOs of the Indian army.”
He said further forensic analysis showed the involvement of four Indian army officials in the situation: Major Sandeep Verma alias Sameer, the main handler and a commanding officer of the Indian army in occupied Kashmir; Subedar Sukvinder alias Sikander; Havildar Amit alias Adil Aman: and another Indian soldier.
He said that Major Sandeep had hired terrorist Abdul Majeed and aired an alleged audio exchange between the two discussing the mode of payment.
“Just see, just hear what is being said by an Indian serving major. He is saying that ‘we conduct terrorism from Balochistan to Lahore’; He is telling the details of entry and how terror financing is carried out,” Chaudhry added.
The DG ISPR said the audio clip was “what you call irrefutable evidence of state-sponsored terrorism” collected from just one terrorist cell that the military was putting forth in today’s press conference.
Chaudhry said the Indian-trained terrorist had carried out four acts of militancy through IED attacks and that the IEDs were transported through drones.
He added that it was not the Indian intelligence agency RAW but the Indian army that was doing such activities of state-sponsored terrorism.
“The terrorist’s fourth attack took place after the Pahalgam incident,” he said, adding that a location near Nadala was shared with Majeed to retrieve the IED on April 22 and carry out the attack the next day at a populated bus stand.“
The DG ISPR said the terrorist was apprehended on April 25.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
This, he said, was manifested two nights back when security forces killed 54 terrorists attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district.
DG ISPR said the total number of terrorists killed was 71 so far after 17 more were taken out later.
Earlier today, the Pakistan Army shot down an Indian quadcopter drone near the Line of Control (LoC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, state media reported. The development came as Indian and Pakistani soldiers reportedly traded fire along the Line of Control for a fifth straight night, after four years of relative calm.
Separately, speaking about the situation at the border, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that “everything is being monitored,: stating that if an incursion were to take place, then Pakistan would “respond accordingly”.
Responding to a question about whether the rise in tension had something to do with the elections in India, the interior minister said that the Indian government had “many motives”.
Indian links in Jaffer Express attack
Earlier today, the Pakistan Mission to the United Nations said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the Jaffer Express attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”, according to a press release issued today.
The Jaffar Express train was hijacked on March 11 when Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages.
Security forces launched a two-day operation, concluding on March 12. DG Chaudhry had said that all 33 terrorists were neutralised, but no hostages were harmed in the final rescue phase.</p><small>2025-04-29 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/29202350a4ffad2.jpg?r=202353' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907375/saudi-authority-dismisses-baseless-claims-that-pakistani-haj-pilgrims-payments-transferred-to-wrong-bank-account-report' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi authority dismisses ‘baseless’ claims that Pakistani Haj pilgrims’ payments transferred to wrong bank account: report</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Haj and Umrah has refuted claims that funds from thousands of Pakistani Haj pilgrims were mistakenly sent to the wrong bank account, emphasising that the Kingdom’s digital Haj platform maintains the “utmost levels of transparency,” Arab News Pakistan reported on Tuesday.
The clarification followed reports from [multiple] Pakistani media outlets last week, which claimed that over 67,000 Pakistani pilgrims might experience delays in their Haj travel due to millions of Saudi Riyals intended for their expenses being erroneously transferred to an incorrect bank account.
“Recent claims in some Pakistani media outlets about ‘Haj funds being sent to the wrong Saudi account’ are baseless and stem from a misunderstanding of the Haj account management system and the ministry’s official electronic Haj platform, which ensures the highest standards of transparency and accuracy,” Arab News Pakistan quoted an official of the Saudi Ministry of Haj and Umrah as saying.
According to the report, the official said that while Pakistan’s religious affairs ministry had finalised all contracts for its pilgrims without significant issues, several Pakistani private firms missed the deadline to secure their pilgrims’ contracts.
He told the outlet that this recurring issue from previous years has led to incomplete entry processes, preventing these pilgrims from participating in Haj in the Kingdom.
Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reprimanded officials from the religious affairs ministry for their alleged negligence that jeopardised the departure of 67,000 potential Pakistani pilgrims this year, assuring that he would take up the matter with the Saudi government to resolve the issue.
Local media had reported that private Haj operators failed to meet the Kingdom’s requirements, depriving the 67,000 intending pilgrims of performing Haj this year.
However, private Haj operators blamed the Saudi government for the delay, claiming they had sent the payments before the deadline, but the Saudi software system crashed.
The final date for issuing visas was April 18, as per the Saudi deadline, leaving the fate of the 67,000 pilgrims uncertain.
Meanwhile, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported that Pakistan’s Haj 2025 operations officially began on Tuesday morning, with the departure of the first Haj flight from Islamabad to Madinah.
“The inaugural flight, PK-713, took off at 5:21 AM, carrying 427 pilgrims who will perform the sacred journey in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” the report said.
In 2025, Pakistan’s Haj quota was set at 179,210, with half of the quota meant to be managed by private Haj operators. However, only 23,000 people were able to go under private operators.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-04-29 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2918030840d2df2.jpg?r=185433' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907369/pakistan-set-to-become-the-next-major-tech-destination-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan set to become the next major tech destination: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to becoming the next major tech destination in light of $700 million pledged in foreign investment in the IT sector at the Digital Foreign Direct Investment (DFDI) conference in Islamabad.
Delegates from around 45 countries arrived in Islamabad to participate in the DFDI conference,  the first-ever DFDI conference held in Pakistan.
Over 75 foreign investors and CEOs of more than 50 global companies attended the event. The digital sector has long been recognised as a key segment for foreign direct investment (FDI), yet Pakistan has struggled to attract substantial digital FDI.
Addressing the DFDI conference today, PM Shehbaz hailed investment in the IT sector, saying: “Pakistan is not waiting for the future but shaping it.”
He called on international stakeholders to continue supporting Pakistan as it was ready to lead the global digital economy.
The premier highlighted the government’s initiatives in the IT sector including the launch of federal and provincial IT parks, incubation centres, and a large-scale research and development (R&D) ecosystem.
 
 

He noted that Pakistan’s youth, aged between 15-30, constitute 60 per cent of the population, and announced that Huawei will train 200,000 boys and girls through a joint skill development programme in collaboration with the government.
“[The youth] are the architects of our digital future”, he said.
PM Shehbaz said that in March Pakistan received a record-breaking $4.1 billion in foreign remittances, signalling growing trust in the country’s digital potential.
“We’re not just building a digital economy — we’re creating a digital Pakistan. From transforming agriculture through AI to expanding exports with smart technology, this is the moment for global investors to join us,” the premier said.
He invited the world to invest, guide and grow with Pakistan.
“Together, we will make Pakistan a leading light in the digital era.”
Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja also spoke at the conference, highlighting Pakistan’s exponential growth in IT export.
“Pakistan’s youth — over 100 million strong — is our greatest digital asset. Under the prime minister’s direct supervision, we have trained over 300,000 young professionals in IT skills this year alone.”
She also spoke about Pakistan’s evolving regulatory landscape and called for the development of robust digital infrastructure.
CEO of Pakistan Software Export Board Abu Bakar announced that IT exports were set to exceed $4b this year, calling it a testament to public-private collaboration and national talent.
Secretary-General of the Digital Cooperation Organisation Deemah AlYahya, praised Pakistan’s ambition and innovation.
“This is a historic moment where ambition, innovation, and opportunity converge. Digital transformation is now a revolution, not a trend and with 142 million broadband subscribers, 65pc smartphone penetration, and IT exports poised to exceed $4b, the country is primed for digital acceleration.”</p><small>2025-04-29 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/29181108edd9e8b.png?r=193221' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907370/security-forces-kill-3-terrorists-in-turbat-operation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 3 terrorists in Turbat operation: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Three terrorists were killed after security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the general area of Turbat town in Balochistan’s Kech district, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Tuesday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the forces conducted an IBO,  effectively engaging with the terrorists’ location.
The statement said that “after an intense exchange of fire, three terrorists were successfully neutralised”.
It said that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists who were involved in multiple activities against the law enforcement agencies and the innocent civilians in the area.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to neutralise any other terrorists present in the area,” ISPR said, adding that the forces remain determined “to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan”.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-04-29 14:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/29173812adbb6cb.jpg?r=173820' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907364/7-bullet-ridden-bodies-recovered-from-balochistans-ziarat-says-official' target='_blank'><strong>7 bullet-ridden bodies recovered from Balochistan’s Ziarat, says official</strong></a><br><p>Seven bullets-ridden bodies were found on Tuesday in Balochistan’s Ziarat district, officials said.
Ziarat Deputy Commissioner Ziarat Zakiullah told Dawn.com, “On Tuesday morning, the district administration received information about seven bodies being dumped at Gonja Tangi, ​​Ziarat, after which the assistant commissioner was sent to the scene along with ambulances.”
However, at Chautir, near the site of the incident, residents had blocked the highway in protest.
“They said that those who were killed neither belonged to Chautir or Ziarat, nor had they been seen in the area before, and that they were terrorists,” DC Zakiullah said.
The residents expressed their worry that based on this pretence, an operation would be launched in the area, DC Zakiullah said.
“After successful negotiations with residents of the area, the district administration took custody of the bodies, which were later handed over to the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ)  Ziarat,” the DC said.
He added that the counterterrorism department (CTD) and local police in Ziarat had been contacted as well.
“They said they were also unaware about the incident,” DC Zakiullah said.
 
 

He added that after being shifted to DHQ, the bodies could not be identified because all those killed appeared to be non-locals, who were shifted to Quetta for further necessary action.

Relations between Pakistan and India have plummeted to their lowest level in years following an April 22 attack in the Indian-occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, mostly tourists.  Following the incident, New Delhi, without providing any evidence, implied Pakistan backed the attackers — an allegation that Islamabad has strongly denied. The world has been urging the two nuclear-armed neighbours to “exercise restraint” amid rising tensions.
Speaking during a press conference, a video of which was shared on the X account of The Press Trust of India, the minister confirmed the incident, saying, “A mob lynching was reported, however, the identity of the victim could not be ascertained. He was rooting for Pakistan during a local cricket match while shouting ‘Pakistan Zindabad’,” he said.
The minister added that it was not yet known whether the victim was from Karnataka or came from elsewhere, adding that as soon as people in the crowd saw him rooting for Pakistan during the match, a few of them gathered and started assaulting him.
“He didn’t die on the spot, he died [later] because of the shock,” the interior minister said, adding that nearly 10 to 12 people had been arrested and further investigation was underway.
“We will definitely take this very seriously because such incidents should never occur anywhere.”
He said that if the victim had chanted pro-Pakistan slogans, people should have handed him over to the police rather than taking the law into their own hands.
Parameshwara called on the public to maintain peace and harmony in the state.
According to India Today, Mangaluru Police Commissioner Anupam Agarwal said that it was a “brutal and unprecedented attack”.
“We’ve never seen such a case in Mangaluru before. The injuries were extensive, and there was no timely medical aid. That led to his death,” the commissioner was quoted as saying by the news outlet.</p><small>2025-04-29 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/29170420fd68807.jpg?r=170446' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907362/uk-to-stop-foreign-sex-offenders-receiving-refugee-protections' target='_blank'><strong>UK to stop foreign sex offenders receiving refugee protections</strong></a><br><p>Foreign nationals convicted of a sexual offence will be blocked from seeking refugee status in Britain as part of government efforts to tighten rules ahead of local elections and counter the charge from opponents that it cannot protect its borders.
Immigration has long been a major issue in Britain, with voters questioning why successive governments were unable to control arrivals, particularly those coming in small boats across the Channel.
 
 

Since being elected last July, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government has sought to restrict access to the asylum system and speed up removal of those denied refugee status.
It is also reviewing how courts interpret a migrant’s right to a family life after the rule which guarantees it, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, was used in multiple asylum appeals, with the details regularly reported by British newspapers.
“We are reviewing that because we do believe that the way in which it’s being interpreted in the courts is an issue,” interior minister Yvette Cooper told Sky News on Tuesday.
Britain has experienced record migration in recent years, with net arrivals hitting 728,000 for the year ending June 2024 — the vast majority coming via legal routes for jobs or as students.
So far this year more than 10,000 asylum seekers have also arrived in small boats in record time, up about 40 per cent compared with the same period last year.
The issue has been seized on by Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK, and the new tightening of the rules was announced two days before local elections on Thursday, where Reform is expected to perform well.
AI for asylum caseworkers
The government’s Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, which is passing through parliament, will be amended to deny refugee status to any foreign national with a criminal conviction that qualifies them for the sex offenders’ register.
“Sex offenders who pose a risk to the community should not be allowed to benefit from refugee protections in the UK,” Cooper said in a statement late on Monday.
The government also said it would introduce new targets to speed up parts of the asylum decision-making system, and begin using AI to help caseworkers.
Britain had 90,686 asylum cases awaiting an initial decision at the end of 2024.
The government said in January that it had met its target to deliver the highest rate of removals since 2018, having removed 16,400 people.
Western countries, from France and Germany to the United States, have been grappling with a surge in the number of people fleeing war, persecution and poverty, with the global refugee population having tripled in the last decade.</p><small>2025-04-29 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/29160604e4f4015.jpg?r=160636' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907355/us-fda-approves-first-cell-based-gene-therapy-for-rare-genetic-skin-disorder' target='_blank'><strong>US FDA approves first cell-based gene therapy for rare genetic skin disorder</strong></a><br><p>The United States Food and Drug Administration approved Abeona Therapeutics’ gene therapy for a rare skin disorder on Tuesday.
Shares of the Cleveland-based drugmaker rose 13 per cent in premarket trading.
The gene therapy, called Zevaskyn, is approved to treat adult and pediatric patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.
Patients with the disorder have extremely fragile skin, with blisters and tears forming large wounds all over the body that are difficult to heal and can remain open for years.
The disorder results from a defect in the COL7A1 gene, which prevents the production of a crucial type of collagen responsible for anchoring the upper and lower layers of the skin.
The current standard of care treatment is daily wound care and protective bandaging.
The treatment is expected to be available in the third quarter of 2025 at specific treatment sites, Abeona said.
Zevaskyn, chemically known as pz-cel, works by adding healthy COL7A1 genes to the patient’s skin cells and transplanting them back to the patient through a skin graft to heal the large and chronic wounds.
The FDA’s approval was based on data from early-to-mid-stage and late-stage studies, in which the therapy showed significant healing of wounds and pain reduction after treatment.
 
 

Current treatment options include Krystal Biotech’s Vyjuvek, approved in 2023, which is used to treat smaller-sized wounds. Last year, Vyjuvek brought in sales of $290.5 million.
Patients being able to use both Vyjuvek and pz-cel at the same time will help treat the disorder more effectively and “hopefully make this disease chronic but livable,” said Brett Kopelan, executive director at debra of America, a nonprofit patient support organisation.

The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed 808.28 points, or 0.71 per cent, to stand at 114,872.18 from the previous close of 114,063.90.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, said, attributed the bull run to the announcement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board meeting “to approve a tranche of $1.3 billion for Pakistan under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and a new 28-month arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility”.
Earlier, the IMF website confirmed that the Fund’s Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country’s staff-level agreement for a new $1.3bn arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing $7bn bailout programme.
According to the IMF, this will be the first “review under the Extended Arrangement Under the Extended Fund Facility”, along with the request for an arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
Ashraf added that this “redirected attention from the border dispute with India to the country’s macroeconomic improvement efforts”.
Yesterday, after a positive start, the concerns about Pakistan’s economic outlook and rising tensions with India prompted equity investors to engage in panic selling towards the end of the session.
An analyst had said the share market fell across the board as investors weighed heightened geopolitical tensions, suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, and stalled bilateral trade by New Delhi.
Last week, the April 22 attack in Pahalgam saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed in what is being described as the deadliest armed attack in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000.
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
Topline Securities Ltd observed that the PSX witnessed a classic tug-of-war between bulls and bears. The index opened positively, gaining momentum in the early hours to register an intraday gain of 1,189 points. However, the optimism proved short-lived, as intensified selling pressure later in the session caused the index to reverse sharply, touching an intraday loss of 1,601 points. The market eventually closed at 114,063.90 — down by 1,405.45 points or 1.22pc day-on-day.</p><small>2025-04-29 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2913081207e6468.png?r=132113' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907326/pakistan-shoots-down-indian-quadcopter-violating-airspace-near-loc' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan shoots down Indian quadcopter violating airspace near LoC</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Army on Tuesday shot down an Indian quadcopter drone near the Line of Control (LoC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), state media reported, as tensions between the two countries linger on in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
The April 22 attack killed 26 men, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
“Pakistan has successfully shot down an Indian quadcopter along the Line of Control, thwarting a violation of its airspace,” state-run Radio Pakistan and PTV News reported, citing security sources.
 


Specifying the location, security sources said the “enemy attempted to conduct surveillance using a quadcopter” in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district in AJK.
“The Pakistan Army, through timely action, foiled this nefarious attempt by the enemy,” the report added.
The security sources termed the incident a “clear testimony to the vigilance, professional skill and defensive preparedness of the Pakistan Army”.
“The Pakistan Army is always ready to give an immediate and effective response to any aggression from the enemy,” the report read, adding that the entire nation stood “united with the armed forces to give a befitting response to the enemy on every front”.
The development comes as Indian and Pakistani soldiers reportedly traded fire along the LoC for a fifth straight night, after four years of relative calm.
The Indian army said its soldiers and Pakistani forces fired at each other overnight. There was no immediate confirmation from Pakistan.
India said that overnight from Monday to Tuesday, the gunfire took place in areas opposite the Kupwara and Baramulla districts in held Kashmir, as well as in the Akhnoor sector.
There were no reports of casualties.
In the latest of this heated debate, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif yesterday said Pakistan was ready for any incursion by India.
 
 

“We have reinforced our forces because it is something which is imminent now. So in that situation, some strategic decisions have to be taken, so those decisions have been taken,” Asif told Reuters.
He said the military had briefed the government on the possibility of an Indian attack, but did not go into further details on his reasons for thinking an incursion was imminent.
In an interview with Samaa TV, Asif warned there was a “war looming on the horizon”, and later told Geo News that the “next two to three days were crucial”.
Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. Analysts say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.
Pakistan preparing to challenge Indus Waters Treaty suspension: Aqeel Malik
Pakistan is preparing international legal action over India’s suspension of the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), Minister of State for Law and Justice Aqeel Malik told Reuters late on Monday.
Malik said Islamabad was working on plans for at least three different legal options, including raising the issue at the World Bank, the treaty’s facilitator.
It was also considering taking action at the Permanent Court of Arbitration or at the International Court of Justice in the Hague, where it could allege that India has violated the 1960 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, he said.
“Legal strategy consultations are almost complete,” Malik said, adding the decision on which cases to pursue would be made “soon” and would likely include pursuing more than one avenue.
India’s water resources officials did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request seeking comment.

Malik added that a fourth diplomatic option that Islamabad was considering was to raise the issue at the United Nations Security Council.
“All the options are on the table and we are pursuing all appropriate and competent forums to approach,” he said. “The treaty cannot be suspended unilaterally and cannot be held in abeyance, there is not [such a] provision within the treaty,” he asserted.
Since the Pahalgam attack, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other.
India on April 23 unilaterally suspended the IWT — a water-sharing agreement that was brokered by the World Bank and has endured through wars and decades of hostility.
The next day, Pakistan retaliated by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights. The National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad also said “any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan […] will be considered as an act of war”.
The treaty is an agreement for the distribution and use of waters from the Indus River and its tributaries, which feed 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture and its hydropower.
 
 

Kushvinder Vohra, a recently retired head of India’s Central Water Commission, told Reuters: “There are very limited options [for Pakistan] … I can say that there are solid grounds for us to defend our action.”
Government officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately, because the treaty has allowed it to only build hydropower plants without significant storage or dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan.
But things could start changing in a few months, and farmers, already hit by climate-change-related water shortages, have raised concerns.
Cyberattacks on ministries’ websites ‘foiled’
In a related development, Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja has said that cyberattack attempts on the websites of some ministries were foiled.
Responding to a query yesterday about cyberattacks from India, Khawaja said: “There were [cyberattacks] on some ministries, but we defended against them successfully. There was no huge issue.
“They were resolved timely,” she told reporters at her ministry’s office in Islamabad, clarifying there was no cyberattack on the IT ministry’s website.
 


Khawaja highlighted that the National Cyber Emergency Resp­onse Team (N-Cert) and its provincial counterparts were functional.
The minister pointed out that Pakistan had been listed among the top countries in cybersecurity last year, recalling the Top Tier-1 ranking in the ITU-Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI-V5) 2024.
Speaking on the Pahalgam attack, she asserted Pakistan had always condemned terrorism and advocated peace.
“It is in no one’s interest that the situation escalates,” Khawaja said about the ongoing Pakistan-India friction.
Also yesterday, N-cert, which is responsible for the security of critical digital infrastructure, warned media and content creators against sharing sensitive national security information.
 
 

In an advisory, it noted there had been an “uptick in the circulation of videos, images, and commentary revealing troop movements, military deployments, and sensitive national security activities” on social media and public forums.
“ Such disclosures — whether inadvertent or intentional — may severely compromise national security, jeopardise operational effectiveness, and facilitate hostile actions by adversaries,“ N-cert said.
The advisory added that disseminating sensitive material may result in a security breach by disclosing the locations and movements of troops.
India shuts over half of tourist spots in held Kashmir in security review
More than half of the tourist destinations in India-occupied Kashmir (IoK) have been closed to the public from Tuesday, according to a government order reviewed by Reuters, in a bid to tighten security after last week’s attack on holiday-makers.

The assailants segregated men, asked their names and targeted Hindus before shooting them at close range in the Pahalgam area, killing 26 people, officials and survivors said.
The local government has decided to shut 48 of the 87 tourist destinations in IoK and enhanced security at the remaining ones, according to the government document.
No time period was given. Government officials did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
Nestled in the Himalayas with lofty peaks, picturesque valleys and grand Mughal-era gardens, the territory has been emerging as India’s tourism hotspot as violence there has waned in recent years.
But the Pahalgam attack has left panic-stricken tourists seeking an early exit at the start of the busy summer season.
UAE joins chorus favouring Pak-India dialogue
Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates today joined other countries in stressing the importance of “promoting dialogue” to defuse tensions between arch-rivals India and Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
UAE Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in a phone call with his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar, discussed the recent regional situation and matters of mutual concern, the Foreign Office (FO) said on X.
Dar apprised the UAE official of the decisions made by Pakistan’s National Security Committee last week in response to “India’s unfounded allegations, inflammatory rhetoric and unilateral actions”.

The UAE deputy PM “emphasised the importance of upholding regional stability, promoting dialogue, exercising restraint and peaceful resolution of disputes”, according to the FO.
“Reaffirming the strong fraternal ties between Pakistan and the UAE, both leaders committed to maintaining close coordination and consultations in light of [the] evolving regional situation.”
Both deputy premiers also expressed their countries’ resolve to “enhance bilateral cooperation and advance shared objectives of peace, stability, and sustainable development”, the FO stated.
Other friendly countries and global powers have also sought de-escalation of tensions between Pakistan and India — including the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Turkiye, and Qatar.
 
 

Yesterday, China said it hoped the two sides would “exercise restraint, meet each other halfway, properly handle relevant differences through dialogue and consultation, and jointly maintain regional peace and stability”.
Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also called for a swift de-escalation of the brewing crisis, Anadolu Agency reported on Monday.
“We want the escalating tensions between Pakistan and India to be de-escalated as soon as possible, before they evolve into a more serious situation,” Erdogan said after a cabinet meeting in Ankara.
“Türkiye emphasises at every opportunity that we do not want new conflicts in our region and beyond,” he stressed.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint” so that issues can be “resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”.
Iran has already offered to mediate, and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”. US President Donald Trump on Friday downplayed tensions, saying the dispute will get “figured out, one way or another”.

According to the Fund’s website, this will be the first “review under the Extended Arrangement Under the Extended Fund Facility”, along with request for an arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
Previously, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb during his visit to Washington had said he also expected the IMF Executive Board to approve in early May.
Approval from the board would trigger the disbursement of a $1bn tranche under the programme, which Pakistan secured in 2024. The IMF programme has played a critical role in stabilising Pakistan’s fragile economy, providing much-needed external financing and boosting market confidence.
Pakis­tan and the IMF had reached a three-year, $7bn aid package deal in July 2024, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
The ongoing 37-month EFF programme consists of six reviews over the life of the bailout, and the release of the next tranche of approximately $1bn will be contingent on the success of the performance review.
In March, Pakistan and the IMF had concluded the first biannual review of the $7bn loan programme on a positive note, without imposing additional revenue measures.
In an end-of-mission statement, mission chief Nathan Porter said: “Programme implementation has been strong, and the discussions have made considerable progress in several areas, including the planned fiscal consolidation to durably reduce public debt, maintenance of sufficiently tight monetary policy to maintain low inflation, acceleration of cost-reducing reforms to improve energy sector viability.”
A separate technical mission from the IMF also visited the country on Pakistan’s request for over $1bn in additional financing for climate resilience.</p><small>2025-04-29 06:40</small></div><hr>
