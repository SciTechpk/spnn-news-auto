<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/032048061c23d18.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939445/pakistan-dispatches-105-tonnes-of-humanitarian-aid-for-quake-struck-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan dispatches 105 tonnes of humanitarian aid for quake struck Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday dispatched 105 tonnes of humanitarian aid for quake-struck Afghanistan, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
The earthquake killed a total of 1,469 people and injured more than 3,700, according to a new toll from Taliban authorities, making it one of the deadliest in decades to hit the impoverished country, according to AFP.
The vast majority of the casualties — more than 1,450 — were in Kunar province, with a dozen dead and hundreds hurt in nearby Nangarhar and Laghman provinces.
“Following my telephone call with Foreign Minister Muttaqi, the Government of Pakistan today dispatched 105 tonnes of humanitarian relief assistance to Afghanistan,” a statement from Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said.
 






The consignment includes “essential food items, medicines, tents, blankets, and bubble mats”, aimed at supporting those affected by the recent earthquakes in the country, the statement added.
“We extend our deepest condolences and prayers for the victims and wish a speedy recovery to the injured,” Deputy PM Dar said.
Pakistan stands in solidarity with the brotherly people of Afghanistan in this difficult time, he added.
The relief supplies are being sent to Afghanistan via the Torkham border via 5 trucks with 40-foot containers. The departure ceremony of the supplies was held at the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) warehouse in Islamabad, PTV News reported.
The ceremony was attended by the special guest, Minister of State for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kheal Das Kohistani, along with officials from the NDMA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
This was the third major earthquake since the Taliban took power in 2021, but there are even fewer resources for the cash-strapped government’s response after the United States slashed assistance to the country when President Donald Trump took office in January.
Even before the earthquake, the United Nations estimated it had obtained less than a third of the funding required for operations countrywide.
Days after quake, Afghan survivors still await aid
Rescue teams struggled to reach survivors as night approached days after a powerful earthquake in eastern Afghanistan, as access to remote areas remained obstructed.
Fearful of the near-constant aftershocks rattling the area, people huddled in the open air while others struggled to unearth those trapped under the heaps of flattened buildings.
Access remained difficult, as aftershocks caused rockfall, stymying access to already isolated villages and keeping families huddled outdoors for fear of the remains of damaged homes collapsing on them.
“Everyone is afraid and there are many aftershocks,” Awrangzeeb Noori, 35, told AFP from the village of Dara-i-Nur in Nangarhar province. “We spend all day and night in the field without shelter.”
 


The non-governmental group Save the Children said one of its aid teams “had to walk for 20 kilometres to reach villages cut off by rock falls, carrying medical equipment on their backs with the help of community members”.
The World Food Programme (WFP) shared images of teams hiking up slopes carrying boxes of food aid on their shoulders.
The Taliban government deputy spokesperson, Hamdullah Fitrat told AFP that areas that had taken days to reach had been finally accessed.
“We cannot determine the date for finishing the operation in all areas as the area is very mountainous and it is very difficult to reach every area.”
More than 12,000 people have been directly affected by the earthquake, according to ActionAid, noting women and girls were particularly vulnerable in emergencies as they face steep restrictions under the Taliban authorities.
Residents of Jalalabad, the nearest city to the quake epicentre, donated money and goods such as blankets to be delivered to those impacted by the quake.
“I am a simple labourer and I came here to help the earthquake victims because I felt very sad for them,” said resident Mohammad Rahman.
“If I could do more, I would help even more, but I helped with what I had.”
Afghanistan airdrops commandos to rescue quake survivors
Afghanistan airdropped commandos to pull survivors from the rubble in areas ravaged by earthquakes, as a UN agency warned that food aid for victims would run out soon without urgent funding.
Dozens of commando forces were being airdropped at sites where helicopters cannot land, to help carry the injured to safer ground, in what aid groups said was a race against time to rescue those still stuck under rubble.
Time was also running out for those who survived the two devastating quakes in the remote eastern region of the impoverished country, the UN WFP warned on Wednesday.
John Aylieff, the head of WFP in Afghanistan, told Reuters that the agency only has enough funding and stocks for the next four weeks.
“Four weeks is just not enough even to meet the basic, essential needs of the population struck by the earthquake, let alone put the victims on a path back to rebuilding their lives,” Aylieff said.
WFP funding for Afghanistan this year is just under $300 million, according to UN financial data, down from $1.7 billion in 2022, the first full year the country was ruled by the Taliban.
Resources for rescue and relief work are tight in the nation of 42 million people hit by war, poverty and shrinking aid. It has received limited global help after the disaster.</p><small>2025-09-03 16:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/03125922db98c59.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939386/business-tycoon-renowned-philanthropist-rafiq-m-habib-passes-away-at-88' target='_blank'><strong>Business tycoon, renowned philanthropist Rafiq M. Habib passes away at 88</strong></a><br><p>Prominent business tycoon and renowned philanthropist Rafiq M. Habib passed away aged 88 in Dubai on Wednesday.
Rafiq was the former head of the House of Habib conglomerate, Habib University’s chancellor, and a member of Stile company’s board of directors. He was also the chairman of the Habib University Foundation.
“With profound sorrow, Habib University mourns the passing of its founding chancellor, Rafiq M. Habib (1937-2025), and honours his enduring legacy,” Habib University said in a post on Instagram.

Remembering him, the varsity said: “A man whose calm resolve and deep integrity shaped every step of this journey, Rafiq sahab was the moral and visionary force behind the creation of Habib University.
“His belief that education must serve the greater good continues to guide our mission. His legacy lives on in the institution he helped build and the generations it will continue to empower.”
According to Habib University’s website, Rafiq was a trustee of “several welfare projects”, including education, healthcare, relief and rehabilitation.
Rafiq actively participated in social welfare programmes and had been part of “several welfare institutions covering a wide range of social activities, education being the prime focus, where the family runs its own schools and supports other schools presently imparting high quality primary education to over 8,000 children”, Stiles noted.
Rafiq had a “wide business experience” in the insurance and banking industry, and promoted many companies, including Indus Motor Company Limited.
“He is a Rotarian, an effective major donor, supports Polio Plus programme and actively promotes street schools, home schools, etc,” Stiles added.
The businessman remained as a consultant for Habib Bank AG Zurich, which has Habib Metropolitan Bank as its subsidiary in Pakistan.
He also served for several years on the Board of Directors of Philips Electrical Company of Pakistan Ltd and was the first chairman on Standard Chartered Bank’s advisory board in the country.
Wasif Rizvi, the president of Habib University, termed Rafiq a “towering figure of vision, humility, and steadfast service, whose leadership and generosity laid the very foundations” of the varsity.
“Rafiq sahib was the visionary in the legendary Habib family to imagine a world-class institution of higher learning being founded in Karachi,” Rizvi wrote in a statement.
“His generosity was never about recognition, it was an act of devotion to knowledge, to service, and to the belief that education is the noblest inheritance one can give to society.”</p><small>2025-09-03 15:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/03200454272e9e5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939447/karachi-school-management-booked-for-manslaughter-as-employee-dies-by-suicide' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi school management booked for manslaughter as employee ‘dies by suicide’</strong></a><br><p>The management of a private school in Karachi has been booked over charges of manslaughter after a young employee purportedly died by suicide, it emerged on Wednesday.
The 25-year-old employee allegedly jumped from the eighth floor of the school building on September 1, according to a first information report (FIR) registered at Brigade police station.
According to the complainant, who was the victim’s brother, “On September 1, he (the victim) left home at around 8:15am for work. At around 9:35am, I received a phone call informing me that my brother’s health had deteriorated and he was being taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC).”
The complainant said that when he arrived at JPMC, the school’s administration staff was also present and they informed him that his brother fell from the eighth floor of the building at around 8:45am.
He added that when he reached the emergency room, he saw that his brother was dead.
“It later transpired that my brother had left a message on social media, naming three men who ‘mentally tortured’ him,” the complainant stated.
He alleged that his brother ended his life because of mental pressure and wanted to pursue legal action against the three people named in the social media post.
The police invoked Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 322 (punishment for manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code against the suspects.</p><small>2025-09-03 15:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0318312501aede8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939439/lahore-atc-grants-bail-to-imran-khans-nephew-shahrez-in-may-9-riots-case' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC grants bail to Imran Khan’s nephew Shahrez in May 9 riots case</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Wednesday granted bail to PTI founder Imran Khan’s nephew Shahrez Khan in a case pertaining to the Jinnah House attack during the May 9, 2023, riots.
ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the verdict that was reserved earlier today on Shahrez’s bail petition and ordered his release subject to paying a surety bond set at Rs100,000. Shahrez’s lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassar, confirmed the development to Dawn.com and PTI lawyer Taimur Malik also said the same.
 






Lahore Police had picked up Shahrez, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from his mother’s Lahore residence on August 21. His brother Shershah Khan was also arrested the next day over similar allegations, and sent on physical remand and then to jail.
Shahrez was sent on 14-day judicial remand by the Lahore ATC on August 30.
During today’s hearing on Shahrez’s bail petition, Advocate Mudassar argued that the athlete was accused of inciting party workers, adding that the investigation was approached from multiple angles, with geo-fencing carried out as well, and yet no evidence was found against Imran’s nephew.
“Everything is clear in the challan, it mentions named and unnamed suspects but Shahrez is not mentioned at all, no investigator gave any statement. He was arrested after 28 months and his mother — the PTI founder’s sister —  is raising her voice for his release. This arrest was made to suppress their voice,” he said.
The lawyer argued that Shahrez was in Chitral during the riots and several people had submitted affidavits in this regard. He said the athlete was also due to go abroad to compete in a sporting event.
Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed their concerns over the arrests, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
Shahrez’s wife has said her husband was in Chitral with her family on May 9, 2023, sharing purported pictures from the trip. At the same time, the PTI had challenged a video being shared of Shahrez, stating it was from the party’s public meeting in Kahna held on Sept 21, 2024, not from the 2023 riots.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.</p><small>2025-09-03 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/03163509d0d71b7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939406/fact-check-video-does-not-show-12-year-old-pakistani-girl-impregnated-by-60-year-old-man-is-of-vietnamese-siblings' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Video does not show 12-year-old Pakistani girl impregnated by 60-year-old man; is of Vietnamese siblings</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple Islamophobic, right-wing and Indian users on social media platform X since Tuesday were sharing a video of a small girl with a baby on a hospital bed, alleging that it showed a 12-year-old Pakistani girl with a newborn baby after being impregnated by a 60-year-old man. However, this video is not from Pakistan and shows two Vietnamese siblings.
A day ago, a video showing a young girl with a baby was shared on X by a user sharing Islamophobic content, based on their past posts.
The caption of the post said: “Pakistan: Islam is a Cult Religion. How sad … A shocking case has emerged in Pakistan where an 11-year-old girl was married to a 60-year-old man and gave birth at age 12. Really, Islam is sexual child abuse religion!”
This post was viewed by over 16 million users.
An Indian propaganda account on X also shared a similar post with the same claim, which received over 102,000 views.
Additionally, several other users on X widely circulated the same claim as can be seen here, here, here, and here, collectively gaining over 110,000 views.
Notably, the posts did not provide any other contextual details, such as the date and location of the alleged incident.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and to address the harm that such allegations can cause.
A keyword search to corroborate whether the incident recently occurred or not in Pakistan yielded no results from credible national or local news outlets reporting any such occurrence.
Observing the video itself showed that the people were not speaking any language or dialect used in Pakistan.
A reverse image search led to a TikTok video posted by an account with the username “baongoc._.93”, dated August 9, 2024.
 
  @baongoc._.93 Bé chị 700g ấp bé em 900g . 2thiên thần đáng yêu của mẹ 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 chi2 nay lớn rồi hiểu chuyện với mẹ lắm@HùngThỏ_Long An #xuhuongtiktok #EmBéCute  ♬ nhạc nền - Bảo Ngọc - Bảo Ngọc   

The caption of the video, translated from Vietnamese, said: “The older sister weighs 700g and the younger sister weighs 900g. Mom’s two lovely angels. The two of them are grown up now and understand their mother very well.”
Further investigation of the same TikTok account yielded another video, dated Aug 11, 2024, featuring a woman with the baby placed on her chest and criticising online chatter about her children.
 
  @baongoc._.93 Bất lực  ♬ nhạc nền - Bảo Ngọc - Bảo Ngọc   

Another video, dated October 15, 2024, showed the young girl on a bed with the baby, accompanied by overlaying text saying: “Two sisters love each other.”

Multiple other videos were also found on the account, showing the same young girl and infant playing together, with the accompanying text saying: “My most precious memories are my children’s childhood”, or celebrating events such as a birthday with their mother.

Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows a 12-year-old Pakistani girl with a newborn baby after impregnation by a 60-year-old man is false. The video shows a young Vietnamese girl with her baby sibling and was shared back in August 2024.

GB’s trophy hunting programme involves local communities, who receive about 80 per cent of hunting revenues for conservation and development projects. While it has been credited with protecting endangered species, stakeholders fear the latest price hikes could jeopardise its sustainability.
The bidding ceremony was held today at the Forest, Parks and Wildlife Complex in Gilgit, where a large number of outfitters and hunters participated in an auction.
Shikar Safari’s owner, Raja Farhad Maqpoon, placed the highest bid of $370,000 and won the Astore markhor hunting permit at the Nanga Parbat conservancy area in Astore, while the second bidder won the Astore markhor hunting permit for $286,000, the third for $270,000 and the fourth permit for $240,000, respectively.
The highest bid of $40,000 was placed by Muhammad Ali Nagri from Markhor Safaris for a Blue sheep permit, and the same bidder also placed $13,000 for a Himalayan ibex and won both.
GB conservator for Parks and Wildlife, Khadim Abbas, told Dawn.com that for the upcoming season, the base price of an Astore markhor permit was raised to $200,000, while blue sheep and Himalayan ibex permits are set at $30,000 and $10,000, respectively.
 
 

Last year, the base rates were lower: $150,000 for markhor, $9,000 for blue sheep and $5,500 for ibex. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa wildlife department had auctioned the highest rate Markhor hunting permit in Chitral for $271,000.
In the 2024-25 season, the highest bid for a markhor reached $161,000, earning the GB government more than Rs30 million.
Separately, local outfitters and tour operators argued that the sharp fee hikes were damaging their businesses and discouraging international clients.
They warned of losses for both outfitters and the local communities that relied on trophy hunting revenue.
Ikram Beg, a Gilgit-based outfitter, said participation in the programme had dropped due to inflated rates, causing “devastating” impacts on livelihoods.
“Trophy hunting can either remain a success story in GB or fade into history as a failed experiment. The choice lies in the wisdom and vision of the communities that are its true custodians,” he said.
He added that such decisions changed the objectives of the programme as the trophy hunting programme was not supposed to be a commercial endeavour.
Similarly, Syed Sumsam Ali Bokhari, chairman of Safari Club International Pakistan Chapter, warned that rising prices undermined Pakistan’s competitiveness compared to neighbouring countries.</p><small>2025-09-03 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/031816354d2bea2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939437/bandit-hideouts-in-rahim-yar-khans-katcha-area-targeted-in-security-operation-police' target='_blank'><strong>Bandit hideouts in Rahim Yar Khan’s katcha area targeted in security operation: police</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Police said on Wednesday that several hideouts of bandits in Katcha Ronti of Punjab’s Rahim Yar Khan were bombed using drones to recover people kidnapped by the reverine gang.
For decades, dozens of bandit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets, brutal killings and robberies on major highways occur on a daily basis.
In a post on X, the Punjab Police said that “an operation against dacoit hideouts was carried out in Rahim Yar Khan’s Kacha Ronti, using drones”.
“The operation left multiple dacoits injured,” the statement added.
Punjab Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar commended the efforts of the police and was quoted as saying, “Punjab Police is fully utilising drone technology not only to assist flood-affected people but also to eliminate criminal elements.”
 






On August 1, five cops were martyred after bandits of the Katcha area attacked a police checkpoint in Rahim Yar Khan.
In March, three people were allegedly shot dead by dacoits in the Jamaldin Wali area of tehsil Sadiqabad near the Indus River, to avenge the murder of a YouTuber.</p><small>2025-09-03 14:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/03172853a14cb11.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939426/homeless-and-fearful-afghan-quake-survivors-sleep-in-the-open' target='_blank'><strong>Homeless and fearful, Afghan quake survivors sleep in the open</strong></a><br><p>Families huddled hungry and homeless days after a deadly earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan, not daring to set foot in the few remaining buildings for fear an aftershock could bring them down.
The initial powerful 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck remote regions along the border with Pakistan, killing more than 1,400 people, with at least six strong aftershocks and countless smaller tremors.
Some farming villages tucked among the green mountainsides were flattened, with people still under the rubble days later.
 
 

Elsewhere, some houses were only partially destroyed, but residents preferred to brave the elements rather than risk being crushed.
Still haunted by the “terrifying night” when the quake destroyed his house in the village of Dar-i-Nur in Nangarhar province, Emran Mohammad Aref said he had since slept with four other family members outside on a rough plastic mat.

“There was a tremor yesterday and there was also one this morning,” Aref told AFP.
“Now we have no place to live and we are asking everyone for help.”
While those with the means fled the village, residents who had no choice but to stay cobbled together makeshift shelters with whatever they could find among the destruction.

Even in Jalalabad, Nangarhar’s provincial capital, which suffered no damage but felt the quake and its aftershocks, “we are very afraid”, said Fereshta, a 42-year-old doctor.
“Every time I take a step, I feel like the ground is shaking. We don’t stay inside the house and we sleep in the garden, constantly thinking there will be another quake,” she said.

‘Give us shelter’
Similar scenes are playing out across the affected region, some in the isolated areas of hard-hit Kunar province that are still cut off from aid by landslides caused by the quake and aftershocks.
But in fleeing their homes — often built on high ground — and taking refuge in low-lying fields, riverbeds or by roadsides, survivors risk being hit by rockfall if aftershocks strike, warned Ijaz Ulhaq Yaad, a senior official in Kunar’s Nurgal district.

“The area is very dangerous, you cannot stay there long or even walk through it,” Yaad said.
The United Nations said it has 14,000 tents ready for distribution.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) told AFP it has at least 700 tents available, but cannot deliver them to survivors because of difficult access to the villages.
“Help us, give us shelter, help my children, we have nothing left,” pleaded Sorat, a housewife injured in the quake along with her husband and children.

While waiting for aid, “we are staying in the valley”, she said, sitting in her blue all-enveloping burqa on a traditional, simple woven bed surrounded by her three small children.

This earthquake, one of the deadliest in Afghanistan in decades, is “the last thing families with young children need in a country where many don’t have enough food, and a large portion of the children are already malnourished”, the World Food Programme said, adding the situation “is brutal”.
Afghanistan, still fragile after decades of war and a prolonged humanitarian crisis, has been rocked by other severe, deadly quakes in recent years —one in 2023 in western Herat, on the other side of the country near Iran.
That first 6.3-magnitude tremor was followed by at least eight powerful aftershocks and destroyed entire villages.

The student, a resident of Khayaban-i-Sir Syed of Rawalpindi’s Pirwadhai town, had lodged a first information report (FIR) with the police on Monday under Sections 338A (punishment  for  Isqat-i-haml) and 376i (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code, alleging that her academy’s principal raped her multiple times and forced her to have an abortion.
In her complaint, the victim alleged that the principal, who was childless, had offered to marry her while she was studying in Grade 10. She reportedly told him to approach her parents regarding the matter.
She further said that the principal started coming closer to her and assured her that he would help her get good marks in the matriculation examination, convincing her to have physical relations with him.
The complainant claimed that the man called her into his office and raped her. After a few months, she informed him that she was pregnant, but instead of marrying her, he gave her medicine for an abortion.
As per the FIR, the victim alleged that the suspect continued raping her from time to time and again made her pregnant. However, when she insisted on marriage, he refused and began subjecting her to torture.
A statement by the police on X quoted Rawalpindi Superintendent of Police Rawal Arshad as saying that the force took swift action and arrested the suspect, adding that the victim’s medical examination had also been initiated.
SP Arshad said a challan would be filed in court with solid evidence to ensure an exemplary punishment for the suspect.  and real punishment will be ensured. “Violence, abuse or harassment against women and children is unacceptable,” he said.
 






Human Rights Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar earlier ordered an “immediate and transparent” investigation into the incident, according to a statement issued today by Tarar’s office.
The minister ordered the suspect’s immediate arrest and sought a report on the incident. “The provision of justice to the affected student should be ensured under all circumstances,” Tarar, who is also the law minister, was quoted as saying.
According to Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code, the punishment for rape can be a death sentence or imprisonment of not less than 10 years and not more than 25 years, or the remainder of the convict’s life, along with a fine.
 
 

In May, a sessions court in Rawalpindi sentenced a man to death for raping a woman under Section 17 of the Anti-Rape (Investigation & Trial) Act, 2021.
Rape laws in Pakistan have seen significant reforms, particularly with the Anti-Rape Ordinance 2020, which introduced special courts for expedited trials, mandated medico-legal examinations within six hours, and established a national sex offender registry.
However, systemic challenges persist, with the national level conviction rate for rape at a mere 0.5 per cent, according to a report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO).
National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) Chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha said last month that only 41pc of the women raped report it, and even out of those, many back off due to societal pressure.
 
 

Last month, the interior ministry reported that 200 of the 567 cases of sexual abuse registered in Islamabad between 2021 and June 2025 involved children.
In June, Rawalpindi police said they had arrested an Adiala jail employee who allegedly raped his 11-year-old niece in the prison’s residential colony.
The same month, a woman in the district’s Dhamial area complained to the police that she had allegedly been sexually assaulted by her landlord’s son.</p><small>2025-09-03 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/031752099127f06.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939434/boxer-imane-khelif-not-competing-at-world-championships-amid-sex-testing-appeal' target='_blank'><strong>Boxer Imane Khelif not competing at world championships amid sex testing appeal</strong></a><br><p>Imane Khelif has the right to appeal World Boxing’s decision barring her from events unless she undergoes genetic sex testing but the Algerian is not competing at the world championships as she has not entered, World Boxing president Boris van der Vorst said.
World Boxing, which will oversee boxing in the 2028 Olympics, introduced mandatory sex testing for all boxers in its competitions in May, less than a year after Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting won gold in Paris amid a gender-eligibility row.
But Khelif appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport — sport’s highest court — seeking to overturn World Boxing’s ruling asking boxers to undertake a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) genetic test.
“She has the right to do this (appeal). For us, it’s important to stress that we introduced mandatory testing in order to have safe and competitive competitions, fair competitions,” Van der Vorst said on Wednesday.
“We announced it in May. And for us, everyone is equal. Every woman here has to submit several documents, including the sex testing.”
The World Boxing Championships get underway in Liverpool on Thursday and when asked if Khelif would have failed the test, Van der Vorst said: “It’s too early to draw conclusions.
“She has simply not entered on behalf of her own federation here in Liverpool.”
The Algerian Boxing Federation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Tuesday, World Boxing confirmed Taiwan’s Lin would not be competing at the world championships either.
“I know that she also is not part of the entry list of the National Federation,” Van der Vorst added.
The Dutchman had apologised in June when World Boxing specifically named Khelif in their announcement on mandatory sex testing.
However, he defended the decision for such tests to ensure they had “safe and fair competitions”.
“We are speaking not only about amateur boxing, but Olympic boxing. For us, that’s our brand, because that’s the ‘why’ of World Boxing. We established World Boxing in order to save the Olympic dream,” he said.
“Boxing is a combat sport and it is important to have safe and fair competitions. So, for us, it’s really crucial to introduce this kind of testing. I think it’s an important step that we show that we want to protect female boxing.”</p><small>2025-09-03 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/03171308bb60f2a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939425/heavy-rain-lashes-northern-india-yamuna-river-breaches-danger-mark-in-delhi' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy rain lashes northern India, Yamuna river breaches danger mark in Delhi</strong></a><br><p>Flooding across northern India killed at least five people on Wednesday, officials said, with more thunderstorms expected and local media reporting that 10,000 people have been evacuated from the river banks in capital Delhi.
The monsoon season in India has been particularly intense this year, killing at least 130 people in August alone in north India, wiping out villages and destroying infrastructure.
The latest round of flooding has hit northern areas of occupied Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab, where the Chenab and Tawi rivers have risen above the danger mark at several spots.
The swollen rivers have triggered landslides and damaged many roads, disconnecting parts of the mountainous regions of Jammu and Himachal from the rest of India.
At least five people were killed today after landslides battered Rajouri and Mandi districts in Jammu and Himachal Pradesh, respectively, officials said.
The India Meteorological Department warned of heavy to very heavy rain in the region today, with more downpours expected in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.
The Central Water Commission said the swollen Yamuna had breached its danger mark a day ago in Delhi.
Local media reported that nearly 10,000 people had been evacuated to relief camps set up by the government along the main highways as a precautionary measure for those living in low-lying areas.
Residents living along the Yamuna in Delhi were evacuated in 2023 as well after floodwaters entered their homes and the river hit its highest level in 45 years.
 
 

Many tourist spots in Himachal Pradesh have been hit by landslides in recent weeks, as raging rivers damaged infrastructure.
Educational institutions were ordered shut, authorities said, asking people to remain indoors due to flood warnings.
In neighbouring India’s Punjab, the government said 30 people have been killed and nearly 20,000 evacuated since August 1.
Water gushing through the plains in India’s breadbasket Punjab state has destroyed 150,000 hectares of crops, the government said a day ago.
Continuous rain prompted authorities to release water from dams, which has caused flooding in the plains in India and Pakistan in recent days.
On the other side of the border, Pakistani authorities issued an alert for more floods in Punjab today after India warned it would release water downstream from its dams, officials said.
New Delhi has previously given four such warnings to Islamabad, the officials said.
The worst floods in four decades have killed at least 43 people in Pakistan’s Punjab, with more than 3.3 million affected since August 26, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority said.
The death toll across Pakistan since the start of the monsoon season in late June stands at 881, according to the National Disaster Management Authority.</p><small>2025-09-03 12:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/031453477be1c82.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939405/china-unstoppable-says-xi-with-shehbaz-kim-and-putin-at-his-side' target='_blank'><strong>China ‘unstoppable’, says Xi with Shehbaz, Kim and Putin at his side</strong></a><br><p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif flanked Chinese President Xi Jinping at a massive parade of military might in Beijing on Wednesday, capping a week of diplomatic grandstanding by the Chinese president and his allies against the West.
The event, ostensibly to mark 80 years since the end of World War II, was a chance for Xi to put on an extravaganza to showcase China’s military prowess and bring together friendly leaders to send a message to the rest of the world.

Kicking off the parade, President Xi warned the world was still “faced with a choice of peace or war”, but said China was “unstoppable”.
China’s enormous new intercontinental ballistic missile DF-5C, with a range of 20,000 kilometres, counted prominently among the tonnes of hardware on display.
State-run Radio Pakistan reported that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “not invited to the parade” and that PM Shehbaz’s presence alongside Xi, Putin, and Kim highlighted Pakistan’s growing significance in the region.
 






The heavily choreographed event drew an acidic response from United States President Donald Trump, who accused the three leaders of plotting against the US.
“Give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against the United States of America,” he wrote on Truth Social.
 


Military hardware on show
During the 90-minute parade, Xi inspected the massed troops and weaponry from an open-topped limousine down Beijing’s vast Chang’an Avenue, before turning back to join his guests in a seating area above the iconic portrait of Mao Zedong on Tiananmen, the entrance gate of the historic Forbidden City.
China’s huge collection of military vehicles and heavy weapons rolled past the dignitaries, while images of thousands of servicemen and women in immaculate uniforms marching in tight ranks and soldiers jumping in and out of vehicles were shown in a slick state media broadcast.

Besides the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), new underwater drones and supersonic missiles were among the latest gear on display.
Beijing residents went out into the streets to catch a glimpse of a spectacular flypast involving scores of warplanes and helicopters, some making an “80” formation.
Millions of Chinese people were killed during a prolonged war with imperial Japan in the 1930s and 40s, which became part of a global conflict following Tokyo’s attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941.
 


Whirlwind week
All eyes were on how the trio of Xi, Putin and Kim — who rarely leaves secretive North Korea — interacted with each other, but the state media broadcast only offered rare snatches of the three together and foreign journalists were kept at a distance and told not to film or photograph the leaders.
The event was the climax of a whirlwind week for Xi, who hosted a slew of Eurasian leaders for a summit aimed at putting China front and centre of regional relations.
The club of 10 countries, named the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), touts itself as a non-Western style of collaboration in the region and seeks to be an alternative to traditional alliances.
During the summit, Xi slammed “bullying behaviour” from certain countries — a veiled reference to the United States — while Putin defended Russia’s Ukraine offensive, blaming the West for triggering the conflict.
Many of the guests from the Tianjin gathering, including Putin, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and several other leaders, joined Xi for the Beijing parade. However, no major Western dignitaries were among the two dozen world leaders at the event.
 


Political influence
Security around Beijing was tightened, with road closures, military personnel stationed on bridges and street corners, and miles upon miles of white barriers lining the capital’s wide boulevards.
China has touted the parade as a show of unity, and Kim’s attendance is the first time he has been seen with Xi and Putin at the same event. It is only his second reported trip abroad in six years.
Kim was accompanied on the trip by his daughter Kim Ju Ae, who was pictured arriving at Beijing Railway Station, and his sister Kim Yo Jong, who was photographed by AFP at a gala lunch.
Putin and Kim held talks after today’s parade, during which the Russian president thanked Kim for deployments of North Korean soldiers to aid Russia in its conflict with Ukraine.
 


Lam Peng Er, principal research fellow from the East Asian Institute at the
National University of Singapore, said Kim’s visit “demonstrates to the North Koreans and the world that he has powerful Russian and Chinese friends who treat him with respect”.
“China also shows that it has convening power and political influence to bring Putin and Kim Jong Un together,” he told AFP.</p><small>2025-09-03 11:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/031534594a0da75.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939411/terrorist-killed-during-intelligence-based-operation-in-kps-lakki-marwat-police' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorist killed during intelligence-based operation in KP’s Lakki Marwat: police</strong></a><br><p>A terrorist commander, allegedly involved in carrying out bomb blasts and targeting law enforcement personnel, was killed during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, the police said on Wednesday.
According to a statement issued by the Lakki Marwat police, the terrorist — identified as Kifayatullah — was killed during an exchange of fire with the cops.
“The police, upon receiving information about a suspected hideout in Nawar Khel, led a Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) team and carried out the operation, during which one police constable was left injured due to an exchange of fire with the terrorists,” the statement said.
Ammunition and a Kalashnikov were recovered from the slain terrorist, it added.
According to the police statement, the “exchange of fire went on for a long time, during which the police retaliated bravely.” It added that a clearance operation was underway in Nawar Khel.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Bannu region Sajjad Khan lauded the bravery of the police officers who participated in the operation.
“Our officers are always ready to fight for their homeland,” he said in a statement. “Their resolve to thwart terrorists’ attempts is ironclad”.
In August, terrorists in Lakki Marwat carried out a series of militant attacks, killing three soldiers and a woman while injuring three others, including two soldiers.
Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. Militant attacks have become more frequent in recent months, despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.</p><small>2025-09-03 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0312405036f73fe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939384/11-dead-as-us-forces-strike-drug-vessel-off-venezuela' target='_blank'><strong>11 dead as US forces strike ‘drug vessel’ off Venezuela</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said that US forces attacked a boat carrying drugs to the United States on Tuesday, killing 11 “narcoterrorists” from a gang he alleged was controlled by leftist Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.
Trump posted a video online of an open-topped speedboat carrying several people travelling on a body of water before it exploded in a ball of flames.
The move is a potentially significant escalation in the standoff between Caracas and Washington, after the United States deployed eight warships to Latin America in what it bills as a war on drug trafficking.
Trump initially announced at the White House that US forces had “shot out a boat … a drug-carrying boat, lots of drugs in that boat” without giving details.
The Republican later posted a statement about the strike on his Truth Social network, along with the black and white video of the exploding boat.
“Earlier this morning, on my orders, US Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua narcoterrorists,” Trump said, without specifying the weapon used.
“The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action.” No US forces were harmed, Trump added.
 


He went on to allege that Tren de Aragua — a Venezuelan group he has frequently referred to as part of his crackdown on undocumented migration — was “operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro.” The United States designated the gang a terrorist organisation earlier this year.
“Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. Beware!” Trump added in his post.
‘Full might’
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a vociferous critic of Maduro, vowed separately to keep using the “full might” of the United States to “eradicate” drug cartels.
Trump has “been very clear that he’s going to use the full power of America, the full might of the United States, to take on and eradicate these drug cartels, no matter where they’re operating from,” Rubio told reporters as he left Miami for a visit to Mexico.
Rubio earlier said on X that the vessel had “departed from Venezuela.”
 






Venezuela’s Maduro has cast the recent US deployment as a threat to the country.
There are currently eight US Navy ships involved in counter-narcotics efforts in Latin America: three amphibious assault ships, two destroyers, a cruiser and a littoral combat ship in the Caribbean and a destroyer in the eastern Pacific, a US defence official said on Tuesday on the condition of anonymity.
The announcement of the strike followed days of mounting tension between Washington and Caracas, with Maduro declaring a state of “maximum readiness” to defend against what he says are US military threats.
Maduro has been in Trump’s crosshairs since the Republican’s first term from 2017 to 2021. But the US president’s policy of maximum pressure, including an oil embargo, has failed to dislodge the Venezuelan leader from power.
Washington has doubled to $50 million a bounty for the capture of Maduro, whose re-elections in 2024 and 2018 were not recognised by the United States or much of the international community amid allegations of fraud and voter oppression.
Analysts have told AFP that the deployment of the US warships was likely aimed at ramping up pressure on Maduro, who has repeatedly accused Trump of attempting to bring about regime change.
Last week, Caracas petitioned the United Nations to intervene in the dispute by demanding “the immediate cessation of the US military deployment in the Caribbean.”
On Monday, Maduro said Venezuela was prepared for “a period of armed struggle in defence of the national territory” in case of an attack.</p><small>2025-09-03 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/03145928e935be7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939388/750-hospitalised-with-cholera-gastroenteritis-in-gbs-astore-district-health-officer' target='_blank'><strong>750 hospitalised with cholera, gastroenteritis in GB’s Astore: district health officer</strong></a><br><p>At least 750 people have been hospitalised with cholera and gastroenteritis in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Astore district, the district health officer (DHO) told Dawn.com on Wednesday.
Astore DHO Dr Nawab Ahmed Khan said that the 750 cases were reported over four days, though 90 per cent of them are now under control.
“I applied 60 drips to a single patient from morning until night,” Dr Khan said. “Several drips were also administered even after the patient left the hospital.”
On August 30, Astore’s District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) reported a sudden influx of gastroenteritis patients displaying symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting, according to a report by the deputy commissioner, available with Dawn.com.
The report stated that the patients hailed from the areas of Pattipura, Lous, Chongrah, Eidgah, Government Colony, Gorikot, Parishing and Shounter. No fatalities were reported as of today.
“[A] preliminary medical opinion indicated a waterborne source,” the report stated.’
 
 

On August 30, 80 cases were reported at DHQ Astore, with 150 patients admitted the following day. On August 31, eight cases were referred to facilities in Gilgit. The report showed that by September 1, the number of patients admitted at DHQ Astore and medical camps rose to a cumulative 450.
According to the DC’s report, water tanks and supply lines were inspected between August 30 and 31, with supplies suspended overnight “as a precaution”. Tanks were cleaned and disinfected on August 31, with four out of eight samples testing positive for cholera.
In light of this, the report noted, the district administration temporarily arranged for the distribution of water tankers and bottled water. Additionally, standard operating procedures were put in place to regularly chlorinate water tanks.
“District Astore has moved from rapid escalation to early stabilisation, with case numbers declining today,” the report read. “The response architecture — medical surge, water-sanitation interventions, network enforcement, targeted risk communication and multi-agency coordination — is fully activated.”
The report noted that the core risk remains infrastructure-related contamination and historic chlorination lapses, which are “being addressed on priority with defined accountability”.
 
 

Amid the monsoon season, GB has been hit by severe flooding. Hundreds of people in the region have fallen victim to water-borne diseases owing to a severe shortage of clean drinking water.
“Diamer, Shigar, Skardu, Astore, and Gilgit are most affected by poor and unsafe water, with the people of these districts being admitted to hospitals and clinics every day,” said GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.
A government report said children under the age of five have also begun falling victim to cholera, diarrhoea, typhoid and pneumonia, among other epidemic diseases.</p><small>2025-09-03 09:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939287/phf-chief-rules-out-pakistans-participation-in-jr-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>PHF chief rules out Pakistan’s participation in Jr World Cup</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Insisting that sending the teams to India for international events amid heightened political tensions was not possible, Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) president Tariq Hussain Bugti on Tuesday said the country will not compete in the Jr World Cup later this year.
The event is scheduled to be held in Indian cities of Chennai and Madurai from Nov 28 to Dec 10.
Pakistan, primarily due to ongoing political strains with New Delhi particularly after a short yet intense military clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May, are not competing in the Asia Cup too which is currently in progress in the Indian city of Rajgir.
Talking to reporters in Lahore on Tuesday, Bugti while acknowledging that not participating in international events in India was hurting the country’s hockey, said the national cause was bigger than everything.
“As there is a war-like situation [currently] prevailing between Pakistan and India, there is no possibility that the PHF will send its team to India for the Junior World Cup. [For the same reason] we did not send our [senior] team for the Asia Cup,” Bugti said.
“We have informed the International Hockey Federation [about missing the events in India]; it will provide Pakistan with an opportunity to qualify for the [senior] World Cup through a qualifying round,” he added.
“The entire world knows about the present [political] scenario between India and Pakistan. Therefore, they recognise that it is not possible for Pakistan teams to tour India.”
Meanwhile, the PHF chief thanked the government for sanctioning Rs250 million to ensure national senior team’s participation in the 2025-26 FIH Pro League that will feature the game’s nine top teams. The PHF had sought Rs350 million for the league.
“It is a good step taken by the federal government in order to bring improvement in our team which will face world’s top teams in the Pro League. And the PHF will field its best team to get full benefit from this event,” he said.
Bugti also revealed that the Pakistan Sports Board had also received Rs250 million from the Finance Ministry, adding modalities were being finalised between the PSB and the PHF on how to use this fund in the best possible way.
The FIH invited Pakistan to participate in the Pro League as runners-up of the FIH Nations Cup held in Malaysia this year after winners New Zealand withdrew from the league due to financial constraints.
Speaking on the occasion, Bugti agreed that a separate foreign coach for goalkeepers should be hired for the national team to strengthen this vital department of the game.
“The PHF also wants a helping hand from the federal government to hire the services of a suitable foreign coach for goalkeepers,” he said.

The new judicial year began in the IHC on Tuesday with Justice Dogar convening a full court meeting attended by all judges. Officials said the chief justice scheduled another full court session for 2pm today (Wednesday), issuing formal notices directing all IHC judges to attend.
Although the detailed agenda was not made public, such meetings are generally convened at the start of the judicial year to review the court’s performance, discuss administrative affairs, and set priorities for the coming months.
The full court meeting, to be chaired by Justice Dogar, will bring together all serving judges of the IHC for collective deliberations on judicial and administrative matters.
Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq also wrote a letter addressed to the IHC top judge, with copies sent to others, wherein he alleged that all his “brethren Judges have submissively reconciled to the concept of a Judiciary kowtowing to the executive”.
Sources said the judges sought a revision of the full court’s agenda, expressing strong reservations about the IHC’s state of affairs and suggesting remedial measures. The letters were also shared with other judges.
Justice Sattar’s letter, seen by Dawn.com, said the full court meeting was “long overdue but welcome step towards correcting the illegalities that have seeped into the administration of Islamabad High Court”, pointing out that the process had begun during the term of the previous top judge.
“I am writing to you in request inclusion of the matters listed below for discussion in the full court meeting. I have only included here brief explanations or questions to articulate their relevance, but I am sure you’ll get my drift.
“Some might counsel that this is an exercise in futility in view of the egregious disregard for judicial independence, institutional norms and the principle of comity amongst judges that has been witnessed in our midst since your transfer to Islamabad High Court. But one must never lose hope in the innate capacity of human beings to assume control of their agency and do the right and decent thing,” Justice Sattar wrote.
IHC’s diminishing role as a guardian of fundamental rights: Justice Sattar said the primary responsibility of the judiciary in a rule of law polity was to protect constitutionally-guaranteed fundamental rights against the abuse of power by the state.
He questioned whether IHC judges truly believed that the court was discharging that “pivotal constitutional duty” today and whether they believed that citizens perceived them as protectors and defenders of fundamental rights.
Failure to exercise supervision and control over subordinate judiciary: On this issue, Justice Sattar asked if the IHC was discharging its obligation to supervise and control courts subordinate to it in a manner so that judges manning such courts could discharge their judicial functions without fear, as required by Article 203 of the Constitution.
“Should the Islamabad District judiciary continue to look like a game of musical chairs played predominantly by deputationists or does IHC have the responsibility to develop district judiciary as an independent institution possessed of integrity and efficiency?”
 
 

Lack of transparency and logic in fixation of cases and preparation of rosters: About this issue, Justice Sattar said that as opposed to respecting institutional norms, Justice Dogar had created rosters excluding senior judges, including the senior puisne judge, from heading divisional benches.
“Should fixation of cases rest on the whims of the CJ or should there be transparency in who hears what case, while matching expertise of judges to the work they are asked to do? We write in our judgments every day that public officials aren’t kings and their administrative powers are neither unfettered nor should be exercised in a colorable manner. The cause lists issued under your watch reflect that cases are mostly marked to transferred judges and additional judges, leaving out permanent judges of IHC who found your transfer to IHC disagreeable. While exercising the administrative powers of IHC should one not remember that judges, including the CJ, are public officials too and not kings?”
Use of administrative powers to undermine judicial independence: Justice Sattar lamented that under Justice Dogar’s leadership and watch, “we have seen the office refusing to issue cause lists in breach of judicial orders, we have seen cases being transferred from the docket of one court to another despite the lack of any power in the office of the CJ to do so, and most recently we have seen issuance of rosters to deprive two judges (including me) of their dockets in a move to render them dysfunctional vis-à-vis their single-bench dockets”.
The judge said that the above might be successful manoeuvres in “rendering some judges irrelevant” and the country’s judicial history was replete with “similar malevolent practices that spread during authoritarian times”. He, however, questioned whether such “subversion of judicial independence” was justifiable.
Composition of committees to undermine high court’s collegiate character: On this issue, Justice Sattar said Justice Dogar had constituted committees “such that they exclude most of the senior judges of IHC from participating in its administrative functions.
“You’ve excluded the two senior-most judges of IHC from the Administration Committee in breach of IHC rules and entrenched institutional norms abided by all high courts, including the LHC from where you’ve come.
“Do you think manning IHC committees with additional judges appointed earlier this year and judges transferred from other provinces along with you strengthen IHC as an Institution and promote collegiality amongst judges?”
Assumption of powers to transform chief justice’s office into a monocracy: The judge said the IHC chief justice had “assumed powers to issue a circular requiring judges to seek an NOC (no-objection certificate) from you to travel out of the country, essentially placing judges on the Exit Control List”.
Justice Sattar said neither the Constitution nor the law vested such rule-making power in the office of the chief justice to “lord over his peers”.
“The draft rules circulated for consideration during the full court meeting also seek to concentrate all administrative powers in the office of the chief justice. You might have read Lord Acton’s words that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Will transforming the office of chief justice into an autocracy, in an effort to reduce the judiciary to a regiment, bolster judicial independence essential for the discharge of our adjudicatory duties?” Justice Sattar pondered.
 
 

Performance evaluation of judges and reporting of judgments: Regarding this issue, Justice Sattar said judges were the highest-paid public officials and should be strenuously held to account for their performance by the public.
However, he questioned whether there should not be an agreed objective framework for their performance evaluation.
“Under your watch IHC has issued skewed statistics regarding discharge of judicial work at IHC. These statistics are designed to cultivate an impression that some judges work super efficiently, while others don’t work at all. What if a curious researcher were to investigate the nature (and number) of cases marked to the ‘performing’ judges versus others, and the nature, quality and length of orders that make up their disposal figures? Should we not put together a consensual performance-evaluation criteria as well as guidance for which judgments are to be reported, to earnestly seek to enhance our performance and hold ourselves to account, instead of engaging in deceptive advertising?”
Concluding his letter, Justice Sattar said: “You will appreciate that it takes decades to build institutions, but they can be destroyed exponentially.  We have seen this happen to Islamabad High Court in the last couple of years.
“While I may be accused of letting hope trump experience in writing to you to encourage and facilitate intra-institutional debate to stem the rot that is reducing this judicial organ into nothingness, I am partial to Rousseau’s opinion regarding the capacity of human beings for virtue. History doesn’t remember kindly those who only make hay while the sun shines. And history also reminds us that all good (and bad) times come to an end sooner rather than later.”
Justice Sattar expressed hope that the IHC chief justice would read the letter to “appreciate the spirit in which it is written”.
 
 

He added: “I apologise in advance if the content causes any offence, for that is not the intent. We are all grown adults who should be able to speak candidly about the state of our institution’s disrepair. Without honest identification and admission of our failings, there can be no corrective action.”
It may be mentioned that Justice Sattar previously wrote letters to Justice Dogar on multiple issues, including amendments in the IHC Rules and formation of administrative committees, among others.
Judiciary kowtowing to the executive: Justice Ishaq
In his separate letter, an incomplete copy of which was seen by Dawn.com, Justice Ishaq alleged that his fellow judges had “submissively reconciled to the concept of a judiciary kowtowing to the executive”.

A “third” point in the letter mentioned “recent instructions by the office of the chief justice for the Judges to take NOC (no-objection certificate) from him for travel abroad”.
Justice Ishaq objected that it was “backed neither by any law nor by the common norms of CJ whether a judge spends his vacations in Pakistan or abroad”.
“This is a blatant impingement of the Fundamental Right of movement of a judge and, by extension, a below-the-belt strike on the independence of the judiciary. It is tantamount to a de facto placement of Judges on the Exit Control List. It is a mighty blow to the independence of the Judiciary.”
 
 

Justice Ishaq further noted: “There are orders passed by some judges of this court highlighting the clear distinction between the initial constitution of the benches and any later transfer of part-heard cases; the latter concept is beyond the pale of the ‘master of the roster’.
“A full and frank discussion (if it is allowed to take place) will necessitate that the Office be directed to annex with the Working Paper all judicial orders on this point passed by various judges of this court.”
The matter, Justice Ishaq said, “requires a frank discussion in the full court, for I am curious to know why my brethren judges have submissively reconciled to the concept of a judiciary kowtowing to the executive, regardless of the miscarriage of justice it can (and has already in some cases) resulted in, and which at least to me is tantamount to a perpetual violation of innumerable injunctions in the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of our beloved Prophet (PBUH) to do justice come what may, as also the oath of a judge under the Constitution to do justice without ‘fear, favour, or ill will’.”
He also took exception to the IHC Practice and Procedure Rules (PPR) being shared with the judges “only a day-and-a-half” before the full court meeting.
“I received yesterday the note for the full court meeting. Following the adage ‘better late than never’, I welcome this step, noting nonetheless that the full court meeting is an institutional convention to be followed each time any material decision impacting the functioning of the Islamabad High Court is to be taken, and not only when the idea catches the fancy of the IHC chief justice,” Justice Ishaq wrote.
 
 

He added that the notice was accompanied by a “voluminous compendium” of the new PPR, which apparently had already been notified in the official Gazette.
“I take strong exception to the PPR being shared with the Judges only a day-and-a-half before the full court meeting, as if we were possessed with some magical powers to read, analyse, and comment usefully on such a voluminous treatise that will regulate the functioning of the IHC and its subordinate judiciary.”
Justice Ishaq demanded a “proper presentation to the judges on the changes made to the existing framework under the Lahore High Court Rules adopted by the IHC”.
“As it stands now, it seems the full court meeting will only be a formality, or in any event devoid of any meaningful discussion on the PPR,” he said, adding that he was “unable to give any meaningful input on the PPR for being excluded during the process of their conception and drafting”.
Recently, the IHC chief justice constituted a division bench exclusively for clearing the backlog of nearly 2,000 tax references. Both Justice Sattar and Justice Ishaq are members of this special bench. The IHC administration had transferred all the cases pending in the dockets of both judges to the other available judges.</p><small>2025-09-03 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/03115440c2c0136.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939377/6-killed-as-vehicle-attacked-in-kps-kurram-police' target='_blank'><strong>6 killed as vehicle attacked in KP’s Kurram: police</strong></a><br><p>At least six people were killed after terrorists attacked a passenger vehicle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, police said on Wednesday.
Kohat Regional Police Officer Abbas Majeed Marwat said in a statement, “Six passengers have been killed in a tragic incident of firing on a passenger vehicle in Lower Kurram.
“A search operation has been launched after the terrorist incident,” he said, adding that 12 suspects were detained in the operation and a large number of weapons were recovered from them.
“Terrorists will not be spared under any circumstances. No one will be allowed to disturb regional peace,” RPO Marwat stated.
Earlier today, Kurram District Police Officer Kurram Malik Habib Khan said that the unknown assailants fled the scene after the attack. “The bodies have been taken to the hospital,” he said, adding that an investigation into the incident was underway.
Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Hameed Hussain condemned the incident in a statement, calling it “an attempt to disrupt the peace of the area”.
“Such incidents are regrettable even after the establishment of check posts on the main highway,” he said.
Meanwhile, Haji Zamin Hussain, secretary of the Anjuman-e-Hussainia Parachinar, strongly condemned the attack, stating, “We are shocked at the incident as people of Kurram have been martyred.”
He expressed solidarity with the victims and called for “severe punishment” against the culprits. “We all should stand together to punish the perpetrators,” he said. He added that there has been “complete peace” in the Turi area and no incidents on the road over the past six months.
Kurram has been marred with tribal violence stemming from decades-old land disputes, which claimed at least 130 lives last year. Following months of conflict, the warring tribes reached a ceasefire agreement in January this year, followed by a year-long peace deal signed in July by the Lower Kurram and Sadda tribes.
In April, three people were killed and several others went missing when unidentified assailants attacked a group of people travelling from Parachinar to Peshawar in the Bagan area of Lower Kurram, triggering protests across the tribal district.

The disturbances that rocked Southeast Asia’s biggest economy last week were sparked by discontent over economic inequality and lavish perks for lawmakers.
They later widened to include anger against police after footage circulated of the killing of a young driver by a paramilitary unit.
The state-affiliated National Commission on Human Rights, or Komnas HAM, told AFP on Wednesday that it had received reports that 10 people had died.
“There are indications that some of them were victims of authorities’ excessive force,” Anis Hidayah, the head of the group, said.
The deaths were reported in the jurisdictions of Greater Jakarta, Makassar in South Sulawesi, Central Java, and Papua, she said.
Komnas HAM also reported that more than 900 people were injured and thousands detained, although most of them have since been released.
“Many other locations have not reported (any) findings; there is a possibility the figures will rise,” Anis said.
AFP previously verified at least six deaths related to the protests since last week.
The unrest in multiple cities across Indonesia was the worst since President Prabowo Subianto took power last year and forced the ex-general into a U-turn on perks for legislators.
An Indonesian NGO, the Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI), also reported 10 deaths and hundreds injured.
Amnesty International Indonesia reported the same death toll and urged the government to “conduct an independent investigation”.
The Commission for the Disappeared and Victims of Violence (KontraS) said at least 20 people were still missing as of Monday.
 
 

The protests initially forced Prabowo to cancel a planned trip to China, but State Secretariat Minister Prasetyo Hadi said late on Tuesday that the president would visit after all, after deciding that the situation had calmed down.
Prabowo attended a grand military parade in Beijing on Wednesday and is scheduled to have a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.
The United Nations’ human rights office also called for “prompt, thorough, and transparent investigations into all alleged violations of international human rights law”.
The National Police did not respond immediately to an AFP request for comment.</p><small>2025-09-03 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0310345743180b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939363/republican-us-house-committee-releases-thousands-of-epstein-files' target='_blank'><strong>Republican US House committee releases thousands of Epstein files</strong></a><br><p>A Republican-led US House of Representatives committee on Tuesday said it released more than 33,000 pages of files on the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as party leadership looked to end a push by a bipartisan pair of lawmakers to force a vote on the matter.
The case of Epstein, who died by suicide in prison in 2019, has caused a political headache for Republican President Donald Trump, after many of his supporters embraced a slew of conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein.
A July Reuters/Ipsos poll found that majorities of Americans and of Trump’s Republicans believe the government is hiding details on the case.
The files released on Tuesday largely included court documents and other previously released information.
“Nearly everything Republicans just supposedly ‘released’ … has already been released,” said Democratic US Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts in a post on X.
 






 






Republican US Representative Thomas Massie and Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, have proposed a measure that would require the Justice Department (DOJ) to release all of its unclassified Epstein records, including those held by the FBI and US attorneys’ offices.
 






Massie and Khanna will hold a press conference with Epstein victims on Wednesday morning. Massie told the Axios news outlet on Tuesday that he would push ahead despite the latest document release.
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Massie’s petition was “inartfully drafted” because it lacked language that would protect the identities of victims who were sexually abused by Epstein.
 
 

Johnson also said the petition is “moot” due to the work of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which released thousands of pages of files.
“It’s superfluous at this point, and I think we’re achieving the desired end here,” Johnson said.
The materials released on Tuesday included at least eight videos of apparent police interviews with victims. Several of the interviews are timestamped from 2005 and 2006.
In one video, a girl whose appearance and name are edited out said Epstein paid her $350 for a massage and sex when she was 17 years old.
 
 

“He has the girls take off their clothes and give him a massage,” she said in the 17-minute video.
Other records include audio recordings from the criminal investigation of Epstein in Florida, including what appeared to be an interview with a victim whose name and date of birth were edited out.
The committee has subpoenaed the DOJ and Epstein’s estate for documents and convicted Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell for a deposition.</p><small>2025-09-03 05:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/03095506bf9fc9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939320/gb-to-auction-hunting-permits-for-118-animals' target='_blank'><strong>GB to auction hunting permits for 118 animals</strong></a><br><p>GILGIT: The Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) Wildlife and Parks Department will auction permits for 118 animals — including four Astore markhors, 100 Himalayan ibex, and 14 blue sheep — for the 2025–26 hunting season.
The bidding ceremony is scheduled to be held today (Wednesday) at the Forest, Parks and Wildlife Complex in Gilgit.
For the upcoming season, the base price of an Astore markhor permit has been raised to $200,000, while blue sheep and Himalayan ibex permits are set at $30,000 and $10,000, respectively.
 
 

Last year, the base rates were lower: $150,000 for markhor, $9,000 for blue sheep, and $5,500 for ibex. In the 2024-25 season, 118 permits were offered, but only 60 were purchased. The highest bid for a markhor reached $161,000, earning the GB government more than Rs30 million.
Officials note that prices in other regions, such as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, can reach $500,000 for markhor hunts. However, local outfitters and tour operators argue the sharp fee hikes are damaging their businesses and discouraging international clients. They warn of losses for both outfitters and the local communities who rely on trophy hunting revenue.

Only half of the permits offered in last season found buyers amid various challenges

Ikram Beg, a Gilgit-based outfitter, said participation in the programme has dropped due to inflated rates, causing “devastating” impacts on livelihoods.
Similarly, Syed Sumsam Ali Bokhari, chairman of Safari Club International Pakistan Chapter, warned that rising prices undermine Pakistan’s competitiveness compared to neighbouring countries.
 
 

In Tajikistan, a markhor hunt costs about $160,000 including logistics; in Nepal, blue sheep hunts average $29,000; and ibex hunts in Central Asia range between $8,500 and $9,900.
Mr Bokhari added that security concerns, geopolitical tensions, and recent terrorist attacks in hunting regions such as Chitral further reduced the country’s attractiveness as a destination.
He urged the GB wildlife department to reconsider its pricing strategy to align with regional market trends.
Launched in 1990 in Bar Valley, Nagar, GB’s trophy hunting programme involves local communities, who receive about 80 per cent of hunting revenues for conservation and development projects.
While it has been credited with protecting endangered species, stakeholders fear the latest price hikes could jeopardise its sustainability.

• PTI boycotts NA proceedings, holds parallel ‘public assembly’ outside Parliament House
ISLAMABAD: Differences within the federal cabinet surfaced on Tuesday during a National Assembly debate on the flood crisis when Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi openly criticised Defence Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif for his remarks on the government’s handling of the disaster.
Although he did not name his cabinet colleague, Mr Abbasi made multiple references to the defence minister’s speech on the floor of the house a day earlier.
He even suggested that Mr Asif resign from the cabinet instead of “levelling allegations against parliament and abusing bureaucracy only to gain [media] publicity”.
Meanwhile, members of the opposition PTI boycotted the proceedings and staged a parallel “public assembly” outside Parliament House to protest alleged political victimisation.
Speaking in the debate, Mr Abbasi accused some politicians of attacking institutions simply to go viral on social media. “If this is all they have to say, they should leave the government benches and sit in the opposition, because such language does not suit treasury members,” said Mr Abbasi, who was elected MNA from Rawalpindi.
 


On Monday, Khawaja Asif had described the recent devastation as a “man-made disaster”, blaming politicians and bureaucrats for unchecked encroachments on waterways and for allowing housing societies and hotels on riverbeds.
He also urged local government elections, criticising his own party’s government in Punjab for failing to hold them.
He also blamed a “contracting company” for the flood devastation in his home constituency, Sialkot.
Responding to the defence minister’s speech, Mr Abbasi said that those who had been a part of the system for the past 40 years were now criticising the system and “demanding local government elections”.
Mr Abbasi took the floor when Mr Asif had already left the assembly hall after briefly attending the proceedings.
“Does a contractor dare to carry out substandard work and run away with money in Rawalpindi?” said Mr Abbasi, stating that it was the responsibility of the MNAs to keep a check on such activities.
He said blaming the entire bureaucracy was unfair, noting that the obsession with going viral in politics had become a “disease”. “I have seen politicians resigning from the cabinet whenever a finger is raised at them. They left the ministry but stayed in the party,” he said while indirectly suggesting the defence minister resign from the cabinet.
Federal Minister for Water Resources Mueen Wattoo said surveys were underway to assess flood-related losses, including damage to crops, livestock, and houses, with compensation to be provided to all affected families. He said estimates were being finalised to ensure timely financial assistance.
PTI’s protest
Earlier, before leading a walkout, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said his party was standing with the flood victims and the leadership had already directed the party workers to visit the affected areas.
However, he said the party had decided to boycott the National Assembly proceedings to protest the policies of the “fascist” government, adding that the PTI members had already submitted their resignations from the standing committees.
 






Meanwhile, talking to reporters after his meeting with former prime minister Imran Khan at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party’s decision to resign from standing committees was “final and irreversible”.
Quoting the jailed former prime minister, he reportedly said that Imran Khan fully endorsed the party’s decision to boycott by-elections and supported the resignations submitted by members from parliamentary committees.

• Five security men martyred in Kech IED blast
QUETTA: At least 13 people were killed and 35 others injured in a suicide bombing near Shahwani Stadium in the Sariab area here on Tuesday night, shortly after the conclusion of a public meeting of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal) held to mark the death anniversary of the late Sardar Attaullah Mengal.
BNP President and MNA Sardar Akhtar Mengal, who presided over the gathering, remained unhurt as the blast occurred when he was leaving for home. Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Asghar Khan Achakzai of the Awami National Party (ANP), and former senator Mir Kabeer Muhammad Shai of the National Party were also present, but escaped unhurt.
However, former BNP MPA Mir Ahmed Nawaz Baloch and the party’s central labour secretary Musa Jan were among those injured along with several party workers and supporters.
“We have received 13 bodies and 35 injured at the hospital,” Dr Wasim Baig told Dawn, adding that the condition of several injured was critical.
Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Hamza Shafqaat, however, confirmed the death toll at 11 at that time. “So far, 11 people have lost their lives while over 30 are injured,” he said, warning that the toll could rise as many were in serious condition.
 
 

Officials confirmed it was a suicide attack. The bomber detonated his explosives-laden jacket in the parking area as participants were leaving the meeting.
According to police, the explosion occurred about 15 minutes after the meeting ended, when crowds were dispersing.
“The blast took place in the parking area of the stadium,” said BNP’s senior vice president Sajid Tareen, adding that Sardar Mengal was still present at the time but later reached home safely.
Six vehicles, including bulletproof cars belonging to politicians, were damaged in the explosion. Mir Kabeer Muhammad Shai survived as he was inside his bulletproof vehicle when the blast occurred.
In a late-night statement, the Balochistan Home Department said a high-level investigation had been ordered. Authorities had collected evidence from the site, it said, adding that the injured were being provided the best possible medical care.
The deceased were identified as Muhammad Ishaq, Najeebullah, Shan, Muhammad Hanif, Madad Khan, Waqir Ahmed, Hafeez, Abdul Nabi, Nasarullah, Allah Bakhsh, Najeebullah, son of Asadullah, Allah Bakhsh and Muhammad Waqar.
Kech IED blast
Separately, five security personnel were martyred and three others injured on  Tuesday when a convoy of security forces was targeted in a blast in the  Buleda area of Kech district, near the Pakistan-Iran border.
Officials said the convoy of Frontier Corps personnel was passing near Babar Post when a powerful explosion struck one of the vehicles.  Five soldiers lost their lives in the attack, while three others sustained injuries.
A senior security official confirmed that the blast occurred close to the convoy. He said an improvised explosive device (IED),  planted by unidentified miscreants on the roadside, was detonated when the convoy was passing through the area.
