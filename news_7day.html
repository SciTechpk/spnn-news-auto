As the session — chaired by NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq — commenced, opposition lawmakers erupted into anti-government slogans. Starting his speech, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the budget was being presented at a “historic moment” marked by national unity and resolve, referencing the recent Pakistan-India conflict.
“The spirit with which we protected our national sovereignty, we need to ensure our financial security in the same way,” he maintained, continuing his speech through the noisy session.
“Pakistan has now achieved economic stability and is moving towards a Pakistan that is prosperous.”
The minister highlighted the current account surplus, remittances, and the stability of the rupee while also mentioning the positive reports from international credit rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch that upgraded Pakistan’s rating.

The federal budget for fiscal year 2026 has a total outlay — the sum of expenditures and net lending of funds — of Rs17.573 trillion, representing a 6.9 per cent decrease from the previous year’s budget.

 


The government has proposed Rs16,286bn for current expenditure in the FY26 budget, a 5.33pc decrease from the previous year.
 


Interest payments, or debt servicing, have contracted by 16 per cent to Rs8,207bn, yet continue to consume almost half of the total budget outlay and becoming, like in the last few years, the government’s single largest expense.
 


Defence expenditure constitutes Rs2,550bn, 20.2pc higher than last year’s budget, making up 1.97pc of GDP, an increase from last year’s 1.71pc.
 


 


 


Aurangzeb said that it was unavoidable to aim for a 14pc tax-to-GDP ratio and added that achieving the national targets was “impossible without the transformation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).”
The government has set an ambitious tax collection target for the FBR at Rs14,131 billion, an 8.95pc increase from last year’s goal.
Detailing that transformation, the minister listed B2B e-voicing, AI-based audit selection systems for sales and income tax, e-billing and faceless audits, and a new central control unit to centralise data collection, among other steps.

Expanding upon the results, he said 390,000 high-value non-filers of tax were identified through data integration, with Rs300m recovered. The minister further highlighted that there was a 100pc increase in the number of tax filers, taking the revenues to Rs105bn.
“For the first time, the IMF (International Monetary Fund) has acknowledged Rs389bn revenues through law enforcement,” he said.
Speaking on tax revenues, he said the tax-to-GDP ratio was only 8.8pc in June 2024, which was raised to 10.3pc in the first nine months of FY2025, and would reach 10.4pc by the end of June.
The government’s revenue was now at 11.6pc, including the provinces’ 0.8pc contributions.
“The FBR has increased tax-to-GDP ratio by 1.6pc, which is historic not just in Pakistan but the world,” he asserted.
Aurangzeb also announced tax relief measures for the salaried class, stating that the government planned to reduce the tax slabs, “balancing inflation and take-home [income]”.
Those earning between Rs0.6m and Rs1.2m would pay a 2.5pc tax, those with income greater than Rs1.2m and less than Rs2.5m would pay an 11pc tax, with those earning above that and till Rs3.2m would need to pay a 23pc tax.
For the corporate sector, the minister said it was being proposed to reduce the super tax rate for corporations earning between Rs200m-Rs500m annually to 5pc.
Aurangzeb said that the federal government’s non-tax revenue target would be Rs5.15tr, with pure earnings of Rs11.08tr.
He added that the total expenditure is aimed at Rs17.58tr, out of which Rs8.21 would be for payments of mark up.
For the defence sector, for which Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the budget share would be increased, Rs2.55tr would be allocated.
Civil administration expenditure would be Rs0.97tr, pension expenditure Rs1.06bn, power and other sectors Rs1.19bn, according to Aurangzeb.
The minister detailed Rs1.93tr worth of grants allocated for AJK, GB and KP’s merged districts, including for BISP and education.
He also took a jibe at those “who were raising alarm about a mini-budget”, adding that no such move had been taken by the government.
The finance czar said that there was a 31pc reduction in electricity prices, as well as 50pc reduction in prices for protected consumers.
Mentioning the privatisation of distribution companies, he said: “Professional boards have been cleared of political corruption.”
The minister went on to announce that the government had made plans to “procure cheap energy”.  Noting the closure of costly power plants and reforms in the oil and gas sector, he said Turkish and other international companies were willing to invest in Pakistan.

He mentioned the $5bn investment pledge by Reko Diq and pointed out fuel price deregulation aimed to promote competition.
“Gold mines in Reko Diq are a key part of our future. The plan’s feasibility study was completed in January,” he noted.
“We expect $71bn in cash flows [as well as] $7bn in tax and $8bn in royalties,” he said, terming the project a “game changer”.
Detailing the steps to be taken under the National Tariff Policy, Aurangzeb said additional customs duties will come to an end in four years, regulatory duties will end in five years, Customs Act’s Schedule 5 will also be eliminated in five years, and customs duty will be structured in slabs, with the maximum being 15pc.
“Tariff reforms will be applied step by step so that businesses can adjust and challenges are reduced. This will apply to all economic areas, including pharma, IT, telecom, textile and engineering.”
Quoting the World Bank, Aurangzeb informed the NA that these instruments would lower the tariffs, bringing them to the same level as Vietnam and Indonesia.
He then spoke about improving debt management and said: “Our economy has been stuck in debt for two decades, paying back loans. Our debt-to-GDP ratio was 74pc two years ago. But now, it is below 70pc. We will lower it further.
“We are diversifying debt products, the Sukuk bond has been started and launching products is being considered.”
The minister stressed that reforms in loss-making state-owned enterprises were underway, along with steps being taken to reduce fiscal strain and invite investment.
“We will complete PIA (Pakistan International Airlines) and Roosevelt Hotel transactions this year,” he asserted.
On pension reforms, the minister highlighted that the increase in pensions had been “linked” to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Pointing out that Pakistan was one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, the minister underscored the need for foreign assistance in mitigation, noting the IMF’s $1.3bn climate fund.
On social protection, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to helping the underprivileged, stating that Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) helped over 11m children go to school.
He added that 1.5m pregnant mothers and children were given funds, while 250,000 were granted training on financial literacy.
Speaking about the digital sector, Aurangzeb noted that Pakistan’s cybersecurity ranking was rising. “There has been $3.1bn in IT exports in the year’s 10 months, which is 21.2pc more than the previous year,” he said.
The minister proposed raising IT exports to $25bn in the next five years.
Aurangzeb informed the parliament that the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority had launched a three-year plan for financing small and medium enterprises.
He said that under the SME risk coverage scheme, 95,000 SMEs had received Rs300bn in funding till May 2025.
Announcing measures for the construction sector, Aurangzeb said withholding tax slabs for property buying would be reduced from 4pc to 2.5pc, from 3.5pc to 2pc, and from 3pc to 1.5pc.
He further said that construction loans and mortgage financing for low-cost housing, as well as a tax credit on 10-marla houses and 2,000 flats, would be introduced.
“To promote mortgage financing we want to get on with it, guaranteer system will be introduced,” he said.
The minister added that e-commerce platforms and courier services would also be taxed. “Digital economy should contribute to revenues,” he stressed.
He noted that pensioners below the age of 70 were getting over Rs100m collectively in pensions, so a 5pc tax would be applied to their income.
However, there would be no tax on low-to-medium income pension-earners.
Expanding on the new classification system for income tax, Aurangzeb said the difference between filers and non-filers would end. Only those who file their tax returns would be able to carry out huge transactions, including sale and buy of cars, and bank accounts.
On the topic of overseas Pakistanis, he noted $31.2bn were remitted to Pakistan, recording a 31pc increase of $10bn.
He affirmed that the government was taking steps for overseas Pakistanis, including an online system, civil procedure laws to prevent fraud, a quota in chartered medical schools, and civil awards for the top 15 senders.
Speaking about the agricultural sector, which comprises 34pc of the economy, Aurangzeb said Rs2.64bn were earned in FY24-25, adding that the National Seed Policy 2025 and the National Agri Technology Policy 2025 had been “nearly approved”.
Announcing the government’s plan to create a “competitive economy”, Aurangzeb said that economic growth in the upcoming fiscal year was expected to remain 4.2pc.
 


Regarding the fiscal deficit, the government aims for a lower target of 3.9pc of the GDP — or Rs5,037bn — from last fiscal year’s target of 5.9pc. The primary surplus would be targeted at 2.4pc of the GDP.

The government has set an inflation target of 7.5pc for the next fiscal year.

Pakistan’s total revenue for fiscal year 2025 is budgeted at Rs19,278 billion.
After accounting for provincial transfers of Rs8,206 billion, the net revenue stands at Rs11,702bn, representing a 6.7pc increase from the previous year.
 


The government has allocated Rs4,223.8bn for the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) in FY25, an 11.4pc increase from last year’s Rs3,792.2bn.
The total federal PSDP, which includes state-owned enterprises and public-private partnerships, has contracted with Rs1,354.8 billion, representing a 20pc decrease from last year’s Rs1,696 billion.
Provincial PSDP allocation, on the other hand, has risen 36.9pc to Rs2,869 billion, up from Rs2,095 billion in the previous year.
 


The minister also praised the Strategic Investment and Facilitation Council (SIFC) for taking forward “strategic brownfield and greenfield projects”.
“Interprovincial and interfederal connection improved,” he added.
Referring again to the recent Pakistan-India conflict, Aurangzeb stressed the need for the country to increase its water reservoirs and ensure water security.
Under the 2018 National Water Policy, he mentioned the goals of 10m-acre increase in water storage, 35pc reduction in water waste and 30pc increase in water-use efficiency.
He detailed that Rs133bn would be allocated for projects, Rs34bn for investment and Rs2bn for 15 key schemes, detailing the breakdown for various dams.
Regarding the energy sector, the minister said that the government needed to ensure the provision of cheap energy.

He said that 47 schemes and Rs90.2bn were allocated to the energy sector, including Rs840m for the Tarbela 5th Extension, Rs10.9bn for the Dasu hydel project, Rs3.5bn for the 884MW Suki-Kinari Hydropower Project, and Rs35.7bn for the Momand hydel dam.
The allocations for other power projects included Rs4.4bn for the Allama Iqbal Industrial City grid station, Rs1.1bn for the Quaid-i-Azam Business Park, Rs1.6bn for the 100KVA and 200KVA transformers asset performance management system, Rs2.9bn for the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) advanced metering infrastructure, Rs1.8bn for the Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO) getting, Rs1.9bn for the Hyderabad getting, Rs2.4bn for the Peshawar getting, Rs67.2bn for the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) clean electricity scheme, Rs3bn for five energy schemes of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan, and 1.2bn for GB grids.
He also mentioned the Matiari-Moro-Rahim Yar Khan Transmission Line project to strengthen transmission.
The finance minister once again shed light on the agricultural sector, saying that fields were being revived under the Green Pakistan Initiative.
 






“Genetic improvement and post-harvest processes will be focused on,” he said, adding that a total of 1,000 agriculture graduates had been sent to China on government-funded programmes. He also announced five new livestock schemes.
Aurangzeb said the Higher Education Commission (HEC) would be receiving Rs39.5bn for 170 projects, of which Rs38.5bn would be set aside for the provinces.
He added that electric wheelchairs, laptops and other audiovisual aids would be distributed under the programme.
For the IT sector, he said the government had proposed Rs4.8bn for ongoing projects under the Uraan Pakistan plan. The schemes included TV modules, a Pakistan-Korea testing facility, and a printed circuit board facility.
To bridge the illiteracy gap, the minister said Rs9.8bn will be allocated for 11 new Daanish Schools — four in Balochistan, three in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, three in GB and one in Islamabad.
Speaking about the Public Sector Development Programmes (PSDP), the minister said a total of Rs18.5bn had been earmarked for those, of which Rs3bn were for the prime minister’s scheme to rebuild flood-damaged schools in Sindh.
“A total of Rs4.3bn [have been allocated] for the PM’s Youth Skill Development programme, under which 165,100 young people receive skills training,” he added.
On the health side, Rs14.3bn had been allocated for 21 schemes under the PSDP.
“Jinnah Medical Complex and Research Centre will get Rs4bn for a flagship teaching and treatment facility in the capital […] Rs1bn will be given to eradicate hepatitis,” he highlighted.
The minister added that Rs800m of these would be allocated for controlling and preventing diabetes, while Rs900m would be earmarked for a stroke centre at Pims Hospital in Islamabad.
Aurangzeb also detailed planned budget shares for AJK, GB and the merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Out of a total of Rs164bn allocated for development projects, Rs48bn each would be set aside for AJK and GB, while Rs68bn would be for KP’s merged districts,” he said.
‘What have the elite done?’
Before the session, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, following a meeting of the federal cabinet, questioned the contributions made to the national exchequer by the country’s elite economic group, ahead of the presentation of the budget for FY26.
“Today, the federal cabinet will discuss the budget and give its approval. In the previous quarter year, the entire nation has faced these challenges. This is in no way an ordinary achievement.
“The sacrifices the common man has made, the burden the salaried class has borne in the previous budget. They say ‘we are salaried [class] but still gave Rs400bn to the treasury […] what have the elite and the wealthy groups contributed compared to us?’,” he added.
“This is a question that the elite, including me, have to answer,” the premier noted.
He further said, “Pakistan is standing at a point where we have to take off,” adding that the country’s stability indicators were satisfactory.
“Be it the inflation rate, be it the policy rate, your exports increased, your remittances have seen a quantum jump, your IT exports have increased, and they have a lot of potential to increase.”</p><small>2025-06-10 15:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10190611c222e5b.jpg?r=190613' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312/iran-says-new-round-of-us-talks-planned-for-sunday' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says new round of US talks planned for Sunday</strong></a><br><p>The sixth round of Iran-US nuclear talks is planned for Sunday, Tehran said as the two sides appear locked in a standoff over uranium enrichment nearly two months into the high-stakes negotiations.
Iran has said it would present a counter-proposal to the latest draft from Washington, criticised by Tehran for failing to offer sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
“The next round of Iran-US indirect talks is being planned for next Sunday in Muscat,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement on Tuesday.
There was no immediate comment from mediator Oman, which has hosted some of the previous rounds, while Washington has said the talks could be held as early as Thursday.
The longtime foes have held five rounds of negotiations since April, the highest level contact since President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from a 2015 nuclear accord during his first term.
Trump has said the next meeting was expected on Thursday, although a source familiar with preparations said it would more likely be on Friday or Saturday.
Iran’s top negotiator, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, will be attending the annual Oslo Forum in Norway on Thursday, his office said.
On May 31, after the fifth round of talks, Iran said it had received “elements” of a US proposal for an agreement, which Araghchi has criticised for its “ambiguities”.
Tehran has said the offer failed to include issues raised in previous negotiations including the lifting of sanctions — a key demand for Tehran, which has been reeling under their weight for years.
On Monday, foreign ministry spokesperson Baqaei said Iran would present a “reasonable, logical and balanced” counter-proposal.
‘National interests’
Trump said that the next round of talks could make it clear if a nuclear deal is possible to avoid military action.
In a key sticking point, Tehran has defended its right to enrich uranium as “non-negotiable”, while Washington called any Iranian enrichment a “red line”.
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set in the 2015 deal and close though still short of the 90pc needed for a nuclear warhead.
Western countries, including the United States and its ally Israel, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire atomic weapons, while Tehran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.
In an interview published on Tuesday, Iranian deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said there was no “deadlock” in the talks, and that the next round would be the first in which the parties discuss “any written material”.
“Any negotiations with an international dimension come with their own sensitivities and require a great deal of patience for them to reach a result,” he told the official IRNA news agency.
“What matters to us is that we can safeguard the national interests of the country through these talks, and that is how we proceed.” In a statement issued on Tuesday, a group of Iranian lawmakers accused the United States of turning the negotiations into a “strategic trap” in coordination with Israel.
They said Washington’s “aim is to impose demands through coercion, adopting positions that are insulting and entirely incompatible with the legitimate rights of the Iranian people.”
‘Less than satisfactory’
On Monday, the United Nations nuclear watchdog began a Board of Governors meeting in Vienna that will last until Friday to discuss Iran’s atomic activities and other issues.
The International Atomic Energy Agency meeting followed a report issued by it criticising “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
Iran has criticised the IAEA report as unbalanced, saying it relied on “forged documents” provided by its arch foe Israel.
On Tuesday, Araghchi reiterated criticism of a plan by European powers and the United States to adopt a resolution at the IAEA meeting that would accuse Tehran of non-compliance with nuclear obligations.
“Any ill-considered and destructive decision in the Board of Governors against Iran will be met with an appropriate response,” Araghchi said during a phone call with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya.
Iran has said it would reduce cooperation with the IAEA if the resolution passed.
On Saturday, Tehran announced it had obtained a trove of Israeli intelligence in a covert operation, including files related to Israel’s undeclared nuclear facilities and defence plans.
 
 

It said the information would enable Iranian forces to launch counterattacks should Israel strike the Islamic republic.
Israel — an undeclared nuclear power — has repeatedly threatened that it could attack Iranian nuclear sites in warnings that have escalated since Tehran and Washington began talks.</p><small>2025-06-10 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10184247e37f80c.jpg?r=184253' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916311/income-tax-calculator-2025-26-how-does-the-new-budget-affect-your-salary' target='_blank'><strong>Income tax calculator 2025-26: How does the new budget affect your salary</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented the budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026 in the National Assembly on Tuesday.

Several students and at least one adult, as well as the suspected shooter, were among the dead, Mayor Elke Kahr confirmed to the Austrian press agency APA.
School shootings are much more rare in Europe than in the United States but in recent years, Europe has been shaken by attacks at schools and universities, that were not connected to terrorism.
“Currently, a police operation is underway … The reason for the deployment was that gunshots were heard in the building,” the police said on X, confirming the attack in the city of Graz.
Police and interior ministry officials could not immediately be reached by AFP.
“The situation is very unclear at the moment,” police sources told Austria’s APA news agency.
EU top diplomat Kaja Kallas declared herself “deeply shocked” Tuesday by reports of the shooting.
“Every child should feel safe at school and be able to learn free from fear and violence,” Kallas posted on X. “My thoughts are with the victims, their families and the Austrian people in this dark moment.”
 






Attacks in public are rare in the Alpine nation of almost 9.2 million people. It ranks among the ten safest countries in the world, according to the Global Peace Index.
In January 2025, an 18-year-old man fatally stabbed a high school student and a teacher at a school in northeastern Slovakia.
In December 2024, a 19-year-old man stabbed a seven-year-old student to death and injured several others at a primary school in Zagreb, Croatia.
In December 2023, an attack by a student at a university in central Prague left 14 people dead and 25 injured.
A few months earlier that year, a 13-year-old gunned down eight fellow classmates and a security guard at an elementary school in downtown Belgrade.  Six children and a teacher were also injured. The shooter contacted the police, who arrested him.
In 2009, nine pupils, three teachers and three passers-by were killed in a school shooting at Winnenden in southern Germany by a former pupil who then killed himself.</p><small>2025-06-10 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10153009f20555f.jpg?r=155745' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916296/sindh-govt-bans-parking-on-karachis-wall-street-to-ease-traffic-flow' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt bans parking on Karachi’s ‘Wall Street’ to ease traffic flow</strong></a><br><p>The provincial government on Tuesday said it has decided to implement strict rules to improve traffic flow and prohibit parking on Karachi’s I.I. Chundrigarh Road — often known as the city’s ‘Wall Street’ — to tighten traffic regulation enforcement and improve road safety.
Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah issued the instructions after receiving a briefing on traffic management in the metropolis, a statement issued by his spokesperson, Abdur Rasheed Channa, said.
According to the statement, parking will be prohibited on I.I. Chundrigar Road, beginning from Shaheen Complex to the Merewether Tower. CM Shah also directed the authorities concerned to ban parking for all types of vehicles from Muhammad Bin Qasim Road to Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road up to the S.M. Law College.
I.I. Chundrigar Road, a major road in the city’s central business district, is often referred to as Karachi’s “Wall Street”. The road is a significant financial hub, serving as the location for the Pakistan Stock Exchange, major banks, and other financial institutions.
The chief minister was informed by traffic police authorities that parking on pavements and main roads will be banned alike, but motorists will be allowed to park their vehicles on Railway Ground.
Murad said that action should be taken against traffic rules violations and illegal parking, and vehicles with fancy or illegal number plates should be confiscated.
CM Sindh was informed that a crackdown is underway against vehicles with unregistered or non-standard number plates, and only official number plates will be acceptable. Deputy Inspector General of Police (Traffic) Pir Muhammad Shah assured the chief minister that police were taking action to ensure the implementation of traffic rules.
The Sindh government had recently approved a set of changes, including a ban on four-seater rickshaws, mandatory third-party vehicle fitness checks, and sharp increases in traffic violation fines.
The government made it mandatory to acquire fitness certification for both commercial and non-commercial vehicles, and outsourcing vehicle fitness evaluations to third parties. It also decided to ban the sale of tinted windows, fancy lights, and sirens, whether online or at physical shops.
Fine were also imposed. For wrong-way driving, the approved fines were set at Rs200,000 for government vehicles, Rs100,000 for other four-wheelers and Rs25,000 for motorcycles.
Driving a vehicle without a valid licence will cost a fine of Rs25,000 for motorcyclists and Rs50,000 for car drivers. One-wheeling or drifting will result in a Rs100,000 fine for a first-time offence, going up to Rs200,000 and Rs300,000 for repeated violations, the government said.
These decisions were taken in the backdrop of a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024.</p><small>2025-06-10 11:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/100754534f18c02.jpg?r=075512' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916156/after-expanding-the-net-new-budget-will-focus-on-increasing-tax-rates' target='_blank'><strong>After expanding the net, new budget will focus on increasing tax rates</strong></a><br><p>• Many goods, services will now be taxed at higher rates
• Lower rates for digital payments versus cash transactions set to replace distinction between filers, non-filers
•  Some relief expected for salaried persons earning around Rs100,000 per month
ISLAMABAD: Facing limited room for fresh tax measures, the Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government has resorted to rebranding taxation — shifting from “broadening the tax base” to pursuing “equity” — in an effort to justify higher taxes on lower-income segments. This transition comes as the government eyes a record revenue target of nearly Rs14 trillion for FY26, a 22 per cent increase over projections for the outgoing fiscal year.
Tied to its commitments under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, the government estimates autonomous revenue collection at Rs12.845tr, based on 4.2pc GDP growth and 7.5pc inflation.
To meet the ambitious target, the government will need an additional Rs655 billion in new tax measures and another Rs400bn through enforcement — figures expected to be finalised in Tuesday’s cabinet meeting ahead of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s budget speech.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) faces significant challenges in meeting its tax collection targets, as doubts persist over its ability to enforce existing tax laws effectively.
Despite concerns about sluggish field operations, no substantial measures have been introduced to bolster enforcement in recent years. An initiative to provide operational vehicles to field officers was also withdrawn following backlash.
 
 

Meanwhile, Ministry of Finance officials continue to present optimistic projections, seemingly hoping for a tax windfall without acknowledging economic headwinds. Large-scale ind­us­tries remain in decline, while sectors like real estate and consumption goods bear the brunt of excessive taxation, further dampening economic activity.
With key industries contracting and consumer confidence fading, the feasibility of achieving ambitious revenue targets remains highly questionable in the next fiscal year.
The government’s proposed tax-to-GDP ratio target for FY26 is 12.3pc, comprising FBR’s share (10.6pc of GDP), provincial collections and the petroleum development levy (PDL).
Moreover, revenue collection could face further setbacks due to a lower-than-expected allocation for the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), which includes fewer new projects. The federal PSDP also remains notably smaller than those of Punjab and Sindh.
Compounding the issue, the federal government is now seeking financial contributions from Punjab and Sindh to fund dam construction, an unusual move that underscores fiscal limitations at the Centre. These factors create added pressure, as the federal government struggles to balance tax collection efforts with a constrained development budget.
From broadening to equity
Officials involved in tax policy formulation indicate that the government is now moving from tax broadening measures to a new approach centred on equity. This shift means lower tax rates on a wide range of goods and services will be raised, a move the FBR anticipates will generate maximum revenue.
Under the earlier broadening strategy, exemptions were systematically withdrawn, even on essential products like food, stationery items and books, to expand the tax base.
 
 

Now, in the second phase, the FBR is introducing “equity” as a justification for increasing lower tax rates across various sectors. This approach will result in a series of hikes in withholding tax rates, targeting dividends, stock markets and other financial transactions.
It is also proposed to levy taxes at the Thresher Unit Level, which would require the use of larger machines to improve the quality of tobacco processing — an effort aimed at increasing revenue collection from the tobacco sector.
At the same time, the FBR intends to implement a new concept of transactions using banking instruments, applying lower tax rates to digital transactions and higher rates to cash-based ones.
This concept will replace the current distinction between filers and non-filers.
However, the real test lies ahead — whether these increased tax rates will bolster revenue collection or further stifle economic activity, particularly as key industries and investment sectors struggle under mounting financial pressures. As part of its proposed new tax measures, the FBR is preparing to introduce a new tax on solar panels, processed food items and a carbon tax, signalling an effort to expand revenue streams amid fiscal constraints.
The tax measures are likely to spark concerns among consumers and businesses, particularly in the renewable energy sector. A tax on solar panels could dampen incentives for clean energy adoption at a time when Pakistan faces mounting electricity costs and energy shortages. Similarly, additional taxation on processed foods may lead to higher consumer prices, affecting household budgets.
However, in a move to provide temporary relief to the agricultural sector, the government has secured an exemption from the IMF on fertilisers and pesticides.
This exemption, extended for another year, will alleviate cost pressures on farmers struggling with rising input prices and uncertain market conditions.
While the government tightens fiscal measures in other sectors, some relief is expected for the salaried class in lower tax slabs. Officials indicate that the exemption limit may be further raised, alongside a lower tax rate for individuals earning around Rs100,000 per month.
Fiscal challenges
While this move aims to stimulate domestic manufacturing and enhance production capacity, it comes at a cost to government revenue. The reduction in import duties will significantly lower tax collection at the import stage, creating further fiscal challenges for an already strained revenue system.
The government is also considering extending the tax measures to former Fata and Pata members, who are exempt until June 30, 2025. This will be another area where the government plans to include tax measures in the budget. However, the Sindh government has asked the federal government to avoid all taxes, including the agriculture income tax on farm products.
Former FBR chairman Dr Irshad Ahmed criticised the government’s persistent reliance on policy measures, arguing that new tax measures alone would not resolve systemic revenue challenges. According to him, such additional revenue merely increases the burden on existing taxpayers while failing to expand the tax base effectively.
Dr Ahmed stressed that the core issue lies in enforcement, which requires a complete overhaul of the FBR’s field formations. He pointed out that officers remain confined to their offices with little access to potential taxpayers, rendering tax collection efforts ineffective.
He also recalled a previous attempt to establish strong tax offices at the district level, an initiative that was ultimately blocked by bureaucratic resistance.
Despite possessing ext­en­sive taxpayer data, FBR lacks the capacity to analyse it effectively and identify tax evaders. Add­ressing these gaps requires significant investment in capacity-building, infrastructure and operational enhancements — elements currently missing from the government’s strategy.
Without a robust enforcement framework, new revenue measures will provide only a temporary financial boost, while those outside the tax net continue to evade their dues.

However, energy experts in both the public and private sectors remain optimistic that this capacity payment burden — estimated at Rs12 to Rs15 per unit and passed on to consumers — will gradually decline, as the government has halted new power projects and terminated power purchase agreements (PPAs) with several independent power producers (IPPs).
“The issue of capacity payments is not considered very painful during summer, but it becomes more significant in winter when our total electricity demand drops to just 12,000-13,000 MW,” a senior official at the Ministry of Energy told Dawn on Monday.
According to the Economic Survey, the country’s total installed electricity generation capacity reached 46,605MW, with the energy mix comprising hydel (24.4 per cent), thermal (55.7pc), nuclear (7.8pc) and renewables (12.5pc).
 
 


Economic Survey puts total installed power generation capacity at 46,605MW

During July-March FY25, total electricity generation stood at 90,145GWh — hydel (30.4pc), thermal (46.3pc), nuclear (19.1pc), and renewables (4.2pc). Electricity consumption during the same period was 80,111GWh, with households accounting for 49.6pc, industrial users 26.3pc, agriculture 5.7pc, and commercial consumers 8.6pc.
According to the survey, six nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 3,530MW supplied 17,174 million units of electricity during July-March FY25.
The 46,605MW installed capacity includes an addition of over 2,800MW through solar net metering, reflecting a 1.6pc increase compared to the 45,888MW recorded in the corresponding period of FY24.
While thermal power still makes up the largest portion of the electricity supply at 55.7pc, its share has declined in recent years, indicating a shift towards more indigenous and sustainable sources. Hydel, nuclear and renewable sources now collectively account for 53.7pc of total electricity generation.
“If we examine the total installed capacity, almost 50pc comes from IPPs, including around 5,000MW from four RLNG plants owned by the Punjab and federal governments. Excluding these, the share of IPPs is around 16,000-17,000MW. Of this, 4,000-5,000MW worth of plants remain under annual maintenance. Meanwhile, the generation capacity of old government-owned plants at Guddu (Gencos) has also reduced to almost half or so. So, the generation from IPPs usually stays around 10,000MW during summer,” explained an official, on condition of anonymity.
According to him, total generation from IPPs, hydel, nuclear and other non-IPP sources ranges between 33,000MW and 34,000MW, while demand reaches around 32,000MW. “Thus, we roughly pay capacity charges for 1,000-2,000MW in summer and 3,000-5,000MW in winter, when hydel generation declines due to reduced water availability,” he said, adding that terminating PPAs with idle IPPs and halting new power projects would help reduce the overall tariffs.
Dr Fayyaz A. Chaudhry, chairman of the Board of Directors of National Grid Company of Pakistan (formerly NTDC), said the system’s firm capacity — the amount that can be dispatched to the power grid at any time — is around 40,000MW.
He noted that solar power generation, including 4,000-5,000MW from net-metered systems and additional non-net-metered capacity, is not considered firm capacity because it’s unavailable in the evening.

The segregated data showed that the literacy rate was 60.6pc, with men at 68pc compared to 52.8pc among women. During the first three quarters of the ongoing financial year, the education-related spending decreased 29.4 per cent, dropping to Rs899.6 billion from Rs1,251.06 billion. The position may increase by June as the expenditure data is only available for July-March, said the survey. The cumulative education expenditures by the federal and provincial governments in FY 2025 were estimated at 0.8pc of the GDP compared to 0.9pc in the health sector.
In the development budget for this financial year, Rs92.1 billion were earmarked for the education sector, including higher education. The Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training implemented 22 projects and programmes related to basic and college education, comprising 17 ongoing and five new initiatives, with a total allocation of Rs20.75 billion. This includes new Daanish school projects in Islamabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Balochistan. A budget of Rs5.5 billion had been allocated for these school projects.
 
 

“In FY 2023, 168.24 thousand functional primary schools with 506.02 thousand corresponding teachers were recorded in the country. Primary enrolment increased by 3.2 per cent, as the total number of students enroled increased to 24.61 million in FY 2023 compared to 23.85 million in FY 2022. However, it is estimated to increase by around 24.83 million in FY 2024,” the PES’s chapter 10 read.

Literacy rate at 60pc; primary enrolment increased by 3.2pc

The estimated data for enrolment, number of institutions and teachers for FY 2025 was not available; therefore, the estimated data for FY 2024 was considered for analysis, said the survey. It added that July 2025 onwards data would be incorporated in the Statistical Supplement of Pakistan Economic Survey, 2024-25.
“In FY 2023, 39.4 thousand secondary schools were functional, with 733.4 thousand teachers recorded nationwide. Secondary school enrolment increased by 5 per cent nationally, to 4.72 million in FY 2023 against 4.49 million in FY 2022. However, it is estimated to increase further by 3.8 per cent (i.e., from 4.72 million to 4.89 million) during FY 2024,” it added.
It said that enrolment of 0.65 million students in degree colleges is expected during FY 2024, as compared to 0.66 million in FY 2023. A total of 2573 degree colleges were found in FY 2023, with an estimated 2516 degree colleges for FY 2024. It added that the number of teachers in degree colleges was 60.13 thousand in FY 2023 and is projected to be 59.84 thousand in FY 2024.
There were 269 universities, with overall enrolment of students in higher education institutions recorded at 1.94 million in FY 2023, 13pc down compared to the previous year. According to the survey, “The enrolment is expected to increase by 0.8 per cent from 1.94 million in FY 2023 to 1.95 million in FY 2024.”
The survey said that in FY 2024, 4,563 technical and vocational institutes with 51.08 thousand teachers were functional nationally. “The enrolment was recorded at 0.45 million in FY 2023 compared to 0.44 million in FY 2022. However, it is estimated to increase by 1.1 per cent (i.e., from 0.45 million to 0.46 million) in FY 2024,” it added.

Sana Yousaf was shot dead at her residence in Sector G-13 in the presence of her mother and aunt by an unidentified man who fled the scene. Police arrested the suspect Omar Hayat within a few hours who police claimed murdered Sana because she repeatedly refused his advances.
Inspector General Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said the suspect was arrested from Faisalabad within 20 hours of the incident. A local court approved a 14-day judicial remand of the prime suspect to facilitate his identification parade.
Calling it a stark reminder of the violence women and girls face simply for asserting their rights, Aseefa extended her condolences to Sana’s family, the community in Chitral, and all those grieving this senseless loss.
“Sana was just a girl—with ambition, with dreams, with a life ahead of her,” Aseefa said in a statement. “She had every right to live freely and safely. What happened to her wasn’t just an act of violence — it was a punishment for saying no. And that should horrify every one of us.”
She highlighted that violence stemming from male entitlement is neither new nor rare—and must no longer be tolerated under the guise of culture or tradition.
“This mindset that a woman’s rejection is an insult, that her choices need to be controlled—it’s old, it’s cruel, and it’s killing our daughters. My mother, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, broke those walls with her own strength. She didn’t just lead—she opened doors for millions of women to follow. And we owe it to her legacy, and to young women like Sana, to keep those doors open.”
Addressing the wave of online abuse directed at Sana after her death, Aseefa rejected the idea that social media use or self-expression could ever be used to justify violence.
“There is nothing—no app, no photo, no video—that excuses murder. It’s disturbing to see people using Sana’s TikTok presence to explain away her death. If that’s the logic, are we saying millions of girls across Pakistan are also at risk? This kind of thinking is not just dangerous—it’s inhumane.”
She closed with a message of solidarity and defiance to young women across the country.
“To every girl watching this unfold—don’t let them silence you. You have the right to dream, to speak, to exist without fear. Don’t back down. If you do, they win. But if we keep pushing forward—together—we’ll shape a country where girls aren’t blamed for their own deaths, but celebrated for their lives.”
Teenager Sana Yousaf was well-known for her social media activities, with nearly 800,000 followers on her TikTok account and almost 500,000 on her Instagram account.</p><small>2025-06-10 08:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10163534a6a0a4f.gif?r=163540' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916176/another-kwsc-pipeline-bursts-at-karachi-university-amid-water-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>Another KWSC pipeline bursts at Karachi University amid water crisis</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: While the city continued to face a severe water crisis on Eid holidays, the dilapidated and outdated water distribution and supply infrastructure of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) once again played havoc with the University of Karachi (KU) after a 36-inch supply line burst, submerging the access to the cemetery on the campus on Eidul Azha.
The leakage, being repaired, inundated a large portion of the road leading to the university’s graveyard. People were forced to wade through the ankle-deep water to reach the graves of their near and dear ones for paying homage, a common practice during religious festivals.
Residents of the KU staff colony said that they had timely reported the leakage to the water utility, but it did not take immediate steps to plug the leakage.
Had the water utility acted promptly, a large amount of water would not have been wasted, besides saving people from the ordeal they went through on the Eid days, the residents lamented.
Earlier in April, a burst water main near KU, an 84-inch diameter pipeline, had led to a water crisis and flooding in on the campus, impacting residential and academic buildings, and causing significant losses for the university. The repair work had caused a severe water shortage and disruptions in the city’s water supply for over 10 days.
Chief Engineer Water Trunk Man (WTM) of the KWSC Syed Muhammad Ijaz said that a leakage had been reported in the joint of the 36-inch diameter line. “The repair work has been started, which will be completed soon,” he added.
The KWSC chief engineer said that the damaged line supplied water only to Scheme 33 and the repair work would not affect the regular supply to any other area in the city.
He said that water had been supplied to Scheme 33 as usual on Sunday night and now the next supply would be made on Thursday as per the schedule.
“During this time, the citizens will not face any kind of trouble or shortage,” he said.
The chief engineer further said that the repair work on the damaged line was in progress on an emergency basis and the technical team of the water utility was present on the spot.
“The repair process is being carried out rapidly so that the line can be fully functional soon,” he added.

Was there real growth in the outgoing financial year, or did the perpetually teetering economy fail to turn the tide? The survey has affirmative answers for both questions, so it’s really a matter of which indicators a person wants to weigh more.
The macro fundamentals have improved considerably. The headline Consumer Price Index inflation has dramatically declined, the current account balance is expected to be in surplus, the fiscal deficit is billed to decline to 5.5pc of GDP from the last five years’ average of 7.13pc, the debt-to-GDP ratio is down from 68pc to 65pc, the rupee has been stable since September 2023, workers’ remittances are rising and reserves have been rising.
These are the goods that have also been recognised by the IMF, other multilateral lenders and the global economic agencies.
But, there’s also the bad.
The economic growth is sluggish, agriculture and big industry are in serious trouble, exports are not increasing fast, large portions of the economy still operate in the shadows and tax burden remains lopsided, with more and more being squeezed out of the salaried class and corporate sector.
 


Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s press conference on Monday clearly showed he was focusing on the goods.“We needed to fundamentally change the economy’s DNA, and for that, we needed structural reforms which are elusive in this country,” the minister said, hinting towards failed past efforts to undertake critical economic reforms.
“We must resist the ’sugar rush. The last thing we want is to go through another round of boom and bust cycles,” the minister maintained.
Balancing tax burden
The minister’s optimism wasn’t shared by many who have repeatedly seen enthusiastic reforms being sacrificed at the altar of political expediency.
Economic experts wonder if the next budget — set to be announced today — would be any different from the previous ones.
Would it lay a foundation for the structural shift? Will there be serious efforts to broaden the tax base by targeting untaxed and under-taxed sectors to cut the fiscal deficit? Will there be reforms needed to boost exports?
Abdul Aleem, the chief executive of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the salaried class and the corporate sector have borne a “disproportionate share of tax burden for far too long”.
“It is putting a huge drag on investment, exports and economic growth,” he told Dawn last week.
“Enough is enough. This cannot go on any longer. Something’s got to give,” he said about the disproportionate taxation.
 
 

According to Mr Aleem, the government’s expenditure is rising, particularly defence. To meet this growing need for money, the tax structure would have to be overhauled to offload pressure on compliant taxpayers. This implies that the tax rates for the sectors shouldering excessive revenue burden would be cut, and for those not paying according to their size in the economy, increased.
On the face of it, this measure should provide relief to the salaried class and the corporate sector they have been imploring for. Yet, many suspect the government’s intentions and consider it a ploy to not touch the powerful lobbies with political clout.
The broadening of the tax net is also crucial for the government to build infrastructure for future growth.
The allocation for the public sector development projects as a ratio of the size of the economy is being curtailed every year to contain the fiscal deficit.
This means the government is spending less and less on people’s socioeconomic benefits.
Had development spending not been curtailed, the average fiscal deficit could have topped 10pc of GDP in the last five years, an economist said.
Industrial reforms
Fair taxation is not the only demand the government would have to address in the next budget.
The industry is also calling for measures to make the manufacturing sector cost-competitive in order to compete in international markets.
According to Gohar Ijaz, an industrialist, a “consistent 5-Year industrial and export policy” is essential to revive the sector. “Investors need predictability; the economy needs direction,” the former caretaker trade minister wrote in a social media post.
He also called for removing what he dubbed as a bias in the Export Facilitation Scheme against the domestic value chain.
The government has a very tight fiscal rope to walk. How will it balance demands for relief with the IMF’s goal of debt sustainability without structural tax reforms is anyone’s guess.

Moscow has kept up its attacks on Ukraine, which has hit back with strikes deep inside Russian territory, while peace talks held over the weekend failed to yield a breakthrough towards ending the three-year war.
Aside from an agreement to exchange prisoners, progress has stalled and Russia has repeatedly rejected calls for an unconditional ceasefire.
“Russia lies every day about its desire for peace and attacks people every day. Time to impose sanctions. Time to support Ukraine with weapons. Time to prove that democracy has power,” Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential office, said on Telegram.
A 59-year-old man was killed in the Russian strikes on residential buildings in Odesa on Tuesday, and at least four others were wounded, said Governor Oleg Kiper.
“The enemy massively attacked Odesa with strike drones. There is damage to civilian infrastructure and fires,” Kiper wrote on Telegram.
“The Russians hit a maternity hospital, an emergency medical ward and residential buildings,” he said, adding the maternity hospital had been evacuated in time.
“Stay in shelters! The massive attack on the capital continues,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram, adding in a separate post around 3am (5am PKT) that “a new batch of UAVs (drones) is flying to the capital”.
Four people were wounded in the attacks that hit at least seven districts, he said, with buildings and cars on fire.
Prisoner swap
Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine triggered the biggest European conflict since World War II, forcing millions to flee their homes and decimating much of eastern and southern Ukraine.
Ukrainian cities are targeted by Russian air strikes almost daily. On Sunday, Russia launched a record 479 explosive drones at Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian Air Force.
Kyiv has also carried out attacks on Russian territory, targeting transport and weapons production infrastructure.
Russia’s transport agency Rosaviatsia said on Tuesday that flight operations were temporarily restricted at Saint Petersburg’s Pulkovo airport. Similar restrictions were imposed on at least 13 other airports overnight, with four in Moscow reopening on Tuesday.
Despite efforts by US President Donald Trump to reach a ceasefire agreement, a second round of peace talks in Turkey are at a standstill.
The only concrete agreement reached at the talks over the weekend was for release all seriously wounded or sick prisoners of war and those under the age of 25 — a deal that did not specify the number of soldiers involved.
While welcoming POW exchanges, Zelensky said last week said it was “pointless” to hold further talks with the current Russian delegation — who he previously dismissed as “empty heads” — since they could not agree to a ceasefire.
On Sunday, the Russian army also claimed to have attacked the Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrovsk, which borders the regions of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia, already partially under Russian control, a first in more than three years of conflict.
“Time for everyone to finally accept the fact that Russia understands only strikes, not rational words,” Ukraine’s Yermak said on Tuesday, in a thinly veiled criticism of the Trump administration.
As a condition for halting its invasion, Russia has demanded that Ukraine cede the territories Moscow claims to have annexed and forswear joining NATO.
It has also rejected a proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire sought by Kyiv and the European Union, arguing that it would allow Ukrainian forces to rearm with Western deliveries.
Ukraine is demanding a complete Russian withdrawal of from its territory and security guarantees from the West, describing Moscow’s demands as “ultimatums”.</p><small>2025-06-10 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/10101922d6f0e94.jpg?r=111426' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916279/trump-administration-deploys-marines-to-la-vows-to-intensify-migrant-raids' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration deploys Marines to LA, vows to intensify migrant raids</strong></a><br><p>The Trump administration on Monday ordered US Marines into Los Angeles and intensified raids on suspected undocumented immigrants, fueling more outrage from street protesters and Democratic leaders who raised concerns over a national crisis.
Some 700 Marines based in Southern California were expected to reach Los Angeles Monday night or Tuesday morning, officials said, as part of a federal strategy to quell street demonstrations opposing the immigration raids, which are a part of a signature effort of President Donald Trump’s second term.
Although their mission to protect federal personnel and property is temporary — filling the gaps until a full contingent of 4,000 National Guard troops can reach Los Angeles — the deployment is an extraordinary use of military force in support of a police operation, and it comes over the objection of state and local leaders who did not request help.
Meanwhile, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem pledged to carry out even more operations to round up suspected immigration violators, extending a crackdown that provoked the protests. Trump officials have branded the protests as lawless and blamed state and local Democrats for permitting upheaval and protecting undocumented immigrants with sanctuary cities.
The military and federal enforcement operations have further polarised America’s two major political parties as Trump, a Republican, threatened to arrest California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, for resisting the federal crackdown.
California sued the Trump administration to block deployment of the National Guard and the Marines on Monday, arguing that it violates federal law and state sovereignty.
The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Jack Reed, said he was “gravely troubled” by Trump’s deployment of active-duty Marines.
“The president is forcibly overriding the authority of the governor and mayor and using the military as a political weapon. This unprecedented move threatens to turn a tense situation into a national crisis,” Reed said.
“Since our nation’s founding, the American people have been perfectly clear: we do not want the military conducting law enforcement on US soil,” he said.
The announcement that Marines would be deployed was made on the fourth straight day of protests. Late on Monday police began to disperse hundreds of demonstrators who gathered outside a federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles where immigrants have been held. Police said arrests were being made.
National Guard forces had formed a human barricade to keep people out of the building. Then a phalanx of police moved up the street, pushing people from the scene and firing “less lethal” munitions such as gas canisters. Police had used similar tactics since Friday.
Rare use of military
US Marines are known as the first American forces to establish and beachhead in US military interventions, and as the last forces to leave any occupation.
Though military forces have been deployed domestically for major disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the attacks of September 11, 2001, it is extremely rare for troops to be used domestically during civil disturbances.
Even without invoking the Insurrection Act, Trump can deploy Marines under certain conditions of law or under his authority as commander in chief.
The last time the military was used for direct police action under the Insurrection Act was in 1992, when the California governor at the time asked President George H.W. Bush to help respond to Los Angeles riots over the acquittal of police officers who beat Black motorist Rodney King.
Newsom contends it is his charge as governor to call in the National Guard, labeling Trump’s“ action as “an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”
Trump in turn said he supported a suggestion by his border czar Tom Homan that Newsom should be arrested over possible obstruction of his administration’s immigration enforcement measures. “I would do it if I were Tom. I think it’s great,” Trump told reporters.
Four days of protests
The protests so far have resulted in a few dozen arrests and some property damage.
“What is happening effects every American, everyone who wants to live free, regardless of how long their family has lived here,” said Marzita Cerrato, 42, a first-generation immigrant whose parents are from Mexico and Honduras.
Protests also sprang up in at least nine other US cities on Monday, including New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco, according to local news outlets.
In Austin, Texas, police fired nonlethal munitions and detained several people as they clashed with a crowd of several hundred protesters.
Before the Los Angeles dispersal, several hundred protesters outside a detention centre chanted “free them all,” flew Mexican and Central American flags, and directed sometimes-vulgar insults toward federal officers.
At dusk, officers had running confrontations with protesters who had scattered into the Little Tokyo section of the city. As people watched from apartment patios above street level, and as tourists huddled inside hotels, a large contingent of LAPD and officers and sheriffs deputies fired several flash bangs that boomed through side streets along with tear gas.
Homeland Security said its Immigration and Customs Enforcement division had arrested 2,000 immigration offenders per day in recent days, far above the 311 daily average in fiscal year 2024 under former President Joe Biden.
“We conducted more operations today than we did the day before and tomorrow we are going to double those efforts again,” Noem told Fox News’ “Hannity.”

What remains missing from the discourse, as usual, is the potential neglect for the development spending, which media reports suggest may be cut once again.
In FY25, the government had proudly proposed an outlay of Rs1.4 trillion under the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP). However, the optimism was short-lived, as within two weeks, the allocation was slashed by Rs250 billion. Though disappointing, the move was predictable, as the PSDP has been revised downward every year throughout the past decade, with an average cut of 17.3 per cent. In contrast, overall expenditure has mostly been adjusted upwards.
Time and again, development has emerged as the frontline item to be trimmed when fiscal pressures mount. It’s come to a point where the revised FY24 allocation of Rs659bn was lower than where it stood in FY16. As a percentage of the federal budget, the PSDP has slipped below 5pc — a concerning situation for any emerging economy.
These are nominal figures, so one can imagine what the real value loss would be. In dollar terms, PSDP for FY24 had plummeted to $2.3bn, less than half its value a decade ago. It’s true that after the 18th Amendment, the responsibility no longer lies with the centre, and provinces have to play an ever-greater role in financing public sector development, especially in devolved subjects like education and health.

With significant cuts in the PSDP, major chunks never translate into actual spending as key ministries utilise far less than what is available

On the first look, that does seem to be the case, as today, provinces now account for around 72pc of the national PSDP. In many cases, their allocations have grown or held steady, often prioritising health, education, and agriculture. But the vacuum left by the centre, especially in large-scale infrastructure and strategic initiatives, is hard to fill.
As part of the Karachi School of Business and Leadership’s latest policy note, we looked at the key trends in the federal PSDP to understand not only the government’s expected priority areas but also the efficiency in utilising the funds.
Historically, around half of all the federal PSDP funds, on average, have been earmarked for infrastructure projects, followed by the social sector, which has raked in almost a fifth of the proposed outlay. This is obviously understandable given that its two largest components, health and education, are provincial mandates under the 18th Amendment and are predominantly provisioned for in their respective budgets.
But the persistent cuts have now caught up with the most critical infrastructure needs of the country. At the sub-category level, transport has consistently been the most funded area, receiving roughly just under Rs1tr in original outlays over the last five years. However, its dominance is waning, as reflected by its share falling by 13 percentage points to 23pc by FY24. Once you start accounting for downward revisions, for which the data is unfortunately not particularly standardised, the picture looks even worse.
The funding mix also reveals a shift as the share of foreign currency in PSDP has fallen from 9pc in FY20 to 6pc by FY24, highlighting the government’s struggles in arranging external financing for development. Nonetheless, some ministries, such as Maritime Affairs and Aviation, have shown more resilience in this regard and managed to garner more sustainable support from international partners, in part due to China-Pakistan Economic Corridor-linked infrastructure projects. But for the most part, the centre has mostly pivoted toward rupee-based resources; whether by design or necessity is up for debate. However, allocations are only part of the story. The more worrying aspect is that a significant chunk of the PSDP may not translate into actual spending.
Even in FY24, only 80pc of the proposed funds were authorised, and some key ministries spent far less than what was available. While agencies like the National Transmission & Despatch Company and Railways exceeded 90pc utilisation, the Planning Division, ironically responsible for overseeing all development, spent just 17pc of its allocation. Similarly, among the 21 low-priority ministries, defined as those with proposed outlays of less than Rs5bn, there was persistently weak absorption with only six departments managing above-average utilisation rates, reflecting a deeper problem of execution bottlenecks and limited capacity.
These cuts, and the inefficiency in utilisation, are not without consequence. Public infrastructure investment, if executed well, has multiplier effects on productivity and economic output. But when projects are delayed, underfunded, or abandoned, the results are the opposite: inflated costs, decaying infrastructure, and waning investor confidence. It’s no surprise that Pakistan’s gross fixed capital formation has fallen to around 11.2pc of GDP, among the lowest in emerging markets.
Compounding the issue is Pakistan’s growing throw-forward of an estimated Rs10tr based on the current pipeline, as per the Planning Commission. Research by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics suggests that around a third of all projects are delayed, some by over a decade, and cost overruns are commonplace.
Clearly, the system needs a reset. While increasing allocations is required, it might not suffice. Arguably, there’s a need for Pakistan to not only clean its portfolio but also overhaul planning and execution frameworks. Public-private partnerships, long touted as a panacea, must be institutionalised and expanded with proper oversight and transparency. Success stories like the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway and Hattar Economic Zone offer templates, but scale and governance remain major hurdles.
The upcoming Uraan Pakistan initiative, the 13th five-year plan, proposes a much-needed pivot toward transparency, data-driven planning, and inclusive governance. But the clock is ticking. Without bold reforms, this vision might end up with the same fate of many before it: celebrated on paper, ignored in practice.

• Major crops down 13.5pc amid water crisis, restricting agriculture and overall GDP growth
• Industry, services underperform; large-scale manufacturing struggles for third straight year
• Inflation drops to 4.6pc, a 60-year low, amid declining interest rates
• Finance czar calls it ‘a gradual recovery’, promises ‘turnaround’ next year
• GDP growth reaches 2.68pc, missing 3.56pc target
ISLAMABAD: “Next year will be a turnaround story,” Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb promised on Monday as he unveiled the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 (PES) document, which highlighted widespread slippages across major sectors of the economy in the outgoing fiscal year.
Reviewing the economy report card, the finance minister suggested that Pakistan’s performance should be evaluated in a global context rather than a historical one.
He stated that while global economic growth has been on a declining trend, expanding 3.5pc in 2023, 3.3pc in 2024, and 2.8pc in 2025, Pakistan had progressed from a contraction of 0.2pc in 2023 to 2.5pc growth in 2024, with a further rise to almost 2.7pc this year.
“This is gradual recovery, and the right way to ensure sustainable growth,” he insisted, adding that no one wanted a return to the boom-and-bust cycles of the past.
 
 

The current year’s GDP growth will clock in at 2.68pc; well short of the 3.56pc target, although slightly improved from last year’s 2.5pc. It is below the five-year average of around 3.3pc, and well below Pakistan’s long-term average of over 4.5pc.
Mr Aurangzeb noted that global inflation stood at 2.6pc in 2023, rose to 2.7pc in 2024, and is projected to reach 3.1pc in 2025. In contrast, inflation in Pakistan had fallen from 29pc in 2023 to 23pc in 2024, and now to a six-decade low of 4.6pc.
“So, this too has moved in the right direction,” Mr Aurangzeb remarked, noting that the benchmark interest rate had been reduced by a cumulative 1,100 basis points during the current year to 11pc, down from a peak of 22pc. Resultantly, the public debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 68pc last year to 65pc, aided by the government’s buyback of approximately Rs1 trillion in debt, which created additional fiscal space, the minister said.
Missed targets
The Economic Survey data reveals that almost all major components of the economy missed targets. The finance minister singled out a 13.5pc contraction in major crops, which was estimated to have restricted the overall GDP growth rate by 0.6pc. The overall agriculture sector, which accounts for nearly 24pc of GDP, posted modest growth of 0.6pc this year, falling well short of the 2pc target and significantly below last year’s announced growth of 6.4pc. Major crops such as wheat, cotton, and maize contracted by 13.5pc, a sharper decline than an estimated 4.5pc.
This was primarily due to initial estimates of a 35pc water shortage, which were later revised down to 11-12pc. As a result, cotton ginning saw a 19pc decline, compared to last year’s growth of 0.1pc, and well below a targeted contraction limit of 2.3pc.
Meanwhile, the industrial sector was announced to have shown 4.8pc growth, surpassing the 4.4pc target. This triggered some pointed questions, however. A journalist commented that it seemed likely the industry’s performance would later be revised downward, given that an almost 1pc contraction had been reported for the first nine months of the current year.
Within industries, mining and quarrying contracted by 3.4pc against a growth target of 5pc, shrinking for the third consecutive year. Likewise, Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM), which contributes nearly 8pc to GDP, contracted by 1.5pc, falling far short of the growth target of 3.5pc.
This also marked the third consecutive year of struggles for LSM, which saw a 10pc contraction in fiscal ’23, followed by less than 1pc growth in fiscal ’24 (that too, owing to a low base effect), and followed by an additional 1.5pc contraction this year.
The services sector, which makes up nearly 59pc of GDP, was said to have posted growth of 2.9pc, well short of the 4.1pc target. Within the services sector, wholesale and retail trade, transport and storage, financial and insurance services, and private services all missed targets, whereas government services, education and similar sectors that outperformed expectations.
Separately, the investment-to-GDP ratio improved to 13.8pc in fiscal ’25, up from 13.1pc in fiscal ’24, although falling short of the 14.2pc target. Private investment grew by 9.1pc, slightly below the 9.7pc target. National savings also saw an improvement, rising to 14.1pc of GDP, surpassing the 13.3pc target.
Indian meddling
Mr Aurangzeb said structural reforms aimed at transforming the foundations of Pakistan’s economy would have remained elusive without the ongoing 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme. The programme, he noted, had supported taxation reforms that raised the tax-to-GDP ratio to a five-year high and contributed to a reduction in power sector losses.
The minister described the recent release of a $1bn tranche by the IMF as a major success, achieved “against all odds.” For the first time publicly, it was revealed that India had actively opposed the move.
“Just as our armed forces fought for a victory, a similar battle was being fought on the economic front,” he said, claiming that the Indian executive director at the IMF had made every effort to keep Pakistan’s case off the board’s agenda, or, if it was included, to block both the second instalment of the EFF as well as a new $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility, which is crucial for Pakistan’s climate adaptation financing needs.
But Pakistan’s bilateral allies and multilateral partners stood by the country and offered their support, Mr Aurangzeb said, while also acknowledging that this outcome would not have been possible without the strength of Pakistan’s economic performance.
Reform-centric budget
Mr Aurangzeb also stated that reforms in public finance, including pension reforms, rightsizing of government, and privatisation of public sector entities, would be pushed through, and this would be evident in the budget to be presented on Tuesday (today).
The minister avoided multiple questions regarding the quality of data, and the use of May-June projections to calculate growth numbers instead of relying on actual data. However, he affirmed his support for the published data, stating that, as finance minister, he stood behind it.
He also expressed his support for the inclusion of members from the private sector on the board of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, which is responsible for the Economic Survey report.

• Income tax exemptions surge 68pc to over Rs800bn
ISLAMABAD: Tax exemptions granted by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) surged to an all-time high of Rs5.84 trillion in the outgoing fiscal year, marking a 51 per cent increase from Rs3.879tr a year ago, according to the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 unveiled by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday.
The unprecedented rise in tax concessions comes at a time when the FBR is grappling with significant revenue shortfalls, making this the second consecutive year of record-high exemptions. In FY24, exemptions skyrocketed 73.3pc.
The cost of tax exemptions has gone up for the seventh consecutive year despite the government’s claim that exemptions would gradually decrease under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.
Tax exemptions refer to the revenues foregone by the state under various categories to different industries and other groups. This is mainly due to exemptions on raw materials and semi-finished products, as well as specific sectors aimed at reducing input costs for export-oriented industries. Additionally, specific individuals are eligible for tax exemptions on certain perks and privileges.
The robust increase in tax exemption costs is mainly due to the Rs1.796tr waiver on domestically supplied and imported petroleum, oil and lubricant (POL) products. A similar quantum of exemption was reported last year.
 
 

However, this exemption is largely fiscal — while provinces receive no share from this amount, the federal government recovers the full amount through the petroleum development levy (PDL), which is not part of the divisible pool.
As a result, the federal government incurs minimal actual cost, but provinces are left out of revenue sharing from PDL collections.
The IMF is concerned about these tax waivers and has requested that the government abolish them. The government withdrew tax in last year’s budget. The upcoming federal budget 2025-26 will show the actual number of exemptions that will be eliminated to meet the FBR’s ambitious revenue target.
The value of tax exemptions has been increasing over the years. In FY18, it was Rs540.98 billion, rising to Rs972.4bn in FY19, to Rs1.49tr in FY20 and then slightly eased to Rs1.314tr in FY21, before surging to Rs1.757tr in FY22. These tax concessions were extended to all sectors to promote industrialisation.
Sales tax exemptions increased by 48.8pc to Rs4.253tr from Rs2.86bn in FY24, primarily due to exemptions on imports and local supply of POL products, and imports under the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Sales Tax Act.
The cost of zero-rated exemptions under the Fifth Schedule rose to Rs683.43bn in FY25 from Rs206.05bn in FY24, an increase of 232pc. This is because the government relaxed the zero-rated regimes for five export-oriented and some other sectors.
On the local supplies, the cost of exemption under the Sixth Schedule decreased to Rs461.09bn in FY25 from Rs613.07bn in the previous year, a decline of 25pc. This is due to a massive withdrawal of exemptions on items under that schedule.
The cost of reduced rates under the Eighth Schedule rose to Rs617.35bn in FY25 from Rs357.99bn in the previous year, indicating a growth of 72.4pc.
The sales tax exemption on petroleum goods surged to Rs1.796tr in FY25 from Rs1.257tr, reflecting a growth of 43pc.
Income tax exemptions rose to Rs800.82bn in FY25 from Rs476.96bn in FY24, an increase of 68pc. This rose mainly because of total exemption on income under Part 1 of the Second Schedule of the Income Tax Ordinance, costing the exchequer Rs443.45bn in FY25, up from Rs293.46bn over the previous year, an increase of 51pc.
At the same time, the tax credit cost extended to businesspersons in income tax more than quadrupled to Rs101.04bn in FY25 from Rs24.37bn last year.
The total tax exemption of Customs reached Rs785.87bn in FY25, up from Rs543.52bn over the previous year, showing an increase of 44.6pc.

• Alleges 30m people have fallen below the poverty line over the last three years
• Blames the agriculture sector decline on ‘anti-farmer policies’
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on Monday criticised the government over the economic survey of Pakistan, alleging it reflected a bleak economic picture and the government’s poor performance, which they said pushed 30 million people below the poverty line in the last three years.
At a press conference, the party’s information secretary, Sheikh Waqas Akram, flanked by Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan, said the finance minister presented the survey “in an apologetic manner.”
“Those who used to criticise 6.5pc growth rate during the PTI’s tenure were trying to defend their performance, which was worst,” Mr Akram said.
Mr Akram said that while President Asif Zardari had promised to address the masses’ issues, poverty has instead increased. He claimed the total economic growth during the last three years was just 1.5pc.
He said people have moved to solar energy because they cannot afford to pay electricity bills. “Inflation is still 11.5pc, but the government claims it is decreasing,” he said, questioning why the finance minister did not begin the survey presentation with inflation figures.
Mr Khan asserted that, by contrast, the PTI government “had brought the energy sector under control.”
Focusing on agriculture, Mr Akram said the sector declined by 13pc while the government claimed livestock grew by 40pc. “How was it possible?” he asked, suggesting the decline resulted from “anti-farmer policies” as there were no major natural disasters.
“Thirty-seven percent of the population was dependent on agriculture and was suffering,” Mr Akram said, adding that the government’s claim of growth in small industries was “a pack of lies.”
Mr Khan said the growth rate was lower than in 1992. “Growth of all crops was negative, but the donkey population has increased,” he said.
The opposition leader also said that the purchasing power of Rs50,000 in March 2022 has plummeted to just Rs20,833 today. Citing the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, he said the price of tea has increased by 74pc.
Both leaders highlighted emigration as a major concern.
“People were leaving Pakistan because of the economic issues,” Mr Akram alleged, claiming that more people will leave in the near future.
Mr Khan said 3.2m people have left the country in recent years, worried about inflation, purchasing power and jobs. He claimed government lawmakers “were not able to face the masses” in their constituencies.

According to the PDMA, current temperatures are ranging between 4 and 7 degrees Celsius higher than average, pushing conditions into potentially life-threatening territory.
A similar warning for next few days was issued for Gilgit-Baltistan. The Met Office said temperature would increase by five to seven degrees. It suggested precautionary measures as it noted that the high temperature may speed up glaciers melting this week.
The city of Sargodha reco­rded the province’s hig­­h­est temperature on Mon­day at a scorching 47°C.
Major urban areas, incl­uding Lahore, Multan, and Faisalabad, simmered at around 45°C, while distri­cts such as Toba Tek Singh, Sahiwal, Okara, Mandi Bahauddin, Khane­wal, Kasur, Layyah, Jhang, and Hafizabad saw temperatures between 40°C and 42°C. Southern Punjab faces particularly severe conditions, with Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Dera Ghazi Khan and Multan expected to bear the brunt of the intense heatwave.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed all relevant agencies to remain on high alert. Critical emergency measures are underway, including the provision of clean drinking water in the arid Cholistan region, activation of dedicated heatstroke counters in all hospitals, and the stocking of essential medicines for heat-related illnesses.
 
 

Authorities were warning citizens on social media about the severe risks posed by the extreme heat.
PDMA also issued an advisory urging the public to take immediate precautions. It instructed people to take special care for vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions, who are most susceptible to heatstroke.
The citizens have also been advised to strictly avoid unnecessary outdoor activities, especially strenuous work or exercise, during peak sunlight hours (10 am to 4 pm). Wearing light-coloured, loose cotton clothing and staying hydrated are essential. The authority stressed the importance of public vigilance, warning that the effects of the heatwave can be severe and swift.
For emergencies, particularly symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, or fainting, citizens are advised to contact the PDMA helpline immediately at 1129.
Meanwhile, according to the Economic Survey 2024-25, issued on Monday, Pakistan experienced its ninth warmest year on record in 2024, with the national average temperature reaching 23.52°C, 0.71°C higher than the long-term average.
The alarming data reveal an accelerating warming trend across most regions of the country. July 2024 was particularly extreme, becoming the second-hottest July in 64 years, with temperatures going 1.26°C above normal.
October broke all records as the hottest October ever recorded, with temperatures soaring 2.48°C above average.

A May 29 notification reveals that the Senate chairman and NA speaker’s salaries have been raised from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3m, besides 50pc of the revised salary (Rs650,000) as the sumptuary allowance.
The hike, with retrospective effect, has become effective in January 2025.
A senior NA Secretariat official, while confirming the development, said the raise for the two offices had been made for the first time since January 2016.

Move draws criticism from within ruling PML-N; ANP demands its reversal

In March, the salaries and allowances of federal cabinet members had been increased by up to 188pc.
Earlier, the finance comm­ittees of the two houses of parliament had approved an increase in the salaries of MNAs and senators, raising it to Rs519,000.
Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique slammed the pay raise for the Senate chairman and the NA speaker, calling it “incomprehensible” and lacking moral justification.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Mr Rafique said: “A sudden increase of many times in the salaries of the Chairman Senate and Speaker National Assembly and a 50 percent increase in allowance is an incomprehensible move.”
PML-N’s Additional Secretary Information Zahid Khan expressed dismay at the decision and demanded its immediate withdrawal. He pointed out that while the government seeks assistance from IMF, it was simultaneously boosting the perks and privileges of top office-holders. He urged the NA speaker and the Senate chairman to refuse the salary hike. “They must lead by example and reject these additional benefits,” he said.
Meanwhile, the ANP also condemned the government for approving the increase in the salaries of high-ranking officials, labelling the move as “rubbing salt into the wounds of people” amid severe economic crisis. The party demanded reversal of the massive hike in the salaries.

Khawaja has requested the Supreme Court to revisit the May 7, 2025 judgement on military trials of civilians otherwise the same will serve as a constant reminder of ceding judicial space to executive by accepting that it can act as judges to try civilians in criminal cases.
“This ceding of judicial space will haunt the Supreme Court and our nation,” says a petition moved to seek review of the May 7 judgment by the seven-judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court.
On May 7, a five-judge constitutional bench had restored key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) that allow for the trial of civilians in military courts. The court ruled by a 5-2 majority in favour of overturning its earlier decision on Oct 23, 2023, in which the five-judge Supreme Court bench had held the military trial of civilians involved in the May 9, 2023 acts of arson and attacks on the military installations as illegal and unconstitutional.
 
 

Except for Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, who had dissented with the majority judgement, the detailed reasoning of the majority judgement has yet to come.

Says judgement cedes vital judicial space to executive and undermines judicial authority

Senior counsel Khawaja Ahmed Hosain has instituted the review petition on behalf of former CJP with a request to set aside the May 7, 2025 judgement since implementation of the same would mean the entire civilian judicial system would be handed over to the executive.
The apex court “conceded” there is no constitutional requirement for its independent existence, the review petition regretted, adding the ruling failed to appreciate the implications of its findings.
It reminded that it was the solemn duty of the Supreme Court and each of its members to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. The preamble to our Constitution, its majestic crown, requires that fundamental rights “shall be guaranteed”. These fundamental rights are the heart and soul of a living Constitution. By allowing court martial of civilians, the May 7 judgement strikes at and undermines the heart and soul of our Constitution, the review petition pleaded.
The petition argued that citizens cannot be deprived of fundamental rights, adding decisions taken in the name of necessity have wrecked our jurisprudence and our history.
The petition contended that the constitutional bench while deciding the intra-court appeals had relied on the District Bar Association (DBA) case to uphold the vires of Section 2(1)(d) of the PAA and to hold that court martials were consistent with principles of fair trial and due process.
There is no consideration in DBA case of the provisions of the PAA under challenge in this case, the review petition reminded adding the DBA case, besides 21st Amendment was inserted in the First Schedule of the Constitution as contemplated in Article 8(3)(b), and was hence insulated from challenge on the basis of fundamental rights.
Moreover, the 21st Amendment had a sunset clause which has since lapsed, the petition reminded adding the insertion of the said amendment in the First Schedule made it immune from challenge on the basis of fundamental rights.
The May 7 judgment thus had failed to engage with a basic point: if court martials are consistent with Article 10A, what was the need to include the 21st Amendment in the First Schedule.
The very purpose of including the 21st Amendment in the First Schedule was to insulate it from a challenge on the ground of fundamental rights, it said, adding the DBA case concerned a limited and time restricted allowance by way of a constitutional amendment.

• Defence secretary says Pentagon is prepared to mobilise active-duty troops if violence continues
• China tells citizens living in the region to boost personal security
LOS ANGELES: Los Angeles was on edge Monday after violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces over immigration raids, with the Californian governor vowing to sue President Donald Trump for deploying National Guard soldiers and the United Nations warning “against further militarisation of unrest”.
Police stood watch after ordering people not to gather in the city’s downtown where cars were torched over the weekend, and security forces fired tear gas at protesters.
“This is exactly what Donald Trump wanted,” Governor Gavin Newsom said on social media. “He flamed the fires and illegally acted to federalize the National Guard.” “We’re suing him.”
The White House also ratcheted up the standoff between the hard-charging Republican president and California’s Democrat-led authorities.
“Gavin Newsom did nothing as violent riots erupted in Los Angeles for days,” Trump’s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on Monday. “President Trump has stepped in to maintain law and order.” She added, “America must reverse the invasion unleashed by (former president) Joe Biden of millions of unvetted illegal aliens into our country.”
The protests in Los Angeles, home to a large Latino population, were triggered by raids and dozens of arrests of what authorities say are illegal migrants and gang members.
Critics say Trump, who has made clamping down on illegal migration a key pillar of his second term, deliberately stoked tensions by sending in California’s National Guard, a stand-by military usually controlled by the state governor.
“You have the National Guard with loaded magazines and large guns standing around trying to intimidate Americans,” protester Thomas Henning told AFP on the scene.
On Monday morning, a heavy police presence patrolled mostly deserted streets. A few protesters remained overnight, with some lobbing projectiles and fireworks, according to TV coverage.
Trump called the protesters “insurrectionists”, and demanded authorities arrest people in face masks.
“BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.
At least three self-driving Waymo cars were torched Sunday, and local law enforcement deployed tear gas and smoke grenades to disperse protesters. An Australian reporter was hit in the leg with a rubber bullet fired by a police officer on live television. Her employer later said she was unharmed.
LA police officers set up containment lines to keep demonstrators separated from armed National Guardsmen from the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in helmets and camouflage gear. At least 56 people were arrested over two days and three officers suffered minor injuries, they said.
California Governor Gavin Newsom said he requested the Trump administration withdraw its order to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles County, calling it unlawful.
Newsom accused Trump of trying to manufacture a crisis and violating California’s state sovereignty. “These are the acts of a dictator, not a President,” he wrote in a post on X.
The White House disputed Newsom’s characterisation, saying in a statement that “everyone saw the chaos, violence and lawlessness”.
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has warned that the Pentagon is prepared to mobilise active-duty troops “if violence continues” in Los Angeles, saying the Marines at nearby Camp Pendleton are “on high alert”. US Northern Command said about 500 Marines were prepared to deploy if ordered.
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed the Trump administration for inciting tensions by sending in the National Guard, but also condemned protesters who became violent.
Meanwhile, China’s consulate told its citizens in the area to strengthen personal security measures, stay away from gatherings, crowded areas, or places with poor public security, and avoid going out at night or travelling alone. They should also “closely monitor official announcements” and “raise their safety awareness”, it added.
On the other hand, UN spokesman Farhan Haq said, “We do not want to see any further militarization of this situation, and we encourage the parties at the local, state and federal levels to work to do that.”

“Today the government of Israel doesn’t represent the vast majority of Israelis,” said Golan, chairman of the Democrats party and a former deputy army chief, days before a planned parliament vote which the opposition hopes would trigger a general election.
He told journalists in a briefing that after more than 20 months of fighting that Israel “should end the war as soon as possible”.
Golan’s party, a conglomeration of left-wing factions, has only four seats in Israel’s 120-member legislature. But in a country where coalition building is essential to achieving a political majority, even relatively small parties can wield considerable power.
Golan said that the current government — one of the most right-wing in Israel’s history — was a threat to democracy.
He said that the vast majority of Israelis wanted to see an immediate end to the war in Gaza, the return of all prisoners held by the Palestinians in a single exchange deal, and the establishment of a national commission of inquiry into Hamas’s 2023 attack, arguing that the Netanyahu government was opposed to these objectives.
He expressed the hope that a deal on the release of prisoners could be reached in a matter of days. “The vast majority wants new elections as soon as possible,” he said.

The tone and content of the presentations at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) focused more on incremental developments, including live translations for phone calls, that improve everyday life rather than the sweeping ambitions for AI that Apple’s rivals are marketing.
Apple software chief Craig Federighi said the company is opening up the foundational AI model that it uses for some of its features to third-party developers.
“This work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,” Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering, said of the delays of some features, such as improvements to the Siri virtual assistant.
 






In an early demonstration of how partners could improve Apple apps, the company added image generation from OpenAI’s ChatGPT to its Image Playground app, saying that user data would not be shared with OpenAI without a user’s permission.
 
 

Apple is facing an unprecedented set of technical and regulatory challenges as some of its key executives kicked off the company’s annual software developer conference on Monday.
Shares of Apple, which were flat before the conference, slipped 1.5 per cent after executives took the stage in Cupertino, California.
Federighi also said Apple plans a design overhaul of all of its operating systems.
Apple’s redesign of its operating systems centred on a design it calls “liquid glass”, where icons and menus are partially transparent, a step Apple executives said was possible because of the more powerful custom chips in Apple devices versus a decade ago.
Federighi said the new design will span operating systems for iPhones, Macs and other Apple products.
He also said Apple’s operating systems will be given year names instead of sequential numbers for each version.
That will unify naming conventions that have become confusing because Apple’s core operating systems for phones, watches and other devices kicked off at different times, resulting in a smattering of differently numbered operating systems for different products.
In other new features, Apple introduced “Call Screening”, where iPhones will automatically answer calls from an unknown number and ask the caller the purpose of their call. Once the caller states their purpose, the iPhone will show a transcription of the reason for the call, and ring for the owner.
Apple also said it will add live translation to phone calls, as well as allow developers to integrate its live translation technology into their apps.
Apple said the caller on the other end of the phone call will not need to have an iPhone for the live translation feature to work.
Apple’s Visual Intelligence app, which can help users find a pair of shoes similar to ones at which they have pointed an iPhone camera, will be extended to analysing items on the iPhone’s screen and linked together with apps.
Apple gave an example of seeing a jacket online and using the feature to find a similar one for sale on an app already installed in the user’s iPhone.</p><small>2025-06-09 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09221150e25b164.jpg?r=221227' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916108/sana-mir-makes-history-as-first-pakistani-woman-cricketer-to-make-icc-hall-of-fame' target='_blank'><strong>Sana Mir makes history as first Pakistani woman cricketer to make ICC Hall of Fame</strong></a><br><p>Former Pakistan women’s captain Sana Mir became the first female cricketer from the country to be inducted into the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) Hall of Fame on Monday.
She took the top spot in women’s one-day international rankings in 2018 and helmed the team that took home gold from the 2010 and 2014 Asian Games. Her rise dovetailed with the growth in sporting opportunities for Pakistani women, who were not allowed to play in open fields until the early 2000s.
Sana played 226 international matches since her 2005 debut. She is one of only nine women cricketers to have taken 100 wickets and scored 1,000 runs in ODI matches. She also led Pakistan to two World Cups and five T20 World Cups.
She was among seven notable cricketers added by the ICC today, the others being India’s MS Dhoni, Australia’s Matthew Hayden, New Zealand’s Daniel Vettori, England’s Sarah Taylor and South Africa’s Hashim Amla and Graeme Smith.
 






The ICC said that with over 200 international wickets against the white-ball, Sana was renowned for her work on and off the field.
It added she was also well known for her strong stance on body shaming, prioritising mental health and helping people affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. It said she “fulfils a childhood dream by joining the ICC Hall of Fame”.
“From dreaming as a little girl that one day there would even be a women’s team in our country to now standing here, inducted among the very legends I idolised long before I ever held a bat or a ball — this is a moment I couldn’t have dared to imagine,” she was quoted as saying by the ICC.
“I am incredibly grateful for this honour and hope to give back to the sport in any way I can. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my teammates, coaches and family for all their support over the years.”
 






ICC Chairman Jay Shah welcomed the new members to the Hall of Fame at a gala event at Abbey Road Studios in London.
“Through the ICC Hall of Fame, we pay tribute to the finest players the game has seen, individuals whose remarkable careers have shaped cricket’s legacy and inspired generations,” Shah said.
“This year, we are privileged to induct seven truly outstanding individuals into this prestigious group. On behalf of the ICC, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to each of them and hope they cherish this well-deserved recognition as a defining moment in their cricketing journey.”
Hayden’s ‘outstanding numbers’, ‘top class’ Amla, ‘inspirational’ Dhoni
Of Hayden, the ICC said that with a “whopping 30 Test centuries and Test average greater than 50, Hayden’s outstanding numbers in the longest format speak for themselves”.
“Each of these players gave something to the game in their own way. It is incredible to be recognised along with them,” he said.
 






The ICC said about Dhoni that there was so much more to the “inspirational skipper”.
Describing his prowess, the ICC said: “Dhoni was ahead of his time with the way he kept wickets in all formats, but perhaps excelled most against the white-ball when he was well renowned for his ability to time a run chase to perfection in the dying overs.
“The Indian great remains the only captain to win all three ICC white-ball tournaments, having led India to success at the inaugural ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2007, the 50-over World Cup in 2011 and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.”
 






Amla’s overall record was hailed as being “top class” in Test cricket and “perhaps even more outstanding in the 50-over format as the underrated right-hander scored bulk runs against every opposition and in all conditions”.
“The Hall of Fame includes some of the most celebrated players in the history of cricket, all of whom have big achievements. Such recognition feels surreal, and I am really thankful,” he was quoted as saying by the ICC.
 






“A superb opening batter and arguably an even better captain,” the ICC described Smith while praising Vettori as a dependable and adept all-rounder and stellar leader.
 






 






Meanwhile, Taylor was called “one of the most talented female players in recent times”.
