Earlier this week, Israeli forces detained the members of the aid ship, operating under the Freedom Flotilla Foundation, going to Gaza to break Israel’s siege. The activists, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, were carrying baby powder and aid for the besieged enclave. Israel has ramped up its offensive in Gaza, after it ended a ceasefire in March. So far, 55,014 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli airstrikes.
Chanting “Free Palestine” echoing through the city’s intersection, civil society members gathered to decry the Palestinian suffering in the face of Israeli occupation. The crowd sang, rejecting Israel’s actions: “Aisay dastoor ko mai nahi maanta” (I do not accept this system).
Speaking to Dawn.com, activist Sheema Kirmani called out the “hypocrisy shown by the Muslim world around the Palestinian cause.”
“The young activists aboard the Madleen went all the way to deliver aid, and yet our leaders, with all their resources, have no interest in doing the same,” Kirmani said.
Lauding their strength, she hoped that someday, people from Pakistan could also go on such missions.
 
 

On Tuesday, Israel said it deported Thunberg and three others after seizing the Madleen, according to Al-Jazeera.
“Every day, we are full of sadness and anger at what Israel is doing in Gaza,” she lamented, adding that there was “very little we can do except raise our voice, get together and protest.”
“The conflict is not of religion but of land, and of power”, Kirmani added.

Environmentalist and activist Zulfiqar Bhutto Jr, while addressing the crowd, said, “The Palestinian issue is not just for Muslims but for everyone.
“If we call them (Palestinians) our brothers, then why is Pakistan not doing anything for them?”
He added: “Greta and the activists were forced to do this because no country, including ours, was doing anything for Gaza.
A representative from the Women Democratic Front noted: “The West has plenty to say about the perils of Afghan women, but they stay silent at the plight of women in Gaza.”
Also, echoing through the crowd were songs hopeful for a free Palestine, “Woh subha kab ayegi”, people sang, calling for an end to the atrocities by Israel in the conclave.
As Israel ramps up its siege on Gaza, the world has repeatedly called for an end to the offensive.
Another participant, reading out the names and the countries of the activists aboard the Madleen, questioned, “Why is there no one from the Muslim world on the list?”
Drawing parallels with the struggle of Sindhis against “state actors”, Sindh United Party’s Jagdish Ahuja said, “We, too, have been deprived of our land and that is why we have always felt the pain of Palestinians.”
Noting the role of women in the conflict, he said until the “women of Palestine rise [and] the women of Sindh rise, there can be no freedom from oppressive forces.”
Bhutto Jr, raising the slogan for an end to the atrocities, said, “Palestine has always been here and it will never cease to exist”.</p><small>2025-06-11 18:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/112326525bbaedd.jpg?r=232728' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916548/us-favourability-tumbles-since-trump-return-global-survey' target='_blank'><strong>US favourability tumbles since Trump return: global survey</strong></a><br><p>The image of the United States has deteriorated sharply in much of the world since President Donald Trump’s return, with low marks both on his character and policies, a global survey said on Wednesday.
The Pew Research Centre found that favorability of the US has dropped in 15 of the 24 countries surveyed.
Trump received his lowest marks in neighbouring Mexico, which he has long disparaged and pressed on migration, with 91 per cent of Mexicans saying they did not have confidence that Trump would do the right thing on world affairs.
Trump led to a downward shift in perceptions of the US as a whole.
In both Mexico and fellow neighbour Canada, which Trump has provocatively said should be the 51st US state, majorities now see the US unfavourably after seeing the country favourably last year when Joe Biden was president.
Views of the US also darkened in most of Europe, with an especially sharp drop in Poland, a frontline ally of Ukraine, as Trump reduces US support for Kyiv and seeks a negotiated solution with Russia.
Sweden, which entered Nato under Biden in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, gave the worst marks to the US among all publics surveyed, with 79pc having a negative opinion of the country.
The survey found that on average majorities from all countries surveyed disagreed with all of Trump’s key global policies including on Ukraine, Gaza, immigration and climate change.
Additionally, 80pc called Trump arrogant and only 28pc found him honest.
Not as bad as first term
Israel, which has enjoyed robust support from its ally in the Gaza conflict, had the most favourable opinion of the US at 83pc, a notch higher under Trump.
Views of the US remained positive in Nigeria and Kenya, which historically have given high marks to the US no matter who is president, and India saw little change, with more than half seeing the US favourably.
Since returning to office, Trump has pursued one of the most sweeping agendas of any US president, which has included eviscerating foreign aid and aggressively deporting migrants.
Nonetheless, the global perceptions of Trump, while negative, were not as bad as they were in 2017 when he first entered the White House. Trump in the first term succeeded Barack Obama, who remained wildly popular in most of the world.
This time, he followed Joe Biden, whose marks were similar to Trump’s globally on the issue of the economy, according to Janell Fetterolf, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Centre.
The past decade has also seen the growing normalisation of right-wing populists.
In Brazil, which Trump’s ideological ally Jair Bolsonaro led from 2019 through 2022, Trump has the confidence this year of 34pc of the public — low, but well above the 14pc he had when he started his first term.
Across the world, Trump consistently enjoyed more support from men than women and was seen more favourably by people on the right of the political spectrum.
But the study also showed the limits of his international appeal. In both Sweden and France, Trump failed to win the confidence of a majority of backers of far-right nationalist parties, although they were more supportive than the general public.
The annual survey contacted 28,333 adults across 24 countries between January and April.</p><small>2025-06-11 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11230201f7bf22e.png?r=231159' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916547/board-of-us-fulbright-programme-quits-citing-trump-interference' target='_blank'><strong>Board of US Fulbright programme quits, citing Trump interference</strong></a><br><p>The board overseeing the Fulbright programme, the prestigious exchanges between US and foreign scholars, quit on Wednesday, accusing President Donald Trump’s administration of political interference.
Members of the board, nominated by successive presidents, voiced alarm about “injecting politics and ideological mandates” into a long non-partisan programme.
“The current administration has usurped the authority of the board and denied Fulbright awards to a substantial number of individuals who were selected for the 2025-2026 academic year,” the board members said in a resignation statement posted online.
“The administration is also currently subjecting an additional 1,200 foreign Fulbright recipients to an unauthorised review process and could reject more,” it said.
“We believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute.”
The board members chose to resign rather than “endorse unprecedented actions that we believe are impermissible under the law, compromise US national interests and integrity, and undermine the mission and mandates Congress established for the Fulbright programme nearly 80 years ago,” they said.
The State Department didn’t immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.
The New York Times reported the board had approved the applications of around 200 American professors and researchers who were set to work at universities and research institutions in other countries this summer, and the State Department was meant to send acceptance letters to the applicants in April.
Instead, board members learned the department’s Office of Public Diplomacy had begun sending rejection letters to the scholars based on the topics of their research.
“The bipartisan Fulbright Board was mandated by Congress to be a check on the executive and to ensure that students, researchers and educators are not subjected to the blatant political favoritism that this administration is known for,” Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.
“While I understand and respect the bipartisan Fulbright Board for resigning en masse rather than grant credibility to a politicised process, I’m painfully aware that today’s move will change the quality of Fulbright programming and the independent research that has made our country a leader in so many fields,” she added.
The Fulbright programme, which was established in 1946, sends US graduate students, scholars, artists, teachers, and professionals abroad to study, conduct research or teach English in approximately 160 countries worldwide.
The program awards approximately 8,000 competitive, merit-based grants each year in most academic disciplines and fields of study, according to its website.
Named after late senator J. William Fulbright, the scholarship was seen as a major source of US soft power by bringing leading scholars to US universities and sending Americans overseas.
The Trump administration has waged war on US universities, which Vice President JD Vance described before taking office as “the enemy” due to their influence and the often left-leaning views in academia.
 .
Trump has cut off billions of dollars in federal research funds for leading universities, over their purported lacklustre response to anti-Semitism during protests against Israel’s devastating military offensive in Gaza.
The Trump administration has also aggressively revoked visas for students, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio using an obscure law that allows him to remove foreigners deemed to go against US foreign policy interests.
Rubio recently suspended processing of visas for foreign students, who are a major source of revenue for US universities, so the State Department can ramp up screening of applicants’ social media postings.</p><small>2025-06-11 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11225318f9f3a39.jpg?r=225344' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916545/punjab-police-arrest-suspect-for-allegedly-killing-wife-in-okara' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab police arrest suspect for allegedly killing wife in Okara</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab police on Wednesday said they arrested a suspect in Okara for the alleged murder of his wife last month.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Okara’s Renala Khurd Saddar Police Station at the complaint of the woman’s father under Section 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code on May 19.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawm.com, said the complainant came to know that his daughter was injured at her house, adding that he “found her murdered with her throat slit when he reached his son-in-law’s home with the latter lying unconscious on the ground in an injured state as well.”
The FIR said the police were subsequently called to the spot. It requested a case and action against the son-in-law, accusing him of the murder with a blade.
A statement from the Okara police spokesperson today said the suspect was arrested and the murder weapon recovered as well, adding that the husband had managed to injure himself as well. It called the murder the “result of a domestic dispute.”
It said legal proceedings had been initiated against the suspect.
“The culprit will be punished as per the law. Anyone who kills anyone unjustly does not deserve any concession,” the statement quoted District Police Officer Rashid Hidayat as saying.
Last Wednesday, a mother of a three-year-old child was allegedly killed by her husband over a family dispute in Dhoke Ghulam Ali, Rawat.
Also that same day, a man attempted suicide after killing his wife and a minor son in Karachi’s Surjani Town.</p><small>2025-06-11 17:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1122094497d3af5.jpg?r=220954' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916541/5-killed-in-separate-road-accidents-across-karachi-officials' target='_blank'><strong>5 killed in separate road accidents across Karachi: officials</strong></a><br><p>Reckless and negligent driving claimed the lives of five people on Wednesday in separate road accidents across Karachi, according to police and rescue officials.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Paposh Nagar Station House Officer (SHO) Shaukat Awan said that two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College.
“The victims were riding a motorcycle and were on their way towards Banaras Chowk when the tanker descending from the North Nazimabad bridge hit them,” Awan said.
The accident resulted in the death of a 20-year-old and an 18-year-old, he said, adding that the bodies were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
He added that the incident enraged passersby, who caught the driver and beat him.
“They attempted to torch the heavy vehicle, but police prevented them,” he said, adding that the driver was arrested and the tanker had been impounded.
Separately, a man was killed and another person was injured when a bus hit them in the city’s Korangi area, according to Sharafi Goth SHO Raja Khalid.
“The victims were riding a motorcycle when a bus belonging to a private company ran them over, resulting in the instant death of one motorcyclist and injuries to the other.
Khalid said, “The driver has been arrested and the vehicle is impounded, while the dead body and the injured person have been moved to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.”
In another incident, Gadap City police SHO Sarfraz Jatoi said, “A young man was killed while his wife was injured in an accident on the Superhighway.
“The couple was travelling on a motorbike when an unknown vehicle hit them near Kathore. The injured couple was taken to a nearby private hospital, where the husband was pronounced dead.”
He added that the wife sustained minor injuries.
The relatives told the police that they did not want any legal proceedings, he added.
Meanwhile, a policeman was killed in a hit-and-run incident in Baldia, according to Saeedabad SHO Pervez Solangi.
“The policeman was on his way to work when an unknown vehicle hit him, killing him on the spot. The body was taken to the Civil Hospital,” SHO Solangi said.
Last month, the police said that a woman was killed and her husband injured when a water tanker hit their motorcycle and ran them over in Korangi, prompting an angry mob to set the water tanker on fire.
In April, an employee of the Pakistan Navy was killed while another was injured in Karachi’s Baldia after a 10-wheeler trailer hit them, police said.</p><small>2025-06-11 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11215202b092530.jpg?r=215938' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916543/us-secretary-of-state-rubio-seeking-sanctions-investigation-of-harvard-report' target='_blank'><strong>US Secretary of State Rubio seeking sanctions investigation of Harvard: report</strong></a><br><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is pushing to investigate whether Harvard University violated federal sanctions, The New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by the newspaper.
Rubio is pushing to investigate if Harvard violated sanctions by collaborating on a health insurance conference in China that may have included officials blacklisted by the United States, the paper said.
The university has been conducting an internal review into the involvement of the Chinese state-run group Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps at the conference, the paper added.
Rubio signed off on a recommendation to the Treasury Department last month to open an investigation, the report said.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.
A treasury department spokesman said the agency takes “any allegations of sanctions violations extremely seriously” but declined to comment on possible or pending investigations. A State Department spokesperson also declined to comment.
A Harvard spokesman declined to comment to The New York Times.
Harvard University did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The Trump administration has launched a multi-pronged attack on the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges.</p><small>2025-06-11 16:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/111658328f57b5b.jpg?r=171129' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916496/aurangzeb-says-lower-govt-spending-in-fy2025-response-to-right-pushback-from-taxpayers' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb says lower govt spending in FY2025 ‘response to right pushback’ from taxpayers</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday said lower government expenditures in the outgoing fiscal year were a “response” to previous “right pushback” from tax-paying individuals.
He made the remarks during a post-budget press conference where he expanded upon the federal budget proposed yesterday for the upcoming FY25-26.
Maintaining an aggressive stance on fiscal consolidation, as required by the Int­ernational Monetary Fund (IMF), Aurangzeb yesterday still managed to offer some notional relief to the salaried class in the federal budget for FY2025-26, along with incentives for the real estate and construction sectors to revive the struggling industrial sector and stimulate economic growth.

Highlights:

Finance minister links no hike in minimum wage with slower inflation
Aurangzeb defends salary hike ‘after 9 years’ for NA speaker, Senate chairman
FBR chief notes levy on solar panels due to ‘disadvantaged’ local assemblers
FBR member explains rationale behind taxing high-value goods at different rates

Miftah Ismail lambastes lack of reforms, inadequate relief measures


Addressing a media briefing in Islamabad today, Aurangzeb acknowledged that past concerns about government expenditures not reducing were the “right pushback”.
However, in the outgoing fiscal year, the minister said the spending had gone up by “just 1.9pc”.
“We have reduced subsidies and debt-servicing costs, and increased some expenditures because this country needed those. But this is our response to those people who are paying taxes in this country that ‘why are you not bringing the government expenditures under control’,” Aurangzeb asserted.
He pointed out that whatever the government was giving was doing so “by taking loans as we start with a deficit”, adding that if the expenditures were not reduced, then the loans would keep surging.
 


At the outset of the press conference, the reporters voiced their concerns about not being given a technical briefing yesterday by the Federal Board of Revenue (FRB) on the Finance Bill 2025, which details the legislation for the proposed measures under the budget.
Subsequently, they walked out of the conference room in protest.
However, flanked by FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial and Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal, Aurangzeb soon continued with his press conference in the presence of some journalists.
Concluding his address, Aurangzeb acknowledged the “worry” caused to reporters and said he “regretted if there was anything of the sort”, referring to the journalists not being briefed.
However, the minister added, he and the FBR chairman “had been appearing before you in terms of having these types of discussions”. “We will continue to accelerate this,” he affirmed, hinting at a plan of engagements with journalists every four to six weeks.
Addressing journalist Mehtab Haider, who spearheaded the journalists’ concerns, Langrial acknowledged that there used to be a “technical briefing” but this time it was decided that Aurangzeb would hold an “essential briefing”.
“Its name is technical briefing but practically, the same questions are raised during it, […] which makes the ministerial press conference slightly less meaningful.
“But if you want, we would hold a separate technical session with you,” the FBR chairman told the journalists.

‘Salaries and pensions linked with slower inflation’
On salaries and pensions for federal employees, which have been raised by 10pc and 7pc, respectively, the finance czar stressed the need for a benchmark.
“If we are saying the inflation is declining, similarly, the salary or pension has to be benchmarked with inflation. This is not just the rule in Pakistan but across the world.”
The minister also pointed out the connection between pay and inflation when asked why the minimum wage of Rs37,000 was not to be increased in the upcoming year.
 
 

“Go to the industries and get their feedback on minimum wage. I think we are in a good place,” he asserted.
Echoing his remarks from yesterday, Aurangzeb stressed that the government tried to give relief “as much as possible” while considering the fiscal space. He also pointed out the 0.5pc reduction in super tax for the corporate sector.

‘Not taxing fertilisers, pesticides negotiated with IMF’
Detailing the measures proposed for property buyers and sellers, Aurangzeb said: “Selling side still gets capital gains but the buying side should get some relief.”
The minister also termed the mortgage financing “as important as the fiscal side of things and what we have to do on the taxation side”.
Speaking on the agricultural sector, Aurangzeb said an additional tax on fertilisers and pesticides was a “benchmark” but it was negotiated with the IMF on the directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as it was a “critical input into agriculture” and should not be imposed.
“Again, this is a step in the right direction”, the minister asserted.
The finance czar acknowledged that additional taxes and measures were also talked about last year. “We had to impose those as when we were speaking to international institutions, they were not agreeing with our stance that there can be enforcement in this country,” he said.
Responding to a query, Aurangzeb underscored the need to reduce the role of the middleman in the agricultural sector and increase the financing for small farmers. “It is very critical […] that we have a policy in the devolved subjects.”
He noted that the relevant measures were underway, hence the growth target was decided considering that.
 
 

Expressing the aim to reach a tax-to-GDP ratio of 10.9pc by the next year, the minister said additional taxes were around Rs312 million of the total 2.2 trillion target.
“We have two ways — either we ensure enforcement or we introduce additional measures of up to Rs400 billion to Rs500bn. This is why we will go to the parliament to help us out with the enabling amendments and legislation.”
The minister added: “We have laws, legislation and taxes but we were not able to enforce them, so in this fiscal year, we have worked on enforcement, which has exceeded Rs400bn.”
‘NA, Senate heads’ salaries hiked after 9 years’
Asked about a recent increase in the salaries of the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker, the minister claimed that the last time their salaries were “adjusted” was in 2016.
He emphasised that the hike was “all of a sudden” as it had not been done for the past nine years.
 
 

Responding to a question on how the federal government could delink the statistic of population from the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Aurangzeb asserted, “Everything will be done in consultation with provinces.”
He added, “Nothing will be done [without them], including the national fiscal pact which we signed with the provinces.”
The provinces are projected to receive a record Rs8.2tr from the federal divisible tax pool in the upcoming fiscal year.
The minister also acknowledged a lack of implementation in suggested measures: “Over the past 10 years, I’ve been looking at the state of economy, first in the private sector and now in this job. I have never seen anything going up go downwards.
“I could be wrong; maybe it might have happened in some year,” he added. “It starts with acknowledgement, the undue burden that we had, as the prime minister has said before as well,” Aurangzeb said.
“The things that had never been reversed before have now been put into reversal, but that’s not the eventual end state,” the finance czar highlighted.
He made it clear that the segments that have been under undue burden, “whether it’s the formal sector, the beneficiary sector, the salaried class”, the government should at least give a signal that it was “serious”. “This is just signalling in my perspective from the right direction,” the finance minister said.
Digital economy, energy and tariff reforms
FBR Inland Revenue member Dr Najeeb Ahmad took the floor to answer some questions on sales tax, specifically on cosmetic items, and the digital economy.
Noting that electrical goods were found to be the high-value retail items sold on e-commerce platforms, Dr Ahmad explained that the tax rate for items worth below Rs20,000 was kept at 0.25pc as per the industry input, as sellers with goods valued above Rs200,000 were already keeping a 1pc-1.5pc profit margin.
The FBR official added: “In boutiques where people buy high-value clothes ranging from Rs15,000 to Rs18,000, their profit margin in such cases usually is 10pc, 15pc or 20pc, but we have set the tax rate for that at 2pc.”
 
 

Najeeb noted that grocery items had lower profit margins but naturally were taxed at a higher rate than electrical goods. “We did not follow previous policies that everyone should suffer under the same category,” he emphasised.
Dr Ahmad highlighted that previously, sales tax was charged on delivery orders through online platforms in the form of cash payment but was not filed.
“Not only is our local economy transforming digitally but the global digital framework is also changing, in which Pakistan’s sales tax right is eroding,” he noted, explaining that vendors in other countries evaded taxes by categorising them as exports.
Aurangzeb noted that the government had taken two “very concrete measures” to bring the cash-based economy of Rs9.4tr or more towards documentation.
Asked what the youth was being offered under the proposed budget, the minister underscored the need for the government to provide an “enabling environment for the youth”.
Noting that freelancers earned $400m last year, he said it was important to provide them with education.
“The coders are now earning $8 to 10 per hour; we hope they reach $100 per hour rate,” he said, urging the private sector to lead that goal.
Answering a query on circular debt, FBR chairman Langrial highlighted the revisions last year for power firms’ contracts. He stated that the power sector wanted “major reforms toward cheap credit and an enabling environment”.

When asked about the rationale for applying an 18pc sales tax on imported solar panels, Langrial explained that they came in two forms: assembled and less assembled.
“The one which added value in Pakistan already had an 18pc tax rate. The assembled one from abroad did not, so the local assembly was at a disadvantage.
“We also closed the door for future local assembling, so this was not an option and we have to create a level playing field,” the FBR chairman said, asserting that incentives were unimportant now that the technology had become cheaper.
“The payback period was two years, so we are ending these anomalies.”
Aurangzeb also reiterated the significance of tariff reforms under the five-year National Tariff Policy, which was approved by the government last month.
“People ask us that the revenue will decline but if we have to take this country forward towards an export-led discussion […] I want to go into the details of the steps we have taken,” he said.
The minister noted that additional customs duties were removed in four “lines”, while they were reduced in 2,700 tariff lines, which were “directly linked with those raw materials on the basis of which exporters will benefit”.
He stressed these measures were just for the upcoming year and more will be taken gradually.
 
 

Expanding further on the topic while answering a query. Aurangzeb said: “This is an East Asia moment for Pakistan. Whatever was available in the fiscal space is the direction of travel. We have tried to reduce tariffs. This is not the eventual end state.”
Asked about local investment and lack of incentives, Aurangzeb highlighted the “need to end protectionism, increase productivity [and] reduce the price of raw materials so that not only textile but every industry exporting benefits”.
Responding to a question on bond repayments, the finance czar stated that the first instalment of Eurobonds worth $500m was due in September, while the next was due in March. “We are prepared and willing to pay.”
The minister reiterated his hopes of Pakistan launching yuan-denominated Panda bonds this year, adding that credit enhancement through the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was in progress.
“As the international credit rating improves, we want to access the euro and US dollar market, which is expected in 2026, but certainly not this calendar year,” Aurangzeb said.
Miftah Ismail lambastes lack of reforms, inadequate relief measures
On the other hand, former finance minister Miftah Ismail lambasted the proposed budget for lack of reforms and inadequate relief measures despite having a “good space to do so”.
Speaking on Geo News today, Ismail said: “I don’t see anything on the budget through which you (government) will take the country towards growth. You could have brought reforms this time according to the country’s requirements; you had such good space to do so.”
He went on to list that international oil prices were low, the country’s current account was in control and had its IMF programme in place, and commodities across the globe were cheaper.
 


Ismail, who resigned as the finance minister in September 2022 and launched a new political party last year, referred to the 2.8pc growth rate in the outgoing year and claimed “anyone could bring such numbers if they have to bring it just on paper through wrong forecasting”.
On the relief measures for the salaried class, Ismail called it a “joke” with the people.
Using an example of a person with a monthly salary of Rs800,000, he said the person was previously liable to pay Rs218,750 in taxes and would now only save Rs7,000 per month — calculations verified by Dawn.com’s income tax calculator.
Ismail stated that the education crisis in Pakistan and the high unemployment rate were among the reasons the government should have given some relief to the people.
 






The finance expert also criticised the “meagre” reduction in the super tax for companies from 10pc to 9.5pc, explaining that they already pay 29pc corporate tax, 15pc dividend tax and 5pc workers’ welfare profit fund.
“You (the government) overspent last year as well,” Miftah said, noting that the civil administration expenditure was recorded at Rs971bn this year despite the government itself highlighting slower inflation.

Celebrities and football stars were due to walk the red carpet at the Fox Studio Lot in Los Angeles — one of the host cities — for the year-to-go event there, a day after President Trump deployed Marines and the National Guard to quell protests.
California Governor Gavin Newsom described the deployment as an “unmistakable step toward authoritarianism”, while Trump officials defended it and branded the protests as lawless, blaming local and state Democrats for permitting upheaval.
Los Angeles is one of several host cities that will mark the year-to-go occasion, including New York-New Jersey, which will welcome fans at a waterside festival in Jersey City with the Statue of Liberty in view.
“If we look at [American] football as the US’s sport, soccer is the world’s sport and this is an opportunity for us to welcome people from all over the world,” Alex Lasry, the New York-New Jersey host Committee CEO, told Reuters.
Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said FIFA needed to work with the US government to ensure the rights of competitors, support staff, fans and media were protected regardless of their identities or views.
“FIFA should publicly acknowledge the threat US immigration and other anti-human rights policies pose to the tournament’s integrity … [and] should establish clear benchmarks and timelines for the US policy changes needed to ensure respect for immigrants’ rights during the 2026 World Cup and beyond,” she said.
US Democratic leaders raised concerns over a national crisis on Tuesday as Trump moved Marines into Los Angeles to tackle civilian protests over his immigration policies.
“There are certainly things that are happening at the national level, the international level, there are going to be geopolitical issues that we don’t even know right now that are going to affect the tournament,” Meg Kane, a host city executive for Philadelphia told reporters at a Paley Centre event on Monday. “So we recognise that we’re planning within uncertainty.”
FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Infantino confident
FIFA President Infantino said last month after meeting Trump that he was confident the world would be welcomed in for the 2026 World Cup and this year’s Club World Cup, which runs from June 14 to July 13.
But the task of reassuring international fans was complicated by a travel ban that went into effect on Monday, cracking down on what Trump called “foreign terrorists”.
Of the 12 countries facing travel bans, Iran is the only one that has qualified for the 2026 tournament so far. Tehran said on Saturday that the ban showed “deep hostility” toward Iranians and Muslims.
European fans, supporter groups and former players contacted by Reuters said it was too early for anyone to be thinking about revising schedules or reevaluating plans for attending the World Cup.
Alina Hudak, the Miami host committee president and CEO, told Reuters she had been in touch with the local consular corps to address their concerns and to offer support.
“My responsibility is to make sure that we’re ready, that we’re safe, that we’re coordinating logistically with all of our law enforcement agencies, that we’ve done everything we can to ensure that our mass transit system is ready and can handle the volume,” said Hudak.
“And so for me, you know, what’s happening outside of that is something that we’re monitoring, but not something that, quite frankly, I have an impact [on].”</p><small>2025-06-11 16:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11211100c66bbfe.png?r=211113' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916533/jaishankars-bellicose-punchlines-show-indias-sheer-frustration-after-failed-military-misadventure-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Jaishankar’s bellicose punchlines show India’s sheer frustration after failed military misadventure: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Wednesday slammed remarks by India’s Minister for External Affairs Subhramanyam Jaishankar regarding how India had the “right to strike Pakistan”, stating that New Delhi’s “bellicose punchlines” showed its “sheer frustration following an unsuccessful military adventure”.
The Indian minister’s comments come in the wake of a four-day military conflict between the nuclear powers last month.
Speaking in Brussels on Tuesday, Jaishankar said when India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintained that ‘Operation Sindoor’ was not over, it was a clear message that “we reserve the right to go after terrorists anytime, anywhere if they have done harm to us”.
According to the FO statement, Pakistan rejected Jaishankar’s comments, stating that top diplomats should aim to promote peace and harmony rather than producing “bellicose punchlines”. Criticising his conduct, the FO said the tone and tenor of a foreign minister “should be commensurate with his dignified status”.
 
 

The FO further said: “For the last several years, India has been engaged in a malicious campaign to mislead the international community through a fictitious narrative of victimhood.
“However, India’s continued anti-Pakistan diatribe cannot hide its sponsorship of terrorism beyond its borders, nor can it cover up the state-sanctioned oppression in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
It added that instead of pointing fingers at others, India should “introspect on its own involvement in terrorism, subversion and targeted assassinations.”
Reiterating that Pakistan believed in peaceful coexistence, the FO urged India to “stop concocting narratives” to justify its aggressive actions in the wake of the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir.
“The narrative emerging from India betrays sheer frustration, following an unsuccessful military adventure against Pakistan,” the FO said. “Indian leaders would be well-advised to improve the standard of their discourse and discard their obsession with Pakistan.”
The FO stated that while Pakistan pursued peace, it would defend its sovereignty against aggression such as that by India last month.
“History will judge not by who shouted the loudest, but by who acted the wisest,” the statement concluded.
 






A day prior, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman termed India a “belligerent power spinning out of control” in response to Jaishankar’s remarks.
“Pakistan cannot be responsible for every attack in India, which is home to a dozen insurgencies,” she said, adding that “no lessons seem to have been learnt from the encounter with Pakistan, and no evidence provided”.
Pakistan and India have been at odds since the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly denied the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a four-day conflict before the US brokered a ceasefire on May 10.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India to the world and counter New Delhi’s unproven allegations. As part of its global outreach, a delegation — including Rehman — has visited the United States, is currently in London and will also head to Brussels.</p><small>2025-06-11 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/111845000970829.jpg?r=192143' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916528/fishing-cat-pakistans-indus-delta-losing-its-lone-surviving-predator' target='_blank'><strong>Fishing cat: Pakistan’s Indus delta losing its lone surviving predator</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has long been struggling with the gradual disappearance of its rare wildlife species due to a lethal mix of environmental and human-induced factors, including habitat destruction, dwindling water resources, pollution and poaching.
Among these vanishing species is the endangered Indus fishing cat, found mostly in the Indus River Delta and surrounding buffer areas, where its numbers have dropped dramatically over recent decades.
Habitat loss, food scarcity, hunting and growing human populations have significantly impacted this rare feline, which plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of aquatic ecosystems, according to experts.
“The past two decades have appeared to be disastrous for this environment-friendly animal, mainly because of the destruction of wetlands and killings by local people,” Saeedul Islam, a senior wildlife expert, told Anadolu.
Although official surveys have yet to determine precise figures, Islam explained that conservative estimates suggest the cat’s population in the country has declined by more than 50 per cent in the last two decades alone.
Globally, the fishing cat population has declined approximately 30pc since 2010, and the animal has been listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)’s Red List since 2016.
In addition to decreasing water levels, deteriorating water quality has exacerbated the plight of these animals.
“Deterioration of water quality due to untreated water flowing directly into water bodies, and the use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers, are also taking a toll on conservation efforts,” Islam noted.

Region’s last surviving predator
Wildlife specialists consider the fishing cat the last surviving major predator of the Indus flood plains, following the near extinction of others such as gharials, tigers and leopards from the region.
“We have this last predator in the Indus flood plains that greatly contributes to keeping aquatic animal populations healthy,” said Zareef Ahmed Shaikh, head of the Indus Fishing Cat Project (IFCP).
The IFCP, launched in 2021, forms part of the global Fishing Cat Conservation Alliance initiative, which seeks to protect and preserve this rare species. The project engages local communities, governmental authorities, and wildlife organisations to support conservation efforts.
Before 2020, the status of the Indus fishing cat on Pakistan’s IUCN country list remained uncertain, suggesting the species was nearing extinction, according to Shaikh.

“It was us (IFCP) who told the world that this animal not only still exists in Pakistan but that its distribution range has extended to the riverine areas of Sindh and Balochistan provinces through the canal network,” Shaikh asserted.
In addition to the Indus delta, recent sightings have occurred in Jaffarabad and Jhal Magsi districts in Balochistan.
Challenges in determining exact numbers
Shaikh acknowledged the difficulty in determining the exact population numbers due to a lack of comprehensive surveys by either government agencies or wildlife groups.
“We cannot give any specific number about its population in Pakistan. But one thing is sure — its number has reduced due to shrinking wetlands and water bodies,” he said.
“That’s why it is hard to fix its current status, but it can safely be described as ‘almost endangered,’ considering the given circumstances.”
Shaikh acknowledged that, although the IFCP has made “a little difference” in increasing the fishing cat’s numbers, “it’s a long way to go”.
Kamal Palari, a community worker involved with IFCP conservation efforts in Sindh’s Thatta district, noted a significant reduction in hunting incidents involving the fishing cat in recent years.
“Locals, especially farmers, would kill them because they falsely believed this cat was a threat to their livestock and crops,” Palari told Anadolu.
However, he said awareness campaigns launched by IFCP and increased community involvement have led to a noticeable decrease in such cases.
Shaikh also clarified that the fishing cat “very rarely” attacks goats and has no capacity to threaten livestock herds significantly.

Balancing aquatic ecosystems
Mumtaz Soomro, a deputy director at the Sindh Wildlife Department, believes that strict wildlife protection laws enacted in 2020 — imposing heavy fines and sentences for hunting rare species — have further helped reduce killings of fishing cats.
Soomro said the department has worked with local communities and wildlife groups on awareness campaigns to protect the cat, which he emphasised is “very important for keeping marine life healthy”.
“We have already almost lost leopards, tigers and other predators because of human-induced factors. We cannot afford to lose this last predator,” he said.
In addition to shrinking wetlands, Islam cited overfishing by local communities as another critical reason for food shortages affecting the fishing cat.
He also stressed the fishing cat’s vital role in maintaining the ecological balance within the Indus delta.
“The fishing cat is a species of low-lying wetlands and can survive not only on fish but also on supplementary foods like crabs, rodents, and birds. The cat catches only lazy animals and fish, helping maintain the health of the remaining aquatic life,” Islam explained.
Shaikh echoed these views, underscoring the fishing cat’s role in protecting crops by controlling populations of rodents and turtles.
“They control the population of small animals, so the ecosystem remains in balance,” he concluded.

The tourism ministry decision issued this week marks the first time the Damascus authorities have issued guidelines related to what women can wear since Bashar al-Assad was toppled in December.
During the Assad family’s iron-fisted rule of Syria, which was shaped by a secular Arab nationalist ideology, the state imposed no such restrictions, though people often dressed modestly at public beaches, reflecting conservative norms.
The new requirements were set out in a wider decree dated June 9, which included public safety guidelines for beaches and swimming pools ahead of the summer, such as not spending too long in the sun and avoiding jellyfish.
It said that beachgoers and visitors to public pools should wear “appropriate swimwear that respects public decency and the feelings of different segments of society”, requiring “more modest swimsuits” and specifying “the burkini or swimming clothes that cover the body more”.
Women should wear a cover or a loose robe over their swimwear when moving between the beach and other areas, it said.
Men should wear a shirt when not swimming, and are not allowed to appear bare-chested “in the public areas outside the swimming areas — hotel lobbies or … restaurants”, it said.
The decree added that “in public areas outside the beaches and swimming pools”, it was preferable to wear loose clothing that covers the shoulders and knees and to avoid transparent or very tight clothing.
It offered an exception for hotels classed as four stars or above, and for private beaches, pools and clubs, saying “normal Western swimwear” was generally permitted, “with adherence to public morals and within the limits of public taste”.
Since rebels overthrew Assad, fliers have appeared urging women to cover up, but the government has issued no directives ordering them to observe conservative dress codes.
A temporary constitution passed earlier this year strengthened the language on the role of Sharia in Syria.
Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led an al Qaeda group before cutting ties with the jihadist network, has sidestepped interviewers’ questions on whether he thought Syria should apply Sharia, saying this was for experts to decide.</p><small>2025-06-11 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11105606898da38.jpg?r=105621' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916482/us-china-reach-deal-to-ease-export-curbs-keep-tariff-truce-alive' target='_blank'><strong>US, China reach deal to ease export curbs, keep tariff truce alive</strong></a><br><p>United States and Chinese officials said on Tuesday they had agreed on a framework to put their trade truce back on track and remove Beijing’s export restrictions on rare earths while offering little sign of a durable resolution to longstanding trade differences.
At the end of two days of intense negotiations in London, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters the framework deal puts “meat on the bones” of an agreement reached last month in Geneva to ease bilateral retaliatory tariffs that had reached crushing triple-digit levels.
But the Geneva deal had faltered over China’s continued curbs on critical minerals exports, prompting the Trump administration to respond with export controls of its own preventing shipments of semiconductor design software, aircraft and other goods to China.
Lutnick said the agreement reached in London would remove some of the recent US export restrictions, but did not provide details after the talks concluded around midnight London time (4am PKT).
“We have reached a framework to implement the Geneva consensus and the call between the two presidents,” Lutnick said.
“The idea is we’re going to go back and speak to President Trump and make sure he approves it. They’re going to go back and speak to President Xi and make sure he approves it, and if that is approved, we will then implement the framework.”
Trump touted that an agreement was reached, saying China would supply “magnets, and any necessary rare earths” to the world’s biggest economy.
The issue of rare earth exports was a key sticking point in negotiations and Trump added that Washington, in turn, would allow Chinese students to remain at US colleges after the deal, which is subject to his and Xi’s final approval.
In a separate briefing, China’s Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang also said a trade framework had been reached in principle that would be taken back to US and Chinese leaders.
The dispute may keep the Geneva agreement from unravelling over duelling export controls, but does little to resolve deep differences over Trump’s unilateral tariffs and longstanding US complaints about China’s state-led, export-driven economic model.
The two sides left Geneva with fundamentally different views of the terms of that agreement and needed to be more specific on required actions, said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Centre in Washington.
“They are back to square one but that’s much better than square zero,” Lipsky added.
The two sides have until August 10 to negotiate a more comprehensive agreement to ease trade tensions, or tariff rates will snap back from about 30per cent to 145pc on the US side and from 10pc to 125pc on the Chinese side.
Investors, who have been badly burned by trade turmoil before, offered a cautious response and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.57pc.
“The devil will be in the details, but the lack of reaction suggests this outcome was fully expected,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone in Melbourne.
“The details matter, especially around the degree of rare earths bound for the US, and the subsequent freedom for US-produced chips to head east, but for now, as long as the headlines of talks between the two parties remain constructive, risk assets should remain supported.”
Resolving restrictions
Lutnick said China’s restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals and magnets to the US will be resolved as a “fundamental” part of the framework agreement.
“Also, there were a number of measures the United States of America put on when those rare earths were not coming,” Lutnick said.
“You should expect those to come off … in a balanced way.”
 
 

Trump’s shifting tariff policies have roiled global markets, sparked congestion and confusion in major ports, and cost companies tens of billions of dollars in lost sales and higher costs.
The World Bank on Tuesday slashed its global growth forecast for 2025 by four-tenths of a percentage point to 2.3pc, saying higher tariffs and heightened uncertainty posed a “significant headwind” for nearly all economies.
A resolution to the trade war may require policy adjustments from all countries to treat financial imbalances or otherwise greatly risk mutual economic damage, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on a rare visit to Beijing on Wednesday.
Phone call helped
The second round of US-China talks was given a major boost by a rare phone call between Trump and Xi last week, which Lutnick said provided directives that were merged with the Geneva truce agreement.
Customs data published on Monday showed that China’s exports to the US plunged 34.5pc in May, the sharpest drop since the outbreak of the Covid pandemic.
While the impact on US inflation and its jobs market has so far been muted, tariffs have hammered US business and household confidence and the dollar remains under pressure.
 
 

Lutnick was joined by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the London talks. Bessent departed hours before their conclusion to return to Washington to testify before Congress on Wednesday.
China holds a near-monopoly on rare earth magnets, a crucial component in electric vehicle motors, and its decision in April to suspend exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets upended global supply chains.
In May, the US responded by halting shipments of semiconductor design software and chemicals and aviation equipment, revoking export licences that had been previously issued.
China, Mexico, the European Union, Japan, Canada and many airlines and aerospace companies worldwide urged the Trump administration not to impose new national security tariffs on imported commercial planes and parts, according to documents released Tuesday.
Just after the framework deal was announced, a US appeals court allowed Trump’s most sweeping tariffs to stay in effect while it reviews a lower court decision blocking them on the grounds that they exceeded Trump’s legal authority by imposing them.
The decision keeps alive a key pressure point on China, Trump’s currently suspended 34pc “reciprocal” duties that had prompted swift tariff escalation.</p><small>2025-06-11 13:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1116410334277c0.jpg?r=171505' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916524/us-centcom-chief-lauds-phenomenal-partner-pakistan-in-counter-terrorism-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>US Centcom chief lauds ‘phenomenal partner’ Pakistan in counter-terrorism efforts</strong></a><br><p>United States Central Command (Centcom) commander Army General Michael Kurilla on Wednesday praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism”, citing the nation’s struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).
Pakistan and the US reaffirmed the continuation of counter-terrorism cooperation during a dialogue in Washington on May 10. The dialogue underscored the cooperation between the two countries in addressing the most pressing challenges to regional and global security, including the threats posed by terrorist outfits such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and IS-K.
The two nations are slated to have another counter-terrorism dialogue this month.
During a House Armed Services Committee hearing in Washington on Tuesday, the general was asked about the situation on the Afghan border with Pakistan, where he outlined that Pakistan has apprehended several “high-value” IS-K operatives.

Hailing a “phenomenal partnership” with Islamabad, Gen Kurilla highlighted that Pakistan has “gone after ISIS Khorasan (IS-K) killing dozens of them.”
“Through a relationship we have with them and providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ISIS Khorasan high-value individuals,” Kurilla said.
“They have extradited back Jaffar, who was one of the key individuals behind the Abbey Gate bombing,” he added, referring to IS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah, an Afghan national who was arrested by Pakistan earlier this year.
Gen Kurilla added that he received a call from Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir after Sharifullah’s arrest, recounting, “He said ‘I’ve caught him, I’m willing to extradite him back to the United States, please tell the secretary of defence and the president’.
“We’re seeing Pakistan — with limited intelligence that we provided them — go after them using their means to do that and we’re seeing an effect on ISIS Khorasan,” he emphasised.
Gen Kurilla noted that there have been 1,000 terrorist attacks in “the western area” of Pakistan since the start of 2024, noting that they “are in an active counter-terrorism fight right now”.
“They have been a phenomenal partner in the counter-terrorism world,” the Centcom chief added.
Continuing his testimony, Gen Kurilla stated that the US needs to maintain ties with both Pakistan and India.
“We have to have a relationship with Pakistan and with India. I don’t believe it’s a binary switch that we can’t have one with Pakistan if we have one with India,” he argued. “We should look at the merits of the relationship for the positives that it has.”
In April, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the pair’s first phone call, where America’s top diplomat expressed interest in deepening cooperation in a variety of sectors, including counter-terrorism.
“During the call, DPM (Deputy Prime Minister)/FM Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening its partnership with the United States,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.
“According to the statement, Dar highlighted Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts between 2013 and 2018, with Rubio appreciating Pakistan’s fight against terrorism and expressing the US’s “desire to further enhance counterterrorism cooperation”.
In an address to the US Congress in March, US President Donald Trump spoke about Sharifullah, praising Pakistan for the arrest.
“Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,” the US president told Congress. “I want to thank especially the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster.”</p><small>2025-06-11 13:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11115353d6c10ad.jpg?r=121931' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916492/psx-hits-all-time-high-as-proposed-neutral-to-positive-budget-well-received-by-investors' target='_blank'><strong>PSX hits all-time high as proposed ‘neutral-to-positive’ budget well-received by investors</strong></a><br><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) hit an all-time high of 124,000 points on Wednesday as the proposed federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year was well-received by investors for being “neutral-to-positive”.
Maintaining an aggressive stance on fiscal consolidation, as required by the Int­ernational Monetary Fund (IMF), the government yesterday still managed to offer some notional relief to the salaried class in the budget for FY2025-26, along with incentives for the real estate and construction sectors to revive the struggling industrial sector and stimulate economic growth.
While there had been uncer­tainties surrounding the taxation measures ahead of the budget announcement, the PSX remained bullish yesterday and gained nearly 400 points to cross the 122,000 point-mark, just before the budget was presented in the National Assembly.
The benchmark KSE-100 index crossed the 124,000-point barrier at around 11am. It then witnessed a slight decline before resurging to 124,588.17 points at 3:30pm — 2,563.73 points (2.10pc) higher than yesterday’s.
The index finally closed at 124,352.68 points, recording a gain of 2,328.24 points (1.91pc).

Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told Dawn.com today that the budget announcement was “well-received by investors, primarily due to the absence of any new taxes or levies on the stock market, alleviating initial concerns”.
He noted: “Overall, the budget is viewed as neutral-to-positive for the listed sectors, with tax collection and fiscal deficit/primary surplus targets seen as non-events, as we believe they remain within the authority’s ability to meet for FY26.”
Despite a record tax shortfall of Rs1.07 trillion recorded for the outgoing fiscal year, the government has set next year’s revenue target at Rs14.13tr — an 18.7pc increase from this year’s revised estimate of Rs11.9tr, against the original budget target of Rs12.97tr.
 
 

Expanding upon the factors related to the stock market, Ashraf said the increase in tax rate for profit on debt and “proportionate imposition of tax on mutual funds contingent to dividends received from debt and equities at rate of 25pc and 15pc mutual funds, respectively, is expected to provide further traction for the equity market”.
Faran Rizvi, country head of sales at JS Global Capital, observed that the market reaction to the budget had been “cautiously optimistic, with the PSX positioned for short-term gains as investors respond to tax relief measures on capital gains”.
“The Capital Gains Tax (CGT) framework, which was expected to tighten significantly, turned out to be more favourable than anticipated,” he noted, echoing Ashraf’s opinion of a positive budget for the stock market.
“This has encouraged mutual funds and institutional investors to redirect capital toward equities, potentially boosting market liquidity,” Rizvi noted.
Stating that while the PSX may see near-term upside, Rizvi stressed that “sustained market performance will depend on the government’s ability to manage public finances, address inflationary pressures, and maintain stable monetary policies in alignment with IMF conditions”.
He further said that broader concerns remained regarding the “sustainability of fiscal measures and the government’s ability to meet ambitious revenue collection targets while maintaining investor confidence”.
 
 

Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities, told Dawn.com: “Post-budget, we believe the market is entering the mass participation phase, characterised by rising volumes and increased public involvement. Valuations remain reasonable and are expected to trend higher.”
He said the 3.9pc GDP deficit target reinforced investor confidence in the government’s commitment to economic stability.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb yesterday announced an increase in the tax rate on interest income from 15pc to 20pc, a move that may discourage savings.
However, some businessmen have labelled the proposed plan a “camouflage budget” due to its unrealistic targets and the lack of meaningful relief for both the business community and the general public.
Pakistan Business Council Chief Executive Ehsan Malik, while noting “small mercies”, termed the real estate sector the “real winner” from the budget.
Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) Secretary General M.

His statement came against the backdrop of Pakistan’s recent conflict with India triggered by a deadly April 22 attack on tourists in Occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. New Delhi, without evidence, accused Islamabad of backing the attackers — an allegation that led to a four-day military escalation between the two nuclear-armed countries before the United States brokered a ceasefire on May 10.
To present Pakistan’s stance on the escalation and dismiss Indian propaganda, the government constituted a high-level delegation, chaired by Bilawal, to visit major world powers. After holding meetings in the US, the delegation is now in the United Kingdom, after which it will head to the Belgian capital of Brussels to hold talks with the members of the European Commission.
Addressing a press conference at the Pakistan High Commission in London, Bilawal said, “India wants to sabotage President Trump’s peace efforts, but its efforts will be in vain. The US will, if required, drag India to the table as it in the global interest that India and Pakistan make peace for regional stability and move towards development.”
The PPP chairman added that the recent conflict with India had turned the Kashmir dispute into a global issue despite New Delhi’s attempts to call it an “internal matter.”
“During this war, there has been progress regarding Kashmir on the diplomatic front. In 2019, India thought it had turned Kashmir into an internal matter. When Trump said there should be mediation on Kashmir, the issue is now a global issue. India has been forced to accept that Kashmir is a bilateral issue.”
A day earlier, the US Department of State reiterated President Trump’s resolve to work on the Kashmir dispute, saying each step that he takes “is made to solve generational differences between countries”.
Responding to a question on the steps US plans to take in the wake of Trump’s offer, State Department’s spokesperson Tammy Bruce during a press briefing noted, “So, while I can’t speak to his plans, the world knows his nature, and I can’t speak to any details of what he might have in that regard.”
He said the delegation held a meeting with members of the All Parties Kashmir Conference at the British House of Commons, who accepted that the issue has been globalised and they can speak about it.
Other members of the delegation include — Hina Rabbani Khar, Khurram Dastgir, Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari, Bushra Anjum Butt and senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
Bilawal reaffirmed that Pakistan desires peace but will defend itself from Indian aggression if attacked.
“Pakistan believes that through dialogue, all issues — whether Kashmir, water or terrorism — can be resolved.  War is not the solution,” he asserted, adding the message would be conveyed to the European Commission during the visit to Brussels as well.
“India’s narrative is based on lies. Its war and post-war narrative is also based on lies.  The people of India also want to live in peace.
“We have demonstrated that we can defeat India in conventional war as well as on the diplomatic front. We are talking about peace and India about war.”
Answering a question, Bilawal said India had no right to suspend or terminate the Indus Water Treaty — a deal between Pakistan and India that ensures fair distribution of the Indus River system’s waters. Following the Pehalgam attack, New Delhi held the treaty in abeyance.
“The treaty is still intact. India’s statement (on holding the treaty in abeyance) is a violation of the Indus Water Treaty. Even threating to suspend the treaty is a violation of the UN charter. If India suspends it, we have called it an act of war.”
The former minister said India would have to “take back the statement on holding the treaty in abeyance.”
“If we are to create an enabling environment for dialogue, it is necessary that treaties are upheld,” he said.
Bilawal also criticised the recent statement of Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Pakistan, who said that when India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that “Operation Sindoor” was not over, it was a clear message that India “reserved the right to go after terrorists anytime, anywhere if they have done harm to us”.
“Jaishankar is a war monger, not a diplomat. If he thinks threatening nuclear war is diplomacy, then India’s problem isn’t Pakistan, it’s extremism within its own cabinet,” Bilawal said.
“Pakistan rejects these recycled allegations. It is ironic that a country with a sitting prime minister whose reputation speaks for itself… dares to lecture Pakistan, who is a victim of terrorism. Threatening missile strikes and boasting about escalation is not a display of strength, it’s a dangerous sign of regional instability.”
“The world should ask who is the aggressor. Pakistan responded with restraint, India continues to brag about war. Even India’s military has walked back its initial lies. Pakistan air force defended its air space.”
“If Jaishankar is so enamored by Google images, I suggest he Googles Abhinandan,” he quipped, referring to the Indian Air Force fighter pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured on 27 February, 2019, after his plane was shot down inside Pakistani territory.
Bilawal said India has been unable to provide even a shred of evidence on the baseless allegations in the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir in which 26 people lost their lives.
“Pakistan has asked for evidence. We have nothing to hide. If India has proof linking the April attacks to Pakistani soil, Pakistan group, then share with the international community.
“The truth is India knows Pakistan has nothing to do with the attacks. That is why India refused our prime minister’s call for an investigation. That is why to this day, they are hiding the truth from their citizens. This was an indigenous act of terrorism, an Indian intelligence failure, and the Indian government launched a war based on a lie,” he asserted.
The Bhutto scion said Pakistan will continue to peruse peace from “Kartarpur to the ceasefire”, while India continues to pursue “propaganda, polarisation, and war”.
“We want peace, stability and regional integration. All we see from New Delhi since election time is jingoism as a war policy,” he said.
In response to another question, Bilawal said India has targeted Sikh activists in Pakistan and countries around the world, and employing terrorism as a foreign policy that cannot be allowed for any civilised nation.
“I think India’s targeting campaign against Sikhs is a continuing factor why the world wasn’t with them when they raised allegations against Pakistan,” he said.
“The world knows India targeted Sikhs activists, killed them, or paid criminals gangs. India has targeted Sikhs in Pakistan also. Canada has said India paid criminal organisations to target Sikhs. There were also targeted in US and Australia.”</p><small>2025-06-11 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1116531759f93ac.jpg?r=165321' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916522/pm-shehbaz-set-to-embark-on-uae-visit-tomorrow-discuss-global-issues-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz set to embark on UAE visit tomorrow, discuss global issues: FO</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will undertake an official visit to the United Arab Emirates tomorrow (Thursday) to discuss bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest during some high-level meetings.
Over the last few months, UAE expressed the country’s commitment to strengthening its long-standing partnership with Pakistan and announced a $2 billion debt rollover soon after. In April, the two nations signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen the bonds between the people of both nations.
A press release issued by the Foreign Office today said that the visit reflected the “deep-rooted fraternal ties” between Pakistan and the UAE, marked by mutual trust, shared values, and close cooperation across multiple sectors.
“The PM will be accompanied by a high-level delegation, including the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, federal ministers, and other senior officers,” the press release said.
“PM Shehbaz will hold high-level meetings with the UAE leadership, including a bilateral meeting with the President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.”
“The visit will serve to further strengthen the longstanding brotherly relations between Pakistan and the UAE, deepen economic ties, and foster multifaceted collaboration,” the press release continued.
It said that the visit was a “manifestation of Pakistan’s and UAE’s shared commitment to bolstering the mutually beneficial strategic partnership, enhancing cooperation in existing areas of mutual interest, and exploring new avenues for further strengthening the bilateral cordial relations.”
In February, PM Shehbaz was invited by UAE leader to participate in the World Governments Summit (WGS) in Dubai, where he delivered a keynote address highlighting Pakistan’s vision for inclusive economic growth, digital transformation and governance reforms.
The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.</p><small>2025-06-11 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11174318d184f79.jpg?r=174551' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916525/iran-says-to-target-us-bases-if-conflict-breaks-out' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says to target US bases if conflict breaks out</strong></a><br><p>Iran threatened on Wednesday to target United States military bases in the region if conflict breaks out, while US President Donald Trump said he was “less confident” about reaching a nuclear deal.
Iran and the United States have held five rounds of talks since April to thrash out a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 accord that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.
Since returning to office in January, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran, backing nuclear diplomacy but warning of military action if it fails.
“All its bases are within our reach, we have access to them, and without hesitation we will target all of them in the host countries,” Iran’s Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said in response to US threats of military action if the talks fail.
“God willing, things won’t reach that point, and the talks will succeed,” the minister said, adding that the US side “will suffer more losses” if it came to conflict.
The United States has multiple bases in the Middle East, with the largest located in Qatar.
Iran and the United States have recently been locked in a diplomatic standoff over Iran’s uranium enrichment, with Tehran defending it as a “non-negotiable” right and Washington calling it as a “red line”.
In an interview published on Wednesday, Trump said he was “less confident” the United States and Iran could reach a deal, in response to a question on whether he believed he could stop Tehran from enriching uranium.
‘A shame’
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 percent, far above the 3.67-percent limit set in the 2015 deal and close though still short of the 90 percent needed for a nuclear warhead.
Western countries, including the United States and its ally Israel, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire atomic weapons, while Tehran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.
Last week, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said enrichment is “key” to Iran’s nuclear programme and that Washington “cannot have a say” on the issue.
During the interview with The New York Post’s podcast ‘Pod Force One’, which was recorded on Monday, Trump said he was losing hope a deal could be reached.
“I don’t know. I did think so, and I’m getting more and more — less confident about it. They seem to be delaying and I think that’s a shame. I am less confident now than I would have been a couple of months ago,” he said.
“Something happened to them but I am much less confident of a deal being made … May be they don’t wanna make a deal, what can I say? And may be they do. There is nothing final,” he added.
On May 31, after the fifth round of talks, Iran said it had received “elements” of a US proposal for a nuclear deal, with Araghchi later saying the text contained “ambiguities”.
 


Iran has said it will present a counter-proposal to the latest draft from Washington, which it had criticised for failing to offer relief from sanctions — a key demand for Tehran, which has been reeling under their weight for years.
On Monday, the United Nations nuclear watchdog began a Board of Governors meeting in Vienna that will last until Friday to discuss Iran’s atomic activities and other issues.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) meeting followed a report issued by it criticising “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
Iran has criticised the IAEA report as unbalanced, saying it relied on “forged documents” provided by its arch-foe Israel.</p><small>2025-06-11 12:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11164853a2b4bf4.jpg?r=164905' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916521/fire-at-iran-petrochemical-plant-kills-at-least-3-state-tv' target='_blank'><strong>Fire at Iran petrochemical plant kills at least 3: state TV</strong></a><br><p>A fire broke out at a petrochemical complex in southern Iran on Wednesday, killing at least three people, state television reported.

However, the video is a deepfake and he has not issued any such message.
A senior trade delegation from Pakistan is due in Washington this week for talks with United States officials on the recently imposed American tariffs and related economic issues, diplomatic sources told Dawn. The PTI claims that Field Marshal Asim Munir would visit Washington around the same time, something that neither the US nor Pakistani officials have confirmed.
While official dates for these visits are being withheld due to political sensitivities, the PTI, which has long opposed the current Pakistani establishment, has announced plans to stage large-scale demonstrations during the visit.
In a tweet posted over the weekend, PTI’s Secretary for Overseas Affairs, Sajjad Burki, called for a protest outside the Pakistan embassy in Washington on June 14, coinciding with the expected presence of senior Pakistani officials in the US capital.
On Tuesday, an X user shared an 18-second clip allegedly showing Barrister Gohar urging overseas Pakistanis to participate in a protest on June 14 against the army chief.
The caption of the post read: “Barrister Gohar’s major announcement. Call for a protest demonstration on June 14.”
In the clip, Gohar says: “As the chairman of PTI, I appeal to all overseas Pakistanis living in the US and the West to actively participate in the protest being held on June 14 in front of the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, DC, so that the true face of Field Marshal Munir can be exposed before the world.”
The post gained 61,000 views and was shared 619 times.
Gohar’s alleged speech was shared in written form by another X user alongside a photo of his, garnering 46,000 views.
The same video was shared by other users on X as can be seen here, here, here and here.
The same viral clip was also found on Facebook as can be seen here, here and here, accumulating 12,490 views.
The clip was also shared on TikTok.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in Imran, the PTI’s protest call, the party’s relationship with the military leadership and all related developments.
Observing the timeline of the X account that first shared the video showed that the user has the following written in their bio: “AI, memes and satire exposing fascism & corruption in PK.”
The user had also shared many other AI-generated images and videos on their timeline.
Observing the video showed inconsistencies such as the lack of direct eye contact with the camera, the line of sight not syncing up with the direction of the face and unnaturally high swaying throughout while speaking, which is not how the PTI leader talks in his addresses and videos.
Interestingly, a video shared by the account of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur of the exact same message, calling for the protest in Washington against the army chief, displayed the same inconsistencies.
Analysis of Gohar’s video using tools to detect manipulation showed that Attestiv assigned it a suspicion rating of 57 per cent while the results from Hive Moderation and Deepware were inconclusive.
 


A reverse image search and keyword search for “Barrister Gohar”, “protest call”, “June 14” and “Washington” led to no news articles from mainstream media outlets that reported on any such alleged video address by the PTI leader, nor was any recent video message of Gohar found speaking with the same background. Neither result was obtained for CM Gandapur saying anything like that.
Instead, a video clip posted on X the same day by Usman Chaudhry, a researcher and environmental journalist according to his bio, showed Gohar responding to a question about the PTI issuing a protest call during the army chief’s visit to the United States.
 






His response is transcribed below:
“The PTI has not given any protest call and nor does the PTI do it. If people abroad do anything then it is their choice. There has been no such press release from the PTI and nor has the PTI said to anyone to do any protest so from our side, we have not given any such call.”
Contacted for comment via Dawn correspondent Nadir Guramani about the video, Gohar said: “Fake and AI-generated”.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a video shows PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar for a protest in Washington on June 14 against the army chief is false. The video is a deepfake and no credible news outlet has reported on any such alleged call by Gohar.

The Arctic region is on the frontline of global warming, heating up four times faster than the rest of the planet since 1979, according to a 2022 study in scientific journal Nature.
“The melting rate of the Greenland ice sheet by, from a preliminary analysis, a factor of 17… means the Greenland ice sheet contribution to sea level rise is higher than it would have otherwise been without this heat wave,” one of the authors of the report, Friederike Otto, associate professor in climate science at the Imperial College London, told reporters.
“Without climate change this would have been impossible,” she said.
 
 

In Iceland, the temperature exceeded 26 degrees Celsius on May 15, unprecedented for that time of year on the subarctic island.
“Temperatures over Iceland as observed this May are record-breaking, more than 13 degrees Celsius hotter than the 1991-2020 average May daily maximum temperatures,” the WWA said.
In May, 94 per cent of Iceland’s weather stations registered record temperatures, according to the country’s meteorological institute. In eastern Greenland, the hottest day during the heatwave was about 3.9°C warmer compared to the preindustrial climate, the WWA said.
“While a heatwave that is around 20°C might not sound like an extreme event from the experience of most people around the world, it is a really big deal for this part of the world,” Otto said.
“It affects the whole world massively,” she said.
According to the WWA, the record highs observed in Iceland and Greenland this May could reoccur every 100 years.
For Greenland’s indigenous communities, the warmer temperatures and melting ice affect their ability to hunt on the ice, posing a threat to their livelihood and traditional way of life.
The changes also affect infrastructure in the two countries.
“In Greenland and Iceland, infrastructure is built for cold weather, meaning during a heatwave ice melt can lead to flooding and damage roads and infrastructure,” the WWA said.</p><small>2025-06-11 10:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1115064219944c1.jpg?r=151536' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916501/musk-regrets-some-of-his-trump-criticisms-says-they-went-too-far' target='_blank'><strong>Musk regrets some of his Trump criticisms, says they ‘went too far’</strong></a><br><p>Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and Donald Trump’s former adviser, said on Wednesday he regretted some of his recent criticisms of the United States president, after the pair’s public falling-out last week.
“I regret some of my posts about President [Donald Trump] last week. They went too far,” Musk wrote on his social media platform X.
 






Musk’s expression of regret came just days after Trump threatened the tech billionaire with “serious consequences” if he sought to punish Republicans who voted for a controversial spending bill.
Their blistering break-up — largely carried out on social media before a riveted public since Thursday last week — was ignited by Musk’s harsh criticism of Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful” spending bill, which is currently before Congress.
Some lawmakers who were against the bill had called on Musk — one of the Republican Party’s biggest financial backers in last year’s presidential election — to fund primary challenges against Republicans who voted for the legislation.
“He’ll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that,” Trump, who also branded Musk “disrespectful”, told NBC News on Saturday, without specifying what those consequences would be.
Trump also said he had “no” desire to repair his relationship with the South African-born Tesla and SpaceX chief, and that he has “no intention of speaking to him”.
In his post today, Musk did not specify which of his criticisms of Trump had gone “too far”.
‘Wish him well’
The former allies had seemed to have cut ties amicably about two weeks ago, with Trump giving Musk a glowing send-off as he left his cost-cutting role at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
But their relationship cracked within days as Musk described the spending bill as an “abomination” that, if passed by Congress, could define Trump’s second term in office.
Trump hit back at Musk’s comments in an Oval Office diatribe and from there the row detonated, leaving Washington stunned.
 






“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore. I was surprised,” Trump told reporters.
Musk, who was Trump’s biggest donor to his 2024 campaign, also raised the issue of the Republicans’ election win.
“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” he posted, adding: “Such ingratitude.”
 






Trump later said on his Truth Social platform that cutting billions of dollars in subsidies and contracts to Musk’s companies would be the “easiest way” to save the US government money. US media have put the value of the contracts at $18 billion.
With real political and economic risks to their falling out, both appeared to inch back from the brink on Friday, with Trump telling reporters “I just wish him well,” and Musk responding on X: “Likewise.”
Trump had spoken to NBC on Saturday after Musk deleted one of the explosive allegations he had made during their fallout, linking the president with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.
 
 

Musk had alleged that the Republican president is featured in unreleased government files on former associates of Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while he faced sex trafficking charges.
Trump was named in a trove of deposition and statements linked to Epstein that were unsealed by a New York judge in early 2024. The president has not been accused of any wrongdoing in the case.
“Time to drop the really big bomb: [Trump] is in the Epstein files,” Musk posted on X. “That is the real reason they have not been made public.”
Musk did not reveal which files he was talking about and offered no evidence for his claim. He appeared to have deleted those tweets by Saturday morning.</p><small>2025-06-11 10:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/111143028a017f1.jpg?r=120529' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916493/sindh-govt-to-allocate-funds-for-ev-taxis-scooters-in-provincial-budget-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt to allocate funds for EV taxis, scooters in provincial budget: minister</strong></a><br><p>In an attempt to provide eco-friendly transport facilities, the Sindh government has decided to purchase more buses and allocate funds for electric vehicle (EV) taxis and scooters in the upcoming fiscal year 2025-26.
Sindh government has reaffirmed its commitment towards addressing Karachi’s urban mobility and transport issues. With a population of 20 million, the metropolis faces rampant infrastructure issues ranging from transport, water and sanitation.
The decision was made in a meeting chaired by Minister for Transport and Mass Transit Sharjeel Inam Memon and attended by Secretary Transport Asad Zamin, Sindh Mass Transit Authority (SMTA) Managing Director Kamal Dayo and TransKarachi CEO Fuad Ghaffar Soomro among other officials.
During the meeting, a comprehensive review of various projects under the provincial transport and mass transit department, including People’s Bus Service, EV scooters, and other issues were discussed. The meeting also discussed establishing charging stations for EV vehicles at various locations in the province.
The minister was given a detailed briefing on the transport department’s projects for the outgoing fiscal year 2024-25, and held comprehensive discussions on the proposed projects for the upcoming year.
Memon was briefed about the launch of bus services by various investors under the public-private partnership mode.
The meeting was informed that work on the Jam Sadiq Bridge, an important part of the Yellow Line BRT, is complete and could be inaugurated in the coming months. It was decided to further accelerate work on completion of the Red Line BRT.
Memon said the provincial government is committed to establishing an environmentally sustainable and modern public transport system. “The Sindh government is constantly striving for eco-friendly and affordable travel facilities for the people,” he said.
The minister said that a new batch of buses are expected to arrive in Karachi soon, while double-decker buses are also being introduced.
“We have launched successful projects like EV buses, People’s Bus Service in Karachi, and are working to lay this network in every corner of Karachi,” he added.  “We want every citizen across Sindh, including Karachi, to avail modern travel facilities.”
The minister said the projects launched by the Sindh government are aimed at regulating the city’s traffic and developing the transport system on modern lines.
During a recent visit to the headquarters of the Chinese automobile company Chery Holdings Group (CHG) in Wuhu, China, Memon has announced that a charging station for EVs will be established every 50 kilometres across all districts of the province.
During the meeting, the company expressed its willingness to install EV charging infrastructure across Sindh. Memon said that the establishment of EV charging stations at regular intervals would benefit owners of electric motorcycles, cars and trucks.
He mentioned that the innovation is coming to the transportation system of Sindh and their vision is to promote environmentally friendly EV vehicles.
He added that the initiative would also create employment opportunities at the local level. In addition, an assembly plant for EV mini-trucks is being set up in Karachi, he said.</p><small>2025-06-11 07:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11074204c9f0c45.jpg?r=074215' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916442/budget-2025-26-austerity-budget-offers-crumbs-for-relief' target='_blank'><strong>Budget 2025-26: Austerity budget offers ‘crumbs’ for relief</strong></a><br><p>• Next year’s revenue target set at Rs14.13tr
• Provinces’ contribution helps Centre outperform fiscal target, record lowest budget deficit in a decade
• Subsidy allocations have been reduced by 14pc
• Reduced debt servicing drives expenditure containment of nearly Rs2.26tr
• Generous tax relief, incentives for construction sector
• Fuel levy, electricity surcharges to rise next year
• Tough crackdown planned on non-filers, tax evaders
• Development spending squeezed to cut deficit
ISLAMABAD: Maintaining an aggressive stance on fiscal consolidation, as required by the Int­ernational Monetary Fund (IMF), Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday still managed to offer some notional relief to the salaried class in the federal budget for fiscal year 2025-26, along with incentives for the real estate and construction sectors, in an effort to revive the struggling industrial sector and stimulate economic growth.
At the same time, however, the government announced it was imposing a ‘carbon levy’ of Rs2.5 per litre on petrol, diesel and furnace oil in the upcoming fiscal year, to be doubled the following year.
It also introduced a 5 per cent tax on large pensions, an 18pc tax on imported solar panels, and an increase in the debt servicing surcharge on electricity to finance not only interest payments, but also principal debt. Additionally, it announced the gradual elimination of tax exemptions for the tribal areas beginning this year.
Ambitious targets
Despite a record tax shortfall of Rs1.07 trillion recorded for the current fiscal year, the finance minister set next year’s revenue target at Rs14.13tr — an 18.7pc increase from this year’s revised estimate of Rs11.9tr, against the original budget target of Rs12.97tr. This would include approximately Rs840 billion in additional revenue measures, on top of a Rs1.39tr automatic tax increase supported by projected inflation of 7.5pc and economic growth of 4.2pc and expenditure containment of nearly Rs2.26tr (equivalent to 2pc of GDP), driven primarily by reduced debt servicing costs, and also at the expense of development and public welfare initiatives.
 


Not only the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), but the provincial governments, too, were unable to meet their commitment of maintaining a Rs1.22tr surplus for the current year. Still, they provided vital support to the federal government with a surplus of Rs1.01tr.
This contribution enabled the federal government to outperform its fiscal target and record a budget deficit of just 5.6pc of GDP (Rs6.44tr) — the lowest in a decade since FY2015-16 — compared to a higher projected deficit of 5.9pc (Rs7.28tr). This notable fiscal tightening was achieved through punishing additional taxation measures amounting to Rs2.2tr (1.8pc of GDP) alongside a reduction in expenditure as interest rates declined from a historic peak of 22pc.
Accordingly, the FY2025–26 budget sets an ambitious target to reduce the budget deficit to 3.9pc of GDP (Rs5.04tr), contingent upon a cash surplus of Rs1.46tr from the provinces. As a result, the primary budget surplus is projected to rise to 2.4pc of GDP, or Rs3.17tr, for the next year — up from this year’s 2.2pc of GDP (Rs2.5tr).
Relief for select groups
The government found sufficient fiscal space to offer some relief to the salaried class, who have been burdened by high tax rates, declining real incomes, and severe inflation over the past two years.
The finance minister proposed a reduction in income tax by half, to 2.5pc, on annual income between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million. It is pertinent to mention that there was a discrepancy in the income tax rate for the lowest taxable bracket announced by the finance minister and the tax rate mentioned in the finance bill, which was even lower at 1pc.
 
 

Clarity is awaited on this matter. Similarly, the annual tax on a salary of Rs1.2m was proposed to be reduced to Rs6,000, down from the current Rs30,000. Mr Aurangzeb added that the income tax rate for those earning up to Rs2.2m per annum would be cut to 11pc, down from the current 15pc. Similarly, the tax rate has been reduced to 23pc from 25pc for salaried income between Rs2.2m and Rs3.2m. In addition, the finance minister acknowledged that oppressive tax rates were driving highly skilled professionals to migrate, contributing to a “brain drain”. As a corrective measure, he announced a 1pc reduction in the surcharge on annual incomes exceeding Rs10m.
Apart from this, a 10pc increase in salaries and 7pc rise in pensions was announced for government employees. The salaries of armed forces personnel would also be increased by 25pc, including a special relief allowance in recognition of their recent heroic performance in response to Indian aggression, the finance minister said.
At the same time, the government introduced a generous tax relief and incentives for the construction sector, including access to cheaper mortgage financing, in a bid to revive large-scale manufacturing, which has been contracting for the past three years due to unprecedented increases in energy and borrowing costs. To this end, the finance minister announced a reduction in the withholding tax on the purchase of real estate from 4pc to 2.5pc. The next two current withholding tax rates of 3.5pc and 3pc will also be reduced to 2pc and 1.5pc respectively.
Additionally, a 7pc federal excise duty imposed last year on the transfer of commercial properties, plots and houses has also been proposed to be abolished.
As a new initiative, the budget includes a tax credit on mortgages for homes of up to 10 marla (250 square yards) and flats of up to 2,000 square feet. This is in addition to a new scheme aimed at promoting mortgage financing. The finance minister also announced a reduction in stamp duty on property purchases in Islamabad Capital Territory, from 4pc to 1pc, and expressed hope that provincial governments would follow suit by reducing heavy taxation on immovable property.
The government also succeeded in persuading the IMF to exempt fertilisers and insecticides from taxation for the current year, in an effort to position agriculture as the engine of economic growth.
Tightening the net
On the other hand, the finance minister announced an increase in the tax rate on interest income from 15pc to 20pc, a move that may discourage savings. However, he clarified that this would not apply to small savers or investments in national saving schemes.
Similarly, digital marketplaces and online businesses are to be brought into the tax net through courier companies, it was announced. The minister also announced a 5pc income tax on pensions exceeding Rs10m per annum for pensioners under the age of 70. In a move to promote a cashless economy, non-filers will now be subject to a 1pc advance tax on cash withdrawals, up from the existing 0.6pc. Taxpaying businesses will be discouraged from making cash sales exceeding Rs200,000. Additional measures have also been introduced to encourage online transactions and digital payments.
 
 

Strict steps will be taken against non-filers. Only taxpayers who submit their wealth statements will be allowed to undertake large financial transactions, such as the purchase of vehicles, immovable properties, securities, mutual funds, or the opening of certain bank accounts.
Tightening the noose around unregistered traders, the finance minister proposed the freezing of bank accounts, restrictions on property transfers, and the sealing of business premises in cases of serious violations of sales tax laws, with the involvement of trade bodies. In the same vein, he also announced a notional 0.5pc reduction in the super tax for corporate firms with annual incomes between Rs200m and Rs500m.
Improved tax collection
The finance minister noted a rise in the tax-to-GDP ratio, which has historically been one of the weakest aspects of Pakistan’s economy, from 8.8pc in June 2024 to 10.3pc in the first nine months of the current year. This figure is projected to reach 10.4pc by June 30, 2025. Including non-tax revenue, the federal tax-to-GDP ratio has improved to 11.6pc, representing an increase of 1.2 percentage points, up from 0.8 percentage points last year.
The consolidated tax-to-GDP ratio, the finance minister added, has reached 12.3pc, including a 0.7pc contribution from the provinces. “The 1.6pc of GDP increase in FBR revenue is not only the highest in Pakistan’s history, but is also rarely seen anywhere else in the world in recent times,” the minister boasted.
Balancing the budget
The government has set the non-tax revenue target for the next year at Rs5.15tr, slightly higher than the current year’s Rs4.9tr. This brings the total gross federal revenue (FBR plus non-tax) to Rs19.28tr, up from the current year’s original budget target of Rs17.8tr, which was later revised down to Rs16.8tr. After transferring Rs8.2tr to the provinces, the net federal revenue is estimated to be Rs11.07tr for the next year, compared to Rs9.8tr this year. This leaves a projected federal deficit of Rs6.5tr, a reduction from the current year’s budgeted Rs8.5tr, which was later revised to Rs7.44tr.
 
 

Subsidy allocations have been reduced by 14pc to Rs1.19tr for the next year, down from Rs1.38tr in the current year. This is primarily due to a 13pc (Rs154bn) cut in power sector subsidies. The tariff differential subsidy for ex-Wapda distribution companies has been reduced by 9.7pc (Rs27bn) to Rs249bn, from Rs276bn this year. Meanwhile, the tariff subsidy for K-Electric has been cut by 28pc (Rs49bn), to Rs125bn from Rs174bn. An even larger reduction has been applied to the tariff subsidy for Azad Jammu and Kashmir, which has been reduced to Rs74bn from Rs108bn, reflecting a cut of 31.5pc.
The major non-tax revenue item is expected to be the petroleum levy on POL products, projected at Rs1.47tr, which is a 26pc increase from the current year’s Rs1.16tr. An even larger contribution is anticipated from State Bank of Pakistan profits, estimated at Rs2.4tr for the next year, though this marks a slight decline from Rs2.6tr this year.
The debt servicing cost for next year has been estimated at Rs8.2tr, representing an 8pc decline from actual repayments of Rs8.95tr, and 16pc lower than the original budget estimate of Rs9.78tr. Pension expenditure is expected to rise by around 4pc, reaching Rs1.06tr, up from Rs1.01tr this year. Military pensions are projected to grow by 12pc to Rs742bn, compared to a 10pc increase in civil pensions, which are expected to reach Rs243bn.
As a result, total current expenditure has been set at Rs16.29tr for the next year, slightly below this year’s figure of Rs16.39tr.

The party arrived at this conclusion after discussing the budgetary proposals for financial year 2025-26 at a meeting of the parliamentary party, which was attended by PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, leader of the opposition in National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan and leader of opposition in Senate Shibli Faraz among others.
Calling the PML-N government “illegitimate”, the participants were of the opinion it had no authority to present the budget. They said the PTI would never accept the budget prop­o­sals as the IMF had allegedly prep­a­red them. They alleged that relaxati­ons were proposed for the elite, while the less privileged were crushed.
The PTI leaders also criticised the ‘biased role’ of the NA speaker. The party decided that if the national broadcaster/PTV failed to air speeches by lawmakers from the opposition benches, the party would hold protests during budget debate.
While talking to Dawn, PTI leader from Rawalpindi Shehryar Riaz said the budget 2025-26 demonstrated a narrow, IMF-driven fiscal tightening, heavily prioritising defence at the expense of social welfare and reforms.
“Without bold tax reform, debt relief or growth-centred investments, it risks perpetuating poverty and instability,” he said.
No benefit for salaried class
Later, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja told a presser there was hardly any benefit for the salaried class.
“They are told to invest money in the stock market. People are being encouraged to invest in stock market that fluctuates. The class, which cannot protest, is continuously being burdened,” he said.
Senate Opposition Leader Shibli Faraz said budget made for the elite broke all records of burdening the less privileged.
The senator suggested that the figures from Imran Khan’s tenure and current government’s tenure should be compared. Economic conditions of the masses had become so weak that many people could not even afford to sacrifice animal during Eidul Azha, he noted.
Interest on loans
Shibli Faraz said the debt was continuously increasing and most of the tax revenue was being used in paying the interest on loans.
He said that government employees protested due to which all roads leading to Parliament House were closed and it had become difficult for lawmakers to reach there for the budget session.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said that instead of a minute increase in salaries, the government should have apologised to the masses.

Donald Trump had offered to work on the Kashmir issue after he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after the two nations’ most intense military confrontation in decades. In a message lauding the countries’ leaders for achieving peace, he remarked, “I will work with both of you to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”
Responding to a question on the steps US plans to take in the wake of Trump’s offer, State Department’s spokesperson Tammy Bruce during a White House press briefing noted, “So, while I can’t speak to his plans, the world knows his nature, and I can’t speak to any details of what he might have in that regard,” adding that the White House would have plenty to say about the matter.
She further said, “[Trump] has been the only one to bring certain people to the table to have conversations that nobody thought was possible,” remaining hopeful that the Kashmir issue can also get resolved.
“It shouldn’t surprise anyone that he’d want to manage something like that,” said Bruce.
Detailing the recent visit of a Pakistani delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in response to a question, she said that the delegation met with state department officials in Washington, including Under Secretary for Political Affairs Allison Hooker.
She elaborated that the two parties discussed issues related to the Pak-US bilateral relationship, including counterterrorism cooperation. Hooker reiterated US support for the ongoing ceasefire.
“We also know that Deputy Secretary Landau met with the Indian parliamentary delegation last week, and he also reaffirmed the United States strong support of India in the fight against terrorism,” Bruce added.
 


Pakis­tan has launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence in the country.
Meanwhile, last week, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump categorically claimed credit for talking India and Pakistan back from the brink of war.
“They don’t give me credit for anything, but nobody else could have stopped it,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-11 05:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1108090095e19cd.jpg?r=081435' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916437/defence-budget-sees-major-boost-amid-india-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>Defence budget sees major boost amid India tensions</strong></a><br><p>• Rs2.55tr allocation is 20pc higher, biggest annual hike in a decade
• Military budget jumps to 1.97pc of GDP, up from 1.7pc last year
ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Tuesday proposed an allocation of Rs2.55 trillion for the country’s armed forces in the fiscal year 2025-26, marking the highest annual increase in defence spending in over a decade, amid heightened tensions with India and last month’s military clashes between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The new allocation represents a 20.2 per cent rise over the previous year’s budget of Rs2.122tr, pushing defence spending to around 1.97pc of GDP — up from 1.7pc last year — as it inches back to 2pc after years of incremental decline. The increase also contrasts with the decline in national spending on health and education in terms of GDP, with figures for the first nine months of the outgoing fiscal year well below 1pc.
The defence spending hike also means a rise in its share of the total federal outlay to 14.51pc, the highest in recent years.
 
 

Presenting the budget in the National Assembly, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang­zeb said, “The security situation in the country is precarious and the armed forces have rendered commendable service in protecting the borders.”
The military allocation comes against the backdrop of heightened regional tensions, including clashes with India in May 2025 and a concurrent 9.5pc increase in India’s defence budget to 6.81tr Indian rupees. Internal security operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan have also contributed to the rising expenditure on security, though internal security spending is met from a separate budget head.
The Rs2.55tr defence allocation — about $9.18 billion — includes key hikes in operational and infrastructure expenses. Operating costs, which cover fuel, rations, training and medical treatment, are set to rise 37.22pc to Rs704.4bn. Civil works, such as infrastructure development, will increase by 37.4pc to Rs336.5bn.
A 3.8pc increase has been proposed for employee-related expenses, covering salaries and allowances for servicemen, with Rs846.03bn earmarked for this purpose. The finance minister said that officers, junior commissioned officers and soldiers would receive a special relief allowance, funded from within the defence budget.
 
 

Spending on physical assets — covering arms and equipment procurement — is set to climb 20.9pc to Rs663.1bn. Large-scale military acquisitions and funding for the country’s nuclear and missile programs are believed to be channelled through classified allocations not reflected in the published defence budget.
The employee-related expe­n­ses, which account for 33.18pc, remain the largest chunk, though dropping from 39pc in FY25. Operating expenses now take 27.62pc, up from 25pc in the outgoing year.
Physical assets, meanwhile, claim 26pc, which is a slight increase from 25.8pc in 2024-25. Civil works would receive 13.2pc, rising from 11.5pc, underscoring a growing emphasis on military construction and facilities.
Compared to the outgoing year, the share for employee-related expenses has declined by 5.82 percentage points, while operating expenses and civil works have gained 2.62 and 1.7 percentage points, respectively, pointing to a reallocation of resources to address heightened security needs amid regional tensions.
Service-wise allocations are as follows: Army, Rs1.17tr (45.9pc of the total); Pakistan Air Force, Rs520.75bn (20.4pc); Navy, Rs265.97bn (10.4pc); and Inter-Services Organisations, Rs498.11bn (19.5pc). All services received around a 15.45pc increase, with the Army’s slightly higher 15.84pc rise.
A closer examination of the defence allocation of Rs 2.55 trillion reveals an unallocated amount of Rs 95.17 billion, as the combined allocation for the Army, PAF, Navy, and Inter-Services Organisations totals Rs 2.45483 trillion. This discrepancy suggests the unallocated funds may be directed toward operational costs not directly tied to specific services.
In addition to the defence budget, Rs1.055tr has been set aside for military pensions — a 4.04pc increase over the previous year. While not part of the defence budget, military pensions constitute roughly 6pc of the total Rs17.573tr federal outlay.
The latest figures suggest a continuing shift away from the decade-long trend of modest annual increases of around 11pc, with the 2025-26 hike being the third consecutive rise from what had become a routine annual raise.
The increase looks to be driven by Pakistan’s evolving security needs, regional dynamics and a push to modernise and maintain readiness across all branches of the military.
Despite the increase, Pakistan’s defence spending remains considerably lower than that of India, whose military expenditure stands at nearly nine times higher in dollar terms.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s April 2025 report, South Asia’s military expenditure continues to rise due to geopolitical rivalries and modernisation initiatives across the region.

• Up to 80pc tax relief for salaried individuals earning Rs600,000-1.2m annually
• Minimal relief for top salary brackets earning above Rs4.1m
• 1pc surcharge reduction for income above Rs10m to curb brain drain
• Super tax cut by 0.5pc for companies earning Rs200m-500m
• Pensions above Rs10m to be taxed at 5pc
• Cash withdrawal tax for non-filers increased to 1pc from 0.6pc
ISLAMABAD: The government has announced sweeping tax reforms in the federal budget 2025-26, offering tax cuts of up to 80 per cent for low-income salaried individuals while limiting relief for higher earners to just 3pc. A new 5 per cent tax has also been proposed on high-value pensions exceeding Rs10 million annually.
The focus of the budget seems to balance sectoral rel­ief, expand tax scope, achieve equitable burden-sharing, and introducing strong enf­orcement measures. The government expects the digital taxation framework, carbon levies and tax enforcement on e-commerce and digital transactions to help Pakistan adapt to global financial regulation standards.
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said tax relief measures total Rs60 billion for salaried individuals, Rs2.4bn for the corporate sector, and Rs60bn in exemptions for fertilisers and pesticides.
 
 

To achieve the proposed tax collection target of Rs14.131 trillion, the autonomous tax growth is projected at Rs1.34tr in FY26 based on the GDP growth target of 4.2pc and inflation rate of 7.5pc.
With the current year’s revenue collection of Rs11.5tr and autonomous growth of Rs1.345tr, revenue collection will reach Rs12.845tr in FY26 without any new tax or enforcement measures.
Tied to its commitments under the International Mone­tary Fund (IMF) programme, the government introduces additional revenue measures of Rs1.05tr, including new tax measures of Rs655bn and another Rs400bn through enforcement.
Enforcement measures
The Finance Bill also proposes Section 114C, which introduces a framework to restrict high-value economic transactions — such as purchase of vehicles, immovable property and securities — for individuals and entities, who have not filed income tax returns or cannot justify their financial capacity through formally declared resources.
By mandating that, only “eligible persons” with sufficient declared assets can engage in such transactions.
A new Section 175AA is proposed to be inserted into the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, empowering the FBR to share tax-related information of high-risk persons with scheduled banks.
This includes details such as turnover, income (including taxable income) for one or more tax years, identification data (including bank account numbers) declared in income tax returns, wealth statements, financial statements, or any other document submitted to the FBR, along with data-based algorithms as may be prescribed.
Salaried class
The salary exemption limit has remained unc­h­anged at Rs50,000 per month. However, the government has now proposed a reduction in tax rates for annual income up to Rs3,200,000 to provide rel­ief to people in lower- and middle-income brackets. Sim­ilarly, the surcharge rate has been proposed to be reduced to 9pc from 10pc for salaried individuals only.
Taxpayers earning between Rs600,000 to Rs1.2m annually will now face a 1pc tax rate, down from 5pc, offering up to 80pc tax reduction.
 
 

For annual incomes between Rs1.2m and Rs2.2m, the rate will drop to 11pc from 15pc (on the amount exceeding Rs1.2m), and the fixed sum reduced to Rs6,000 from Rs30,000. For a salary of Rs150,000 per month, this translates to a 48pc reduction in tax liability.
For annual salaries bet­ween Rs2.2m and Rs3.2m, the rate drops from 25pc to 23pc (on the income exceeding Rs2.2m) and the fixed sum to Rs116,000 from Rs180,000.
No percentage change was made for the remaining two slabs except reductions in the fixed sums.
Those earning between Rs3.2m and Rs4.1m per year will see their fixed tax reduced to Rs346,000 from Rs430,000, though the income exceeding Rs3.2m will still be taxed at 30pc.
For people earning more than Rs4.1m annually, the fixed sum has been reduced to Rs616,000 from Rs700,000, but the tax rate on income exceeding Rs4.1m will remain 35pc.
A 1pc surcharge reduction is proposed for individuals earning above Rs10m to discourage skilled professionals from emigrating. Meanwhile, pensioners drawing over Rs10m annually will now be taxed at 5pc.
Other key measures
The income tax and withholding tax exemption for the erstwhile Fata and Pata regions has been proposed to be extended to June 30, 2026.
Withholding tax on property purchases has been lowered across brackets — from 4pc to 2.5pc, 3.5pc to 2.5pc, and 3pc to 1.5pc — and Federal Excise Duty on commercial property transfers has been abolished (previously up to 7pc).
The interest income tax rate will rise from 15pc to 20pc, though national savings schemes are exempt.
Rent from commercial properties must be reported at a minimum of 4pc of fair market value unless proven otherwise to the commissioner.
Digital economy
A Digital Transactions Proceeds Levy will apply to all payments for goods or services delivered via digital platforms. Banks and courier services will act as withholding agents to capture the payment chain.
Withholding tax on cash withdrawals by non-filers rises from 0.6pc to 1pc. For specified services, withholding tax increases from 4pc to 6pc, excluding IT and IT-enabled services.
For non-specified services, a flat 15pc applies; for sportspersons, the rate increases from 10pc to 15pc. The tax rate on profit on debt has been increased from 15pc to 20pc. The dividend tax rate has been enhanced to 25pc and 15pc on dividend from mutual funds.
The government also proposes removing the Rs5m cap on profit from debt under the final tax regime for individuals and associations of persons  though companies will retain the adjustable tax.
Sales tax measures
The government also proposes an 18pc sales tax on the sales of imported solar panels.
Hybrid cars will also be subject to an 18pc sales tax, aligning them with petrol and diesel vehicles. A 10pc sales tax on goods will now be gradually imposed over the next five years in the sales tax-exempt provinces, i.e. ex-Fata region and Balochistan.
Under the proposed regime, payment intermediaries (banks, financial institutions, exchange companies, and payment gateways) will collect sales tax on digital payments, while couriers will handle tax collection for cash on delivery transactions. Additionally, the withholding tax rate is set to increase from 1pc to 2pc.
Sales tax has been extended to items like pet food, chocolates and cereal bars in retail packs. Rate on vermicelli and sheermaal has been increased from 10pc to 18pc. The 10pc tax on bun and rusk supply has been withdrawn.
The government has imposed 18pc sales tax on supplies, imports and import of plant and machinery by the industrial units located in the erstwhile Fata and Pata.
