The ban will remain in place till June 13 and it is applied to the Kannup, Sunerah, Mubarak Village, Turtle and Dua Chowk beaches.
Official sources said there was no restriction on people to visit other city beaches, including Sandspit, Hawkesbay, Paradise Point and Seaview, as these beaches were guarded by lifeguards and law enforcers.
 
 

Commissioner Syed Hasan Naqvi imposed the ban under Section 144 of the criminal procedure code on the request of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC).
The order authorised the SHOs concerned to register FIRs under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code against violators of the ban.
The officials said that a ban on swimming at other beaches might be imposed in view of the monsoon season, when there was comparatively high tide there.

KARACHI: It is disappointing that only two Urdu films will be released on Eidul Azha. They are: Love Guru directed by Nadeem Baig and Deemak helmed by Rafay Rashdi. Although half-a-dozen Pakistani films hit the cinema screens on Eidul Fitr (five Urdu and one Punjabi), they did not manage to create a splash in the placid waters of our local movie scene.
It is abundantly clear now that the only way for the film exhibitors and cinema owners to do business is by virtue of big Hollywood releases. For example, prior to Eidul Azha, Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning, the popular franchise starring Tom Cruise, did well at the box office. (It is difficult to ascertain the exact number that it has managed to attract because MI is still in theatres.)
On Eidul Azha, too, a couple of major English language films — apart from a few Turkish projects dubbed in Urdu — will be there to compete with the Pakistani movies: Ballerina and Karate Kid: Legends. The former is a spin-off of the John Wick series and the latter a throwback sequel to a project that began in 1984.
This means, both are strong franchises. Since, Love Guru and Deemak will have more screens, as they should, Ballerina and Karate Kid may have a sluggish start at the box office.
Now back to the Urdu films. Love Guru is a romantic comedy (or rom-com in modern day parlance) starring Humayun Saeed and Mahira Khan. The presence of the seasoned lead pair, and the team that’s involved in the making of the movie (director Nadeem Baig and writer Vasay Chaudhry) pretty much gives an idea as to what the storyline will entail. It is primarily meant to entertain.
But will it rake in big numbers in terms of ticket sales? The question can be answered in a month or so.

In addition to Love Guru and Deemak English language films Ballerina and Karate Kid: Legends are also being screened

 
 

One of the marked features of Deemak is that it’s director and producer are the sons of two distinguished Pakistani women. Rafay is the son of Mehtab Rashdi and Murad Ali (the producer) is the son of eminent poet, the late Parveen Shakir.
Deemak, starring Javed Sheikh, Faysal Qureshi and Sonya Hussyn, is a horror film. It is a difficult genre to do justice to — a slight misstep, and all can go topsy-turvy.
Those who have seen the movie are singing praises for it. In the final analysis, though, it will be box office results which will put a cinematic venture in its right place.

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that the Pentagon was prepared to mobilise active-duty troops “if violence continues” in Los Angeles, saying the Marines at nearby Camp Pendleton were “on high alert”.
Federal security agents on Saturday confronted protesters in the Paramount area in southeast Los Angeles, where some demonstrators displayed Mexican flags. A second protest in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday night attracted some 60 people, who chanted slogans including “ICE out of LA!”
Trump signed a presidential memorandum to deploy the National Guard troops to “address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester,” the White House said in a statement. Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, told Fox News that the National Guard would be deployed in Los Angeles on Saturday.
 






California Governor Gavin Newsom called the decision “purposefully inflammatory”.
He posted on X that Trump was deploying the National Guard “not because there is a shortage of law enforcement, but because they want a spectacle,” adding: “Don’t give them one. Never use violence. Speak out peacefully.”
 






Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that if Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass can’t do their jobs “then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, riots and looters, the way it should be solved!!!”
The protests pit Democratic-run Los Angeles, where census data suggests a significant portion of the population is Hispanic and foreign-born, against Trump’s Republican White House, which has made cracking down on immigration a hallmark of his second term.
‘Violent insurrection’
“Insurrectionists carrying foreign flags are attacking immigration enforcement officers, while one half of America’s political leadership has decided that border enforcement is evil,” Vice President JD Vance posted on X late on Saturday.
 






Senior White House aide Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner, described the protests as a “violent insurrection”.
The administration has not invoked the Insurrection Act, two US officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity. One said that National Guard troops can deploy quickly, within 24 hours in some cases, and that the military was working to source the 2,000 troops.
The 1807 law empowers a president to deploy the US military to enforce the law and suppress events like civil disorder. The last time it was invoked was during the 1992 Los Angeles riots at the request of the California governor.
Video footage of the Paramount protest showed dozens of green-uniformed security personnel with gas masks at the Paramount protest, lined up on a road strewn with overturned shopping carts as small canisters exploded into gas clouds. Authorities began detaining some protesters, according to Reuters witnesses. There was no official information on any arrests.
“Now they know that they cannot go to anywhere in this country where our people are, and try to kidnap our workers, our people — they cannot do that without an organised and fierce resistance,” said 44-year-old protester Ron Gochez.
 


A first round of protests kicked off on Friday night after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted enforcement operations in the city and arrested at least 44 people on alleged immigration violations.
The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that there were about “1,000 rioters” at the protests on Friday.
Reuters could not verify DHS’s account. Angelica Salas, executive director of immigrants’ rights organisation Chirla, said lawyers had not had access to those detained on Friday, which she called “very worrying”.
Trump’s immigration crackdown
Trump has pledged to deport record numbers of people in the country illegally and lock down the US-Mexico border, with the White House setting a goal for the ICE to arrest at least 3,000 migrants per day.
But the sweeping immigration crackdown has also caught up people legally residing in the country, including some with permanent residence, and has led to legal challenges.
ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Los Angeles Police Department did not respond to requests for comment on the protests or whether there had been any immigration raids on Saturday.
 
 

Television news footage on Friday showed unmarked vehicles resembling military transport and vans loaded with uniformed federal agents streaming through Los Angeles streets as part of the immigration enforcement operation.
Raids occurred around Home Depot stores, where street vendors and day labourers were picked up, as well as at a garment factory and a warehouse, Salas of Chirla said.
Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, condemned the immigration raids.
“I am deeply angered by what has taken place,” Bass said in a statement. “These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city. We will not stand for this.”</p><small>2025-06-08 04:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/684354f5012be.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915948/the-war-within' target='_blank'><strong>The war within</strong></a><br><p>PRESIDENT Donald Trump’s greatest challenge at home has come from the country’s judiciary, not the opposition Democratic Party that remains leaderless and in disarray.
The biggest blow to the US president’s trade policy was the ruling delivered by a federal court last month that declared illegal many tariffs he had imposed on countries across the world. Although the administration secured a temporary reprieve from an appeals court that paused the ruling, the legal battle is far from over. The appeal process has to play out and the case may even go to the US Supreme Court. Global financial markets welcomed the court order against tariffs but it leaves Trump’s trade plan hanging in the balance.
Trump reacted furiously to the court of international trade’s decision calling it “wrong”, “political” and the “harshest financial ruling” ever. His officials went further, accusing judges of “judicial overreach” and an abuse of power to “usurp the authority of the president”. In fact, it was Trump who exceeded his emergency powers to levy global tariffs, according to the trade court. Trump had invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on April 2.
Due to the adverse market reaction to that decision, he went back and forth on tariffs, pausing them, lowering some and then raising others. This spooked investors and sowed confusion among America’s trading partners. Trump switched course when markets tanked and there was a heavy sell-off in US bonds. After the markets, it was the turn of the courts to try to restrain Trump. As the Financial Times wrote in a recent editorial, America’s courts are playing a salutary role by “trying to rein in what Trump regards as his limitless powers as president”.
Legal problems have cast a shadow over Trump’s trade agenda. They may impact trade talks underway with many countries, who might see their negotiating hand strengthened by challenges Trump’s policies face from the courts. Crucial negotiations lie ahead with America’s two key trading partners, China and the EU. They can be affected by legal issues at home, even though Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have recently had a positive phone conversation on trade issues.

America’s courts are trying to restrain Trump’s unbridled use of executive power.

While the tariff ruling is arguably the biggest judicial jolt to Trump’s plans, he has encountered legal setbacks on other fronts too. According to one estimate, there have been court orders against 182 of Trump’s executive actions. Some injunctions have been of a temporary nature, but they have still acted as a check on Trump’s whimsical conduct. The petitioners have mostly included state governments, cities, labour unions, civil liberties and non-profit organisations. In the tariff case, it was a group of states led by Oregon that sued the administration over its use of emergency powers without congressional action.
Cases against the administration have involved Trump’s immigration and deportation policies, his downsizing of the federal government that entailed sweeping layoffs of the workforce, freeze on foreign aid, dismantling of US agencies, birthright citizenship rights, and assaults on universities and law firms.
Among the most controversial of Trump’s actions to be legally challenged are the drastic cuts in the size of the federal government by large-scale firing of civil servants, ceasing funding and closing down agencies. The task of executing this plan was given to Trump’s billionaire (now estranged) friend, Elon Musk, through his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which saw over three dozen cases challenging its authority and even more lawsuits contesting funding cuts and sacking of workers. Tens of thousands of federal employees were fired while thousands were placed on forced leave or left their jobs under resignation programmes.
A California court ruling ordered a halt to the downsizing, questioning the legality of the move. Subsequently, in another blow for Trump, an appeals court upheld that decision, forcing the administration to maintain the pause on more cuts and firings. Musk’s exit from the government throws DOGE’s future into uncertainty, even though Trump has vowed its work will carry on.
Ivy League universities have also come under mounting pressure from Trump’s efforts to control these institutions and suppress dissent. The administration’s battle with Harvard University has seen funding withheld, and attempts to change its governance structure and bar its ability to host foreign students. Harvard resisted and asserted its rights in the face of government intimidation by suing the federal government. Its efforts succeeded when a federal judge blocked the order revoking its right to enrol foreign students. Trump then suspended visas for six months for foreign students enrolled for study at Harvard. But this effort to circumvent the court’s ruling will only intensify the legal battle.
Courts have issued important rulings and provided temporary relief in some cases to foreign students whose visas were cancelled or threatened owing to their pro-Palestinian sympathies. The way foreign students have been arrested — some from the streets — handcuffed and sent to detention centres, with their visas abruptly revoked, sparked an outcry in America’s academic community. A California district judge has now barred the administration from ending the legal status of international students across the country. The ruling prevents the authorities from arresting, imprisoning or moving students elsewhere based on their legal status until their case is resolved.
Trump’s response to judicial opposition to his policies has predictably been harsh. He and his officials have vilified judges and subjected some to strong public criticism. Of course, in some notable and consequential cases, courts have also ruled in his favour. But the administration is embroiled in scores of lawsuits and it remains unclear whether Trump will comply with court orders or try to circumvent them. He has already defied court rulings, especially in immigration issues, including a supreme court order in a deportation case. How the growing clash between the executive and judiciary plays out is hard to predict, but for now America’s courts are standing up to Trump’s arbitrary actions, striking them down in key cases and acting as a check on the unbridled use of executive power.

Published in Dawn, June 7th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-08 04:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/080857173f6cfc7.jpg?r=085729' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915943/pushed-into-poverty' target='_blank'><strong>Pushed into poverty</strong></a><br><p>A WORLD Bank finding that nearly 45pc of Pakistanis live below the poverty line should not come as a surprise. Neither should the fact that the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has risen from 4.9pc to 16.5pc.
The poverty numbers quoted by the bank in a report are based on a survey conducted in 2018-19; they do not take into account the devastating impact of the 2022 floods or the record inflation of the last couple of years on millions of people. Pakistan has not conducted household income surveys since 2019. If a new survey is carried out, the percentage of people living below the poverty line is certain to rise further.
 
 

The bank has clarified that the increase comes in the wake of an update in global poverty lines by it, and not because of any change in the underlying economic conditions in Pakistan or elsewhere. About 82pc of the increase in the numbers living in poverty is due to the higher value of the new poverty lines, with the rest explained by price increases in Pakistan between 2017 and 2021.
However, the bank says that poverty trends remain unchanged. A bank official said that Pakistan’s poverty and resilience assessment, currently in progress, would provide the latest update on actual poverty in the country and explore the drivers and dimensions of trends in poverty and welfare over the past 20 years. In addition, the findings, due in September, would examine spatial disparities and fiscal equity.
 
 

The increase in the number of poor may have come from the revised higher poverty threshold, stagnant economic growth and a record spike in living costs in recent years, besides the impact of disaster on millions, which together must have pushed most low-income households to the borders of ‘poor’ and ‘non-poor’ under the poverty line. With socioeconomic conditions unlikely to change and public service delivery likely to deteriorate further due to falling development expenditures, chances are that new surveys will reveal worsening urban and rural poverty results.
The factors affecting an increase in poverty apart, there still is room to reverse the trend through targeted interventions and the effective use of available resources. But this will require political will, a strong policy focus and coordination amongst the different tiers of government. In this respect, we can learn a lot from China’s successful experience.

• Only two movies being released this Eid
• Costs, cultural constraints affect cinema industry amid OTT boom
• Artists, producers say govt patronage key to silver screen revival
WITH a shift from big cinemas — whose prices were more affordable to a larger segment of society — to high-end multiplexes, a dearth of quality films and the rise in over-the-top streaming services, it feels like the curtain is falling fast on the silver screen industry.
This is not just the story of one industry, rather a cultural loss, where avenues of community entertainment have dwindled over the years.
Sixty-seven cinemas have been closed all over Pakistan in the last seven years, known film distributor Sheikh Abid told Dawn. “Across Punjab, only 39 cinemas are left after the closure of as many as 37 cinemas.”
Even Film star Shaan Shahid regretted that there were no films to run the cinema halls.
Only two Pakistani movies, Deemak and Love Guru, are being released this Eid.
 
 

On the list of the top 11 highest-grossing Pakistani films within local cinemas, there were four movies in 2018 and two in 2022 but none afterwards, indicating the waning flow of quality content.
At the same time, the affordability and diversity offered by Over-The-Top (OTT) services have increasingly pulled audiences away from cinemas.
In Shaan’s words: “Cinema perhaps is getting outdated, but not the content. Good films are always the outcome of good content.”
He says no attention had been paid to filmmaking over the years. “Young filmmakers should have been given a chance and should be financed to come up with films having good content. [In such case] The atmosphere of cinema cannot be replaced with social media platforms.”
Growth of OTTs
However, streaming has already globalised Pakistani content, with Sunn Mere Dil, Dil-i-Nadan, Churails, Rukhsaar, Aik Jho­oti Love Story and Barzakh gaining traction in the Middle East, India, and among the diaspora.
 
 

Netflix’s Jo Bachay Hain Sang Samait Lo starring Fawad Khan and Sanam Saeed is slated for later this year, signalling a leap in international visibility.
Creative freedom and affordability are the main reasons for the growth of OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5 and iflix, drawing not only audiences but also artists away from mainstream cinema in Pakistan, which has struggled to evolve beyond formulaic storylines due to cultural or commercial constraints.
Film producer Kanwal Khoosat says, “Local and international are two different scenarios when it comes to films. It seems to us cinema has become old-fashioned, whereas OTT for its outreach and visibility is one of the essentials, but it’s a misconception.”
In Europe, she said, it is considered derogatory to screen films on OTT. “We in Pakistan have no diplomacy with [such] platforms, we need to rely on our own cinema for its revival. Regretfully, cinema is no more an entertainment for the ordinary man; modern cinema halls are for the elite.”
Govt support, fee cut
However, Yasir Nawaz, a noted director and producer, was of the opinion that cinema was experiencing a downfall across the world. He said OTT or AI were not the issue, what matters for cinema’s revival was “big support from the government” and “fee cut by exhibitors and distributors”.
He said no strategies had been laid out to revive the industry. “Expensive cinema halls led to less buying of tickets,” he said, adding even they did not offer discounts.
Noted film director Nadeem Baig, who directed films such as Punjab Nahi Jaoon Gi and Jawani Phir Nahi Aani, said OTT platforms did give competition, but cinema could only be revived when filmmakers produced around 12 films a year.
 
 

He said government support was vital. “It is good Punjab and Sindh governments have realised spending on filmmaking is important,” he noted.
Humayun Saeed beli­eves OTT platforms can’t affect cinema, asserting they could not create the effect that cinema had. But industry’s revival depended on supply chain and government support, he said. Production of more and diverse films was the mantra, he said.
Mentorship
For veteran actor Nayyer Ejaz, improved content is key to revive cinema. “Why OTT is being considered top of the line? Because they choose the best and different content,” he said. Government patronage is important, but young writers must learn screenplay from seniors, he said, adding the industry also needed to adopt modern techniques.
Film writer Pervaiz Kalim was of the opinion that young filmmakers could help revive cinema, while also underlining the need for mentoring budding filmmakers by seniors to boost film production.
If Pakistani content can get awards and nominations in international film festivals, there’s no dearth of talent or scarcity of original content.
Actor Wahaj Ali, however, thinks OTT and AI had nothing to do with the revival of cinema. “We need to enhance our productions. Pakistani dramas have a great international audience. If producers invest properly in films without fear of recovery, quality films can be produced.”
 
 

Screenwriter, actor and host Vasay Chaudhry, too, believes OTT or any other social media platform could not replace cinema. “Cinema’s popularity just cannot be replaced,” he reiterated. People used to say after Covid that cinema wouldn’t survive, but many films were screened, he remarked.
Many film enthusiasts, however, question if our known filmmakers, artists, distributors and exhibitors are prepared to take up the challenge, embrace innovation and hone the potential of young tech-savvy minds or still in denial mode, resorting to blame game and awaiting some external help to turn the tide.
Indeed, when the brightest minds are empowered with the experience of yesteryears and the tools of tomorrow, miracles can happen.

After obtaining approvals from relevant regulators, including the Competition Commission of Pakistan, and clearing all cases in the Islamabad High Court, the $560 million deal has materialised.
Jazz, the largest telecom operator in the country, has become the first telecom to offload all of its telecom towers. Deodar, the cell-site tower management subsidiary of Jazz, has been sold to Engro Connect.
However, Jazz will pay rent for all the cell sites installed at these towers to Engro Connect, a subsidiary of Engro Corp.

Move to establish ‘cells’ of multiple telecom operators at a single tower

The deal was one of the most significant private-sector infrastructure transactions in the country’s digital evolution. Jazz was currently using around 14,500 telecom towers; other tower companies, including Engro Enfrashare, the largest independent tower infrastructure company in Pakistan, and Edotco managed the remaining 4,000 towers.
Meanwhile, TAWAL Pakistan, a Saudi-based company, has recently launched its operations as the fourth ‘towerco’.
A senior official of the company stated that the telecos invested heavily in the tower around 20 years ago, as there was no infrastructure available at that time, and the strength of the telecos was measured by their coverage areas and the number of subscribers.
Meanwhile, Jazz CEO Aamir Ibrahim has said, “As we pivot to a digital-first future, this milestone enables us to remain asset-light while doubling down on what we do best — delivering impactful, tech-driven solutions for Pakistan’s evolving needs.”
He added that the company would focus on being a full-fledged service, with a portfolio spanning fintech, cloud, entertainment, and digital health.
 
 

The concept of towercos was gaining popularity globally as they have become experts in infrastructure development and management by taking on the responsibilities of paying annual taxes and duties for towers, power supply, generator management, and security.
Under this concept, a towerco can establish the ‘cells’ of multiple telecom operators at a single tower.
Currently, there are around 50,000 telecom towers in the country, and it is expected that as the concept of tower companies grows, other telecom operators will also offload their tower management responsibilities.
A senior official from the IT ministry stated that while it is anticipated that many towers will be consolidated in urban areas, the overall number of towers will increase in several new regions where telecom services have not yet been established.
“But it was less likely that Telenor and Ufone would make such a decision soon — as their merger was underway and many business decisions of both the companies were on hold till the CCP decides on merger,” the official added.
Apart from the telecoms, telecom towers are also becoming key interchanges for the optical fibre network, and many fibre companies and internet service providers are also paying rent to the tower operators for internet cable services.

This was highlighted in a report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), titled “Battery Storage and the Future of Pakistan’s Electricity Grid”. According to the report, the adoption of BESS is being driven by both off-grid and on-grid solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. Pakistan imported 27.6 gigawatts of solar PV modules between FY19 and FY24, with an additional 5.2GW imported in the first half of FY25.
However, it is estimated that only half of the total imported capacity is currently installed across the country, and at least 11.5GW of this capacity exists off-grid. “It is unlikely that all rooftop and captive solar consumers will adopt battery storage systems because of the high upfront costs,” said the report.
If all existing net metering capacity were paired with equal-sized battery storage systems, it could reduce annual electricity demand from the grid by 1.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) or 1.1 per cent of the country’s demand.

Pakistan imported 32.8GW of solar PV modules in five years

Similarly, commercial enterprises like office spaces, which operate from 9am to 5pm, may not require battery storage at night. Assuming a conservative estimate where only 25pc of the energy produced by the imported solar panel capacity is stored, annual grid demand could be reduced by 11.5TWh, or 8.4pc of Pakistan’s actual demand.
 
 

The convergence of rising energy prices and falling costs for distributed energy resources (DER), such as rooftop solar PV systems and BESS, have encouraged consumers to adopt decentralised energy solutions, reducing reliance on the grid and energy costs. “Pakistan imported an estimated 1.25 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion battery packs in 2024 and another 400 megawatt-hours in the first two months of 2025, a trend that is likely to continue,” said the report.
Pakistan’s growing adoption of battery storage is supported by lithium-ion battery imports from China — the global leader in BESS technology and production.
China’s abundant clean technology manufacturing capacity is forecast to continue expanding, further driving down prices. Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) predicts batteries will cross the $100/MWh threshold in 2025, while global benchmarks for wind and solar generation are also expected to decline.
“BNEF’s projections for global levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) benchmarks for battery storage in 2035 show an almost 50pc drop, with storage costs declining to $53/MWh,” said the report.
While solar PV module prices in Pakistan have consistently declined, emulating improving economics in China, the same is not true for BESS because of high taxes and customs duties.
“The average price of lithium-ion battery packs in Pakistan ranges between $230/kWh and $360/kWh,” said the report. It added that on a macro level, the falling demand from the grid has led to financial losses and increased capacity payments for the government and remaining consumers.
“The country’s rapid adoption of solar PV systems has already started impacting centralised grid generation. As more consumers shift to net metering and self-generation, the overall electricity demand from the national grid has started declining,” said the report.
However, due to contractual obligations resulting from long-term power purchase agreements, the exit of paying consumers from the grid increases the financial burden on remaining users through higher fixed costs and capacity payments.
A more direct way of assessing BESS adoption is by examining lithium-ion battery storage imports. According to analysis by IEEFA, around 1.25GWh of lithium-ion battery storage packs were imported into Pakistan in 2024.
“This accounts for around 4.7pc of that year’s 25.6GW annual peak demand. Based on a daily charging-discharging cycle, installing the entire 1.25GWh of battery storage could mean a yearly deduction of 438GWh of energy demand from the grid,” said the report.

LAHORE: The Pakistan Kissan Ittehad (PKI) has issued a stark warning regarding an escalating agricultural crisis that has gripped the nation since May 2024, resulting in unprecedented financial losses for farmers and a severe downturn in the country’s vital agricultural sector.
According to data compiled by the PKI, farmers have collectively sustained a staggering compound loss of approximately Rs2,200 billion in wheat alone between May 2024 and May 2025. This colossal figure represents a significant 23.15 per cent of the total crop sector’s contribution to GDP, which stood at Rs9,500 billion for FY24. The immense financial strain has severely curtailed farmers’ purchasing power, consequently hindering productivity across other critical crops.
 
 

“The agricultural sector, the backbone of our economy, is teetering on the brink,” stated Khalid Mahmood Khokhar, President of Pakistan Kissan Ittehad. “The past year has been catastrophic for our farmers, with plummeting prices and unsustainable production costs pushing many to the wall. This crisis is not merely an agricultural issue; it’s a national emergency that demands immediate and decisive action.”
The crisis extends beyond wheat, with other key crops experiencing significant setbacks. According to PKI, cotton production has plummeted to 5.55 million bales this year, a staggering 50pc below target and 34pc lower than the previous year. This drastic decline is projected to inflate the cotton import bill to an alarming $1.9 billion, a massive leap from $448 million last year.
Likewise, the 2025 wheat production is estimated at 28.98 million tonnes, an 8.91pc reduction from last year’s 31.81m tonnes, representing a shortfall of 2.82m tonnes. This reduction alone accounts for an estimated loss of Rs250bn based on international market values, it claims.
Maize production has declined by 15.4pc to 8.24m tonnes from 9.74m tonnes last year, while sugarcane production has decreased to 84.24m tonnes from 87.64m tonnes.
Mr Khokhar says that the overall production of important crops has seen a collective decrease of 13.49pc in FY25, and the overall agricultural sector growth has nosedived from 6.25pc to a mere 0.56pc since July 2024, highlighting the severe contraction of the sector.
The impact of these production shortfalls is reflected in the nation’s trade balance for food items. While Pakistan’s raw food exports slightly decreased to $6.16bn during July-April 2024-25 compared to $6.23bn last year, the food import bill surged to nearly $7bn in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, up from $6.82bn in the same period last year. This widening gap underscores the nation’s increasing reliance on food imports, further straining its foreign exchange reserves.
Adding insult to injury, the current tax structure places an unfair burden on local farmers, he bemoans. There is zero General Sales Tax (GST) on imported cotton bales, while locally produced seed cotton is subjected to an 18pc GST, creating a disadvantage for domestic growers.
 
 

The PKI recommends abolishing further tax burden on the agricultural sector as it cannot withstand any additional tax in the form of GST or Federal Excise Duty (FED).
It also urges the government to immediately announce support or indicative prices for all crops to prevent the exploitation of farmers.
It demands a robust, efficient, and transparent commodity price mechanism, guaranteeing farmers at least a 25pc return on investment (ROI). The 18pc GST on locally produced seed cotton must be abolished immediately to protect cotton growers. Also the 14pc GST on tractors and 18pc on tractor-mounted implements should be abolished without delay, and electricity tariffs for the agricultural sector should be standardised at Rs10 per unit (one unit, one rate).
’’These measures are not merely suggestions; they are vital for the survival of our farmers and the food security of our nation,“ remarked Khokhar. “The government must prioritise the agricultural sector and implement these recommendations without delay to avert a complete collapse.”

One of Ukraine’s largest cities, Kharkiv is located just a few dozen kilometres from the Russian border and has been under constant Russian shelling during more than three years of war.
“Kharkiv is currently experiencing the most powerful attack since the start of the full-scale war,” Terekhov said on the Telegram messenger early on Saturday.
Dozens of explosions were heard in the city through the night and Russian troops were striking simultaneously with missiles, drones, and guided aerial bombs, he said.
Multi-storey and private residential buildings, educational and infrastructure facilities were attacked, Terekhov noted.
Kharkiv governor Oleh Syniehubov said that one of the city’s civilian industrial facilities was attacked by 40 drones, one missile and four bombs, causing a fire, adding there may still be people under the rubble.
In the evening, Russian aircraft once again attacked Kharkiv with guided bombs, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called “another brutal murder”.
“It was a brutal blow to the city in broad daylight, and in fact, they have been attacking our city of Kharkiv for the entire day,” Zelenskiy said in his evening statement.
“Last night, there was a massive drone strike on Kharkiv, and now there are aerial bombs. Dozens of people have been injured in the past 24 hours,” he said.
The Ukrainian military said Russia launched 206 drones, 2 ballistic and 7 other missiles against Ukraine overnight.
It said its air defence units shot down 87 drones while another 80 drones were lost — in reference to the Ukrainian military using electronic warfare to redirect them — or they were drone simulators that did not carry warheads.
Ten locations were hit, the military said.</p><small>2025-06-07 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/072050232c2024c.jpg?r=211643' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915997/bilawal-calls-out-india-for-excuses-to-avoid-dialogue-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal calls out India for ‘excuses’ to avoid dialogue with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Saturday called out India for its “excuses” to avoid any dialogue with Pakistan to resolve their outstanding issues after recent tensions between the two countries.
Pakis­tan has launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team will also visit London and Brussels. The delegation comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
Addressing a press conference in Washington after wrapping up engagements with US lawmakers and think tanks, the PPP chairman said Pakistan’s civil and military leadership were all on the same page against terrorism and believed that it was in the region’s interest to establish with India. “It is India who’s been running away from calls for an investigation and it’s been India who’s been running away from efforts for dialogue. I believe that is perhaps the lamest excuse for not having a dialogue right now,” he added.
Bilawal offered to arrange a dialogue with the military or political leadership if India wanted.
“I believe the true path forward is for India and Pakistan to engage in a dialogue to establish peace. Whatever excuse you want to make sometimes, it’s this civil military excuse, sometimes it’s this geopolitical excuse, sometimes it’s this ‘Oh all Muslims are terrorist excuse so we’re not going to talk to Pakistan’ — it’s getting [tiresome]. You can’t be two nuclear armed neighbours with a conflict threshold so low and absolutely no dispute resolution mechanism.”
Bilawal said India did not want mediation from the US or the United Nations or any interactional actor and did not even want to engage directly with Pakistan, noting that this made no rational sense.
“It’s in all our interest to convince India to undo the decision that doesn’t serve their purposes and come to the table and talk.”
 


Bilawal said the recent ceasefire between the two countries was only the first step.
“For durable peace in South Asia, we need to have a comprehensive dialogue with our neighbour where we address all our friction points. Indeed, when Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire, we did so on the condition that going forward, there would be a dialogue in a neutral location on all friction points.
“And we’re very confident that that is the only way forward, not only for Pakistan, but also for India. While we’re very grateful for the ceasefire, we’re cognizant of the fact that we are all, Pakistan and India, but our region and the globe, by extension, a less safe place today than we were when this conflict started.”
The former FM said the threshold for “full-blown war between two nuclear-armed powers” had been drastically decreased and was at a stage it was never before at in history.
“As things stand today, if there’s a terrorist attack anywhere in India or Indian-occupied Kashmir, proof or no proof, that means war. That doesn’t serve the interest of my country, and that certainly doesn’t serve the interests of the people of India.”
Bilawal once again said that Pakistan was ready to discuss the issue of terrorism in any “comprehensive dialogue” with India.
He stressed that if there was to be new dialogue with India and new promises and new treaties, “then it’s all the more important that we abide by our old treaties so we have confidence in each other that the new agreements that we are to make are worth more than the paper that they are written on”.
Indian disinformation during military conflict
On the topic of misinformation and disinformation during their recent conflict, Bilawal said a factor that played to Pakistan’s favour was that “we were transparent and we managed to maintain our credibility.
 
 

“We were transparent with the media, we were transparent with our public, and we were transparent with our allies. The events corroborate what we say.
“Three people are making claims in this situation, Pakistan, the United States, and India. Two of us are saying one thing, one of them is saying something else. So I think you can try to figure out who’s telling the truth. India employed disinformation not only during this conflict, they continue to employ disinformation as part of their delegations’ tool.
“They lied to the international community and their own people about this terrorist attack. To this day, they haven’t shared either with the media, with their allies, or with Pakistan, who they fought a war with, who the terrorists were that were involved with this incident in Indian-occupied Kashmir. They have not been honest or forthcoming about the damages they sustained during this conflict. They still, to this day, refuse to admit how many airplanes they lost in this conflict.”
 
 

Bilawal said that to assess who was speaking more accurately, “you can see who’s had the same line consistently, whose views are being corroborated by the statements made not only from the presidency, but also from the State Department.”
He said Pakistan prided itself on its transparency during this period, adding that the country still open to questions and probing on the facts.
“India has relied on disinformation throughout this conflict. Even during the war, the Indian media played the role of fake news and amplified some of this disinformation that originated from the Indian government.”</p><small>2025-06-07 18:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0720283790bc0d1.jpg?r=203133' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915994/uk-and-india-discuss-counter-terrorism-cooperation-after-south-asia-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>UK and India discuss ‘counter-terrorism’ cooperation after South Asia tensions</strong></a><br><p>The United Kingdom and India on Saturday discussed expanding their “counter-terrorism” collaboration following recent fighting between the latter and Pakistan, Britain’s foreign minister told Reuters after meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
British FM David Lammy is the highest-profile Western official to have visited both New Delhi and Islamabad since the two agreed to a ceasefire last month after their worst fighting in nearly three decades.
The latest tensions began in April after the killing of 26 men in Indian-occupied Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on “terrorists” it alleged were backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denied. India then attacked what it claimed was “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan, leading to escalation from both sides until a May 10 ceasefire.
“We want the situation to be maintained, but of course we recognise fragility, particularly in the backdrop of terrorism, terrorism designed to destabilise India,” Lammy said in an interview at the residence of the British high commissioner in New Delhi.
“We are keen to continue to work with our Indian partners on counter-terrorism measures.”
He said he discussed the next steps with both Modi and Indian FM S. Jaishankar, but gave no specifics.
Last year, India and Britain discussed combatting the financing of terrorism, cooperation between law enforcement and judicial bodies and information sharing.
Lammy said he also discussed boosting trade between the world’s fifth and sixth largest economies. The countries concluded talks for a free trade deal early last month.
“I know that Prime Minister Keir Starmer is very much looking forward to coming to India very soon to sign the free trade agreement,” Lammy said. “There is so much that our two nations can continue to do together.”</p><small>2025-06-07 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/071132400ad5d00.jpg?r=154411' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915974/country-celebrates-eidul-azha-today-with-call-for-unity-selflessness' target='_blank'><strong>Country celebrates Eidul Azha today with call for unity, selflessness</strong></a><br><p>The country celebrated Eidul Azha on Saturday, with leaders urging unity and selflessness, and emphasising the importance of promoting values of sacrifice, love, and brotherhood.

The municipal administrations in cities and towns made special arrangements for the disposal of offal and other post-qurbani solid waste during the three days of Eidul Azha, and to ensure cleanliness.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended heartfelt congratulations to the entire Pakistani nation and the Muslim Ummah around the world on the occasion of Eidul Azha.
They emphasised the importance of promoting values of sacrifice, love, brotherhood, and unity in the nation’s behaviour.
In his message, the president said that the day revives in people the spirit of faith, sacrifice, selflessness, and brotherhood.
“He called for drawing lessons from the spirit of sacrifice and selflessness shown by Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and integrating them into our lives,” Radio Pakistan said.
 
 

He said there was a pressing need to support the underprivileged and marginalised segments of our society. “Along with the act of animal sacrifice, Eid calls upon us to make a solemn pledge to always care for those in need.”
Zardari said as a nation, we must support each other, share in each other’s sorrows, and work together to build a prosperous and great Pakistan.
PM Shehbaz said, “The message of Eidul Azha is not limited to the sacrifice of animals alone, it also teaches us to sacrifice our ego, desires, and personal interests for higher purposes.
“As our beloved homeland, Pakistan, moves forward on the path of development, we must embrace the spirit of unity, sacrifice, and selflessness.”
He said this Eid teaches us not only the importance of sacrificing life and wealth but also that nations achieve greatness when they work for collective welfare and selflessness alongside individual development.
PM Shehbaz continued, “Today, we must especially remember our Palestinian brothers and sisters who are enduring ruthless and inhumane oppression and hunger.”
He added: “Likewise, we reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the brave people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, who have been engaged in a just and courageous struggle for their right to self-determination for decades.”
The prime minister, along with former chief minister Hamza Shehbaz, offered prayers in Lahore’s Model Town.

PM, FM exchange Eid greetings with foreign leaders
PM Shehbaz called his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim and exchanged Eid greetings, Radio Pakistan reported.
Both leaders prayed for peace and the safety of Palestinians in Gaza. They reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation between both countries in trade, investment, and culture.
PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude to the Malaysian leader for his stance during the Pakistan-India crisis, calling for de-escalation and dialogue.
He underscored that Pakistan always strove for regional peace and stability, but was left with no option but to respond decisively to India’s military aggression.
He further said that Pakistan accepted the ceasefire understanding, brokered by the US and other friendly countries, in the interest of regional peace and security.
He reiterated that Pakistan was ready for dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
Shehbaz also called Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon to exchange Eid greetings and thanked the Central Asian state for its balanced position calling for peace and dialogue during the recent Pakistan-India crisis.
He emphasised that Pakistan always strove to maintain peace and security in the region and agreed to the ceasefire with India. The Tajik president appreciated Pakistan’s efforts for regional peace and security.
Emir of the State of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was also called by the premier and conveyed Eid greetings.
PM Shehbaz thanked the emir’s proactive diplomacy and constructive role in de-escalating tensions between Pakistan and India during the recent crisis.
The two leaders also reiterated their common desire to expand ties between both countries, particularly through mutually beneficial trade and investment.
Meanwhile, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called the foreign ministers of friendly countries, including Azerbaijan, Turkiye and Egypt, to exchange Eid greetings.
Dar spoke with Azeri Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov and discussed ways to further strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation, the Foreign Office said in a statement.
He also held a telephone conversation with Turkish FM Hakan Fidan and exchanged Eid greetings and “prayed for peace and well-being of the Palestinian people and the entire Ummah”.

US President Donald Trump signed on Wednesday an executive order reviving sweeping restrictions that echo his first-term travel ban, justified on national security grounds following a firebomb attack at a pro-Israel rally in Colorado.
Alireza Hashemi-Raja, the foreign ministry’s director general for the affairs of Iranians abroad, called the measure, which takes effect June 9, “a clear sign of the dominance of a supremacist and racist mentality among American policymakers”.
The decision “indicates the deep hostility of American decision-makers towards the Iranian and Muslim people”, he added in a statement released by the ministry.
Apart from Iran, the US ban targets nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. A partial ban was imposed on travellers from seven other countries.
Hashemi-Raja said the policy “violates fundamental principles of international law” and deprives “hundreds of millions of people of the right to travel based solely on their nationality or religion”.
The foreign ministry official said that the ban was discriminatory and would “entail international responsibility for the US government”, without elaborating.
Iran and the US severed diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and relations have remained deeply strained since.
The United States is home to the largest Iranian community outside Iran.
According to figures from Tehran’s foreign ministry, in 2020, there were some 1.5 million Iranians in the US.
Trump’s executive order came days after Sunday’s attack at the Colorado rally, in which authorities said more than a dozen people were hurt. The suspect is an Egyptian man who had overstayed a tourist visa.
Separately, the Afghan Taliban’s supreme leader, Sheikh Hibatullah Akhundzada, used his Eid sermon in southern Kandahar to slam the US travel ban and decision to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access in Gaza.
Afghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the Taliban leader led Eid prayers at Eidgah in Kandahar with thousands attending the congregation.
Mujahid posted Akhundzada’s address on his official X account.
“Fourteen countries supported the resolution calling for a ceasefire in Palestine but the oppressive America, which had committed atrocities here in Afghanistan, is now committing atrocities in Palestine. Palestinian Muslims are victims of oppression. America is supporting Israel.”
He regretted that some people were happy with friendship with the US and considered it success for themselves. “The US is the biggest oppressor. America is the murderer of all Muslims in Palestine,” the Taliban leader said.
He said peace was established in Afghanistan.
“Those who followed the path of jihad have succeeded … No one was expecting Muslims would be victorious in Afghanistan. Americans would be humiliated in the world as they were in Afghanistan,” he claimed.
“Israel is oppressing Palestinians with the backing of America, and if America is not their, then Israel does not have that much power”
The Taliban leader defended a complete ban on opium cultivation in Afghanistan and said he had not taken the decision to get anything from the world. “But this decision had been taken in accordance with Islamic Sharia,” Akhundzada said.</p><small>2025-06-07 14:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0716473849a86f9.jpg?r=172014' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915986/in-pictures-eidul-azha-celebrations-across-the-world' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Eidul Azha celebrations across the world</strong></a><br><p>Millions of Muslims around the world observed Eidul Azha, also known as the feast of the sacrifice, by offering special prayers, holding social gatherings and giving meat to the needy on Saturday.

Worshippers in several countries, including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Thailand and Myanmar, gathered to mark the festivities, amid the shadow of Israeli bombardment and siege in Gaza, which has so far claimed the lives of over 54,000 Palestinians.

Addressing reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said he wasn’t “thinking about” the Tesla CEO.
“I hope he does well with Tesla,” Trump said.
However, Trump said a review of Musk’s extensive contracts with the federal government was in order. “We’ll take a look at everything,” the president said. “It’s a lot of money.”
 


Trump may get rid of the red Tesla Model S that he bought in March after showcasing Musk’s electric cars on the White House lawn, a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Musk, for his part, did not directly address Trump but kept up his criticism of the massive Republican tax and spending bill that contains much of Trump’s domestic agenda.
On his social-media platform X, Musk amplified remarks made by others that Trump’s “big beautiful bill” would hurt Republicans politically and add to the nation’s $36.2 trillion debt. He replied “exactly” to a post by another X user that said Musk had criticised Congress and Trump had responded by criticising Musk personally.
Musk also declared it was time for a new political party in the United States “to represent the 80 per cent in the middle!”
People who have spoken to Musk said his anger has begun to recede and they think he will want to repair his relationship with Trump, according to one person who has spoken to Musk’s entourage.
The White House statements came one day after the two men battled openly in an extraordinary display of hostilities that marked a stark end to a close alliance.
Tesla stock rose on Friday, clawing back some losses from Thursday’s session, when it dropped 14pc and lost $150 billion in value, the largest single-day decline in the company’s history.
Musk’s high-profile allies have largely stayed silent during the feud. But one, investor James Fishback, called on Musk to apologise.
“President Trump has shown grace and patience at a time when Elon’s behaviour is disappointing and frankly downright disturbing,” Fishback said in a statement.
Musk, the world’s richest man, bankrolled a large part of Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. Trump named Musk to head a controversial effort to downsize the federal workforce and slash spending.
Trump feted Musk at the White House a week ago as he wrapped up his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk cut only about half of 1pc of total spending, far short of his brash plans to axe $2 trillion from the federal budget.
Since then, Musk has denounced Trump’s tax-cut and spending bill as a “disgusting abomination”. His opposition is complicating efforts to pass the bill in Congress, where Republicans hold a slim majority.
Trump’s bill narrowly passed the House of Representatives last month and is now before the Senate, where Republicans say they will make further changes. Nonpartisan analysts say the measure would add $2.4tr in debt over 10 years.
House Speaker Mike Johnson said he has been texting with Musk and hopes the dispute is resolved quickly.
“I don’t argue with him about how to build rockets and I wish he wouldn’t argue with me about how to craft legislation and pass it,” Johnson said on CNBC.
‘Very disappointed’
Trump had initially stayed quiet while Musk campaigned to torpedo the bill, but broke his silence on Thursday, telling reporters he was “very disappointed” in Musk.
Musk, who spent nearly $300 million in last year’s elections, said Trump would have lost without his support and suggested he should be impeached.
Trump suggested he would terminate government contracts with Musk’s businesses, which include rocket company SpaceX and its satellite unit Starlink.
The billionaire then threatened to decommission SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, the only US spacecraft capable of sending astronauts to the International Space Station. Musk later backed off that threat.
Musk had been angered when Trump over the weekend revoked his nomination of Musk ally Jared Isaacman to head the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Two sources with direct knowledge of the dispute said White House personnel director Sergio Gor had helped turn Trump against Isaacman by highlighting his past donations to Democrats.
Musk and Gor had been at odds since the billionaire criticised Gor’s pace of hiring at a March cabinet meeting, the two sources said.
A White House spokesperson, Steven Cheung, praised Gor’s efforts to staff the administration but did not address his relationship with Musk.
A prolonged feud could make it harder for Republicans to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections if Musk withholds financial support or other major Silicon Valley business leaders distance themselves from Trump.
Musk had already said he planned to curtail his political spending, and on Tuesday, he called for “all politicians who betrayed the American people” to be fired next year.
His involvement with the Trump administration has provoked widespread protests at Tesla sites, driving down sales while investors fretted that Musk’s attention was too divided.</p><small>2025-06-07 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/07155950b9f0c7e.jpg?r=162149' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915984/us-steps-up-immigration-crackdown-with-la-raids-ny-courthouse-arrests' target='_blank'><strong>US steps up immigration crackdown with LA raids, NY courthouse arrests</strong></a><br><p>Masked and armed federal agents carried out sweeping immigration raids in Los Angeles on Friday, while others pounced on migrants at a New York courthouse in forceful displays of United States President Donald Trump’s crackdown on people without papers.
From courthouses to hardware store parking lots in two of the most diverse cities in the world, federal agents wrestled migrants into handcuffs and unmarked vehicles.
Agents used extreme tactics, conducting unprecedented raids on at least three areas of Los Angeles to detain dozens of people.
At one sweep less than two miles from Los Angeles City Hall, agents threw flash-bang grenades to disperse angry crowds of people following alongside a convoy of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) vehicles as protesters hurled eggs and epithets at the agents, media reported.
“As a mayor of a proud city of immigrants, who contribute to our city in so many ways, I am deeply angered by what has taken place,” LA Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement.
“These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city.”
White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who grew up in LA’s Santa Monica, insisted on social media platform X that Bass had “no say in this at all”.
“Federal law is supreme and federal law will be enforced.”
 






Service Employees International Union leader David Huerta was briefly detained while documenting one of the raids in Los Angeles, according to media reports.
“Hard-working people, and members of our family and our community, are being treated like criminals,” Huerta said in a statement after his release.
Homeland Security Investigations spokesperson Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe told the Los Angeles Times that federal agents were executing search warrants related to the harbouring of people illegally in the country.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Friday afternoon to demand the release of detainees, broadcaster ABC7 reported.
The largely peaceful rally was later ordered to disperse by police, with some violent clashes between protesters and riot police being reported.
NY courthouse arrests
Across the country, plainclothes agents in New York pounced on two immigrants in the hallway of a courthouse on Friday.
Trump was elected to a second term with broad support for his promise to crack down hard on the entry and presence of undocumented migrants. ICE agents have intensified such operations in and around American immigration courts in recent weeks.
The Department of Homeland Security revoked regulations that limited agents’ access to protected areas such as courts after Trump returned to office in January.
One of the men arrested in New York was Joaquin Rosario, a 34-year-old Dominican who arrived in the US a year ago, registered as he came in and who had his first immigration hearing on Friday, his relative Julian Rosario said.
“He was at ease. He did not think anything was going to happen,” the relative said, adding that Rosario was so unworried he had not brought his lawyer with him.
The other detainee appeared to be Asian. He arrived accompanied only by one of many immigration advocacy group volunteers who walk immigrants to and from the courtroom. The volunteers screamed out as the agents arrested the two men, but it did nothing to halt the raid.
‘Sound the alarm’
Human rights groups are outraged by such operations, arguing that they sap trust in the courts and make immigrants wary of showing up for appointments as they try to gain US residency.
“They’re illegal abductions,” said Karen Ortiz, a court employee who was demonstrating on Friday against the sudden arrests of migrants.
“We need to sound the alarm and show the public how serious this is and one way we can do that is actually physically putting ourselves between a masked ICE agent and someone they’re trying to detain and send away,” she told AFP.
Trump has dramatically tested the limits of executive power to crack down on foreigners without papers since he returned to office, arguing that the US is being invaded by criminals and other undesirables.</p><small>2025-06-07 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/07150933db707ff.jpg?r=150939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915978/6-dead-2-injured-as-gas-cylinder-explodes-in-mardan-officials' target='_blank'><strong>6 dead, 2 injured as gas cylinder explodes in Mardan: officials</strong></a><br><p>A gas cylinder explosion on Saturday killed six people and injured two others in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan, according to police and rescue officials.
Mardan District Police Officer Zahoor Babar Afridi confirmed the casualties and told Dawn.com, “The explosion was caused by a gas cylinder.”
The spokesperson for KP Rescue 1122 Bilal Ahmad Faizi said that a cylinder explosion in Mardan’s Aram Colony caused the roof of a two-story house to collapse. He said, “Six people were killed and two girls were seriously injured in the accident.”
He added that the rescue teams reached the site as soon as they received information about an alleged explosion inside the house.
Rescue 1122 teams continued rescue operations and rescued eight people, including a woman and children, buried under the rubble, he said.
Mardan Deputy Commissioner Azmatullah Wazir, District Emergency Officer Syed Shoaib Mansoor and Assistant Commissioner Junaid Khalid were present at the scene and supervised the entire operation, he added.
He also said that over a hundred Rescue 1122 personnel participated and completed the operation in seven hours, removing the dead and injured people and transferring them to the Mardan Medical Complex.
Incidents of fire caused by leakage and explosion of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders occur routinely across the country.
Following an LPG tanker explosion in Punjab’s Multan earlier this year that killed at least 19 and injured over a dozen others, the Senate Stan­ding Committee on Cabinet Sec­re­tariat ordered a probe into the sale of adulterated LPG.
In February, twelve people were injured after a gas cylinder exploded in a roadside cafe near the Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH) in Peshawar, a rescue official said.</p><small>2025-06-07 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/07104935882463c.png?r=104945' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915911/modi-finally-gets-invite-for-g7-summit-in-canada' target='_blank'><strong>Modi finally gets invite for G7 summit in Canada</strong></a><br><p>New Delhi: After his name was initially missing from the list of Global South leaders invited to the G7 summit in Canada, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Friday that he had received the elusive invitation and would be attending the June 15-17 jamboree.
Indian opposition had held the absence of the invitation to Modi as yet another sign of India’s isolation after the military escalation with Pakistan last month.
The Indian Express said it was a sign of improving ties between India and Canada that Mr Modi was invited by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney for the upcoming G7 meeting in Kananaskis later this month.
Ties between the two countries had worsened under former PM Justin Trudeau who had levelled several allegations against India. The US has arrested a man allegedly linked to the assassination of a Sikh separatist in Canada’s Surrey district. 
Canada and India downgraded diplomatic ties after Mr Trudeau, the then Canadian prime minister, set off a political storm in 2023 when he alleged “potential” involvement of Indian government agents in the killing of a Canada-based Khalistan separatist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar.
India rejected the charges as “absurd” and “motivated”. While India is not a part of G7, host nations usually invite some countries as guest countries or outreach partners.“

Given the incident occurred in the constituency of provincial home minister and political rivals had been named in FIRs as the police-protester confrontation had reportedly resulted in multiple injuries on both sides and fatalities among protesters, the commission questioned impartiality of the police-led investigation announced by Sindh IGP, said a press release issued by HRCP on Saturday.
“We therefore urge the Sindh government to announce an independent judicial inquiry without delay to establish the facts, ensure accountability and uphold rights of all citizens involved,” it said.
It said that an HRCP fact-finding mission had visited Moro to investigate the events that unfolded after the demonstrations erupted along National Highway against proposed construction of canals on Indus River and allocation of land for corporate farming projects.
 






According to community testimonies, the protest led by local residents, including members of Hari Mazdoor Ittehad group, was peaceful until police resorted to violent means.
One protester, Irfan Laghari, was critically injured and later died in a Hyderabad hospital. His family maintained he had no affiliation with any nationalist groups and had been demonstrating peacefully. Shortly after the confrontation, Lanjar House — residence of Sindh home minister — was set on fire.
 
 

According to Laghari’s family, private individuals armed with heavy weapons, reportedly deployed to protect the house, had opened fire. Zahid, who was not participating in the protest but happened to be nearby on personal business, was allegedly shot in the head and later succumbed to his injuries. He was 27 years old and his wife was currently expecting their first child, said the family.
The mission visited Goth Bajrani Laghari, the victim’s village, where they recorded statements of the families of the deceased, local journalists and teachers and attempted to meet police officials at Moro police station, but the station house officer declined to comment, stating that only SSP could speak on the matter.
The SSP could not be contacted on account of suspended cellular services. The team visited Lanjar House, but no one agreed to meet them.
The mission was informed that over 400 individuals had allegedly been falsely implicated in criminal and terrorism cases and that dozens — including political workers — had either been arrested or had been missing [since then].
In several cases, first information reports (FIRs) had been registered in districts far from Moro, including Shikarpur and Mirpurkhas.
The FIR for arson at Lanjar House named senior opposition figures. Since May 20, mobile services in the area had remained suspended and a visible police presence continued to create an atmosphere of fear among residents, it said.

The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted by a student-led revolt in August 2024, ending her iron-fisted rule of 15 years.
“I am announcing to the citizens of the country that the election will be held on any day in the first half of April 2026,” said Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who leads the caretaker government.
Political parties jostling for power have been repeatedly demanding that Yunus fix an election timetable, while he has said time is needed as the country requires an overhaul of its democratic institutions after Hasina’s tenure.

Interim leader Yunus says his govt’s major responsibility is to ensure ‘transparent, participatory election’

“The government has been doing everything necessary to create an environment conducive to holding the election,” he said in the television broadcast, while repeating his warning that reforms were needed.
 
 

“It should be remembered that Bangladesh has plunged into deep crisis every time it has held a flawed election,” he said, in a speech given on the eve of the Eidul Azha holiday.
“A political party usurped power through such elections in the past, and became a barbaric fascist force.” Hasina’s rule saw widespread human rights abuses, and her government was accused of politicising courts and the civil service, as well as staging lopsided elections.
The interim government had already repeatedly vowed to hold elections before June 2026, but said the more time it had to enact reforms, the better.
Reform of utmost importance
The key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), seen as the election frontrunner, has in recent weeks been pushing hard for polls to be held by December.
Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman, in a speech to officers in May, also said that elections should be held by December, according to both Bangladeshi media and military sources.
Days after that speech, the government warned that political power struggles risked jeopardising gains that have been made.
“Those who organise such elections are later viewed as culprits, and those who assume office through them become targets of public hatred,” Yunus said on Friday.
“One of the biggest responsibilities of this government is to ensure a transparent… and widely participatory election so that the country does not fall into a new phase of crisis,” he added.
“That is why institutional reform is of utmost importance.” Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 after Hasina’s government launched a crackdown in a bid to cling to power, according to the United Nations.
Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to her old ally India and she has defied an extradition order to return to Dhaka.
Her trial opened in absentia this month.
Yunus said “reforms, trials, and elections” were the three “core mandates” of his government.
“The sacrifices made by our students and people will be in vain if good governance cannot be established,” he said.
The Election Commission will “present a detailed roadmap” for the vote “at an appropriate time”, the interim leader said without specifying a date.
“We have been in dialogue with all stakeholders to organise free, fair, competitive, and credible election in the history of Bangladesh,” Yunus added.

Israeli and Palestinian media have reported that the group Israel has been working with is part of a local Bedouin tribe led by Yasser Abu Shabab.
The European Council on Foreign Relations (EFCR) think tank describes Abu Shabab as the leader of a “criminal gang operating in the Rafah area that is widely accused of looting aid trucks”.
Knesset member and former defence minister Avigdor Liberman had told the Kan public broadcaster that the government, at Netanyahu’s direction, was “giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons”.

Popular Forces outfit denies being ‘a tool of the occupation’

“What did Liberman leak? That security sources activated a clan in Gaza that opposes Hamas? What is bad about that?” Netanyahu said in a video posted to social media on Thursday.
 


Michael Milshtein, an expert on Palestinian affairs at the Moshe Dayan Centre in Tel Aviv, told AFP that the Abu Shabab clan was part of a Bedouin tribe that spans across the border between Gaza and Egypt’s Sinai peninsula.
Some of the tribe’s members, he said, were involved in “all kinds of criminal activities, drug smuggling, and things like that”.
‘Gangster’
Milshtein said that Abu Shabab had spent time in prison in Gaza and that his clan chiefs had recently denounced him as an Israeli “collaborator and a gangster”.
“It seems that actually the Shabak (Israeli security agency) or the (military) thought it was a wonderful idea to turn this militia, gang actually, into a proxy, to give them weapons and money and shelter” from army operations, Milshtein said.
He claimed that Hamas killed four members of the gang days ago.
The ECFR said Abu Shabab was “reported to have been previously jailed by Hamas for drug smuggling. His brother is said to have been killed by Hamas during a crackdown against the group’s attacks on UN aid convoys”.
Hamas said the group had “chosen betrayal and theft as their path” and called on civilians to oppose them.
Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades, said it had evidence of “clear coordination between these looting gangs, collaborators with the occupation (Israel), and the enemy army itself in the looting of aid and the fabrication of humanitarian crises that deepen the suffering of” Palestinians.
The Popular Forces, as Abu Shabab’s group calls itself, said on Facebook it had “never been, and will never be, a tool of the occupation”. “Our weapons are simple, outdated, and came through the support of our own people.”
Milshtein called Israel’s decision to arm the group “a fantasy, not something that you can really describe as a strategy”.

• Calls on US to help bring New Delhi to negotiating table after Trump acknowledges presence of ‘strong leadership’ in Islamabad
WASHINGTON: Warning that the current ceasefire between India and Pakistan was quite tenuous, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has said that the world is now a less safe place than it was before the crisis in the Subcontinent.
The statement comes a day after US President Donald Trump acknowledged the presence of “very strong leadership” in Islamabad as being one of the contributing factors to a recent de-escalation of tensions with India.
In meetings with US lawmakers and think tanks, the PPP chief, who is currently heading a high-powered Pakistani delegation to the US, said the ceasefire was “a welcome start”, but cautioned that “South Asia, India, and Pakistan, and by extension, the rest of the world, are less safe today than when we started this crisis.”
In contrast with efforts of India’s national security caucus, the Pakistani delegation currently in Washington pursued a focused but quieter diplomatic effort on Capitol Hill this week.
The delegation’s meetings with senior US lawmakers — members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and key senators — underscored Pakistan’s effort to sustain a credible narrative amid a tilt towards New Delhi in US policy circles.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari held candid and constructive meetings with US Congressman Brian Mast, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Congressman Gregory Meeks, Ranking Member; Congressman Bill Huizenga, Chair of the Subcommittee on South and Central Asia; and senior lawmaker Brad Sherman.
 
 

Central to the delegation’s message was the unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India, described by Mr Bhutto-Zardari as “a dangerous precedent and a violation of international law.”
The potential weaponisation of water resources adds a new and alarming dimension to the already fragile peace framework between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, he said.
“The threshold for all-out war between India and Pakistan is the lowest it has ever been in our history,” he stated, adding: “As it stands today, if there’s a terrorist attack anywhere in India, proof or no proof, it means war”.
This reality underscores the urgency for sustained diplomatic engagement to prevent miscalculations that could lead to full-scale conflict.
He urged the United States to leverage its influence, stating, “The United States, if it puts its might behind peace, can speak to India and explain how it’s in all our interests to resolve our issues, including the core issue of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
 






This aligns with President Trump’s messaging as well. Speaking to reporters after an interaction with German leader Freidrich Merz in the Oval Office a day earlier, Trump had categorically claimed credit for talking India and Pakistan back from the brink by threatening to pull out of trade talks, which he claimed both countries were currently engaged in with the US.
“They don’t give me credit for anything, but nobody else could have stopped it,” he said, referring to the recent escalation in the Subcontinent.
Pakistan House reception
The Pakistani delegation also engaged with a bipartisan group of US legislators at a dinner reception hosted by Ambassador Rizwan Saeed Sheikh at Pakistan House.
The event saw the attendance of members of Congress, including Representatives Jack Bergman, Tom Suozzi, Ryan Zinke, Maxine Waters, Al Green, Jonathan Jackson, Hank Johnson, Stacey Plaskett, Henry Cuellar, Mike Turner, Riley Moore, George Latimer, and Cleo Fields, among others.
 






Addressing them, Mr Bhutto Zardari presented a compelling case for regional peace and stability, characterizing the delegation’s visit as a “mission for peace.”
“Our Prime Minister, Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, gave this delegation a mission, and the mission is peace — to engage in dialogue and diplomacy with India to resolve our issues,” stated Mr Bhutto-Zardari.
Appreciating the crucial role played by the United States in facilitating a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed nations, the former foreign minister urged US legislators to continue their efforts in maintaining peace and stability in South Asia.
 
 

“We’re here to appeal to you, requesting the United States to aid us in this pursuit for peace. The United States, if it puts its might behind peace, can speak to India and explain how it’s in all our interests to resolve our issues, including the core issue of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK),” the Chairman noted.
“Just as urgently as we needed the United States government’s help to achieve the ceasefire, we need your assistance today to help engage India and prevent policies that lead to regional and global insecurity,” he said.
The US Congress members assured their full support for regional peace and stability in South Asia, commending the delegation for their comprehensive briefing on the ongoing crisis.

The prime minister, acco­mpanied by his delegation, including the army chief, deputy PM and federal ministers, also performed Umrah on Friday when pilgrims performed the last major ritual of Haj — the “stoning of the devil”.
The PM, who is on a two-day official visit to Saudi Arabia, met the Saudi crown prince in Makkah, according to an official press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.
 






“The prime minister expressed appreciation for the kingdom’s proactive role during recent tensions between Pakistan and India, and its steadfast commitment to promoting peace and stability in the region and beyond.”

PM Shehbaz also underscored Pakistan’s policy of responsible restraint in the face of Indian aggression, emphasising that “sustainable peace in South Asia is achievable only through dialogue”.
 
 

The meeting reaffirmed the deep-rooted, strategic, and fraternal ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
The PM was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar.
The PM also extended Eidul Azha greetings to King Salman bin Abdulaziz and the crown prince on behalf of the government and people of Pakistan.
He commended the kingdom’s hospitality and service to the pilgrims from around the world who are in Saudi Arabia to perform Haj.
Situation in Gaza
The two leaders also discussed the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.
They urged the international community to fulfil its moral and legal obligations to help the people of Palestine.
They reiterated support for a just and durable resolution to the Palestinian issue in line with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
Prime Minister Shehbaz expressed satisfaction with the bilateral political, economic and security cooperation.
 
 

The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepening the relationship between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
The prime minister invited the crown prince to visit Pakistan, which he accepted.
Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz, accompanied by the army chief and his delegation, performed Umrah.
 






The delegation offered prayers inside the Holy Kaaba, said the press release.
Nawaz offers Eid prayers
Meanwhile, former prime minister and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif offered Eid prayer at the Regents Park mosque in London.
According to media reports, he prayed for the country’s development and prosperity.
He also urged the United Nations to play its role in resolving the Kashmir issue.
Last Haj rite
More than 1.6 million pilgrims performing Haj ‘stoned the devil’ on Friday, as Muslims around the globe celebrated Eidul Azha.
Starting at dawn, the pilgrims threw seven stones at each of three concrete walls symbolising the devil in the Mina valley, on the outskirts of Makkah.
This year’s Haj saw noticeably thinner crowds as authorities implemented a wide-ranging crackdown on illicit pilgrims with a heavy security presence at holy sites in Makkah and surrounding areas.
The measures, including heat mitigation efforts, were aimed at preventing a repeat of last year’s Haj that saw 1,301 people die in temperatures that hit 51.8 degrees Celsius.

The plan proposes gradually lowering import duties, liberalising used car imports and permitting commercial imports of used vehicles. Industry stakeholders warn these measures could destabilise the local auto sector, erode foreign exchange reserves and widen the current account deficit.
 
 

Under the proposed tariff rationalisation, duties on completely built-up (CBU) vehicles would be slashed to 15 per cent over five years, down from the current 20pc. Additional Customs Duty (ACD) and Regulatory Duty (RD) will be phased out, and the number of tariff slabs reduced from five to four. The government also plans to eliminate the fifth schedule and lower the maximum slab rate to 15pc.
This sweeping overhaul of the trade regime is apparently aimed at fostering export-led growth, but the auto sector sees it as a serious threat. While the IMF-backed policy seeks to bring Pakistan’s tariff structures in line with global norms, local manufacturers argue that it risks flooding the market with cheaper used vehicles and reversing years of progress in localisation, employment and investment.

Local carmakers say IMF-backed policy risks flooding market with cheaper used vehicles; fear it will reverse ‘years of progress in localisation, jobs and investment’

IMC urges policy stability
Indus Motor Company (IMC) CEO Ali Asghar Jamali urged the government to avoid abrupt tariff changes and inconsistent policies that, he said, threaten the viability of Pakistan’s auto industry, which he said is the 34th largest in the world.
This sector contributes four per cent of total tax revenue, is among the top contributors in customs and sales tax collection and sustains 2.5 million jobs, Mr Jamali said. “With over $5 billion invested, harming this strategic industry risks revenue loss, unemployment and stalled localisation. Long-term, stable policies are essential for sustainable growth,” he said.
He suggested that industry volumes be stabilised at 350,000 units annually to strengthen local supply chains. He also called for maintaining a balanced duty differential of up to 40pc between completely built units (CBUs) and completely knocked down (CKD) units, and up to 25pc between raw materials and auto parts.
He also proposed increasing financing limits to 70pc of the vehicle’s price with a seven-year term and gradually phasing out used car imports by incentivising local production and rationalising the tax structure for fair competition.
‘Parts makers being undermined’
Aamir Allawala, CEO of Tecno Auto Glass Limited and former chairman of the Pakistan Association of Auto Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM), argued that auto parts makers “need consistent volume and respect from the government as the biggest employment generator in the country”.
He criticised the growing market share of used vehicles, which now stands at 25pc, saying it comes at the cost of the indigenous vendor base.
Mr Allawala alleged that used car imports are widely known to involve black money, where transactions are often made through hawala and sales conducted in cash without any traceable money trail.
Still, the government continues to encourage it by allowing “ridiculously low fixed duties” on used vehicles below 1,300cc while planning to increase sales tax on small local vehicles from 12.5pc to 18pc, he lamented.
He said the industry needed the continuation of a policy that encourages local manufacturing and helps increase volumes to 500,000 vehicles per year.
Steel industry seeks road map
Malik Javed Iqbal, chairman of the Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSP), called on the government to establish a consistent, homegrown tariff policy in consultation with stakeholders.
 
 

“Incentivising steel production through iron ore will further boost the domestic steel industry, which has the capacity to meet the entire demand of steel now and in future and can also opt for exports,” he said.
He said the revival of the steel and construction industries by the government can be boosted through a substantial increase in allocations in the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) and a further cut in the power tariff to make prices of steel products affordable.
“Tariff reduction without ensuring regionally competitive costs of critical inputs like power, gas, interest rates and taxes would invite massive dumping of steel from other countries, further hitting the local industry,” he added.
Used car importers
On the other hand, All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association (APMDA) President H.M. Shehzad expressed optimism that the upcoming budget would include provisions to increase the age limit for used car imports to five years and reduce import duties. He said the government is also likely to permit the commercial import of used vehicles.
He hoped these measures could reduce used car prices by Rs500,000 to Rs1 million and ensure the availability of these vehicles under Rs2 million.
Mr Shehzad pointed out that a five-year-old car in Japan costs $3,000-$4,000 compared to $8,000 for a three-year-old vehicle, while a locally assembled 660cc car is priced above Rs3 million. A duty cut and age limit hike could push annual used car imports from 30,000 to 70,000-80,000 units, bringing in additional revenue, he added.
