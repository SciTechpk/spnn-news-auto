ISLAMABAD: Having missed a total of 11 performance indicators under its IMF programme, the government has agreed to 11 new targets, including additional tax measures and expenditure cuts from early next month, to make up for rising revenue shortfalls and keep the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on track.
Commitment to the new or revised structural benchmarks, together with completion of two “prior actions”, enabled the conclusion of a staff-level agreement on the second review of the EFF and its approval by the IMF Executive Board for the disbursement of about $1.2bn, reveal fresh documents released by the Fund on Thursday.
The government confirmed at the outset that it estimated a shortfall from the underperformance of the captive power levy of Rs104bn, which it said would be covered by a reduction in power subsidies made possible through lower circular debt accumulation relative to budget estimates.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has already missed its collection target by about Rs430bn in the first five months of FY26.
“Should FBR’s revenues continue to fall short of expectations in the second quarter of FY26 (end of current month), and if other tax revenues are insufficient to bridge the gap, we will — in consultation with IMF staff — increase federal excise duty (FED) on fertilisers and pesticides by five percentage points, introduce FED on high-value sugary items, and move items from the 8th GST schedule to the general GST regime,” Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb assured the Fund, implying full 18pc GST on those items.
He further committed that “if by the end of the second quarter of FY26 there is a revenue shortfall due to the implementation of the National Tariff Policy, we will postpone an equivalent amount of expenditure until the last quarter of FY26”.
Pakistan has also sought waivers for already missed targets in terms of performance criteria, str­u­ctural benchmarks and indicators. The documents confirm that publication of a governance and corruption assessment report was set as a “prior action” for the latest $1.2bn disbursement to the State Bank of Pakistan, while an­­other prior action related to recapitalisation measures for a weak bank.
In all, the authorities missed one out of six qualitative performance criteria, five structural benchmarks and four indicative targets — some of which were subsequently met after the original deadlines or extended.
The waivers pertain to non-ob­servance of the end-June quantitative performance criterion (QPC) on Benazir Income Support Prog­r­amme (BISP) spending, and a mo­­dification of three end-December QPCs: the ceiling on the general government primary budget deficit, the floor on the number of new tax returns (to account for seasonality) in line with the agreed FY26 primary surplus, and the BISP floor on targeted cash transfers.
Under the roadmap agreed with the Fund, the FBR will complete all actions required to fully implement at least three priority areas by the end of March 2026, including any necessary subordinate legislation, staff hiring and allocation, and initial KPI reporting.
The government has also committed to publish an initial study by the end of June 2026 assessing the fiscal costs and effectiveness of incentives for all existing Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Export Processing Zones (EPZs), and to phase out all such incentives by 2035.
A Tax Policy Office has been created and will now handle all tax policy functions, including the development and publication of a medium-term tax reform strategy by the end of December 2026. The new strategy is intended to reduce reliance on ad hoc revenue measures and ensure revenue-neutral reforms that deliver sustained growth in tax receipts over the medium term.
Provinces have pledged to realise the full potential of agriculture income tax by fully operationalising information-sharing between the FBR and provincial tax auth­o­rities, and by ensuring that all services — except for a limited list of exemptions — are subject to GST.
The authorities will also conduct a comprehensive study of bottlenecks in the local currency bond market and publish an action plan to address identified weaknesses by the end of September 2026. They have further undertak­­en to strengthen efforts to make formal channels more attractive than the hawala market, without resorting to fiscal incentives. To this end, the SBP plans to conduct a comprehensive assessment of remittance costs by the end of May 2026 to improve cross-border payments.
At the same time, the authorities will seek to deepen the foreign exchange market, including through greater reliance on interbank trading and exchange rate flexibility, to support external sustainability.
On the power sector, the government has promised to complete the bidding process for the first round of privatisation of three distribution companies (Dis­c­­os) early in 2026 and to move ahead with the rest.
It has committed to completing the preconditions for the privatisation of Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) and Sukkur Electric Power Company (Sepco) by the end of December 2026. The authorities also plan to advance the privatisation of public generation companies, finalise transmission network restructuring and launch a wholesale electricity market.
Following amendments to the asset declaration framework, pre­p­­arations are underway to publish, by the end of December 2026, the asset declarations of high-lev­­el federal civil servants on a government website. The framework will also extend to high-level provincial officials and allow banks full access to their declarations.
Based on an institutional-level risk assessment, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) will lead and coordinate action plans to mitigate vulnerabilities in the 10 agencies identified as having the highest risks by the end of October 2026.
Amendments to most of the nine statutory state-owned enterprise (SOE) laws are expected to be submitted to the National Asse­mbly before the end of August 2026. In parallel, the government is moving to amend the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) law by the end of March 2026 to clarify its mandate, ensure transparent and competitive divestment and procurement procedures, introduce fiscal safeguards, and subject SWF-owned SOEs to the SOE law. Operationalisation of the SWF will remain on hold until these amendments are adopted.

ISLAMABAD: Amid concerns by Pakistan regarding the use of Afghan soil by militants to launch attacks inside the country, over 1,000 Afghan clerics recently passed a resolution apparently aimed at discouraging the flow of militancy from its territory to neighbouring states.
The resolution, adopted by leading Afghan clerics, pledges that their country’s soil will not be used against other countries.
In case of violations, the “Islamic Emirate has the right to take necessary measures against them”, it said, noting that Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada had not permitted any Afghan national “to travel abroad for military activity, so if anyone violates this… The Islamic Emirate must take necessary measures to prevent such people”.
The resolution, though welcomed by Pakistan, elicited only cautious optimism, given the Taliban’s track record on militant groups. Terming it a “positive development”, the Foreign Office reiterated its demand for written assurances from the interim Afghan government that its soil would not be used against Pakistan.
The document, described as a significant development by experts in Pakistan and Afghanistan, comes from independent clerics, without any formal endorsement from the Taliban government, nor does it explicitly name Pakistan.
However, it does say that whoever would “conduct military operations beyond Afghanistan’s borders would be considered a rebel against the state”. This would also be considered “as a violation of the emir’s orders” and would be a punishable offence, the resolution said.
But it remains unclear who would enforce such a punishment, as the group of religious scholars who have issued it have no legally binding authority.
However, the timing of the declaration seems significant, coming at a time when Islamabad is asking Kabul to rein in militants, particularly the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), who it blames for perpetrating terror attacks in the country.
Pakistan has asked Kabul to issue a decree — in the name of supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada — to stop such incursions; a demand that was reiterated during a series of negotiations in Qatar, Turkey and Saudi Arabia over the past few months.
However, according to officials privy to the meetings, the Taliban had asked Pakistan to approach their own scholars for such an edict.
Afghan religious scholar Sheikh Faqirullah Faeq, who was present at the Kabul University gathering, termed the resolution “very significant” and appeared hopeful about its outcome.
He said all senior clerics of major religious schools participated in the day-long meeting of the clerics, adding that there were 34 major jihadi seminaries in Afghanistan and all participated in the event.
“Teachers have influence on those Taliban who go outside the country to fight. Some people say certain circles go to Pakistan or Gaza and other areas.
The supreme leader does not want a neighbour to have problems because of us, and I hope this resolution will work,” Sheikh Faeq told Dawn.
FO’s ‘cautious optimism’
In the absence of official backing, it is unclear how it will be enforced — a concern also echoed by the Foreign Office.
“If the leadership of the Afghan Taliban regime or certain segments of Afghan society realise the gravity of the matter that their soil is being used not just by the banned TTP/FAK/FAH but also by their own nationals to perpetrate terrorism in Pakistan, such realisation is positive,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said during his weekly briefing.
“One important aspect is that commitments made in the past by the Afghan Taliban regime have not been fulfilled. This is exactly why, during the talks held with the mediation efforts of our brotherly countries, Pakistan insisted on written assurances from the Afghan side,” the spokesperson said.
Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, however, told the clerics’ gathering in Kabul on Thursday that the interim government had the right to stop anyone using Afghan soil for militant activities in other countries. “If anyone violates this, ulema favour action against them,” he said while alluding to the resolution. He said it was obligatory for all Muslims in Afghanistan to obey the resolution.
‘Positive development’
Despite expressing concern about its impact, the resolution is being seen as a positive development by observers in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Pakistan’s former special representative for Afghanistan Asif Durrani, in a brief message sent to Dawn, said the timing of the resolution was important.
“One has to look at the timing of the resolution when everything seems to be frozen,” he said, adding that the document was “clearly intended” to convey a message to Pakistan regarding reconciliation.
“Hopefully, the TTP, which owes allegiance to the Taliban supreme leader…will now submit to the collective wisdom of the Afghan Taliban ulema and surrender arms,” he said, asking the government of Pakistan to welcome the resolution.
Analyst and journalist Sami Yousafzai said the move would be a positive one for Pakistan, which has repeatedly asked for an Afghan ‘fatwa’ or edict.
“Implementation would be a little difficult. But it would work if the Taliban leaders opt for punishment, arrest and jail those Afghans who join the Pakistani groups,” he told Dawn.
He said Afghans’ participation in attacks in Pakistan has increased, especially of the Afghans from Logar and Maidan Wardak provinces — both provinces are located near the capital Kabul.
“So, the Taliban are also worried over the growing number of Afghans participating. This is a good beginning and a positive message to Pakistan,” he said, adding that the Afghan Taliban’s intelligence can monitor the movement of their own people.
According to the FO spokesperson, Pakistan will adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ policy to evaluate this document, since the Taliban had failed to live up to their promises in the past.

Just weeks before the Afghan Taliban returned to power in August 2021, Gen Faiz — wearing a two-piece suit and a tie — was standing before a podium bearing the ISI emblem, at his office auditorium in Islamabad, with two giant screens on either side flashing statistics on Afghanistan.
He was forcefully articulating his institution’s view that the Taliban’s fight in the neighbouring country, was in fact, a “Pashtun nationalist uprising”.
But minutes later, he took a dramatic U-turn. His words: “Not many people believe me, but in my opinion the Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan (TTA) and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) are two faces of the same coin.”
Weeks later, wearing dark blue blazer with grey pants, there he was standing in a swanky Kabul hotel with a cup of tea in his hands, trying to help patch up the interim Afghan administration, and assuring a western journalist that “everything was going to be just fine” in Afghanistan.
Two months later, in October 2021, when the Taliban were comfortably ensconced to rule Afghanistan, Faiz found himself in Peshawar as commander of XI Corps to singularly pursue an ambitious, yet extremely complex project — getting the TTP to disarm and return to Pakistan to live as peaceful citizens.
The talks in Kabul, shrouded in utmost secrecy, involved several rounds and several trips. Accompanied by aides from the intelligence community, as well as experienced civil officers, then-Lt Gen Faiz held direct talks with top TTP leader Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud. Sometimes the exchanges were one-on-one, sometimes held in the company of Taliban interior minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani.

 

“I have full authority to take any decisions”, a confident Faiz had assured his deeply cynical Afghan and Pakistani interlocutors. He came across as so confident, in fact, that his Afghan hosts and even the TTP head honcho began to take a liking to him.
Whether the pursuit to sue peace with the TTP was his own brainchild — from his time as head of Pakistan premier intelligence agency — or an assignment given to him by his then-boss Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, it’s hard to tell.
Following his arrival in Peshawar, Faiz immediately set about this secret mission. No one else in the political echelons of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was in the loop, not even then-chief minister Mahmood Khan.
Predictably, the talks didn’t go anywhere, especially after misgiving about the project within GHQ grew when it became clear that the fragile TTP ceasefire was merely a ruse to give cover to infiltration activities in the hitherto peaceful regions of the province.
But as fate would have it, Faiz couldn’t complete his two-year term and was posted out to Bahawalpur in August 2022. Few outside military corridors knew at the time the actual reason for the sudden change of command in Peshawar.
Whether it was due to the failed attempt to broker peace with the TTP or the high-stakes, behind-the-scene jockeying for the all-powerful top slot in Rawalpindi that saw his unceremonious departure, the sudden move did trigger speculations and fed into conspiracy theories prevailing at the time.
For many in Peshawar, Faiz was virtually a shoe-in as the next army chief, and even acted like one.
At the time, the Mahmood Khan-led provincial PTI government had practically ceded bureaucratic and financial control to the man, whose phone calls moved things around at breakneck speed.
Under his watch, billions were diverted from the Peshawar Urban Development Fund for the beautification of Peshawar Cantonment, bureaucrats made a beeline to the sprawling fortified XI Corps compound.
Politicians, too, lined up in the hope of currying favour from the man they thought would shape their destiny and fortune in the not-too-distant future.
But like so much else, things rarely play out as predicted. Faiz’s exit from the military meant that not only was his dream of holding the baton shattered, the aspirations of many in the political class — who had thought to hitch their carts to his horses — were also left unfulfilled.
Published in Dawn, December 12th, 2025</p><small>2025-12-12 02:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12073833e880e43.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960623/fomenting-political-agitation-whats-next-for-embattled-former-spymaster' target='_blank'><strong>‘Fomenting political agitation’: what’s next for embattled former spymaster?</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The announcement of a 14-year sentence for ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed has reignited speculation about his alleged role in fomenting unrest in the country, especially after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) hinted at a broader and more serious plot, involving unnamed political actors.
While the ISPR statement focused on his conviction under military laws, it was the final paragraph that drew the most attention.
“Involvement of the convict in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with,” the statement said, offering no details.
The language implied linking Faiz Hameed and unnamed politicians to a wider effort to engineer unrest.

 

The reference marked the latest in a series of military statements since last year, signalling suspicion and hinting at an alleged nexus between him and political elements, opposed to the government.
In a statement issued on Aug 15, 2024, the ISPR noted that “further investigations of certain retired officers and their accomplices for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests are continuing.”
A separate statement released at the time of Hameed’s detention alleged that “multiple instances of violation of Pakistan Army Act post retirement have also been established,” though it did not elaborate.
Days later, the ISPR disclosed that Hameed was being investigated for alleged involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots, during which military buildings and monuments were vandalised.
“During the process, involvement of Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed (retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading to multiple incidents including, but not limited to May 9, 2023, for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,” the statement had then said.
Accusations and suspicions
This is certainly not the first time that Hameed has been accused of political maneuvering, both pre and post-retirement. He came into the limelight for his role as a guarantor in the 2017 Faizabad agreement, a controversial deal betw­een the government and TLP protesters that ended a weeks-long sit-in.
While the PTI was in power, Hameed quickly made room for himself in the then-PM’s kitchen cabinet. By some accounts, he became quite close to both Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi.

 

Then, in 2020, ex-PM Nawaz Sharif had publicly accused Hameed and his former boss, Gen Qamar Bajwa, of orchestrating the three-time premier’s ouster.
The most direct accusation came during a rally in Gujranwala: “Gen Faiz, this is done with your hands and you need to answer,” Mr Nawaz had roared.
Although speculation was rife about his influence on the PTI and its political machinations, there was no direct evidence to substantiate this.
Subsequently, in 2022, a viral video showed the now-retired Faiz Hameed at an event, with a PTI leader praising him and inviting him to enter politics.
The former general, however, had denied having any plans to enter politics, saying on TV, “I will not join politics after the two-year bar nor afterward.”
Then came the case of his brother Najaf Hameed, who was arrested on corruption and bribery charges in March 2024 after a court rejected his request for bail.
Anti-corruption officials apprehended the former naib tehsildar from court premises in Rawalpindi and sent him to Adiala jail on a 14-day judicial remand.
The case against him, registered with the Anti-Corruption Establishment in Chakwal, includes charges of bribery, misuse of authority, and causing losses to the national exchequer.
Many alleged that he had became a powerful figure in the region during his brother’s tenure as the ISI chief.
May 9 role?
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, speaking in a television interview soon after Hameed’s arrest last year, said he remained “deeply involved” in political developments after leaving service in November 2022.
“After his retirement, the political events that unfolded had Faiz’s involvement. Knowing him, he never hesitates to stir things up, especially someone like him who wielded immense power and then had to step back,” Mr Asif then said.
About his potential involvement in the May 9 riots, Mr Asif had then said the “evidence and circumstances” pointed toward his participation, possibly as a “strategic adviser.”
“He might have provided logistics and used his experience to guide actions aimed at causing greater damage,” Mr Asif then said, adding, “While I can’t say this with absolute certainty, the evidence and circumstances suggest his involvement.”
Although the ISPR has avoided naming any political party or leader, its repeated references to actions taken “at the behest of and in collusion with political elements” have been widely interpreted as alluding to jailed former prime minister Imran Khan.
The military has not said when the separate investigations mentioned in the statement would conclude, nor whether additional charges will be brought against the former intelligence chief.

The social media platform X, which around 4.5 million people in Pakistan use, was blocked in February 2024, around 10 days after the general elections.
Speaking on Dawn News programme “Doosra Rukh,” Barrister Malik, responding to a question about a possible ban on incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s X account, said “investigations are ongoing.”
He added that while the government has contacted X, the platform has shown the least cooperation compared to other social media networks.
Criticising X, the minister said the platform should not operate with double standards. “Posts related to Palestine are removed, and accounts blocked, within 24 hours. Here, we are talking about a matter of terrorism,” he said.
He further noted that the government has issued reminders to social media platforms and warned that those that fail to cooperate or coordinate could face a ban, similar to actions taken by Brazil.
“Brazil’s courts had issued orders, which were then accepted, and a fine of $5.2 million was paid. All content taken out of context was removed,” Barrister Malik said.
X had 22 million users in Brazil before it was blocked on August 30 by Brazilian Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes for failing to comply with a series of court orders aimed at combatting disinformation.
Barrister Malik said that today the government again issued a reminder, emphasising that it had already warned that these platforms are being used for terrorism, misinformation, and disinformation.
“We have asked them to open offices here in Pakistan, but there has been no response. Some social media platforms are cooperating well, but X is cooperating the least,” he added.
Earlier, on October 4, the minister said that investigations regarding Imran’s X account were ongoing and that contact with the platform was underway.
He had said that any measures regarding a potential block of Imran’s account would be disclosed once further evidence comes to light.
According to an October post on his official X account, Imran was also quizzed in prison by Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials about his “anti-state” tweets, critical remarks on foreign policy and other topics.
A month before that, in September, a petition was filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment.
The petitioner requested the court to direct the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to conduct a thorough investigation to determine who has been operating the PTI founder’s account while he remains incarcerated.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p><small>2025-12-11 22:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11230658ed8643d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960529/pti-led-kp-headed-toward-governors-rule-warns-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>PTI-led KP headed toward governor’s rule, warns Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said on Thursday that although there had been no discussion with the PML-N about imposing governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the PTI-led government in the province was heading in a direction that could create conditions for such an option.
The federal government is seriously considering imposing governor’s rule in KP, citing “security and governance issues” in the province as the reason for this potential move.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar earlier said “governor’s rule is not the face of any martial law” and added that if the conditions merit it, then it was within the Constitution to implement it.
Bilawal was speaking to the media during a visit to the Rajoa House residence of Syed Hassan Murtaza, the PPP’s central Punjab general secretary, in Chiniot to offer condolences on the death of his father.
He said the PTI’s politics was creating conditions for governor’s rule in KP. “The PTI is forcing the federal government to take strict action against it … and it’s an option in the province,” he added.
“Constitutional options exist for imposing governor’s rule,” he noted.







The PPP chief also chided PTI founder Imran Khan. “He [Khan] is now being held accountable for his crimes. Intoxicated by power, he had threatened to send everyone to jail. Imran Khan is now facing the consequences of his own conduct.”
On Wednesday, the PPP chairman had urged his party’s coalition partner, the PML-N, to give political space to the PTI. “It is the responsibility of the government to give space to the opposition in politics, and all political forces must play a serious role for the betterment of the country,” he told reporters after visiting the house of late senior party worker Zubaida Jafri in Baghbanpura.
27th Amendment lauded
To a question about the 27th Amendment on Thursday, the PPP chairman said its passage paved the way for the establishment of a constitutional court, which had been a long-standing dream of his mother, former premier Benazir Bhutto.
“The constitutional court gives equal representation to all provinces, and its chief justice belongs to South Punjab,” he said.
“This is a victory for the PPP’s political manifesto and ideology.
“He added that another achievement in the amendment was the protection of the NFC award granted under the 18th Amendment, which ensured that the provincial share remained unchanged.
Speaking about the proposed 28th Amendment, he said the federal government had held no discussions with the PPP on the matter. He said the 27th Amendment fulfilled a key promise in the Charter of Democracy and reflected the PPP’s political vision.
The protections given to the provinces under the 18th Amendment, he added, had been preserved.
He attributed the government’s financial difficulties to bureaucratic inefficiency, especially the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) failure to collect adequate revenue.
The PPP chairman criticised the FBR, questioning why the public should suffer for the institution’s weaknesses. “We [the PPP] will work together with government to remove their difficulties and I have suggested reforms in tax collection to overcome financial vows.”
Economy
The PPP chairman said the government had improved the country’s economy.
“When the PDM [Pakistan Democratic Movement] came to power, the country was on the verge of default, but the financial condition is much better now,” he noted.
However, he added that the government should focus on increasing productivity and exports as well as providing relief to the common man.
“The Sindh government is providing fertiliser to small farmers free of cost to increase the per acre productivity and increase their incomes,” he said.
“We can achieve the target of food security by providing incentives to the agriculture sector of the country.”
Bhutto-Zardari said his three-day organisational tour of Punjab had been very successful and gave him the chance to meet party workers.</p><small>2025-12-11 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1123135467df40d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960509/pm-meets-turkmen-president-vows-to-strengthen-bilateral-ties' target='_blank'><strong>PM meets Turkmen president, vows to strengthen bilateral ties</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday met Serdar Berdimuhamedov, President of Turkmenistan, in Ashgabat.
According to the PM Office, the prime minister congratulated the Turkmen president on the 30th anniversary of Permanent Neutrality of Turkmenistan and on the UN designation of 2025 as the International Year of Peace and Trust.
While underscoring the importance of the historic and fraternal relations between Pakistan and Turkmenistan, the PM expressed his resolve to further strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries, particularly through enhanced trade and economic engagement.
He conveyed his deepest gratitude to the Turkmen leadership and government for the support extended to safely evacuate Pakistani nationals from Iran during the Iran-Israel war earlier this year.
The PM reaffirmed Pakistan’s desire to enhance connectivity with Turkmenistan through land and sea routes and said that Karachi and Gwadar ports were ideally located to be utilised by the Turkmen side to enhance their outreach to South Asia and beyond.
While thanking the Turkmen president for the hospitality extended to him and his delegation by the Turkmen side, the PM conveyed his warm wishes for H.E. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, National Leader of the Turkmen People, and reiterated his invitation to him as well as to President Serdar Berdimuhamedov to undertake official visits to Pakistan next year, on mutually convenient dates, to be worked out by the two sides.
The Turkmen president thanked the prime minister for his visit and participating in the International Forum on Peace and Trust and assured that Turkmenistan was also keen to enhance its bilateral cooperation with Pakistan across multiple areas of mutual interest.
Premier arrives in Turkmenistan
The premier arrived in Turkmenistan on a two-day official visit, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said.
It added that the premier was undertaking the visit at the invitation of Turkmenistan President Serdar Berdymukhamedov, with whom he would hold a bilateral meeting today.
PM Shehbaz and the delegation accompanying him were welcomed by Mammetkhan Chakyev, Turkmenistan’s deputy chairman of cabinet ministers, the PMO statement added.
It said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Tariq Fatemi, a key aid to the PM, and Special Assistant to the PM Talha Burki were part of the delegation accompanying the premier.







Moreover, the PM would also attend during his trip a “forum organised in Ashgabat to mark the International Year of Peace and Trust 2025, the International Day of Neutrality, and the 30th anniversary of Turkmenistan’s permanent neutrality”.
United Nations had granted Turkmenistan the status of a neutral country in 1995. UN defines neutrality as “the legal status arising from the abstention of a state from all participation in a war between other states, the maintenance of an attitude of impartiality toward the belligerents, and the recognition by the belligerents of this abstention and impartiality”.
Earlier, state broadcaster PTV News reported that PM Shehbaz would also hold bilateral meetings with other world leaders attending the forum in Ashgabat.</p><small>2025-12-11 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11224110dec3fbf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960530/pti-divided-over-sit-ins-outside-adiala-jail-kp-cm-again-denied-meeting-with-imran' target='_blank'><strong>PTI divided over sit-ins outside Adiala jail; KP CM again denied meeting with Imran</strong></a><br><p>Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Sohail Afridi was denied permission to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for the 10th time on Thursday by the Adiala jail administration, while party leaders remain divided over the continuation of prolonged sit-ins outside the jail, warning that they could adversely affect the incarcerated leader.
Politi­cal temperatures rose further a day earlier, as Rawalpindi police sought a legal opinion on the question of registering an FIR against PTI leaders and supporters over a protest outside Adiala jail, even as the party moved a privilege motion in the National Assembly over alleged use of force against its workers, and voiced alarm at reports of Imran Khan’s possible transfer to another prison.
The PTI also joined other opposition parties in warning that efforts to “minus” the incarcerated former premier and clamp down on peaceful protest would only deepen the stand-off with the government and push the country towards greater political turmoil.
Some party leaders believe token protests should continue outside Adiala jail, warning that a halt could give the “powers that be” an excuse to create a “scene” and potentially transfer Imran to another facility.
A senior party leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were differing opinions within the party. “One group favors prolonged sit-ins, believing they will put pressure on the government and the powers that be. The other group believes a token protest outside the jail should be held before dispersing,” he added.
When asked about the rationale behind the token protest, a PTI MNA said there were concerns that the “powers that be” might create a scene outside Adiala Jail, such as orchestrating a blast or staging a false-flag operation, to allege that an attempt had been made to break into the facility and free Imran Khan.
“After that, the government will be able to convince the international community that it was necessary to shift Imran Khan from Adiala Jail to somewhere else. We don’t want to give the government any such excuse,” he explained.
Another leader who belongs to Punjab said that for the last three months, workers and leaders from Punjab were regularly reaching the prison.
“Our attendance is marked in Lahore and sometimes in Kallar Kahar. Each MPA or leader who brings four people with him in a car spends Rs50,000 to Rs60,000, as they usually reach Lahore or other parts of Punjab the next day. Peshawar, however, is less than two hours away, so leaders and workers can easily travel from there and return. Despite this, people from Punjab have dominated the crowds every time. The KP chief minister arrives at Adiala Jail with only a few people; he does not even bother to bring his full cabinet,” he claimed.
He added that in several meetings of the parliamentary party, some members suggested that workers should stage a token protest outside Adiala Jail and then disperse.
“Everyone knows that we will not be allowed to meet Khan sahab, so we should record the protest and save our energies for the right time,” he suggested.
Another MNA claimed that ever since Aleema Khanum took control of the party’s social media operations, online trolling targets anyone who speaks with logic or suggests a practical approach to securing Imran’s release.
“On the other hand, it is also a fact that our workers are arrested while Aleema is not, despite non-bailable warrants having been issued for her. We have received messages from certain quarters that if we ‘calm down’, meetings with Khan sahib may be allowed in a few weeks. However, some individuals appear more interested in self-projection,” he claimed.
“It is a fact that earlier this week, while Aleema Khanum was holding a sit-in, around 20 of our vehicles were damaged, and police seized the keys of several others. As a result, even those cars that were not damaged could not be driven away by party leaders,” he claimed.
“There are some people who reach the sit-in for ratings as they are active on social media,” he added.
He further said that in the past, Mashal Yousafzai, after meeting Imran and Bushra Bibi, had conveyed that they had instructed her to end the protests outside Adiala jail and stage demonstrations outside the Islamabad High Court instead.
“A written directive was also issued in this regard, but later Aleema Khanum met Khan sahab and claimed he had not given any such instructions, after which the protests outside Adiala jail resumed,” he added.
Central Information Secretary PTI Sheikh Waqas Akram, while talking to Dawn, admitted that the decision was made to stop protests outside the prison.
“However, when Aleema Khanum announced that she would hold the protest outside Adiala jail, the party decided to stand along with her. She is the sister of Imran Khan, and we will stand by her,” Waqas explained.
Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, speaking to Dawn, dismissed reports of internal rifts within the party as “disinformation.”
“There can be differences of opinion, that is the beauty of a political party. In the last parliamentary party meeting, it was unanimously decided that all decisions will be taken by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, and the entire party will follow his lead,” he said.
CM KP Sohail Afridi again barred from meeting Imran
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Sohail Afridi was denied permission to meet Imran for the 10th time on Thursday. Although he arrived at Adiala Jail, the police informed him that the meeting could not be allowed.
Speaking to media persons, Mr Afridi said that it was strange that an elected CM was not being allowed to meet his party’s founding chairman despite court orders to the contrary.
He questioned the state on the message being sent to PTI and Imran Khan’s sisters, who were peacefully protesting but were dispersed using water cannons. He asked whether the intention was to suggest that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was not considered part of Pakistan.
He warned that both the federal and Punjab government leadership would face consequences once the PTI returned to power at the Centre.
Afridi said that efforts had been underway for the past three years to “minus Imran” , but all such attempts had failed. He added that the government and the “powers that be” should engage in talks with Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, as Imran had authorised them to represent him in negotiations.
Replying to a question about Faiz Hameed’s sentencing, Afridi said it was an “internal matter of the institution”.
Early on Wednesday morning, authorities used water cannons to disperse protesters, including the sisters of the PTI founder, who were staging a sit-in outside Adiala jail after being denied a meeting with the ex-premier.
The sit-in, led by Aleema and also including Imran’s other sisters Uzma and Noreen, was staged outside the jail on Tuesday after she was once again denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Senior party members, including PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI KP Provincial President Junaid Akbar Khan, had also joined the demonstration.
The PTI has made multiple attempts to meet the incarcerated party founder, being denied an audience each time by jail authorities despite a court order allowing meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
However, last week, the authorities allowed Uzma Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, to meet her incarcerated brother. After the visit, she said he was “perfectly fine”.</p><small>2025-12-11 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11214910c186c9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960526/time-magazine-names-architects-of-ai-as-person-of-the-year' target='_blank'><strong>Time magazine names ‘Architects of AI’ as Person of the Year</strong></a><br><p>Time magazine named the “Architects of AI” as its Person of the Year on Thursday, highlighting the US tech titans whose work on cutting-edge artificial intelligence is transforming humanity.
Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and xAI’s Elon Musk are among the innovators who have “grabbed the wheel of history, developing technology and making decisions that are reshaping the information landscape, the climate, and our livelihoods,” Time wrote.
One of two covers of the magazine is a homage to the famous 1932 photograph of ironworkers casually eating lunch on a steel beam above New York City.







In the Time illustration, sitting astride the city are Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, AMD chief Lisa Su, Musk, Huang, Altman as well as Google’s AI boss Demis Hassabis, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li.
“Racing both beside and against each other, they placed multibillion-dollar bets on one of the biggest physical infrastructure projects of all time,” the magazine said of the group.
“They reoriented government policy, altered geopolitical rivalries, and brought robots into homes. AI emerged as arguably the most consequential tool in great-power competition since the advent of nuclear weapons.” Alongside popular AI models like ChatGPT and Claude, Time credited investors like SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, who has plunged billions of dollars into the technology.
Time’s Person of the Year selection is an acknowledgement of the year’s most influential figure.
The title last year went to president-elect Donald Trump. Others have included singer Taylor Swift and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.
‘Gravitational center of 2025’
According to the magazine, which is owned by Silicon Valley billionaire Marc Benioff, 2025 was the year AI shifted from promise to reality and when ChatGPT usage more than doubled to 10 percent of the world’s population.
“This is the single most impactful technology of our time,” Huang, CEO of chipmaker Nvidia – the most valuable company in the world – told Time.
He predicted that AI will eventually grow the global economy from $100 trillion to $500 trillion.
But the magazine also pointed to AI’s darker side.
Lawsuits have alleged that chatbots contributed to suicides and mental health crises, sparking debates about “chatbot psychosis,” where users may devolve into delusions and paranoia.
In one case, the California parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine are suing OpenAI after he took his own life. They claim that ChatGPT provided information about suicide methods.
Time noted too looming job displacement as more companies race to replace workers with AI models.
Yet the magazine notably steered away from using AI to generate its cover art, opting instead for human artists.
Thomas Hudson, chief analyst at US research firm Forrester, said the Person of the Year choice rightly reflected AI’s heavy influence this year.
“AI has been the gravitational center of 2025 for the economy and the source of endless discussions on how it will shape the future of our societies,” he said in a statement.</p><small>2025-12-11 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11205508d3ef50f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960524/afghan-deportation-likely-to-pick-up-pace-in-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan deportation likely to pick up pace in KP</strong></a><br><p>The deportation of Afghan refugees from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is likely to pick up pace as authorities are moving to push out those staying in refugee camps across the province after the Centre criticised the KP government’s response to the issue.
In October, the federal government denotified 28 refugee camps across the province during a drive to expel more than 1.3 million Afghan nationals with Proof of Registration (PoR) cards — the last category of refugees legally living in Pakistan without visas. The process was underway since September 1.
A senior government official told Dawn that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had accused the KP government of “going soft on Afghan refugees.”
“While all refugee camps across the province had been denotified, a soft drive was ongoing in KP to send them to Afghanistan,” he said.
The official said the Pak-Afghan border was closed for new arrivals and trade, while it was only open for deportation and repatriation of Afghan refugees.
In a presser last week, the interior minister had pointed out that refugee camps had been shut down across the country except KP, where they were still operational, he said, adding the refugees had been receiving health and educational facilities.
“Following the interior minister’s presser, the provincial authorities conveyed a message to the district administration to go hard on refugees,” he said.
According to the official, the KP authorities had been directed to return refugees to their country and discontinue facilities of health, education, electricity, drinking water and psycho-social support to the camps.
Some of the facilities had been discontinued, while the process for others was underway, the official said, adding the district authorities had actively been working to take over camps’ infrastructure and other facilities.
“They are being pushed out of refugee camps.”
A large number of Afghan refugees were living in urban areas as well, but they had yet to see a concerted effort to be sent back, he said.
About the repatriation of illegal Afghan nationals, Naqvi, in the press conference last week, had said the authorities were facing difficulties in KP about sending Afghan refugees back to Afghanistan.
“This is not the case in the three other provinces. Afghan migrants are being protected in the KP. The federal government had denotified camps of Afghan refugees, but several of them are still operational in KP,” Naqvi alleged. He warned the Afghans who had been repatriated that they would be arrested if they tried to return.
A total of 43 Afghan refugee camps were operational in the province before the denotification orders. On October 15, the authorities ordered the immediate shutdown of the 28 last remaining camps in the province.
A senior KP government official told Dawn that they had asked districts to hold jirgas with the refugees and facilitate those who wanted to go back to their homeland.
According to the UN refugee agency data released on Tuesday, a population count of Afghans living in Pakistan revealed that they number over 2.18 million, out of whom 1.22m are registered, with only 35pc of registered Afghans living in refugee villages.
In 2023, the government set a deadline of Nov 1 for all illegal immigrants to leave Pakistan, otherwise, all law enforcement agencies would deport them. The government, then, initiated a nationwide operation to deport illegal foreign nationals, the majority of whom were Afghans.
Key findings of a UN refugee agency report stated cumulatively, from September 15, 2023, to November 8, 2025, 1,723,481 individuals have returned to Afghanistan.</p><small>2025-12-11 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1119124511db7c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960519/pakistan-china-conduct-joint-counter-terrorism-exercise-warrior-ix-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China conduct joint counter-terrorism exercise Warrior-IX: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Troops from Pakistan and China are conducting a two-week long counter-terrorism exercise to “enhance interoperability and strengthen military-to-military cooperation between the two countries”, said the military’s media wing on Thursday.
“Pakistan Army and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China are conducting joint counterterrorism exercise Warrior-IX from 28 November to 14 December 2025,” said the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).



A ‘Distinguished Visitors Day’ was also held today during the drills at the National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) Pabbi. In attendance were the Ambassador of China to Pakistan, Jiang Zaidong, as the chief guest and Pakistan Army’s chief of general staff as the guest of honour.



Senior dignitaries from China accompanied Zaidong.
“Honourable guests were briefed on the scope, objectives, and conduct of the joint exercise during the visit. They witnessed various counter-terrorism drills and appreciated the professionalism, operational competence, and high morale demonstrated by the participating troops from both sides.”
“The exercise reflects strong defence collaboration between Pakistan and China and reaffirms the commitment of both Armed Forces to working together for peace and stability,” it said.

Pakistan and China, being strategic allies, maintain close coordination and cooperation in defence-related matter. Beijing has become the primary arms supplier of Islamabad.
Chinese-built J-10CE fighter aircraft performed exceptionally well during the May conflict with India and were credited with shooting down at least 6 Indian Air Force fighters in aerial engagements that firmly established the national air force’s qualitative edge over India.
Last year, the two forces participated in Warrior-VIII joint drills.

Norwegian Ambassador Per Albert Ilsaas attended the Supreme Court hearing of rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts. The diplomat’s presence during the court proceedings generated a lot of chatter on social media.
The ministry, in its statement, said the Scandinavian country’s top representative was summoned by the additional foreign secretary (Europe). He was informed that his presence breached “diplomatic protocol and relevant international law”.







“Noting that his actions amount to interference in the internal affairs of the country, the Ambassador was urged to adhere to the established norms of diplomatic engagement, as outlined in the relevant articles of the Vienna Convention,” said the statement.
However, Imaan defended the envoy’s presence during the court hearing today on social media.
Responding to a journalist who termed the presence of the ambassador as a “breach of diplomatic norms”, Imaan said, “Who is going to explain to this genius that diplomats routinely observe court proceedings — that is not equivalent to them taking a position on any case.
“This is a standard practice but it’s very clear where the pressure is coming from to malign the ambassador,” she said.







Imaan and her husband are facing a trial under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca) — had moved an application in the SC requesting the urgent hearing of their appeal against the IHC’s refusal to grant interim relief.
The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under Peca.
The complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The two have already filed a criminal revision before the IHC challenging the trial proceedings on grounds of due process violations under the CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in their absence.</p><small>2025-12-11 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11142129da931a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960497/sc-stays-trial-court-proceedings-against-imaan-mazari-hadi-ali-chattha-in-controversial-social-media-post-case' target='_blank'><strong>SC stays trial court proceedings against Imaan Mazari, Hadi Ali Chattha in controversial social media post case</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday stayed trial proceedings againstrights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts until their pending appeals were decided by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The court issued the directives as a three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar and comprising Justice Salahuddin Panwhar and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, heard Imaan’s appeal seeking to set aside the IHC’s Dec 1 order refusing to grant interim relief by staying the trial in the case.
Imaan and her husband Abdul Hadi Mohammad Ali — who are facing a trial under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca) — had moved an application in the SC requesting the urgent hearing of their appeal against the IHC’s refusal to grant interim relief.
The petitioners have already filed a criminal revision before the IHC challenging the trial proceedings on grounds of due process violations under the CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in their absence.
During today’s SC proceedings, Justice Kakar, while dictating the order, said, “We expect the IHC to decide on the fate of the petition after providing a full opportunity of hearing to both parties.”
The order stayed the trial court proceedings, which were scheduled to resume on Dec 15 by Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka.
Imaan and her husband were represented by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi whereas Additional Attorney General (AAG) Rana Asadur Rehman opposed the maintainability of the appeal.
During the hearing, Justice Kakar observed that it was common practice for the plaintiff to devise their own strategies to fight the case, but the court would neither belittle nor undermine the trial court judge.
Meanwhile, Norwegian Ambassador Per Albert Ilsas also attended the proceedings, which caused a lot of chatter on social media.

The van, carrying 12 passengers, was coming from Hajera in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and plunged into the river while navigating a turn near Garari Bridge in the Kahuta area of Rawalpindi on Thursday morning, as per Rescue 1122 sources.
According to Rescue 1122, four people have been confirmed among the drowned.
District Emergency Officer 1122 Rawalpindi Sighbatullah said that four people have been rescued so far and were rushed to the Kahuta Tehsil Hospital in Rawalpindi.
Superintendent THQ hospital, Dr Samina, also confirmed that the rescued persons had been shifted to the medical facility.
The Rescue 1122 official also confirmed that “four bodies of the drowned victims, including a female, had been retrieved and shifted to hospitals, where their identity was being ascertained”.
He added that the van had been pulled out of the water, and a search for the other passengers was underway.

Meanwhile, Commissioner Rawalpindi, Engineer Amir Khattak, directed all relevant authorities, including health, Rescue 1122, traffic police and tehsil administration to launch a coordinated operation for the rescue of the passengers.
The rescue operation continued till dusk, as low-light conditions did not allow divers to search for the missing. Rescue officials said the search will resume at first light on Friday, but expressed fear that the river’s current may have carried away the missing passengers.
Assistant Commissioner Kahuta Ayesha Zafar, speaking to Dawn, said three or four passengers were still missing and the rescue operation will resume tomorrow morning.
On August 24 last year, a fatal accident at the same Garari bridge claimed 24 lives after a bus plunged into the river, while in another accident over 14 passengers were seriously injured in a bus accident in the area on the Kahuta- Hajera AJK road in October 2024.
Following these accidents, the district authorities of police and traffic had launched a drive to inspect the condition of the public service vehicles (PSVs); however, it ended after a few months.
In November last year, 22 people drowned after a bus carrying them plunged into a river in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district.</p><small>2025-12-11 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/111609522ad4536.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960510/attack-on-school-in-mir-ali-leaves-future-of-over-600-students-at-risk' target='_blank'><strong>Attack on school in Mir Ali leaves future of over 600 students at risk</strong></a><br><p>An attack on a school in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali subdivision earlier this week has jeopardised the future of more than 600 school-going children, it emerged on Thursday.
On Monday night, unidentified militants blew up a government primary school in the Khushali area of Ayaz Kot. Unknown attackers had planted explosives in the school and detonated them late on Monday night.
The powerful blast, which was heard miles away, destroyed a significant portion of the school building.
Education department officials confirmed that more than 600 students were enrolled in the institution, which served as the only functional primary school in the area.
Authorities said the remaining sections of the building have been cordoned off, while an emergency plan for alternate learning arrangements is under consideration.
Local elders and parents expressed deep concern, calling attacks on educational institutions “a direct assault on the future of children”.
“This school was the only beacon of hope for our children. Its destruction has shocked the entire community,” an area elder said.
As per the police, evidence had been collected from the site, and the Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU) was assessing the type of explosive used.
Initial findings suggest that the device was detonated either through a remote-controlled or a timed mechanism.
Security officials stated that the area has been cordoned off and a search operation has been launched.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far.
The district administration condemned the incident as an “anti-education act,” saying, “Such attacks hinder peace and development in the region. Those responsible will be brought to justice soon.”
The incident comes weeks after Cadet College Wana came under a terrorist attack in South Waziristan.
In October, an explosion at a girls’ primary school in Lakki Marwat district partially damaged the building.
Last year in May, a private girls’ school was blown up by unidentified militants in Tehsil Shewa of North Waziristan district. Similar attacks also took place in May 2023 when two government schools for girls in Mirali were blown up. No loss of life was reported in the incidents.</p><small>2025-12-11 12:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11173505a87f9bb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960503/timeline-of-faiz-hameeds-arrest-and-trial' target='_blank'><strong>Timeline of Faiz Hameed’s arrest and trial</strong></a><br><p>Former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Faiz Hameed on Thursday was sentenced to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment by a military court, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
The court handed down the sentence following a Field General Court Martial (FGCM) in which Hameed was found guilty on multiple charges, including engaging in political activities, violating anti-espionage laws, and abusing his authority, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
In November 2023, the Supreme Court (SC) said that allegations of an “extremely serious nature” against the ex-spymaster “cannot be left unattended” as they would undermine the reputation of the country’s institutions if they were proven to be true.
A series of investigations was thus initiated against him, following which he was taken into military custody in August 2024.
Dawn.com takes a look at the major developments and milestones in the case against Hameed over the last year.
August 12, 2024
Hameed was taken into military custody, with the army’s media wing confirming that the process for his court-martial had been initiated in connection with the Top City housing scheme scandal.
The government hailed the military’s decision to uphold the rule of law by initiating court martial proceedings against the former spymaster  for his alleged involvement in victimising the owner of a private housing society. The opposition PTI, however, adopted a reserved stance, calling it an internal issue of the army.
August 17, 2024
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar revealed that Hameed, who was facing court martial proceedings, had apologised to him for victimising him. Calling the arrest of the former ISI chief a miracle, Dar said: “I am among the victims of Faiz Hameed.” However, he added, the retired general had tendered an apology for his “excesses”.
August 22, 2024
PTI founder Imran Khan called for an open trial of the former spymaster. He termed the arrest a ‘drama’ and claimed that Hameed’s open trial would expose the ‘regime change operation’ and the incidents of May 9. Imran also said that if Hameed is tried for mutiny, the proceedings should be open to the public.
September 5, 2024
ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that court martial proceedings against Hameed had been initiated based on “concrete evidence” following a detailed probe.
December 10, 2024
The military’s media affairs wing confirmed that Hameed had been formally indicted by a military court on three counts — engaging in political activities, violating anti-espionage laws, and abusing his authority.
February 13, 2025
An investigation was conducted against him for allegedly misusing his powers. Awami National Party leader and former chief minister Ameer Haider Khan Hoti stated that before the Top City inquiry, Hameed should be held accountable for actions that led to the “loss of Pashtun lives.”

“Accordingly, the SBP has received SDR 914 million (equivalent to about $ 1.2 billion) under the EFF and RSF in value [on] Dec 10, 2025 from the IMF,” the central bank said.
“The amount would be reflected in SBP’s foreign exchange reserves for the week ending on Dec 12,” it added.







Earlier this week, the Fund had approved the fresh disbursement of $1.2bn to Pakistan under its dual-track bailout — the 37-month EFF and the climate-focused RSF.
With this tranche, total disbursements to Pakistan under the EFF and RSF now stand at approximately $3.3 billion, supporting both macroeconomic stabilisation and long-term structural reforms for climate resilience.
In a statement released after the meeting of its Executive Board, the IMF highlighted that “Pakistan’s strong programme implementation, despite the recent devastating floods, has maintained stability and improved financing and external conditions”.
It stressed that the country’s policy priorities remain centred on maintaining macroeconomic stability and advancing reforms to strengthen public finances, enhance competition, raise productivity and competitiveness, bolster the social safety net and human capital, reform state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and improve public service provision and energy sector viability.
The board noted that Pakistan’s fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of 1.3 per cent of GDP achieved in FY25, in line with programme targets. Gross reserves stood at $14.5bn at end-FY25, up from $9.4bn a year earlier, and are projected to continue rebuilding in FY26 and over the medium term. The board also noted that “inflation has increased, reflecting the impact of the floods on food prices, but this is expected to be temporary”.
The statement quoted IMF Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair Nigel Clarke as saying that “in the face of an uncertain global environment, Pakistan needs to maintain prudent policies to further entrench macroeconomic stability, while accelerating reforms necessary to achieve stronger, private-sector-led, and sustainable medium-term growth”.
He highlighted the importance of “advancing reforms to raise revenues via tax policy simplification and base broadening”, describing it as key to achieving fiscal sustainability and building the fiscal space necessary to boost climate resilience, social protection, human capital development, and public investment.
Clarke also stressed that “reforms in the energy sector are critical to safeguarding its viability and improving Pakistan’s competitiveness”. He noted that timely power tariff adjustments had “helped reduce the stock and flow of circular debt”, while emphasising that “subsequent efforts need to focus on sustainably reducing electricity production and distribution costs and addressing inefficiencies in the power and gas sector”.
Meanwhile, the latest IMF projections for Pakistan suggest that the immediate risk of economic free fall has eased but the country remains locked into a narrow stabilisation path marked by weak growth, heavy debt and limited relief for households.</p><small>2025-12-11 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11095044d870d1b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960488/pakistan-says-terrorism-emanating-from-afghan-soil-poses-gravest-threat-to-national-security-sovereignty' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan says terrorism emanating from Afghan soil poses ‘gravest threat’ to national security, sovereignty</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan told the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Wednesday that terrorism emanating from Afghan soil posed the “gravest threat” to the country’s national security and sovereignty.
Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad made the remarks while addressing a debate in New York on the situation in Afghanistan.
In his statement, he highlighted Islamabad’s concerns about security, humanitarian, and socio-economic challenges emerging from neighbouring Afghanistan.
Briefing the UNSC on Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, the ambassador said Pakistan had maintained consistent engagement with the Afghan Taliban, conducting high-level visits, facilitating humanitarian relief, supporting the transportation of goods, and announcing trade and transit concessions.
Despite these efforts, he said, threats persisted, creating mounting security challenges for Pakistan and the wider region.



“Afghanistan is once again a safe sanctuary for terrorist groups and proxies, with devastating consequences and mounting security challenges for its immediate neighbours, particularly Pakistan, and the region and beyond.”
He said Afghan authorities were failing to take concrete measures against terrorist groups, adding that Pakistan had witnessed a surge in militant attacks that were planned, financed and orchestrated using Afghan soil under their watch.
“Just this year alone, we have lost close to 1,200 lives to terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. Since 2022, more than 214 Afghan terrorists, including suicide bombers, have been neutralised in Pakistan during counter-terror operations,” he said.
“Terrorism emanating from Afghan soil poses the gravest threat to Pakistan’s national security and sovereignty,” the envoy said, adding that terrorist groups, including the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Al-Qaeda, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), and the Majeed Brigade, enjoyed “safe haven” in the neighbouring country.
He said Pakistan had successfully thwarted multiple infiltration attempts by TTP and BLA terrorists from across Afghanistan, confiscating caches of military grade equipment left behind by international forces in Afghanistan.
“These efforts have had a human cost, with huge sacrifices by our valiant security forces and civilians,” he said.
“Elements within the Taliban rank and file are supporting these terrorist groups and allowing them safe passage to operate with impunity and free will. There is also credible evidence of collaboration among these terrorist groups through joint training, illicit weapons trade, refuge to terrorists, and coordinated attacks against Pakistan using the Afghan soil,” he said.
“And not surprisingly, one detractor in the region, opportunist, and spoiler, has moved fast to intensify its sponsorship of terrorist activity through material, technical and financial support, to terrorist groups and proxies active against Pakistan from Afghan soil,” he added, without taking any names.
Ambassador Ahmad also urged the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to strengthen efforts to prevent illicit arms trade and provide an objective assessment of border security, emphasising that cross-border terrorism was the primary issue behind border clashes between the two countries.
He also highlighted Pakistan’s efforts to engage with the Afghan Taliban, including recent talks held in Doha and Istanbul.
He expressed gratitude to the governments of Qatar and Türkiye for facilitating dialogue with the Afghan Taliban and called for concrete, verifiable action by them against terrorist groups.
He warned that failure to do so would result in Pakistan taking “all necessary defensive measures” to protect its citizens and sovereignty.
Ambassador Ahmad also highlighted Pakistan’s decades-long role in hosting Afghan refugees. He told the UNSC that millions of Afghans had been welcomed over the past four decades despite Pakistan’s own constraints.
“With conflict now ended, we expect that Afghans will now return to their country of origin in a dignified, phased and orderly manner,” he said. The envoy said Pakistan would continue to extend all possible assistance to the Afghans but also called on the international community to “shoulder its responsibility”.
He also noted Pakistan’s visa regime, saying that it allowed Afghans to enter the country legally for purposes such as education, health, business, and family visits. He highlighted that more than 536,000 medical visas have been issued since September 2023.
The envoy stressed that Pakistan sought a peaceful, stable, interconnected, and prosperous Afghanistan — one that was at peace with itself and its neighbours.
He cautioned that bilateral engagements should not be used by countries with negative agendas to destabilise the Pakistan–Afghanistan border or the wider region.
“No country desires peace and stability in Afghanistan more than Pakistan. No country has suffered from the consequences of decades of conflict more than Pakistan,” he said.
Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to work for peace in Afghanistan, emphasising that lasting stability could only be achieved through sincere dialogue with the Afghan Taliban, respect for international obligations, and strengthened regional cooperation.
He called upon the international community to remain engaged, provide humanitarian support, and assist in fostering a security environment conducive to long-term development and prosperity in Afghanistan and the region.
Recent reporting provides a stark backdrop to Pakistan’s warnings at the UNSC.
A report by US watchdog Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has confirmed that billions of dollars’ worth of American-supplied weapons, military equipment, and security infrastructure left behind during the 2021 US withdrawal now form the backbone of the Afghan Taliban’s security apparatus.
Parallel assessments by UN monitoring teams and investigative reporting by the Washington Post indicate that some of these weapons have already reached the TTP, strengthening a group responsible for escalating attacks inside Pakistan.
A UN panel also reported that the Taliban continue to provide logistical and operational support to the TTP, reinforcing Islamabad’s concerns about safe havens for terrorists and cross-border militancy.</p><small>2025-12-11 07:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11112238e5b313a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960492/health-minister-launches-last-nationwide-polio-campaign-of-2025-notes-declines-in-cases-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Health minister launches last nationwide polio campaign of 2025, notes declines in cases in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Health Minister Mustafa Kamal on Thursday launched the last nationwide polio campaign of 2025 aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children against the crippling disease, noting that the number of cases in the country had reduced in comparison to last year.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases, with the highest number of cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 19.
Launching the last polio campaign of the year — set to run from December 15 to December 2 — at a ceremony in Islamabad, the minister noted the decline in cases in comparison to 2024, saying, “We have succeeded in reducing polio cases in the country.”
He recalled that Pakistan had recorded 74 cases in 2024; however, this year the country only saw 30 cases.
The minister said that the virus was “present in more than half of the country,” including Peshawar, Karachi, and Lahore.
He stated that the government remained “determined to eliminate the virus in the country by year’s end and called on all parties to “play their part”.
Kamal noted that 19 out of 30 cases reported this year were from KP, out of which 16 were from the south of the province. He said that 200,000 children in south KP had not been immunised against polio due to the “law and order situation”.
The minister further said more than 400,000 polio workers would be involved in the latest campaign, calling on parents to cooperate with polio teams.
Kamal also called on scholars to play their role in polio campaigns. The minister also urged citizens to “not fall for any negative propaganda” against the drive.
He also called on elected representatives to “administer polio drops to people from their families and make a video to further encourage people”.
Anti-polio drive to be held from Dec 15-21
Meanwhile, the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) said that the polio campaign would be held from Dec 15-21, to vaccinate around 45.5m children.
In a statement, the body said, “More than 400,000 frontline polio workers will take part in the campaign”.
It said more than 23m children will be immunised in Punjab, over 16m in Sindh, more than 7.2m in KP and over 2.6m in Balochistan. In Islamabad, the campaign aims to vaccinate over 400,000 children.
The NEOC urged parents to cooperate with polio workers and ensure the vaccination of their children.
On October 21, a case of wild poliovirus was confirmed in KP’s Torghar, taking the tally of cases for this year to 30.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-12-11 07:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/111103430176930.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960489/fighting-rages-at-cambodia-thailand-border-ahead-of-expected-trump-call' target='_blank'><strong>Fighting rages at Cambodia-Thailand border ahead of expected Trump call</strong></a><br><p>Renewed fighting raged at the border of Cambodia and Thailand on Thursday, with combat heard near centuries-old temples, ahead of US President Donald Trump’s planned phone call to the two nations’ leaders.
At least 15 people, including Thai soldiers and Cambodian civilians, have been killed in the reignited border conflict, officials said.
More than half a million people, mostly in Thailand, have fled border areas near where jets, tanks and drones have waged battle.
The Southeast Asian nations dispute the colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometre (500-mile) frontier, where both sides claim a smattering of historic temples.
This week’s clashes are the deadliest since five days of fighting in July that killed dozens before a shaky truce was agreed, following intervention by Trump.
The US president said he expected to speak on Thursday with the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia to demand a halt to their renewed clashes.
“I think I’m scheduled to speak to them tomorrow,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday.
Both sides blame the other for reigniting the conflict, which has expanded to five provinces of both Thailand and Cambodia, according to an AFP tally of official accounts.
In Thailand’s northeast on Thursday morning, hundreds of evacuated families woke up inside a university building in Surin city that has been transformed into a shelter.
A few older women pound chilli paste while volunteers stir big pots of food.
Nearby, 61-year-old farmer Rat, who declined to give her last name, said she had to leave her home before she could plant a cassava crop this season, fleeing with her family of eight.
“I just want to go home and farm again,” she told AFP.
“Every time the fighting starts, it feels like life gets paused all over again.”
Cultural heritage
AFP journalists in Cambodia’s northwestern Oddar Meanchey province heard the blasts of incoming artillery from the direction of disputed temples since dawn on Wednesday.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said in a statement that Thai forces initiated an attack early on Thursday morning in the province, “shelling into Khnar Temple area”.
On the other side of the border, the Thai military announced an overnight curfew in parts of Sa Kaeo beginning Wednesday night.
The Thai army said on Wednesday that Cambodian forces fired rockets early that day that landed in the vicinity of the Phanom Dong Rak Hospital in Surin province — to the north of Sa Kaeo, and which was struck in the fighting in July.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said more than 101,000 people have been evacuated, while in Thailand, authorities said more than 400,000 civilians have taken shelter elsewhere.
The United States, China and Malaysia, as chair of the regional bloc ASEAN, brokered a ceasefire back in July.
In October, Trump backed a follow-on joint declaration, touting new trade deals with Thailand and Cambodia after they agreed to prolong their truce.
But Thailand suspended the agreement the following month.
The United Nations cultural agency called on Wednesday for “protection of the region’s cultural heritage in all its forms” amid the ongoing fighting.
“Unesco has communicated to all parties concerned the geographical coordinates of sites on the World Heritage List as well as those of national significance, in order to avoid any potential damage,” it said in a statement.
In 2008, military clashes between Thailand and Cambodia erupted over a patch of land next to the 900-year-old temple, located on the border.
Sporadic violence from 2008 to 2011 led to the deaths of two dozen people and displacement of tens of thousands.</p><small>2025-12-11 06:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11105602754d3e8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960490/venezuelan-opposition-leader-maria-corina-machado-emerges-from-hiding-after-winning-nobel' target='_blank'><strong>Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado emerges from hiding after winning Nobel</strong></a><br><p>Nobel laureate and Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado emerged from hiding to make her first public appearance in almost a year, waving to supporters from the balcony of her Oslo hotel early on Thursday.
Machado, who won the Nobel for challenging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s grip on power, did not arrive in Norway in time for Wednesday’s prize ceremony.
Her daughter collected the prestigious award on her behalf, and delivered a blistering acceptance speech in her stead.
The Venezuelan democracy campaigner made it to the Norwegian capital hours later, and went straight to see her family, Nobel Prize Committee Chair Jorgen Watne Frydnes said.
From the balcony of the Grand Hotel, Machado later greeted a crowd of jubilant supporters, who sang and shouted “libertad” (freedom), according to AFP journalists.







Machado, who has been living in hiding in Venezuela, was last seen in public on January 9, when she protested Maduro’s inauguration for his third term.
In her Nobel acceptance speech, the democracy campaigner urged her compatriots to keep fighting against Maduro’s “state terrorism”.
“What we Venezuelans can offer the world is the lesson forged through this long and difficult journey: that to have democracy, we must be willing to fight for freedom,” Machado said in a speech delivered by her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado.
It is unclear how Machado managed to leave Venezuela, or how she plans to eventually return.
She was warned by Caracas that she would be labelled a “fugitive” if she left the country.
“She risks being arrested if she returns, even if the authorities have shown more restraint with her than with many others, because arresting her would have a very strong symbolic value,” said Benedicte Bull, a professor specialising in Latin America at the University of Oslo.
Machado’s previous refusal to leave the country had also boosted her political power.
“She is the undisputed leader of the opposition, but if she were to stay away in exile for a long time, I think that would change and she would gradually lose political influence,” Bull added.
‘State terrorism’
Her daughter assured the Nobel prize audience that her mother would return. “She wants to live in a free Venezuela, and she will never give up on that purpose,” Ana Corina Sosa Machado said.
Machado’s mother and three daughters, and some Latin American heads of state, including Argentine President Javier Milei, were at the prize-giving at Oslo’s City Hall.
In her acceptance speech, Machado denounced kidnappings and torture under Maduro’s tenure, calling them “crimes against humanity” and “state terrorism, deployed to bury the will of the people”.
Machado has been hailed for her fight for democracy, but also criticised for aligning herself with US President Donald Trump, to whom she has dedicated her Nobel.
The Oslo ceremony coincides with a large US military build-up in the Caribbean in recent weeks and deadly strikes on what Washington says are drug-smuggling boats.
Maduro, who came to power in 2013, insists the goal of the US operations — which Machado has said are justified — is to topple the government and seize Venezuela’s oil reserves
Nobel prize
Machado has accused Maduro of stealing Venezuela’s July 2024 election, from which she was banned — a claim backed by much of the international community.
The opposition claimed its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won the election. He now lives in exile and was also in Oslo on Wednesday.
Multiple other Nobel Peace Prize-winners have been unable to collect their awards in person. Family members usually do so on their behalf, Nobel Institute director Kristian Berg Harpviken explained this week.
The Nobel laureates in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics all received their prizes from Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustaf at a separate ceremony in Stockholm on Wednesday.
The prize consists of a diploma, a gold medal and 11 million kronor ($1.2 million) — which is shared when several laureates are honoured in the same category.</p><small>2025-12-11 05:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11075952afbaa4e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960450/british-lawmakers-press-for-action-on-kashmir-freedom' target='_blank'><strong>British lawmakers press for action on Kashmir freedom</strong></a><br><p>• Highlight ‘urgent’ crisis following India’s revocation of disputed region’s special status; call for self-determination vote as per UN’s 1948 resolution• Hamish Falconer insists lasting resolution rests solely with India and Pakistan
LONDON: British lawmakers on Wednesday urged their government to support self-determination for the disputed region of Ja­m­­mu and Kashmir, and called on it to press India on human rights.
However, a minister reaffirmed the UK’s long-standing policy on the decades-old dispute during a parliamentary debate by saying “we believe in diplomacy”, with a renewed push for bilateral talks between India and Pakistan.
The debate “Kashmir: Self-determination”, in Westminster Hall, saw several members of parliament calling for a more active British role, citing concerns from their large British-Kashmiri constituencies.

 

The session was led by Labour MP Imran Hussain, who described the situation as an urgent human rights issue.
For the people of [India-held] Kashmir, this is not a distant foreign-policy issue, Mr Hussain said.
“This is about families torn apart, homes bulldozed, voices sile­nced, human rights abused. The right to choose their own destiny has been denied for generations.”
He criticised India’s revocation of the region’s special status in 2019. “Since the removal of Articles 370 and 35A, we have seen communication blackouts, curfews, mass detentions and attempts to alter the demographics of the region,” he said.
He also referenced a 1948 United Nations resolution calling for a vote on the disputed territory’s future.
The promise of a free and fair plebiscite made in 1948 remains unfulfilled, Mr Hussain added.
Decades later, the international community and successive UK governments have failed to ensure that Kashmiris can exercise their right to self-determination, he added.
Other MPs echoed his concerns. Jim Shannon of Strangford highlighted the humanitarian situation in occupied Kashmir, highlighting “repressive policies” including the use of arbitrary detention, extrajudicial killings and other most serious abuses, including sexual abuse.
Gareth Snell of Labour from Stoke-on-Trent Central highlighted the large British-Kashmiri population and the enduring lack of political attention to the issue.
Labour MP Andy McDonald of Middlesbrough and Thornaby East raised concerns over reports of arbitrary detention, suppression of free speech and restrictions on journalists.
Responding for the government, Hamish Falconer, who is the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, emphasised that the UK’s position has not changed.
“It is for India and Pakistan to find a lasting resolut­­­ion to the situation in Kashmir, which must take into ac­­count the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” he said, stressing that both sides are friends. Mr Falconer also said the UK regularly raises human rights with both nations. “The UK takes human rights seriously,” he said. “We continue to raise concerns with both India and Pakistan regarding restrictions, the detention of political leaders, and the protection of minorities. We welcome any steps to lift remaining restrictions and release political detainees,” he added.
He also addressed the UK diaspora, saying the UK recognises the strength of feeling among the British-Kashmiri community and remains open to engagement with community representatives, adding, “I do not wish to take a view about whether a further reference to the United Nations is useful at this time, but it is critical in 2025 and into 2026 that there is dialogue between India and Pakistan. We have seen the extent of the pressure when dialogue breaks down.” While ministers acknowledged the plight of Kashmiris and the UK’s role in raising concerns, they stopped short of committing to any UK-led mediation or a UN-backed plebiscite.
The session marks the latest in a series of parliamentary debates on the disputed Himalayan region, including discussions in March 2025 and January 2021, reflecting the ongoing concern among MPs, constituents, and diaspora communities about human rights and political representation in the region.

RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: Politi­cal temperatures rose further on Wedne­sday, as Rawalpindi police sought a legal opinion on the question of registering an FIR against PTI leaders and supporters over a protest outside Adiala jail, even as the party moved a privilege motion in the National Assembly over alleged use of force against its workers, and voiced alarm at reports of Imran Khan’s possible transfer to another prison.
The PTI also joined other opposition parties in warning that efforts to “minus” the incarcerated former premier and clamp down on peaceful protest would only deepen the stand-off with the government and push the country towards greater political turmoil.

 

After entering a report in its daily police diary (roznamcha) on the PTI sit-in outside Adiala jail on the previous night, Rawalpindi police termed the demonstration a “violent protest by a political party with the intention of attacking Adiala jail” in a statement issued on Wednesday.
It noted that Section 144 was in force in the city and that it was the police’s respo­n­sibility to ensure its implementation.
A police spokesperson said Adiala jail was a sensitive and densely populated area where maintaining security and traffic order was crucial. He added that there was no visiting time at night and no one could be allowed to meet an inmate without a court order.
The spokesperson claimed that the po­lice had “shown extreme patience” du­r­ing the sit-in despite “attempts to vandalise and resist the police” by protesters.

 

“Members of the political party pelted stones and attacked the police, on which the law had to take its course. Water cannon had to be used, with extreme patience and strategy, to prevent malicious activity and an attack,” he said, adding that violation of the law would not be tolerated “under any circumstances” in such a sensitive area.
In a post on X at 3:58am, the party had claimed that authorities used water cannons to disperse Imran Khan’s sisters and peaceful PTI workers outside Adiala jail, despite a court order allowing a meeting with the jailed former PM.
The party said Mr Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Niazi, along with party leaders and workers, had spent the entire day peacefully waiting outside the prison to exercise their “constitutional and legal right” to meet their incarcerated leader on a court-mandated visitation day.







“This brutal crackdown on a peaceful sit-in violates basic human rights and freedom of assembly in freezing weather!” the party said. It also shared a video of a water cannon being used as people, bundled up against the cold, fled the scene.
A police source said a report on Tuesday night’s incident had already been recorded and could be converted into a formal FIR, in which the accused would be nominated and booked under the relevant sections of the law.
Privilege motion
On the other hand, PTI MNAs on Wednesday submitted a complaint for a “privilege motion” in the National Assembly against Rawalpindi police.
At a subsequent presser, opposition leaders claimed that PTI parliamentary leader Shahid Khattak’s “leg had been broken” in the melee.
The motion claimed that police had used force against PTI leaders and workers who were present outside the jail to express solidarity with the PTI founder imprisoned there.
The party also expressed grave concern over reports that the former prime minister might be transferred to another jail, calling such a move a blatant display of “fear, political desperation and weakness” on the part of the government.
The party said its founding chairman could neither be “minused” nor removed from the political arena, nor could his voice be sile­nced behind prison walls.
In a statement issued by the PTI Central Media Department, the party condemned remarks by federal ministers suggesting that Mr Khan may be mov­ed to another facility, saying the government “continued to tremble at his very name” despite keeping him incarcerated for over two and a half years.
The party also condemned what it described as a police “assault” on Mr Khan’s sisters, female workers and party leaders outside Adiala Jail.
It said the episode once again exposed the “stark reality” that the incumbent government had abandoned “moral boundaries, constitutional principles and basic human values” in its use of force against political opponents.
War of words
Meanwhile, the war of words between the opposition and the ruling coalition continued on Wed­nesday, with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan saying that “things have reached a point of no return”, while PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali stressed that “common sense should prevail”.
The tensions have particularly intensified in rec­ent days after the spok­esperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on Dec 6, in response to Imran Kha­n’s latest outburst against the military leadership.
Addressing a press conference, Mr Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, “We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy. However, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance. All doors to talks are now closed.”
He went on to say that anyone supporting the incarcerated PTI founder “stood for the desecration of Pakistan’s sovereignty, honour and development”.
“We do not want to label anyone a traitor or ban a political party,” he continued. However, he stressed that “given the current state of affairs, I ask the people what else can be done”.
‘Common sense’
Later, leaders from opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which also includes the PTI, addressed a press conference outside Parliament.
Among them, Barrister Gohar reiterated his party’s allegations that their “mandate had been stolen” in the last general elections.
“We did not stage a sit-in back then … We sat in parliament, believing that our voices would be heard, and a solution to our and the people’s difficulties would be found,” he said, adding that there had been multiple confrontations during the last two years. However, “at some point, common sense should prevail”, he said
Without naming anyone, he said: “If you want to create distance between [Imran] Khan and the people, this is not possible.”
He also spoke to the media earlier in the day, objecting to the resolution passed by the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday.
The government, he said, was attempting to “pitch federating units against each other.”
“You are isolating a major political party. Does removing them from due process save democracy?” the PTI chairman asked.
Achakzai on dialogue
Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai also addressed the press conference outside parliament.
Apparently alluding to the prospect of talks between the opposition and the government, he said: “If anyone wants to hold a dialogue, permission must be given to meet PTI founder Imran Khan. How can we negotiate without his permission?”
For his part, PTI leader Asad Qaiser announced that the opposition had decided to convene a “nati­onal conference” on Dec 20 and 21, in which all political parties and bar associations would be invited.
A national agenda would be presented at the conference, he said, adding, “We are peaceful people, and we will move forward in accordance with the Constitution and the law.”
Mr Qaiser also warned against the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and shifting the PTI founder from the Adiala jail, saying that the moves would “push the country towards anarchy”.
‘Dark period’
Later in the evening, PPP’s Sharjeel Memon addressed a press conference, assailing the PTI and its founder, alleging that the party’s time in power was a “dark period” in Pakistan’s history.
“He (Imran) is being portrayed as a hero who speaks against the establishment. However, if you go back in time, listen to how he spoke about the establishment,” the minister said.
“It is the same Khan who was willing to give Gen Bajwa a lifetime extension, and now these people talk about morals and revolution.”
“Why did you not say anything back then?” the PPP leader questioned. “It was not that long ago, so why have we erased it from our memories?” Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, in a press conference in Islamabad, called on overseas Pakist­anis to recognise the “venomous rhetoric” being spread by PTI.
“I want the overseas Pakistanis to identify and acknowledge these gro­ups,” Mr Chaudhry said. “I want my nation, my Pakistanis, to acknowledge what is right and what is wrong.”

The state-owned Bang­ladesh Sangbad Sangstha news agency quoted Dha­ka’s Foreign Adviser Md Touhid Hossain as saying: “It is possible for us (Bang­ladesh) strategically … (but) it is not possible for Nepal or Bhutan to form a grouping with Pakistan excluding India”.
His remarks are being interpreted as a response to a statement by Pakis­tan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar at the recent ‘Islamabad Conclave’, where he had said a trilateral initiative involving Bangladesh, China and Pakistan had begun and may expand to include countries within and beyond the region.
According to the Bang­ladeshi outlet, Mr Hossain said Mr Dar “has said something, and perhaps at some point this could see some progress”.
In August, Foreign Minister Dar visited Bangladesh for the first time in 13 years.
PM Shehbaz Sharif and Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus have also held a couple of cordial meetings in recent months.
There has been a thaw in ties between the two nations ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh saw Sheikh Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year.

The package includes Link–16 systems, cryptographic equipment, avionics updates, training, and comprehensive logistical support.
The DSCA letter makes clear the rationale for the sale, stating that it “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by allowing Pakistan to retain interoperability with US and partner forces in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and in preparation for future contingency operations.”
The proposed sale is also aimed at modernising Pakistan’s F-16 fleet and addressing operational safety concerns. The letter notes that it will “maintain Pakistan’s capability to meet current and future threats by updating and refurbishing its Block–52 and Mid Life Upgrade F–16 fleet.”
These updates will provide more “seamless integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force in combat operations, exercises, and training, and refurbishment will extend the aircraft life through 2040 while addressing critical flight safety concerns,” the letter adds.
The letter also emphasises Pakistan’s readiness to absorb the technology, stating that the country “has shown a commitment to maintaining its military forces and will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.” It also addresses regional concerns, asserting that “the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.”

 

Lockheed Martin Company of Fort Worth, Texas, will serve as the principal contractor for the sale. The US defence agency pointed out that “implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional US Government or contractor representatives to Pakistan” and that there will be “no adverse impact on US defence readiness as a result of this proposed sale.”
The total estimated value of the sale is $686 million, with major defence equipment valued at $37 million and other items at $649 million. The major defence equipment (MDE) component includes 92 Link–16 data link systems and six inert Mk–82 500-lb general purpose bomb bodies; the latter will have no explosive payload and will be used for weapons integration testing.
Link-16 is an advanced command, control, communications and intelligence system. It is a secure, real-time communication network that shares tactical data among allied forces and is used by US and allied Nato forces. The system is also resistant to electronic jamming from enemy air and ground assets.
“It provides the warfighter key theatre functions such as surveillance, identification, air control, weapons engagement coordination, and direction for all services and allied forces,” the letter read.
The rest of the deal consists of $649m worth of non-MDE equipment, including the AN/APQ–10C Simple Key Loaders and AN/APX–126 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe system — used to identify hostile and allied aircraft.
It also includes hardware and software modifications to support the Operational Flight Program and mandated avionics updates, as well as KY–58M and KIV–78 cryptographic appliqués, which are National Security Agency (NSA)-certified modules used in military aircraft and other tactical systems for secure communications and identification.
The equipment also covers additional secure communications, precision navigation and cryptographic devices, Joint Mission Planning Systems and support, Common Munitions Built-in-test Reprogramming Equipment, and ADU–981 missile adaptor units.
Other weapons integration, test and support equipment, spare and repair parts, software delivery and support, publications and technical documentation, full motion simulators, personnel training, and training equipment are also included.
The package will also provide Pakistan with US government and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support services, studies and surveys, and other related elements of logistical and program support.
Pakistan had requested upgrades to its F-16 fleet in 2021 amid strained relations, but Washington delayed its response. The country is now less dependent on the F-16s, having acquired and jointly developed other platforms, which proved their worth during the May 2025 air war by inflicting significant damage on the Indian fleet.
“Pakistan still welcomes the US offer, as it will enhance the shelf life of its F-16s until 2040,” a diplomatic source said.
The DSCA letter, sent to the Speaker of the House and the chairmen of the relevant congressional committees, concludes that the sale “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States” while ensuring that Pakistan can continue to operate its F-16 fleet safely and effectively.</p><small>2025-12-11 02:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11180155232c72b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959562/tennis-the-goat-of-pak-tennis' target='_blank'><strong>TENNIS: THE GOAT OF PAK TENNIS</strong></a><br><p>On November 29, after playing the doubles final of the ATP Challenger in Islamabad, Aisamul Haq Qureshi called time on his 27-year illustrious professional tennis career. He is arguably the greatest tennis player that Pakistan has ever produced.
The first Pakistani tennis player to hit international headlines was Haroon Rahim in the 1970s, with a highest singles ranking of 34 in 1977. In three of the four Grand Slams, he reached the singles’ second or third round. In the doubles, his best showing in Grand Slams was a quarter-final appearance. It took around three decades for the next tennis star to emerge from Pakistan.
Aisamul Haq, like Rahim from Lahore, was born into a tennis family. His maternal grandfather, Khawaja Iftikhar, is the only one to have reached the top national ranking in both undivided India and, later, Pakistan. Khawaja Iftikhar’s daughter and Aisam’s mother, Nausheen Ehtisham, was ranked as Pakistan’s No 1 woman player for almost 10 years.
Ironically, Aisam didn’t pick up a tennis racket till he was 13 years old. He did indulge in other sports at his school, Crescent Model School, which boasts of multiple sports facilities. But when he picked up the racket, he picked it up really well. 

Aisamul Haq Qureshi, who just retired from professional tennis, is the greatest of tennis players that Pakistan has ever produced. What will the future of the game in the country be like after his bowing out? 

Within four years, he was competing in junior grand slam tournaments. At the age of 18, Aisam was World No 7 and Asia No 1 in the junior rankings. He beat Andy Roddick and David Nalbandian, the future World No 1 and 3, respectively, in the World Super Junior Championships in 1998. In the junior grand slams, his best showing in singles was reaching the third round at Wimbledon in 1998. That year, he figured in the doubles quarter-finals of all four grand slam tournaments.
Also in 1998, he turned professional. It was a long struggle. Devoid of sponsorship, Aisam mainly banked on his family’s support. He first appeared in the Futures (now named ITF World Tennis Tour), the entry-level professional circuit. The following year, he made it into the quarter-finals of his first Challenger tournament, the second tier of professional tennis. 
His ranking improved and, in 2001, he made his debut in a top tier ATP tournament (in the doubles). His first appearance in a Grand Slam arrived the following year (in doubles) at Wimbledon, where he reached the third round. It was in 2004 that Aisam made his maiden singles appearance in an ATP event.
The year 2007 was his annus mirabilis in singles. In June, in the Gerry Weber Open, he defeated World No 11 Richard Gasquet who, three weeks later, reached the Wimbledon semi-final. He qualified for Wimbledon, becoming the first Pakistani in 31 years to play at a Grand Slam singles, and the second to win a match. In the second round, he was defeated by the former world No 1 Marat Safin. He also reached the final qualifying round at the US Open. But an injury forced him to pull out with the match finely poised at one set all. He ended the year with his highest career ranking of 125.
In doubles, 2010 was his most memorable year. With his long-time partner, Rohan Bopanna of India, he created history at the US Open. The 16th-seeded pair, known as the Indo-Pak express, surprised everyone by reaching the final, where they lost 7-6, 7-6 to the Bryan twins, widely acknowledged as the greatest doubles pair. 
It was the first time that a Pakistani had played the final of a Grand Slam. There was a double delight. In the mixed doubles too, the unseeded pair of Aisam and Kveta Peschke (Czech Republic) finished runners-up.   
But what endeared him to everyone was his post-final speech. At the time, Pakistan was suffering from a phase of terrorism worse than that of today. At New York’s Arthur Ashe Stadium, Aisam declared to the crowd, “There’s a very wrong perception about Pakistan being a terrorist country. We are a very friendly, loving and caring people, and we want peace in this world as much as you guys want. May Allah bless us all.”
The Aisam and Rohan pair was awarded the ‘Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year’ award in 2010. The duo also received the 2010 ‘Peace and Sport Image of the Year’ award.
Aisam’s highest doubles ranking was eight and, from 2009 to 2023, he had a streak of playing in 50 grand slams. The government of Pakistan conferred on him the President’s Award for Pride of Performance in 2004 and the Sitara-i-Imtiaz in 2010.
All these years, the national cause remained close to his heart. Aisam played for Pakistan in the Davis Cup throughout, sometimes skipping lucrative pro circuit tournaments. He had stopped entering singles on the pro circuit in 2009 but continued in the Davis Cup. In 2005, Pakistan made it to the World Group play-off for only the second time.
He says he is still available for national duty: “I have played my last match on the professional circuit. But if Pakistan needs me for the Davis Cup, I will be available for doubles.” 
But the nation expects even more from him. Last year, Aisam was elected the president of the Pakistan Tennis Federation. And from the looks of things, he has his sights set on making big strides for the sport in the country.
The ATP Challenger was recently staged in Pakistan for the first time. “Players from 14 countries participated,” points out Aisam. “In his maiden appearance, Muzammil Murtaza reached the second round in singles and the final in doubles. He would get ATP points. That was our goal. More ATP events will be hosted. The ATP points earned will improve players’ rankings, hence enabling them to appear in the pro circuit abroad.”
Even legendary tennis player Bjorn Borg, winner of 11 Grand Slam singles titles, congratulated Aisam on hosting the first-ever ATP Challengers in Pakistan, “It is the start of a new era for Pakistan,” he said.
For now, Aisam’s  main focus is on the juniors. “In 2025, Pakistan hosted five ITF Juniors Tournaments for the first time,” he says. “For next year, Pakistan has been allocated seven ITF Juniors.” It all ties in with Aisam’s vision for promoting tennis in Pakistan.                                     
“When I turned pro, I had no sponsorship,” Aisam points out. “Many of my contemporaries on the junior circuit, hailing from tennis-rich countries, got sponsorship. This enabled them to acquire the services of good coaches and physical fitness experts. It helped them make rapid strides on the pro circuit. My first financial sponsor was when I was 27. I wish promising players of today get patronage at an early stage.”
Ostensibly the biggest initiative to put Pakistan tennis on track was taken much before Aisam assumed the office of the PTF President. The Ace Tennis Initiative was launched in August 2022, under the umbrella of the Haq Foundation, initially run solely by Aisamul Haq’s family. Later, other sponsors joined, including the BARD Foundation, McDonald’s and Servis Industries.
“Ace Tennis conducted a nationwide talent hunt in Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar,” explains Aisam. “Four promising players were selected in each city, 15 boys and one girl. They joined a 12-month programme for customised training and fitness plans for each athlete. It is a sort of conveyor belt, where some players have been dropped from the programme over time, while a few have graduated out due to age. Similarly, players have also been added.” 
The results are very encouraging. The best coming through the Ace initiative have been sent abroad for competitions and have been doing well. Others doing well on the domestic circuit are also being facilitated and encouraged and arrangements have also been made for their training abroad.
Aisam’s efforts have gone beyond bringing glory to Pakistan tennis just by dint of his own sportsmanship. And from the looks of things, it won’t take that long for Pakistan tennis to see the emergence of the next Aisam.
