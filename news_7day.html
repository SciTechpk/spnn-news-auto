The military confrontation between Pakistan and India began a little after 1am on Wednesday with the Indian air strikes when the neighbouring country launched what it termed “Operation Sindoor”. Soon after reports emerged, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) confirmed the strikes, saying that India had carried out the attacks from within its airspace. The military spokesperson provided an updated damage assessment of the scenario at around 4am, reporting the death of eight civilians.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed the downing of two Indian jets around 2:45am after Pakistan launched its swift response, while the confirmation for the third plane, a Rafale aircraft, came an hour later. Confirmation of the fourth and fifth Indian jets being taken down came after 5am by Tarar and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif.

Talking to the media around 7am at the information ministry, Tarar asserted that India had waved a white flag at the Line of Control and “accepted defeat”. The minister said this as footage of a white flag played in the background.
“They have been forced to wave a white flag,” Tarar said. PTV News also shared footage of a white flag hoisted seemingly on top of a structure.

Tarar further said that “several” posts of the Indian army across the border had been destroyed by the armed forces.
He recalled that Pakistan had called for a probe into the Pahalgam attack but India “conducted this attack and then fled from it”. “It is a cause of shame for them that they targeted innocent labourers and citizens,” he added.
According to the minister, Pakistan did not target any civilians in India in its retaliatory actions.

Key highlights:

India launches late-night strikes at sites of Kotli, Bahawalpur, Muridke, Bagh and Muzaffarabad
Eight Pakistanis slain, 35 injured, mosques targeted
Five Indian jets downed in military retaliation
Indian brigade headquarters, Indian checkpost along Line of Control destroyed
Flights on ground put on hold while all inbound, outbound flights diverted to Karachi
National Security Committee meeting summoned at 10am
Trump terms India’s actions a “shame”


In an interview to Bloomberg TV, Defence Minister Asif said that Pakistan has shot down five Indian planes and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles, with checkposts destroyed along the Line of Control.
 






Similarly, appearing on Geo News at 5:09am, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also said that Pakistan had downed five Indian jets.
“[We shot jets down] in Akhnoor, Ambala, Barnala and in Jammu. We also shot down quadcopters and a big drone,” he stated. “It is an ongoing situation, we need to see what India does.”
The military, Reuters reported, said the five Indian fighter jets included three Rafale planes and one each of Russian planes, a Su-30 and MiG-29.
A spokesman for the military told Reuters Indian planes were only targeted after they attacked Pakistan.
There was no word from India on the downing of the jets, which would be the most serious loss for the Indian military in decades and risked further escalation.
The Rafale fighter is a new addition to India’s military, part of a plan to modernise its military, reduce dependence on Russian-origin equipment, and boost domestic weapons production to supply forces deployed along two contentious borders with Pakistan and China.
Before the clash, the Indian Air Force operated 36 Rafale fighters, while the navy’s aircraft fleet mainly comprises Russian MiG-29 jets.
India signed a deal with France’s Dassault Aviation on Monday to buy another 26 Rafale fighter aircraft worth 630 billion rupees ($7.4bn) for its navy in late April.
Tarar earlier said that Pakistan’s military response was ongoing but did not share operational details. “We shot down two Indian planes and we are responding to Indian aggression right now as we speak,” he told British broadcaster Sky News.
“Indian media, in a state of frenzy, is continuously running fabricated stories about losses of Pakistani Air Force and false claims of damaged aircraft,” PTV had said, stating, “No Pakistan Air Force aircraft has sustained any damage.”

The prime minister has summoned a meeting of the National Security Committee at 10am.
In the wake of the attack, Punjab has shut all educational institutions across the province today, and all exams scheduled for today have been postponed, according to a notification from the Punjab Higher Education Department.
“However, examinations scheduled by [or] on behalf of International Examining bodies shall not be affected by this postponement,” the notification said.

The strikes come as tensions have been escalating intensely between the two countries in the wake of a militant attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Last week, Pakistan reinforced its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granted “operational freedom” to his military. The military had warned of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, while diplomatic channels had remained engaged to prevent escalation.
ISPR damage assessment: 4am
In a short press briefing, DG Chaudhry provided the stats from the damage assessment: “A total of 24 impacts have been reported by India, with different weapons, in six localities. In these six localities, eight Pakistanis have been slain, 35 have been injured and two are missing, based on our damage assessment.”

“In [Bahwalpur’s] Ahmedpur East, Subhan mosque was targeted,” he added. “Here, there were four strikes and five innocent Pakistanis were slain, including a three-year-old girl. Thirty-one civilians have been injured, including 25 men and six women.”
He said one mosque was destroyed, while four quarters in which people were living were also destroyed.
“In Muzaffarabad, Bilal mosque was targeted. There were seven impacts, in which one girl has been injured and a mosque was destroyed,” the DG ISPR said.
“In Kotli, Abbat Mosque was targeted. There were five impacts and two people died, including a 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy. A woman and her daughter are both injured,” DG Chaudhry added.
“In Muridke, Umalkura Mosque was targeted and there were four strikes. One man has been slain, while another is injured. Two people are missing,” he said. “A mosque has been destroyed and potters have sustained economic damages,” DG Chaudhry added.
“In Sialkot district, in the village of Kotki Lohara, there were two strikes,” he added. “One missile misfired, while one fell in an open field. There was no damage.”
“Near Shakargarh, there were two strikes with no damage. There was minor damage to a dispensary,” he added.

The DG ISPR said that the “unprovoked, cowardly attack” will be met with a befitting response. “We are giving it and will continue to give it,” he said.
A statement by state broadcaster PTV News, quoting security sources, said: “Pakistani forces are giving a befitting reply to Indian aggression. According to initial reports, the Pakistan Air Force has shot down two enemy aircraft. All Pakistani Air Force aircraft are safe. Pakistan armed forces are giving a befitting reply to the enemy’s aggression.”

PTV reported that Pakistan had also destroyed an Indian brigade headquarters in a retaliatory strike. It did not specify the location of the retaliatory strike.
A post from the broadcaster said that India is being given a “befitting response” at multiple locations.

PTV additionally reported that an Indian checkpost in the Dudhnial sector along the Line of Control was destroyed in a missile strike.
“Pak forces are responding to the naked aggression of the enemy,” the broadcaster said, citing security sources.

Appearing on British broadcaster Sky News around 2:45am, Tarar said Pakistan’s response is ongoing, but did not share operational details.
When asked about the potential for escalation, Tarar said it “is an evolving situation”.
He reiterated that Pakistan was expecting an attack by India and said that “they would be the aggressor”.
“We offered an investigation into the whole Pahalgam episode, we wanted a fair and transparent investigation. But … India, without evidence, has targeted civilians, women and children. India had no right to do that,” he added.
“As the minister for information, I have occupied a seat of responsibility,” Tarar said. “I have taken an oath and I will give you verified information.”
When asked why India blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack, Tarar replied: “This area (Pahalgam) is a good 200km from the LoC. The FIR was filed in 10 minutes, but police arrived after one and a half hours.”
Tarar accused India of “running away” from an investigation into the Pahalgam attack and accused India’s governing party of “wanting a reason to attack Pakistan”.
“We have a high morale and we will respond to Indian aggression,” he said.
“India has no evidence whatsoever to link Pakistan to this incident,” he stressed. “India has attacked civilians … without any justifiable cause and because we have the right to self-defence, we will defend our country, we will respond.”
Questioned about terrorists found hiding in Pakistan in the past, including Al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden, Tarar rejected the allegations and reiterated that Pakistan was facing terrorist attacks “every second week”.
“If you’re talking about the history — the Soviet invasion, the cold war — then that’s a different story,” he said.
Tarar also maintained that the US had thanked Pakistan for its efforts in the war against terrorism and “for the good fight we are fighting”.
“India will now face Pakistan’s very fierce response, because we are never the aggressors,” he said.
Referring to Pahalgam, Tarar said India “is questioning its own government”.
“They have no evidence, they have no facts and they ran away from the investigation which Pakistan had offered,” the minister added. They attacked our civilians, they attacked our mosque today, they attacked five localities. Pakistan will now respond and will respond very, very effectively.
“Our desire for peace should not be mistaken for weakness,” he said.
When asked about India’s strikes, Tarar said that no terrorist infrastructure was hit.
“When I took foreign and local journalists to a village near the LoC … tomorrow morning, I was planning to take them to Bahawalpur and Muridke to show them where the strikes have occurred, to show that the local population is living there.
“We totally deny India’s allegations regarding terrorists,” Tarar maintained. “We have complete evidence that women and children have been targeted, there are civilian casualties in this and we will bring the evidence to foreign and local media. There are no terrorist camps.”
Questioned about the possibility of de-escalation, Tarar said that the situation is ongoing, adding, “let’s see how it turns out”.
Speaking to ARY News at 1:06am about the initial details of the attack, DG Chaudhry said: “All of our air force jets are airborne. This cowardly and shameful attack was carried out from within India’s airspace. They were never allowed to come and intrude into the space of Pakistan.”
He noted: “Let me say it unequivocally: Pakistan will respond to this at a time and place of its own choosing. This heinous provocation will not go unanswered.”
“This temporary happiness that India has achieved with this cowardly attack will be replaced with enduring grief.”

Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told ARY News that civilian areas were attacked.
“The attacks were carried out on civilian areas,” Asif said, adding that the “cowards” attacked from their own airspace. “They never left their house. Let them come out, we will respond fittingly.”
When asked about Pakistan’s decisions, Asif replied that Pakistan will retaliate.
“We will give a far greater response than their own strike,” the minister said. “Not only did they attack civilians but they did it from their own airspace.”
On Geo News, Asif clarified that the strikes were launched from within India’s airspace.
“Women and children have been martyred in civilian areas. India is claiming it was targeting terrorist camps,” he said. “There is no such thing, international media can visit the targets so that India’s lies are exposed. We are offering international media to come wherever attacks have happened.”
The defence minister further said: “They don’t have the courage to attack us in our airspace, and they are firing on women and children. Mosques have been destroyed.”
He vowed that “we will give a befitting response,” he said. “They will immediately receive their due.”
Multiple loud explosions were heard in Azad Jammu and Kashmir close to the mountains around the city of Muzaffarabad after midnight, multiple Reuters witnesses said.
After the explosions, the city’s power was blacked out, the witnesses said.

Confirming the development, the Indian government said: “A little while ago, the Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor” and hit infrastructure in Pakistan and AJK from which it alleged “terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed”.
“Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution,” it said in the statement.
‘Cowardly attack’
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the “cowardly attack”, stating that Pakistan “reserves the right to respond forcefully to this warlike act imposed by India”.
“The deceitful enemy has carried out a cowardly attack on five locations in Pakistan,” the PM wrote. “Pakistan fully reserves the right to respond forcefully to this warlike act imposed by India, and a robust response is being given.
“The entire nation stands with the Pakistan Armed Forces, and the morale and spirit of the entire Pakistani nation are high. The Pakistani nation and the Pakistan Armed Forces know well how to deal with the enemy,” he added.
“We will never allow the enemy to succeed in its nefarious objectives.”

In another post on X at 4am, the PM wrote, “The treacherous enemy has launched a cowardly attack on five locations within Pakistan. This heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished.
“Pakistan reserves the absolute right to respond decisively to this unprovoked Indian attack — a resolute response is already underway,” he wrote, adding that the entire nation stands united behind its armed forces, and morale and resolve “remain unshaken”.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the brave officers and soldiers of Pakistan,” the PM added. “The people of Pakistan and its forces are fully prepared to confront and defeat any threat with our strength and determination. The enemy will never be allowed to achieve its malicious aims.”
 






A statement from the presidency said President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned India’s cross-border aggression against Pakistan that targeted the civilian population.
“Pakistan will give a befitting reply to Indian aggression. Indian provocation will be countered with full force and unwavering resolve to protect Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
“Targeting civilian areas, unprovoked Indian attack is a clear violation of international law, UN Charter and Pakistan’s sovereignty. The entire Pakistani nation is united behind its brave armed forces.
“India’s cowardly actions expose the true face of a fascist regime. The Indian government is ready to put regional peace and security at stake to advance its political agenda,” the president said.
He said Pakistan’s armed forces were fully prepared and capable of defending every inch of the motherland.
 






In a post on X, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar strongly condemned the attacks, accusing India of “jeopardising regional peace”.
“Pakistan strongly condemns India’s aggression, which is [a] flagrant violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty, the UN Charter and international law,” he wrote. “Pakistan reserves the right to respond as per Article 51 of the UN Charter. We will protect our sovereignty & territorial integrity by all means.”
 






“Pakistan must launch an immediate strong counter strike against India. We have to teach India and fascist Modi a lesson India will never forget. It is imperative that PM Imran Khan is released from Adiala because he is the single person who can unify the country,” demanded Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub.
 






The Foreign Office said that in an unprovoked and blatant act of war, the Indian Air Force, while remaining within Indian airspace, violated Pakistan’s sovereignty using standoff weapons, targeting the civilian population across international border in Muridke and Bahawalpur, and across Line of Control in Kotli and Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
“India’s act of aggression has resulted in martyrdom of civilians, including women and children. This act of aggression has also caused grave threat to commercial air traffic.
“We strongly condemn India’s cowardly action, which is a flagrant violation of the UN Charter, international law, and established norms of inter-state relations.
In the wake of Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace and security. India’s reckless action has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict.“
The FO said the situation continues to evolve and Pakistan reserves the right to respond appropriately at a time and place of its choosing, in accordance with the Article-51 of the UN Charter, and as enshrined in international law.
“The government, armed forces and people of Pakistan stand united in the face of Indian aggression. They will always act with iron resolve to protect and preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan.”
“We the people of Pakistan stand together as a nation against this ugly, senseless, foolish Indian aggression. We are shoulder to shoulder with our fighting forces and will defend our homeland against this cowardly Indian attack,” said former president Arif Alvi.
 






Former FM and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said: “I strongly condemn India’s cowardly attack on Pakistani territory and civilian targets. Such acts of aggression will not go unanswered. Pakistan’s brave armed forces, including our valiant Air Force, are responding with resolve. Any misadventure will be met with full force. Pakistan stands united.”
 






He said India’s “cowardly and unprovoked attacks on civilian targets” were acts of war. “The targeting of innocent women and children is not strength, it is savagery. Pakistan’s armed forces, backed by an unbreakable nation, are responding with full force. Every aggression will be crushed. We will not tolerate violations of our sovereignty. Pakistan is united, defiant, and ready.”
 






When asked by reporters at the White House about the strikes, US President Donald Trump called India’s actions a “shame”.
“It’s a shame we just heard about it … I guess people knew something was going to happen, based on a little bit of the past. They’ve been fighting for a long time,” he said. “They’ve been fighting for many decades … I just hope it ends very quickly.”
 






Meanwhile, the White House said Rubio has spoken with his counterparts from India and Pakistan, encouraging both sides to engage in discussions to settle the escalating military confrontation.
“He is encouraging India and Pakistan to re-open a channel between their leadership to defuse the situation and prevent further escalation,” said US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes in a statement.
Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval briefed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio shortly after New Delhi’s strikes, the Indian embassy in Washington said.
Rubio later posted on X that he was “monitoring the situation between India and Pakistan closely”. He echoed Trump’s comments earlier today that this hopefully ends quickly and will continue to engage both Indian and Pakistani leadership towards a peaceful resolution,“ he said.
 






United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres was very concerned about Indian military operations in Pakistan and AJK, his spokesperson said, while calling for maximum military restraint from both the countries.
“The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan.”
United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed called on India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, de-escalate tensions and avoid further escalation that threatens regional and international peace, the Emirati state news agency WAM reported early on Wednesday.
The minister stressed the importance of heeding the voices calling for dialogue and mutual understanding to prevent military escalation, strengthen stability in South Asia, and avoid further regional tensions, WAM added.
According to the Foreign Office, Turkish FM Hakan Fidan called Dar to express Turkiye’s solidarity with Pakistan “against India’s unprovoked aggression violating Pakistan’s sovereignty and killing innocent civilians”.
“He (Fidan) expressed concern over the deteriorating regional security situation. Both leaders agreed to remain in close coordination on the evolving situation,” the FO wrote in a post on X.
 






The FO said that on Dar’s direction, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York has informed the UN Security Council of India’s open aggression and threats to international peace and security.
Michael Kugelman, an expert on Washington’s relations with South Asian nations, noted: “India’s strike on Pakistan is of much greater scale than the one in 2019.
“Pakistan’s response, which according to many reports included downing several Indian jets, has also exceeded the scale of 2019.  They’re already higher up the escalatory ladder than any time in [the] 2019 crisis,” he added.

Pakistan airspace closed as of now following Indian strikes: sources
Meanwhile, sources in the Civil Aviation Authority said Pakistan’s airspace was to be completely closed and the Islamabad International Airport was closed for flights, with all flights diverted to Karachi airport.
The sources said the airspace was initially closed for 48 hours and all flights were cancelled, with passengers advised to return home.
“Major change in air routes in the region. All foreign flights rerouted to Pakistani airspace. Foreign flights leave Pakistani airspace and head towards the Arabian Sea. Flights withdrawn from Pak-India airspace, new route to the Arabian Sea adopted. International flights away from Pakistani airspace,” the sources said.
British news outlet The Guardian quoted Pakistan International Airlines as saying that all domestic and international flights on the ground have been put on hold while all inbound and outbound flights are being diverted to Karachi.
“Authorities have advised passengers not to come to the airport and to return home,” it reported.
The Flight Radar 24 online tracker showed that international flights to Karachi were still scheduled.
Meanwhile, the British Foreign Office issued a travel advisory advising against all but essential travel to Pakistan.
Qatar Airways temporarily suspended flights to Pakistan.
 






Ready at any time: Khawaja Asif
Earlier, Asif said that a clash with India “can happen anytime” amid the ongoing tensions between the two countries in the wake of a militant attack in occupied Kashmir.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) earlier in the day, where he was briefed on the country’s preparation for a “conventional threat”. Asif was also part of the visit.
Speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ on the briefings in the ISI HQ, the defence minister reiterated that he had already said before that a clash with India was imminent.
“That is still imminent today and can happen anytime,” he said, adding that a confrontation could be “one of the choice” India could want to adopt but “we have developed a countermeasure for every choice, whether that is a surgical strike or ground attack or air attack or naval engagement.
“We are ready for them everywhere at all times.”
He said the “crux” of today’s briefing was that “every kind of incursion or attack is being expected from them.”
Asif added that the briefing also delved into Pakistan’s strategy for responding to any situation.
 


Questioned about the chance of an ambush on a large scale, the minister said such actions were always taken on a small scale and added that he did not see any possibility of a big ambush or movement since it was detected immediately.
“We are continuously monitoring them,” he said, referring to Indian activities on the border. “Everything is in our watch. It is not the matter that they’re doing something hidden, which will cause an ambush.”
Asif said Pakistan’s preparation was complete and the government would not sit idly by. “A befitting response will be given to them at every level the moment they make a move.”
Meanwhile, the United States on Tuesday again called for calm between India and Pakistan, after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned of stopping water from flowing across borders.
“We continue to urge Pakistan and India to work towards a responsible resolution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters.
She did not comment on Modi’s latest comments but said that the US was “aware of various reports” on the situation and was “engaged”. “We remain in touch with the governments of both countries at multiple levels,” she said.
 


Pakistan has also taken the matter to the United Nations Security Council, which was briefed on the country’s stance on the Pahalgam attack and India’s “unsubstantiated” allegations.
In the latest moves by the two nuclear-armed nations, the Civil Defence in Rawalpindi has activated its 14 posts in the garrison city while all states in India were set to conduct mock drills for “effective civil defence”.
PM Shehbaz briefed on country’s preparations during visit to ISI HQ
PM Shehbaz’s visit to the ISI HQ in Islamabad entailed a detailed briefing on the prevailing security environment, “with a particular focus on preparedness for [a] conventional threat in the light of India’s increasingly aggressive and provocative posture along Pakistan’s eastern border”, a statement from the PM Office (PMO) said.

“The leadership was apprised of regional security developments and the evolving threat matrix, including conventional military options, hybrid warfare tactics and terrorist proxies,” it added.
The premier was accompanied by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Asif and the services chiefs, the PMO said.
The services chiefs — Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar — were part of the visiting team, according to a group photo released on the occasion.
The picture also showed ISI Director General Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik — who was recently appointed as the country’s national security adviser — and the military’s media spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, present there.
 
 

PM Shehbaz and the accompanying dignitaries “underscored the imperative of heightened national vigilance, seamless inter-agency coordination, and reinforced operational readiness to deter and decisively respond to any violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, the PMO said.
Commending the ISI’s “professionalism and strategic acumen”, the prime minister lauded its “critical role in safeguarding national interests and enabling informed national security decision-making under complex and dynamic conditions”.
“Pakistan Army is one of the most professional and disciplined force in the world,” the premier was quoted as saying. He reaffirmed that the entire nation was standing with “our brave armed forces”.
“The leadership reaffirmed Pakistan’s unambiguous resolve to defend the homeland against all threats — conventional or otherwise,” the statement read.
The leaders reiterated that with the nation’s full support, the armed forces, supported by all other elements of national power and state institutions, remained “fully prepared to uphold Pakistan’s security, prestige, and honour under all circumstances”.
PM Shehbaz also visited the newly established National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre (Niftac) and formally inaugurated its state-of-the-art headquarters, “which will serve as the central node for coordinating Pakistan’s national counterterrorism strategy”, the PMO said.
“Niftac, a federal institution, integrates over 50 relevant federal and provincial departments and agencies into a unified intelligence and threat management architecture supported by a centralised national database.”
The statement added that at the subnational level, Niftac is linked to six Provincial Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centres (Piftacs), including those in AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan, ensuring seamless coordination from the federation to the provinces.
Commending the efforts of all stakeholders involved in operationalising this vital capability, the prime minister described Niftac as a quintessential national platform for collaborative threat assessment and response. He underscored that “dismantling the nexus between terrorism, illicit networks, and external sponsorship requires robust and efficient institutional mechanisms.”
PM Shehbaz said Niftac would play a pivotal role in uprooting terrorism and its support structures from the country.
Modi vows to stop waters key to Pakistan
Meanwhile, Modi said that water from India that once flowed across borders would be stopped.
Modi did not mention Pakistan specifically, but his speech comes after New Delhi suspended its part of the 65-year-old Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs water critical for consumption and agriculture.
“India’s water used to go outside, now it will flow for India”, Modi said in a speech in New Delhi. “India’s water will be stopped for India’s interests, and it will be utilised for India.”
Pakistan has warned that tampering with its rivers would be considered “an act of war”.
However, experts also pointed out that India’s existing dams do not have the capacity to block or divert water and can only regulate the timing of when they release flows.
Islamabad accused India of altering the flow of the Chenab River, one of three rivers placed under Pakistan’s control according to the IWT.
“We have witnessed changes in the river (Chenab) which are not natural at all,” Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Pirzada told AFP.
“The majority impact will be felt in areas which have fewer alternate water routes,” Pirzada warned.
“One day the river had normal inflow and the next day it was greatly reduced,” Pirzada added.
In AJK, large quantities of water from India were reportedly released on April 26, according to the Jinnah Institute.
“This is being done so that we don’t get to utilise the water,” Pirzada added.
Afghan FM hails Pakistan’s steps to ease trade, travel amid tensions with India
On Tuesday, the FO Dar held a telephonic conversation with Afghan Acting FM Amir Khan Muttaqi who “appreciated Pakistan’s proactive steps to ease trade and facilitate travel”, amid rising tensions with India.
It added that Muttaqi extended an invitation to Dar to visit Afghanistan again. “He conveyed prayers and best wishes for the government and people of Pakistan,” the FO said.
Dar also briefed his Afghan counterpart on recent provocation and “illegal and unilateral measures” by India against Pakistan, reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to peace and safeguarding its sovereignty.
Both leaders expressed satisfaction with the pace of progress made by the two sides in bilateral relations since the deputy PM’s visit to Afghanistan on April 19, with a focus on trade, connectivity, economic cooperation, people-to-people contacts and reactivating political consultative mechanisms.
The two sides also agreed on the importance of maintaining high-level contacts for fostering long-term cooperation to promote peace and security in the region and beyond, the statement concluded.

He was the first world leader to react to the tense situation after India carried out strikes inside Pakistan which also retaliated and reportedly shot down Indian jets.
“It’s a shame. We just heard about it as we were walking in the doors of the Oval [Office],” he said inside the White House after overseeing the swearing-in ceremony for his special envoy, Steve Witkoff.
 
 

“I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They’ve been fighting for a long time,” the US president added.
“I hope it ends very quickly.”
In a statement, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for restraint from both countries, Associated Press  reported.
“The Secretary-General is very concerned about the Indian military  operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls  for maximum military restraint from both countries. The world cannot  afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,” said  the statement.
The US State Department also said it is “closely monitoring developments,” CNN reported.
“We are aware of the reports, however we have no assessment to offer at this time,” the spokesperson said. “This remains an evolving situation,and we are closely monitoring developments.”

The increased activity of armed groups within Pakistan since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 remains a common source of tensions between the two neighbours. Pakistan maintains that these armed groups operate from within Afghan soil, a claim that Afghan officials have denied, maintaining that no one can use Afghan soil against any country.
Last month, FM Dar had said Pakistan and Afghanistan had assured each other that they would not allow nefarious elements to use their soil to conduct attacks or illicit activities against the other, adding that both countries would be responsible for taking appropriate action in such a case.
 
 

Dar’s interactions with the Afghan Taliban leadership were quite cordial, with promises from both sides to improve ties and address the irritants standing in the way of better relations.
However, Ambassador Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, said while speaking at a seminar titled “Pak-Afghan Relations under the Shadow of Terrorism”, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, that the “Afghan Taliban government could not resolve Pakistan’s concerns regarding outlawed TTP till now.”
He added: “It seems that there is a difference of opinion in Afghanistan on this issue.”
Sadiq said the TTP was a challenge. “It is not just a challenge for Pakistan. TTP is damaging Pak-Afghan relations. Many people in Afghanistan are aware of this fact,” he added.
“There was a time when we could have solved the TTP problem after Zarb-i-Azb,” Sadiq said, referring to the major operation conducted against the TTP, other Pakistani and foreign militant groups in North Waziristan in June 2014.
“At that time, some went across the border [into Afghanistan], some turned into sleeper cells here in Pakistan.”
He said the issue of the TTP could have been discussed in the Doha peace talks between the United States and the Afghan Taliban, but it was not addressed at the time.
“The Afghan Taliban are in control of every place in Afghan cities, villages and towns, but it seems they are not tired of the war yet.
“There are different opinions among different classes and regions in Afghanistan. The TTP participated in the Afghan Taliban’s war against the United States. This included supplying suicide bombers with all kinds of assistance. The Afghan interim government says that it is afraid that if it takes action against the TTP, they will join IS (Islamic State),” Sadiq said.
The ambassador said there were examples of suicide bombers being trained in camps and then sold to another group.
“Members of the Afghan Taliban also join the TTP, IS and other groups,” he said.
He recalled that the government of Ashraf Ghani in 2019 had declared TTP as a threat to Afghanistan in the country’s first National Security Police and had arrested a number of TTP commanders.
“Afghanistan had at that time reached the conclusion that the TTP is a threat to its security.”
In a post on X, he said he had emphasised the importance of strengthening Pakistan-Afghanistan relations to address security concerns and promote regional stability and economic development.
Last month, security forces had killed 54 terrorists attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations, this was the highest-ever number of terrorists killed by security forces in a single engagement throughout the campaign against terrorism.
Security forces had later killed 17 more terrorists in North Waziristan district near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.</p><small>2025-05-06 19:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/062154580af2b0a.jpg?r=215525' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908839/israel-hits-yemens-main-sanaa-airport-in-airstrike-against-houthis' target='_blank'><strong>Israel hits Yemen’s main Sanaa airport in airstrike against Houthis</strong></a><br><p>The Israeli military carried out an airstrike on Yemen’s main airport in Sanaa on Tuesday, its second attack in two days on Houthi fighters after a surge in tensions between the group and Israel.
Three people were killed in the strike, according to Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV.
Israel warned people to leave the area around Sanaa International Airport before Tuesday’s attack, which it said targeted Houthi infrastructure and “fully disabled the airport”. Witnesses later reported four strikes in the capital.
Tensions have been high since the Gaza conflict began, but have risen further since a Houthi missile landed near Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport on Sunday, prompting Israeli airstrikes on Yemen’s Hodeidah port on Monday.
“A short while ago, IDF (Israel Defence Forces) fighter jets struck and dismantled Houthi terrorist infrastructure at the main airport in Sanaa, fully disabling the airport,” the Israeli military said.
“The strike was carried out in response to the attack launched by the Houthi terrorist regime against Ben Gurion Airport. Flight runways, aircraft, and infrastructure at the airport were struck.”
Three airport sources told Reuters that the strikes targeted three civilian aeroplanes, the departures hall, the airport runway and a military air base under Houthi control.
The Israeli military said the airport had been “a central hub for the Houthi terrorist regime to transfer weapons and operatives”.
In a statement carried by al-Masirah, the Houthis said: “The operations of our armed forces will continue and the support by Yemen to Palestine will only end with the end of the aggression and siege against Gaza.”
The United Nations Special Envoy to Yemen Hans Grundberg said on X that the latest hostilities “mark a grave escalation in an already fragile and volatile regional context”.
 


An official at Yemen’s flag carrier Yemenia Airways told Reuters that three of its aircraft were destroyed according to an initial assessment.
Separately, President Donald Trump said the US would stop bombing the Houthis after the group agreed to stop interrupting important shipping lanes in the Middle East.
In an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump announced that the Houthis no longer want to fight but did not elaborate on the message.
“They said please don’t bomb us any more and we’re not going to attack your ships,” Trump said.
There was no immediate response from the Houthis.
The US president said Washington would take the Houthis’ word that they would not be blowing up ships any longer.
‘Axis of resistance’
The Houthis have been firing at Israel and at shipping in the Red Sea since Israel began its military offensive against Hamas in Gaza after the group’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.
The Houthis say they are doing so in solidarity with the Palestinians and have pressed on with attacks in response to Israel expanding its military operations in the Gaza Strip.
The Houthis said on Sunday they would impose a “comprehensive” aerial blockade on Israel by repeatedly targeting its airports.
Sixty per cent of Yemenis live under the control of the Houthis, a resilient group that withstood years of Saudi-led bombing during the country’s devastating civil war.
The Houthis are part of Iran’s “Axis of Resistance” against Israeli and US interests in the Middle East, which also includes Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah.
While Israel has weakened those groups by assassinating top leaders and destroying military infrastructure since the Gaza conflict began, the Houthis are still a force to be reckoned with.
The Israeli strikes around Hodeidah on Monday killed four people and wounded 39, the Houthi-run health ministry said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had vowed to retaliate after the missile launched by the Houthis landed near Ben Gurion Airport and led to European and US airlines cancelling flights.</p><small>2025-05-06 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/06141036d15beb3.jpg?r=141056' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908804/pakistans-resolve-is-to-fight-for-freedom-not-conflict-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s resolve is to fight for freedom, not conflict: Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday said that Pakistan’s resolve to fight was for freedom and not for conflict, amid the growing tensions with India in the wake of a militant attack in occupied Kashmir.
An attack on April 22 in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
Speaking during the National Assembly session today, Bilawal said, “Pakistan had no hand in that crime. We do not export terror, we are the victims of terrorism.”
He refuted India’s claims on fighting against terrorism, saying, “How can you fight terrorism while practicing state terrorism in Kashmir?”
He said that Pakistan was suffering from “foreign-sponsored, ideologically driven, and brutally indiscriminate” terrorism. “We have buried our soldiers and school children … We have fought the menace with not only arms but with ideas, education, economic reforms and unity.”
Bilawal continued, “Terrorism cannot be defeated by a tank alone, it must be defeated with justice. It cannot be uprooted by bullets, it must be disarmed with hope. It cannot be defeated by demonising nations but by addressing the grievances that give it birth.”
He called on India and Pakistan to work together, stating, “The prime minister’s challenge to India for an impartial investigation is a start.
“Why would a true victim of terror shy away from accountability? Unless they are worried that the real blame for the bloodshed in Kashmir lies in Delhi and not in Islamabad.”

The PPP leader further said, “If India wishes to walk the path of peace, let them come with open hands and not clenched fists. Let them come with facts and not fabrication. Let us sit as neighbours and speak the truth.
“If they do not … then let them remember that the people of Pakistan are not made to kneel. The people of Pakistan have a resolve to fight, not because we love conflict, but because we love freedom.”
He said, “Let India decide. Will it be dialogue or destruction? Cooperation or confrontation?”
 
 

A day earlier, the NA unanimously passed a resolution condemning India’s unlawful and unilateral declaration to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in blatant violation of the treaty.
The resolution said that the killing of innocent civilians was contrary to the values upheld by Pakistan, and the NA rejected all “frivolous and baseless attempts” to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam attack.
The lawmakers condemned the “orchestrated and mala fide campaign” by the Indian government to malign Pakistan, which “follows a familiar pattern of exploiting the issue of terrorism for a narrow political goal”.
India’s accusations ‘excuse’ to further suppress Kashmiris: Amir Muqam
Amir Muqam, federal minister for Gilgit Baltistan and Kashmir Affairs and States and Frontier Regions, said that India’s allegations against Pakistan were an “excuse” to further suppress those in occupied Kashmir.
“[Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi thought he could throw accusations, giving him an excuse to further suppress the people of Kashmir, and prevent Pakistan from providing them with moral, political and diplomatic support.”
“We are one nation and stand with the Pakistan army,” he affirmed, adding that Modi made accusations against Pakistan to “hide his own weaknesses”.
He praised the nation’s passion, stating, “Every one of us [Pakistani] is a soldier. They (India) would have to fight everyone.”
The minister reiterated the offer for a transparent investigation into the incident, adding, “India has not responded to this.”
“The whole world can see now India’s accusations have no truth,” he added.
Tarar says ‘This is one opportunity where we speak with one voice’
Taking the floor, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Kashmiris still identified their loyalty with Pakistan even as the country’s politicians were bogged down in internal squabbling. “This is one opportunity where we speak with one voice,” he stressed.
He spoke about incarcerated PTI leader Imran Khan, stating that “at this time, Imran Khan is as good as his own leadership [PML-N],” and urged against internal divisions amid rising tensions with India.
He called the Pahlgham incident a “false flag operation” and a “security and intelligence” failure of India.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

He questioned the credibility of India’s claims of Pakistan being involved as the first information report of the incident was filed “at the behest of masters “10 minutes after the attack even though the police reached the site of the attack 1.5 hours later”.
He referred to international media like Al Jazeera, the Economist, and New York Times claiming that “India has no evidence to link Pakistan to this incident”.
Tarar said that the Pahalgham attack is the only opportunity where we should put forward a “united voice”.
He added that “Kashmir is Pakistan’s jugular vein” and claimed that India is trying to divert the world’s attention from the Kashmir issue by blaming Pakistan for Pahalgham.
He said India should be ashamed of a blaming a country which is a “frontline state against terrorists” and is serving as “a wall between the world and terrorists”.
“We are victims of terrorism, we fight against it, and then you blame us for terrorism?” he asked.
The information minister also said the Pakistani nation has always delivered a crushing defeat to the enemy. He said, “we are not aggressors, but if the enemy resorted to any misadventure, it will face such a response from our armed forces that its generations to come will remember it,” Radio Pakistan reported.</p><small>2025-05-06 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/062055211f70ad4.jpg?r=205929' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908836/conservative-merz-elected-german-chancellor-after-initial-debacle' target='_blank'><strong>Conservative Merz elected German chancellor after initial debacle</strong></a><br><p>German conservative leader Friedrich Merz was elected chancellor by parliament on Tuesday in a second round of voting after a humiliating and unprecedented defeat on the first attempt, getting his coalition government off to a weak start.
Merz, 69, who led his conservatives to a federal election victory in February and has signed a coalition deal with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), won 325 votes, nine more than needed for an absolute majority, in the secret ballot.
He had secured just 310 votes in the first round of voting, meaning at least 18 coalition lawmakers failed to back him.
After the vote, he headed to the nearby Bellevue Palace to be formally nominated by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Later, he will return to the historic Reichstag building in the heart of Berlin to take the oath of office to become Germany’s 10th chancellor since the end of World War Two.
Merz is under heavy pressure to show German leadership after the implosion last November of outgoing SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s three-way coalition left a political vacuum at the heart of Europe, even as it faced a myriad of crises.
“People have been asking Germany to lead for a long time, and there is no more space to not heed that call,” said Sudha David-Wilp of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.
“Everything that had been undergirding post-war Germany in the past eight decades is no longer the case, whether it be open markets and free trade, whether it be the US security presence in Europe.”
A global trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump’s sweeping import tariffs is threatening a third year of downturn in Europe’s largest economy, which has already had to grapple with the end of cheap Russian gas since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and growing rivalry from China.
Meanwhile, Trump has threatened not to come to the aid of the Nato alliance, prompting even transatlanticist Merz to question the reliability of the US as a top security ally and urge Europe to improve its ability to defend itself.
The German coalition deal has mapped out plans to revive growth, such as reducing a corporate tax and lowering energy prices. It also vows strong support for Ukraine and higher military spending.
Embarrassing start
But Merz’s failure to win backing for his chancellorship at the first attempt is a first for post-war Germany and an embarrassment for a man who has promised to restore German leadership on the world stage.
“The whole of Europe looked to Berlin today in the hope that Germany would reassert itself as an anchor of stability and a pro-European powerhouse,” said Jana Puglierin, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations think-tank.
“That hope has been dashed. With consequences way beyond our borders.”
Party insiders said on Monday he would swiftly secure a majority despite grumbling in both coalition parties about cabinet nominations, policy compromises and a huge borrowing package pushed through the old parliament in its final days.
“This shows that the coalition is not united, which could weaken his ability to pursue policies,” said Holger Schmieding, Chief Economist at Berenberg in London.
The only winner of Tuesday’s debacle is the far-right, anti-establishment Alternative for Germany, which came second in February and has topped some recent surveys, said Forsa pollster Manfred Guellner.
“Trust in political institutions is being further damaged,” he said.
The two coalition parties have lost support since their already dismal performances in February, especially the conservatives, due in part to frustration with Merz’s decision to loosen borrowing limits, despite campaign promises of fiscal rectitude.
“The failed vote is clearly a sign that not everyone in the CDU agrees with the fiscal U-turn,” said Carsten Brzeski, Global Head of Macro at ING Research.
The abrasive and erratic style of Merz, who has never held government office, has also failed to convince some that he is chancellor material.
“The relationship between the parties will be severely damaged because of this and [it will] exacerbate the conflicts that are already bubbling beneath the surface,” said Philipp Koeker, political scientist at the University of Hanover.</p><small>2025-05-06 15:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0614332387779e4.png?r=210904' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908809/two-judges-object-as-sc-accepts-review-pleas-on-reserved-seats-for-hearing' target='_blank'><strong>Two judges object as SC accepts review pleas on reserved seats for hearing</strong></a><br><p>As the constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Monday took up a set of review pleas against the top court’s ruling that had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats, two judges declared the petitions as inadmissible.
In its July 12, 2024 short order, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a list of 80 MNAs were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the single largest party in the National Assembly.
However, the ruling had not been implemented by the National Assembly, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some objections. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the PML-N, the PPP and the ECP.
 
 

As the full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan took up the review pleas today, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi objected to them, declaring the applications as inadmissible.
The other 10 members of the bench were Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Salahuddin Panhwar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi.
Five of the eight judges who ruled in PTI’s favour — namely senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Shahid Waheed and Justice Irfan Saadat Khan — are not part of the CB.
While Justices Mazhar, Ayesha and Rizvi were part of that majority verdict, Justices Aminuddin and Afghan had rejected the PTI’s pleas, denying it the reserved seats.
According to a cause list issued by the SC, the review pleas included three filed by the PML-N, including one by its leader Huma Akhtar Chughtai, as well two each from the PPP and the ECP.
Barrister Haris Azmat appeared as the counsel for the PML-N while Sikandar Bashir Mohmand was present on behalf of the ECP.
During the hearing, judges of the apex court repeatedly questioned the ECP lawyer about the electoral watchdog not implementing the July 12 verdict.
While the CB formally accepted the review petitions for hearing, Justices Ayesha and Abbasi dissented with the majority decision, objecting to the maintainability of the pleas.
With a split majority of 11-2, the bench issued notices to the parties in the case and adjourned the hearing till tomorrow (Wednesday).
It also stated that a contempt plea filed by PTI’s Kanwal Shauzab against the ECP for not implementing the SC’s July 12 ruling would be clubbed with the review pleas.
 
 

In its review application, the ECP submitted that the July 12 short order was based on the law that has since been altered by the amendments made to Sections 66 and 104 of the Elections Act and a new section, namely 104-A, has also been inserted with retrospective effect.
It requested the SC to revisit its judgement in the reserved seat case that granted relief to the PTI, saying it was neither a political party nor individuals claiming to be its candidates had ever approached the ECP, Peshawar High Court or the apex court to claim the reserved seats.
In its detailed verdict on the reserved seats case, which was authored by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, the SC had observed that the
ECP’s numerous “unlawful acts and omissions” had “caused confusion and prejudice to PTI, its candidates and the electorate who voted for PTI”.
It had also castigated the ECP for failing to fulfil its “role as a guarantor institution and impartial steward” of electoral processes.
On Sept 14, 2024 — the day the government was supposed to lay the 26th Amendment in both Houses of the parliament but could not — the Supreme Court, through a clarification, had reprimanded the ECP for not implementing its July 12 ruling in the reserved seats case.
Later on October 18, in yet another clarification, Justice Shah reiterated that the effect of an amendment made in the Elections Act 2017 in August last year could not undo the reserved seats case verdict.
 
 

The bill, titled “Elections (Second Amendment) Act, 2024”, was seen as aimed at circumventing the apex court’s verdict on the reserved seats case by barring independent lawmakers from joining a political party after a stipulated period.
A six-judge CB of the apex court was set to take up the PTI’s petition challenging those tweaks to the election laws in December 2024. A separate plea of the PTI against the Jan 13, 2024 ruling denying it its election symbol is also pending before the SC.
The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, PML-N lawyer Azmat contended that the reserved seats were allotted to a political party that was not a respondent in the case.
He was referring to the PTI which was not a party to the case, but instead, the Sunni Ittehad Council, with which it had allied for the elections, was a respondent.
Justice Ayesha then replied that this question had been asnwered in the detailed verdict. “What is the basis of your review petition?” she asked.
Responding to Justice Mazhar’s question that whether the PML-N disagreed with the entire ruling or only the majority ruling, the lawyer replied that he was objecting to the majority ruling only.
Justice Ayesha observed that the scope of review was limited and arguments could not be presented twice in a case. Justice Mandokhail also noted that the orders of the returning officers (ROs) and the ECP were available, to which Azmat responded that the PTI did not challenge those orders despite having “an army” of lawyers in the party.
“Will we punish the nation for the mistake of a party? Could we let go of a matter if it came to the notice of the Supreme Court?” Justice Mandokhail asked. Justice Ayesha, who was part of the original ruling, stressed that the judges had arrived at the decision after hearing all “points in detail”.
 
 

Addressing the PML-N lawyer, Justice Abbasi remarked: “You keep mentioning political party. Leave that aside. The Supreme Court gave its decision according to the Constitution. Tell us what the mistake in the judgment was.
“We know the things you are telling us from our student days. Would you now teach the Supreme Court?” the judge added, ordering Azmat to argue on the grounds for the review instead of repeating arguments on the original case.
Here, Justice Ayesha Malik asked whether the reserved seats verdict was implemented, to which Azmat replied that he was not sure about it. “You are standing before the court. What does this mean that it is not confirmed to you?” she asked.
Justice Ayesha also wondered how a review plea could be filed without the earlier order being implemented. Justice Mandokhail said: “You (Azmat) also have to tell whether the ECP is not bound to implement our orders.”
Adding to this, Justice Abbasi pointed out that a contempt plea was also before the court over the non-implementation of the July 12 court order.
At this point during the hearing, Mohmand, the ECP’s counsel, came to the rostrum. Justice Kakar asked the lawyer to respond in a “yes or no” about whether the SC ruling had been acted upon.
 
 

Upon Mohmand replying that the electoral watchdog had followed the order “to the extent of one paragraph”, Justice Abbasi remarked: “Is it up to your wishes that which paragraph you choose to implement?”
Justice Ayesha then inquired of Azmat how the ECP was an affected party in the case, questioning how it could seek review of something it had not implemented. “Your job is to hold elections. How can you become a party to this case?”
To this, Mohmand responded that the PHC had made the ECP a party. Justice Ayesha quipped: “The Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution [but] you did not like that interpretation, so you came to the SC again.”
Justice Kakar then remarked, “If the ECP has implemented the [earlier] order, then it is fine. Otherwise, what guarantee is there that our order will be implemented?”
Mohmand informed the judge that the ECP had followed that ruling “partially”, at which Justice Ayesha observed, “You cannot pick and choose which orders to follow. You implemented the bits you liked and did not implement what you did not like.”
Addressing the ECP lawyer, Justice Abbasi suggested taking up the contempt plea against the commission that was pending. “If the contempt proceedings against you are heard, will you [still] seek a review?”
Mohmand then insisted that the ECP had followed the court orders, at which Justice Abbasi told him not to say so as it was not the case.
Here, Justice Mandokhail remarked, “In which direction are you taking the Supreme Court? If someone is sentenced to death tomorrow, will they say that the noose was only put up to their head and left there?”
Justice Ayesha observed that she had a question on the maintainability of the ECP’s review petition, while Justice Abbasi asked the lawyer if he would be able to present arguments in the contempt case if that was taken up.
Subsequently, with an 11-2 split — as Justice Ayesha and Justice Abbasi objected to the admissibility of the pleas — the CB issued notices to the parties and adjourned the hearing till tomorrow.
‘Clear error in verdict must be identified for review plea to be taken up’
Earlier today, a three-member bench of the SC observed that a “clear error” in an original verdict must be identified for a review petition to be accepted for hearing.
The ruling came as the bench — led by Justice Shah and comprising Justices Mazhar and Hassan — took up a set of civil review petitions against a PHC ruling which had dismissed challenges brought by candidates who had been denied appointments as primary school teachers.
 
 

Justices Mazhar and Hasan are part of the CB that has taken up the review pleas against the SC’s ruling on the reserved seats case.
The judgment, authored by Justice Shah, stated that a review could be sought only under Article 188 of the Constitution, which empowers the SC to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it, or under the Supreme Court Rules of 1980.
Citing the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, the order stressed that “some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record” was one of the situations where a review may be sought.
Acknowledging that the phrase “cannot be defined with precision”, Justice Shah declared that the error “must be self-evident, immediately apparent, and not require extensive discussion or reasoning”.
The power of review was “not an open invitation to revisit judgements merely on the basis of dissatisfaction with the outcome”, the judge emphasised.
 
 

“A decision, order, or judgment cannot be corrected simply because it is erroneous in law, or because a different view could have been taken by the court or tribunal on a point of law or fact,” he noted.
“Frivolous claims serve no purpose other than to waste the court’s
time and resources,” the order stated, clarifying that the power of review should not be confused with the appellate power.
Noting that there were over 2.2 million cases currently pending before courts across Pakistan, including approximately 56,635 before the SC, the ruling pointed out that “frivolous, vexatious and speculative litigation contributes
substantially to this backlog”.</p><small>2025-05-06 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0619195627bfdf9.jpg?r=192921' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908833/7-soldiers-martyred-in-ied-blast-by-indian-proxy-terrorists-in-balochistans-mach-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>7 soldiers martyred in IED blast by ‘Indian proxy’ terrorists in Balochistan’s Mach: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Seven soldiers were martyred in a blast from an improvised explosive device planted by “Indian proxy” terrorists in Balochistan’s Kacchi district, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
A press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said: “On May 6, 2025, terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, so-called ‘Baloch Liberation Army’, targeted security forces’ vehicle with an improvised explosive device in general area Mach.”
It said the following seven soldiers were subsequently martyred in the attack: Subedar Umar Farooq, 42, resident of Karachi; Naik Asif Khan, 28, resident of Karak district; Naik Mashkoor Ali, 28, resident of Orakzai district; Sepoy Tariq Nawaz, 26, resident of Lakki Marwat district; Sepoy Wajid Ahmed Faiz, 28, resident of Bagh district; Sepoy Muhammad Asim, 22, resident of Karak district and Sepoy Muhammad Kashif Khan, 28, resident of Kohat district.
“Nefarious designs of India and its proxies operating on Pakistani soil will be defeated by the valiant security forces, LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and the brave nation of Pakistan,” the ISPR said.
It added that sanitisation of the area was being carried out to eliminate any terrorists present in the area and the perpetrators of the “heinous and cowardly act” would be brought to justice.
“Security forces of Pakistan, in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve.”
Two Pakistan Coast Guards personnel were injured on Monday when a remote-controlled bomb targeted their patrol vehicle in the Jiwani area, while a Levies official escaped unharmed when his private vehicle was destroyed by a separate roadside bomb in Pishin district.
Last week, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-05-06 14:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/061855234bffe8d.jpg?r=185736' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908829/ppps-waqar-mehdi-wins-senate-by-election-for-sindh-seat' target='_blank'><strong>PPP’s Waqar Mehdi wins Senate by-election for Sindh seat</strong></a><br><p>PPP’s Syed Waqar Mehdi won the by-election held for the vacant general seat of the Senate from the province of Sindh in Karachi on Tuesday, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The ruling PPP and the opposition Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) had nominated Waqar Mehdi and Nighat Mirza, respectively. The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) did not field any candidate and on Monday it announced boycotting the polling process as well.
In the by-election held at the Sindh Assembly, Mehdi secured 111 votes, while MQM-P’s Nighat Mirza received 36, and two were rejected, said the returning officer, Provincial Election Commissioner Sindh Ejaz Anwar Chauhan.
The polling was conducted from 9am to 4pm without any break. A total of 149 votes were cast during the scheduled polling time.
The general Senate seat from Sindh province fell vacant after the death of PPP’s Senator Taj Haider on April 8 in Karachi. He was elected a senator on a PPP ticket from a Senate general seat in Sindh in March 2021 for a period of six years.
Officials had said that the candidate to be elected on Tuesday will serve as a member of the Senate for a period of around two years until March 2027.</p><small>2025-05-06 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0618432802cc6b5.png?r=184349' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908827/britain-and-india-clinch-landmark-trade-deal-in-shadow-of-trumps-tariffs' target='_blank'><strong>Britain and India clinch landmark trade deal in shadow of Trump’s tariffs</strong></a><br><p>India and the United Kingdom concluded on Tuesday a long-coveted free trade pact, in a landmark deal that represents London’s most significant post-Brexit agreement that was finalised in the shadow of US President Donald Trump’s tariff increases.
The deal, between the world’s fifth and sixth largest economies, has been concluded after three years of stop-start negotiations and aims to increase bilateral trade by a further 25.5 billion pounds ($34bn) by 2040 with liberal market access and eased trade restrictions.
“These landmark agreements will further deepen our comprehensive strategic partnership, and catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X.
 


The deal lowers tariffs on goods such as whisky, advanced manufacturing parts and food products such as lamb, salmon, chocolates and biscuits. It also agrees to quotas on both sides for auto imports.
Both countries are also seeking bilateral deals with the United States to remove some of Trump’s tariffs that have upended the global trade system, and the resulting turmoil sharpened focus in both London and New Delhi on the need to clinch a UK-India trade deal.
“We are now in a new era for trade and the economy. That means going further and faster to strengthen the UK’s economy,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.
“Strengthening our alliances and reducing trade barriers with economies around the world is part of our plan for change to deliver a stronger and more secure economy here at home.”
 


The pact marks India opening up its long-guarded markets, including automobiles, setting an early example for the South Asian nation’s likely approach to dealing with major Western powers such as the US and the European Union.
Talks over a free trade deal between India and Britain were initially launched in January 2022, and became a symbol of Britain’s hopes for its independent trade policy after leaving the European Union.
But negotiations were stop-start, with Britain having four different prime ministers since that launch date and elections in both countries last year.</p><small>2025-05-06 14:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/06181600231db08.jpg?r=183115' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908826/gunmen-kill-cop-in-kps-bannu-police' target='_blank'><strong>Gunmen kill cop in KP’s Bannu: police</strong></a><br><p>A policeman was shot dead by unidentified assailants in the limits of the Mandan police station in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Tuesday morning.
Khanzala Quraishi, spokesperson for the Bannu regional police officer, told Dawn.com: “Police Constable Khanzeb was on his way to duty on a motorcycle when he was intercepted and targeted by unidentified assailants near the Asghar fuel station in the limits of Mandan police station.”
He added that the policeman was killed on the spot by the intense firing and the body was moved to the District Headquarters Hospital Bannu after a heavy police contingent soon reached the spot.
A statement from the police said that Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi also visited the incident site later in the day, inspecting the scene in detail and issuing strict instructions for the arrest of the culprits.
The statement said the DPO himself, along with other police personnel, was present in the area for the operation to arrest the suspects.
“We will not rest until the elements involved in the incident are brought to justice,” the DPO was quoted as saying in the statement.
Three policemen of the counter terrorism department embraced martyrdom and two others were injured in an armed clash with terrorists in the district’s Speena Tangi Chashmi area last week.

The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 533.73 points, or 0.47 per cent, to stand at 113,568.50 from the last close of 114,102.23 at the end of today’s session.
Earlier today, shares had increased by 990.87 points, or 0.87pc, to stand at 115,093.10 from the previous close at 10:03am. They then witnessed a slight decline, dropping to 114,723.98 at 12:30pm but still up by 621.75 points from yesterday’s close.
The sell-off comes despite the State Bank of Pakistan’s decision yesterday to slash the interest rate by 100 basis points to 11 per cent, which had defied analysts’ expectations that ongoing tensions with India might keep the central bank cautious and lead to no change in the monetary policy.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, said the market “lost its momentum amid concerns over border tensions with India, overshadowing the earlier boost from the rate cut”.
 
 

In the past few days, panicky investors have continued to reduce their holdings as Pakistan has expressed a heightened possibility of a military action by India in the wake of the latter’s allegations regarding a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
However, Ashraf noted that the “likelihood of a full-scale war between Pakistan and India remains low, constrained by the nuclear deterrence factor”.
“We believe, escalation at a wider scale would have severe consequences for both nations, particularly given their dependence on external financing and exposure to short-term external liabilities,” he added.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also attributed the early gains in shares today to the monetary policy, noting that the SBP rate cut was “higher than market expectations”.
Topline Securities Ltd had observed yesterday that the benchmark index was volatile, falling by 1,036 points in early trading. However, it made a strong recovery in the second half, mainly supported by the cement sector, as investors expected a possible rate cut in the monetary policy later in the day.
 
 

Also on Monday, international rating agency Moody’s warned that sustained India-Pakistan tensions could negatively affect Pakistan’s growth.
It also said that escalating tensions could cause a setback to nascent macroeconomic stability and also disrupt Pakistan’s access to foreign funding flows.
On the other hand, Moody’s noted that macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable. However, it did stress that higher defence spending could impact India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”.</p><small>2025-05-06 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/06152635ea6ce36.png?r=153929' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908819/omar-ayub-writes-to-na-speaker-over-censoring-his-speech-in-parliament' target='_blank'><strong>Omar Ayub writes to NA speaker over ‘censoring’ his speech in parliament</strong></a><br><p>Leader of Opposition in National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan on Tuesday wrote to the NA speaker over “censoring” his speech in the House.
Earlier in November of last year, a NA session was adjourned indefinitely after the opposition leader’s remarks on last night’s swift legislation were expunged from the record.
In a letter addressed to the speaker, Khan said: “Despite your ruling and personal commitment made on the floor of the House, my speech was, in fact, blocked, censored, and the continuity of parliamentary proceedings and debate was deliberately interrupted by the Media and Photography Wing of the NA.”
“This act of suppression occurred in direct violation of your explicit assurance and has inflicted serious damage on the transparency of parliamentary business,” the opposition leader added.
“As the leader of the opposition, I had formally sought and was assured by your good self, in your capacity as speaker that my speech would be broadcast live, without interruption, censorship, or selective blocking, in order to safeguard the parliamentary right of debate for all members, including those on the opposition benches,” he continued.
Khan said that this assurance explicitly extended to the live transmission on the official Parliament TV channel as well as coverage by national media networks.
He complained that his request for access to the official audio and video recordings of his speech from the NA general media and photography wing were denied without any lawful justification, “even though no portion of the speech was ordered to be expunged by the Chair.”
“The actions of Secretary General Mr Tahir Hussain, and the Director General (Media) Mr Zafar Sultan Khan, who are duty-bound to implement your ruling, have instead willfully disregarded it.
“By obstructing the rightful participation of opposition members and withholding fair media coverage, they have committed a serious breach of privilege. Their conduct has undermined both the authority of the speaker and the institutional integrity of this House.”
The opposition leader referred to Article 66 of the Constitution, while deals with the privileges of members and provides complete freedom of speech in parliament and no member can be liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of anything said or any vote given by them in the house.
“This constitutional guarantee safeguards the right of members to speak freely and to have their voices heard fully, both within and beyond the House,” he concluded.
Last year in March, Khan had said that his speech as the leader of the opposition was not live-streamed and was censored.
Referring to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s speech after being elected as the prime minister, he said, “His speech was shown live and mine was interrupted again and again.”</p><small>2025-05-06 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/06142536fbeee2b.jpg?r=142555' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908810/loyalists-cheer-as-ex-pm-khaleda-zia-returns-home-to-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>Loyalists cheer as ex-PM Khaleda Zia returns home to Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh’s ex-prime minister Khaleda Zia, chair of the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), returned home to cheering crowds on Tuesday after months abroad for medical treatment.
Zia, 79, led the South Asian nation twice but was jailed for corruption in 2018 during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, her successor and lifelong rival who barred her from travelling abroad for medical care.
The 79-year-old was released from house arrest after a student-led mass uprising ousted Hasina in August 2024.
She flew to Britain in January and returned on Tuesday, BNP spokesperson Shairul Kabir said.
Thousands of party activists welcomed her, gathering on either side of the road leading to the airport, carrying photographs of Zia and waving party flags and placards with welcome messages.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, 84, who has led an interim government since Hasina fled into exile as crowds stormed her palace, has said elections will be held as early as December, and by June 2026 at the latest.
“This is a significant day for the country and the people of Bangladesh,” Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the BNP’s secretary general, told reporters.
 
 

“The celebration we are witnessing is not only an outpouring of emotion but also a demonstration of our strength.”
Zia’s rival Hasina remains in self-imposed exile in India and has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.</p><small>2025-05-06 11:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/061507558f03fbd.jpg?r=150808' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908817/uk-may-restrict-students-from-pakistan-other-countries-most-likely-to-claim-asylum' target='_blank'><strong>UK may restrict students from Pakistan, other countries most likely to claim asylum</strong></a><br><p>The British government may restrict visa applications from students living in countries — including Pakistan — that are considered most likely to claim asylum in a move designed to bring down annual net migration, a government official said.
The move comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour Party was punished in local elections in England last week by voters angry over issues, including illegal immigration.
The government is expected next week to publish a policy document, known as a white paper, which will set out how the government plans to reduce net migration, which reached 728,000 people in the year to June last year.
“Our upcoming Immigration White Paper will set out a comprehensive plan to restore order to our broken immigration system,” the Home Office said in a statement.
High levels of legal migration have long dominated Britain’s political conversation and were one of the major drivers for the Brexit referendum in 2016.
Out of the 108,000 people who claimed asylum in Britain last year, 16,000 had student visas, government data shows. The government does not provide a breakdown of the nationalities of those who had student visas, who went on to claim asylum.
 
 

But the government said people from Pakistan, Nigeria and Sri Lanka were the most likely to claim asylum in Britain after arriving on a work, student, or a visitor visa.
In the aftermath of the party’s poor local election results last week, some Labour members of parliament urged the government to do more to take a more decisive approach on issues such as bringing down net migration.
Jo White, who represents a group of lawmakers in previously Labour heartlands known as the “Red Wall”, said the government should stop “pussyfooting around”.</p><small>2025-05-06 10:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/68193943cfac5.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908697/indian-states-told-to-conduct-air-raid-drills' target='_blank'><strong>Indian states told to conduct air raid drills</strong></a><br><p>NEW DELHI: The Indian government on Monday asked all states to conduct mock drills for “effective civil defence”, which includes operationalising air-raid warning signs, crash blackout measures, camouflaging vital installations and evacuation plans.
Meanwhile, Indian PM Narendra Modi  met with defence secretary Rajesh  Kumar Singh, followed by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, in his  office.
The mock-drills are to begin countrywide on May 7 and likely to continue till May 9, The Hindu quoted a senior government official as saying.
Around 400,000 volunteers associated with the Direc­torate General, Civil Defence, under the home ministry will be roped in for the drill, the official told The Hindu.
Government sources confirmed to the paper that this comes in the backdrop of escalating tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
The Civil Defence department was created in 1962, following India’s war with China.
The official said mock-drills are routinely performed for disasters such as earthquakes and building collapse among others but air-sirens are used to warn the public when there is an “external threat”.
“Every state including those on the western border will do the mock-exercise beginning May 7. The finer details will be shared on Tuesday. Some states are better equipped and for others we will issue guidelines,” said the official.
The official explained that camouflaging of vital installations amounts to switching off all illumination including in the vicinity of plants and vital buildings.
“We have over 400,000 volunteers associated with the Civil Defence. We will try to mobilise the maximum number for the exercise. The state police will also mobilise volunteers in their jurisdictions,” said the official.
On Sunday, police conducted a 30-minute blackout drill in the Ferozepur district of Punjab, bordering Pakistan. The Ferozepur Cantonment Board issued an advisory and residents were asked to switch off lights for half an hour.

Television visuals showed fallen trees and damaged crops as heavy lightning and thunderstorms impacted several districts.
The unseasonal rain across most of the state was driven by a cyclonic circulation in the neighbouring parts of Pakistan and India’s Rajasthan state, according to India’s Meteorological Department.
The weather forecaster has forecast more rain, thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds across Gujarat until Thursday.
Local officials told Reuters that 14 people were killed and 16 injured so far.
“We are awaiting reports on crop damage,” said Anju Sharma, secretary of the state’s agriculture department. Gujarat is a major producer of cotton, cumin and rice.
“District administrations will assess the losses and send us their reports today.”

Instead, it is reeling from a $48 million snap aid cut by US President Donald Trump’s government, which health workers say could rapidly unravel years of hard work and cause huge numbers of preventable deaths.
“Doctors told me I was infected with a serious kind of tuberculosis,” labourer Mohammed Parvej, 35, told AFP from his hospital bed after he received life-saving treatment from medics funded by the US aid who identified his persistent hacking cough.
But full treatment for his multidrug-resistant tuberculosis requires more than a year of hospital care and a laborious treatment protocol — and that faces a deeply uncertain future.
“Bangladesh is among the seven most TB-prevalent countries globally, and we aim to eradicate it by 2035,” said Ayesha Akhter, deputy director of the formerly US-funded specialised TB Hospital treating Parvej in the capital Dhaka.
 
 

Bangladesh had made significant progress against the infectious bacteria, spread by spitting and sneezing, leaving people exhausted and sometimes coughing blood.
TB deaths dropped from more than 81,000 a year in 2010, down to 44,000 in 2023, according to the World Health Organisation, in the country of some 170 million people.
Akhter said the South Asian nation had “been implementing a robust programme”, supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID).
“Then, one fine morning, USAID pulled out their assistance,” she said.
Starving children
More than 80 per cent of humanitarian programmes funded by USAID worldwide have been scrapped.
Tariful Islam Khan said the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh had, with US funding, carried out mass screening “improving TB case detection, particularly among children” from 2020 to 2024.
“Thanks to the support of the American people… the project has screened 52 million individuals and diagnosed over 148,000 TB cases, including 18,000 children,” he said.
Funding cuts threatened to stall the work.
“This work is critical not only for the health of millions of Bangladeshis, but also for global TB control efforts,” he said.

Growing rates of infectious diseases in one nation have a knock-on impact in the region. Cuts hit further than TB alone.
“USAID was everywhere in the health sector,” said Nurjahan Begum, health adviser to the interim government — which is facing a host of challenges after a mass uprising toppled the former regime last year.
US aid was key to funding vaccines combating a host of other diseases, protecting 2.3 million children against diphtheria, measles, polio and tetanus.
“I am particularly worried about the immunisation programme,” Begum said.
“If there is a disruption, the success we have achieved in immunisation will be jeopardised.”
Bangladeshi scientists have also developed a special feeding formula for starving children. That too has been stalled.
“We had just launched the programme,” Begum said. “Many such initiatives have now halted”.
Pivot to China
US State Department official Audrey M. Happ said that Washington was “committed” to ensuring aid was “aligned with the interests of the United States, and that resources are used as effectively and efficiently as possible”.
Bangladesh, whose economy and key garment industry are eyeing fearfully the end of the 90-day suspension of Trump’s punishing 37pc tariffs, is looking for other supporters.
 
 

Some Arab nations had expressed interest in helping fill the gap in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
China, as well as Turkey, may also step into Washington’s shoes, Begum said.
Jobs are gone too, with Dhaka’s Daily Star newspaper estimating that between 30,000 and 40,000 people were laid off after the United States halted funding.
Zinat Ara Afroze, fired along with 54 colleagues from Save the Children, said she worried for those she had dedicated her career to helping.
“I have seen how these projects have worked improving the life and livelihoods of underprivileged communities,” she said, citing programmes ranging from food to health, environmental protection to democracy.
“A huge number of this population will be in immediate crisis.”
Babies dying
Those with the least have been hit the hardest.
Less dollars for aid means more sick and dead among the Rohingya refugees who fled civil war in their home in neighbouring Myanmar into Bangladesh since 2017.
Much of the US aid was delivered through the UN’s WHO and Unicef children’s agency.
WHO official Salma Sultana said aid cuts ramped up risks of “uncontrolled outbreaks” of diseases including cholera in the squalid refugee camps.
Faria Selim, from Unicef, said reduced health services would impact the youngest Rohingya the hardest, especially some 160,000 children under five.
Hepatitis C, with a prevalence rate of nearly a fifth, “is likely to increase in 2025”, Selim said.
Masaki Watabe, who runs the UN Population Fund in Bangladesh working to improve reproductive and maternal health, said it was “trying its best to continue”.
Closed clinics and no pay for midwives meant the risk of babies and mothers dying had shot up.
“Reduced donor funding has led to … increasing the risk of preventable maternal and newborn deaths,” he said.</p><small>2025-05-06 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/061200131ff0360.jpg?r=120156' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908798/trump-administration-freezes-future-grants-to-harvard' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration freezes future grants to Harvard</strong></a><br><p>The US Department of Education informed Harvard University on Monday that it was freezing billions of dollars in future research grants and other aid until the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college concedes to a number of demands from the Trump administration, a senior department official said.
The move represents the latest salvo from a Trump administration willing to use the power of the federal purse to force institutions, from law firms to universities, to make sweeping policy changes or else lose billions of dollars in federal grants and contracts.
In a letter to Harvard, US Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon said the university must address concerns about anti-Semitism on campus, school policies that consider a student’s race, and complaints from the administration the university has abandoned its pursuit of academic excellence while employing relatively few conservative faculty members.
“This letter is to inform you that Harvard should no longer seek grants from the federal government, since none will be provided,” McMahon wrote.
 
 

Harvard said the McMahon letter doubles down on demands that would impose “unprecedented and improper control” over the university and makes new threats to “illegally” withhold funding for lifesaving research.
“Harvard will also continue to defend against illegal government overreach aimed at stifling research and innovation that make Americans safer and more secure,” a university spokesperson said.
The freeze of future funding represents a slightly altered tactic by the Trump administration, whose attempts to freeze top schools of existing funds raised legal eyebrows.
Trump has targeted Harvard over allegations of anti-Semitism on campus during pro-Palestinian protests. The protests were sparked by US ally Israel’s military assault on Gaza after the October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas.
Trump has alleged pro-Palestinian protesters are anti-Semitic and sympathetic to Hamas. Protesters, including some Jewish groups, say the government wrongly conflate their criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza with anti-Semitism and their advocacy for Palestinian rights with support for extremism.
In recent weeks, the administration began a formal review into nearly $9 billion in federal funding for Harvard, demanded the university ban diversity, equity and inclusion practices, and crack down on some pro-Palestinian groups and masks in protests.
 
 

Harvard rejected numerous Trump demands last month, calling them an attack on free speech and academic freedom. It sued the Trump administration after it suspended about $2.3 billion in federal funding for the educational institution, while also pledging to tackle discrimination on campus.
In its lawsuit against the Trump administration, Harvard said the government’s funding cuts will have stark “real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, (and) researchers” while putting in jeopardy crucial medical and scientific research.
Harvard has a $53bn endowment, the largest of any US university, but the funds are often restricted and used for things like financial aid and scholarships.</p><small>2025-05-06 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0602545874d4a60.jpg?r=031151' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586/pakistans-objectives-largely-served-and-achieved-by-unsc-moot-on-south-asia-tensions-asim-iftikhar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s objectives ‘largely served and achieved’ by UNSC moot on South Asia tensions: Asim Iftikhar</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN Asim Iftikhar on Tuesday said that the country’s objectives were largely achieved by a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) meeting it had requested to discuss the prevailing tensions in South Asia amid a standoff with India in the wake of a militant attack in occupied Kashmir.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
Iftikhar delivered a press briefing following the UNSC meeting, stating that the nation’s objectives were “largely served and achieved” by the discussion and reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to remaining peaceful and open to dialogue.
“Several [council] members recognised the imperative of peacefully resolving all issues, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with UNSC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” Iftikhar said.
“There was also a clear sense that regional stability cannot be sustained through unilateralism, it requires principled diplomacy, engagement and adherence to international law.”
Iftikhar noted that peace “does not happen in a vacuum” and highlighted some of the key points discussed during the moot.
“We expressed grave concern over India’s recent unilateral measures, particularly the illegal actions of April 23, military buildup and inflammatory statements,” he said.
“These actions, alongside credible evidence of potential escalation, have dangerously raised tensions.
“Pakistan does not seek confrontation [but] we are fully prepared to defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. When peace is threatened in a region home to one-fourth of humanity, it becomes a global issue,” he noted.
Iftikhar highlighted that Pakistan “categorically rejected” India’s allegations that it was responsible for the Pahalgam attack, which was condemned by Pakistan and “all council members”.
“What India is claiming is nothing but recycled allegations, unsubstantiated, unverified [and] designed to serve its political interest and strategic objectives, which include trying to divert attention from repression and human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir and to undermine the legitimate Kashmiri struggle for self-determination,” he said.
Iftikhar also raised India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, which he noted was brokered by the World Bank and “upheld during wars”.
“Water is life, not a weapon,” he said. “These rivers sustain over 240 million Pakistanis. Any attempt to disrupt their flow constitutes aggression, and allowing such a precedent would endanger every lower riparian state.”
According to Iftikhar, the council was reminded that the Kashmir issue was the core contributor to instability in South Asia.
“The Kashmiri people continue to face gross human rights violations, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, torture, demolition of homes — that we are seeing now — restrictions on expression and media and a systematic denial of their right to self-determination,” he lamented.
“Lasting peace in South Asia requires that the UNSC implements its own resolutions, which include the holding of a UN-supervised plebiscite for Kashmiris to determine their own future,” he stated.
The ambassador added that Pakistan called out India’s “weaponisation of disinformation [and] efforts to malign Pakistan”.
“We reminded the UNSC that Pakistan has been a frontline state in the war on terror, sacrificing over 19,000 lives along with immense economic setback,” he said. “India’s attempts to distort this reality, while ignoring its own destabilising actions and involvement in terrorism abroad, including the case of Kulbushan Jadhav and extraterritorial assassinations, must be met with truth, transparency and accountability.”
Iftikhar continued: “We reiterated our commitment to peaceful, cooperative relations with all our neighbours, including India. We remain open to dialogue based on mutual respect and sovereign equality.”
The ambassador added that Pakistan reiterated its call for a “transparent, neutral and credible investigation” of the Pahalagam attack.
“While we pursue peace, we will defend our interests and safeguard our sovereignty resolutely, and at all costs. We urge the UNSC and the secretary general to remain actively engaged in peacemaking and preventative diplomacy,” he said.
“The role of the council is not just to observe conflict from afar, but to prevent it through timely and principled action. Peace must be built through dialogue, engagement and respect for international law. India’s current posture reflects none of these,” Iftikhar said.
“The burden of peace must be shared — the people of Kashmir have waited far too long for justice, and the people of Pakistan will not stand by while their rights — to water, to peace, to sovereignty — are threatened,” he added.
“In view of the gravity of the situation, the calls for dialogue, de-escalation, and peaceful resolution of disputes, such as by the secretary general and what we heard from the council members today, are the most pertinent and the way forward for lasting peace and stability in the region,” he concluded.
Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had instructed Iftikhar to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.
 
 

“Pakistan will particularly brief the UNSC on how India’s aggressive actions, repeated provocations and inflammatory rhetoric pose a serious threat to regional and global peace and stability,” an FO press release issued today said.
It said that Pakistan would call upon the UNSC to “exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security by taking appropriate measures to address these concerning developments”.
“It will also highlight India’s unlawful and unilateral attempt to put the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a clear violation of its international obligations,” the FO said.
The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar said Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India’s aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.
Pakistan and India have fought multiple wars and remain bitter foes.
International pressure has been piled on both New Delhi and Islamabad to de-escalate.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack in Kashmir.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his military “full operational freedom” to respond, and Islamabad has warned it will hit back against any aggression.
UN chief urges ‘maximum restraint’ in India, Pakistan standoff
Earlier, before the session, UN chief Antonio Guterres urged that Pakistan and India must exert “maximum restraint” and step back from the brink of war.
Relations have reached “a boiling point”, Guterres told reporters in New York, adding that they were at their “highest in years”.
He again condemned the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, calling for those responsible to be brought to justice through “credible and lawful means”.
“It is also essential — especially at this critical hour — to avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control,” the secretary-general warned.

“Now is the time for maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink.”
The UN chief also called Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss the prevailing security situation in South Asia, according to a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
It added that this was the second telephone conversation between the two leaders within a week.
PM Shehbaz appreciated the UN chief’s continued engagement and outreach efforts and welcomed his call for de-escalation as well as the need to avoid any confrontation.
“While reiterating his offer of an independent, transparent, neutral and credible investigation, the prime minister expressed his concern that India was yet to provide any evidence, nevertheless, it continued to resort to provocative rhetoric and warmongering,” the statement said.
The premier reiterated Pakistan’s determination to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
PM Shehbaz also expressed his serious concern at Indian attempts to politicise international financial institutions in an attempt to harm Pakistan’s economic interests.
The UN chief briefed the prime minister on his outreach efforts for peace and stability in the region, and expressed his commitment to remain engaged with all interlocutors on the issue.
NA passes unanimous resolution, condemns India’s move to suspend Indus Waters Treaty
Meanwhile, the National Assembly (NA) unanimously passed a resolution condemning India’s unlawful and unilateral declaration to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in blatant violation of the treaty.
Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry presented the resolution.
The resolution said that the killing of innocent civilians was contrary to the values upheld by Pakistan, and the NA rejected all “frivolous and baseless attempts” to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam attack.
The lawmakers condemned the “orchestrated and mala fide campaign” by the Indian government to malign Pakistan, which “follows a familiar pattern of exploiting the issue of terrorism for a narrow political goal”.
The resolution warned that Pakistan remained fully capable and prepared to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression, including water terrorism or military provocation and any misadventure by India would be met with a firm, swift and decisive response.
The lawmakers emphasised that the people of Pakistan remained committed to peace but would never allow anyone to transgress the country’s sovereignty, security, and interests.
The resolution demanded that India should be held accountable for its involvement in different acts of terrorism and targeted assassinations on the soil of other countries, including Pakistan, and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering moral, political and diplomatic support for and commitment to the Kashmiri people’s just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination.
Pahalgam attack attempt to divert attention from India’s cross-border terrorism: Dar
FM Dar said that the attack was an attempt to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges and its cross-border terrorism.
Addressing the Regional Dialogue 2025 in Islamabad today, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Dar said Pakistan believed the Pahalgam attack was part of an effort to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges, adding that it could be “self-choreographed”.
“We believe that what has happened is to divert attention — I am talking of Pahalgam — from India’s internal challenges, state-sponsored terrorism, the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and to gain narrow domestic political objectives,” Dar said.
“Don’t forget that there are some by-elections coming in the next few months in India,” he added, referring to the upcoming polls in Bihar in October.
“This brinkmanship carries consequences that extend far beyond India’s borders,” the deputy PM warned, calling India’s actions “unilateral, politically-motivated and highly provocative”.
He noted: “There appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern — level allegations against Pakistan without evidence, use inflammatory rhetoric, incite war hysteria and use this as a pretext for aggression and unilateral actions.”
In a reference to the Indian government, Dar stressed that regional and international peace and security could not be “sacrificed at the altar of narrow electoral gains”.
“This is a dangerous political game and gamble, putting at stake the lives of millions in the region,” the foreign minister highlighted. However, he also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace: “We will support all efforts towards de-escalation.”
“Analysts say this could be another ploy. It might have been self-choreographed,” echoing Pakistani leaders’ previous statements of the Pahalgam attack being a “false flag operation”.
 


“How can an FIR (first information report) be registered in 10 minutes at a police station where you need at least 45 minutes to reach? […] Come on. Nobody’s a fool,” Dar quipped.
“International dignitaries are talking [to] both sides. Few of them — great friends — suggested to me, ‘Can you try and help the perpetrators be caught?’ I said ‘come on, do you know the distance where it happened and where’s the Line of Control? 230 kilometres.”
The deputy PM asserted: “Pakistan has exposed India’s mala fide and they are now on the backfoot. But it takes two to tango. I am telling all these dignitaries that we will show patience and will not be the first ones to attack.
“But if anybody makes any mistake and ventures into adventurism, then God knows what situation that will lead to. I hope sense prevails and they should [reflect].”
He detailed that he has directed Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations to request a meeting of the UN Security Council.
 
 

“Let’s share with them the facts and figures and the details and the evidence we showed the other day,” said Dar, referring to his press briefing with the military’s spokesperson, where they accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.
“I cannot find the word abeyance in any international treaties’ dictionary. The word suspension is there,” Dar said, referring to India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.
UK to ‘work closely’ with Pakistan, India to reduce tensions
Separately, UK High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott assured PM Shehbaz today that her country would “work closely with Pakistan and India for maintaining regional peace and security”, the PMO said.
In his meeting with Marriott in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz urged her country to play its part in de-escalating the ongoing tensions with India.

The premier shared Pakistan’s perspective on the prevailing situation in South Asia in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident and rejected India’s attempts to link Pakistan to the incident without providing any evidence.
He also reiterated his offer for a transparent, credible and neutral international investigation into the incident and invited the UK to join it, the PMO statement added.
Noting that the UK enjoyed “good relations” with both India and Pakistan, PM Shehbaz assured Marriott that Islamabad “would never take any action that could imperil regional peace and security”.
The prime minister stressed that with the support of friendly countries, including the UK, his government’s “foremost priority remained advancing economic growth and development of the country”.
Iran FM meets with PM Shehbaz, army chief
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also met PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir today, state broadcaster PTV News said in a post on X.
FM Araghchi, who arrived in Islamabad late last night, also met with Deputy PM Dar.
 


“Key discussions held with PM Shehbaz Sharif, FM Ishaq Dar and Army Chief Gen Asim Munir,” PTV News stated, highlighting that the visit came amid “rising India-Pakistan tensions after the Pahalgam attack”.
In his meeting with the Iranian FM, PM Shehbaz stressed that India’s weaponisation of the Indus Waters Treaty was unacceptable and a red line for Pakistan.
According to the PMO, the premier shared serious concerns over the prevailing tensions in South Asia as a result of India’s provocative behaviour since the Pahalgam incident.
He categorically rejected any attempts to link Pakistan to the incident, without sharing any evidence and said Pakistan had offered that an international, transparent, neutral and credible investigation be conducted to ascertain the facts behind the Pahalgam incident.
While stating that Pakistan had acted with maturity and responsibility, the prime minister said, “India had, on the other hand, created a media frenzy to divert the world’s attention away from Jammu and Kashmir dispute, which remained the root cause of instability in South Asia.”
Iran’s FM Araghchi conveyed warm greetings from the Iranian leadership to the prime minister and reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to strengthening its relations with Pakistan and also playing its part in bringing peace and stability in South Asia.
The meeting between the army chief and the Iranian FM at General Headquarters (GHQ) today featured constructive discussions on the geo-strategic environment, with particular focus on challenges confronted by both countries in the domain of security, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.

Both sides agreed to stay engaged for enhanced bilateral cooperation while jointly working to assist in bringing positive developments in issues concerning the region, ISPR said.
The Iranian FM acknowledged and appreciated Pakistan’s efforts for peace and stability in the region, it added.
In their meeting, Dar and Araghchi exchanged views on the evolving situation in South Asia and the US-Iran nuclear talks, the Foreign Office said.
Both leaders also agreed that complex issues could be “resolved through diplomacy and negotiations”.
“They appreciated each other’s constructive diplomatic efforts, which demonstrate their shared commitment to peace and stability in the region,” the FO said. As Pak-India tensions persist, FM Araghchi is also expected to visit India later in the week.
According to an FO press release, Dar shared Pakistan’s “serious concerns over the prevailing tensions in South Asia as a result of India’s provocative behaviour” and rejected “unsubstantiated attempts to implicate Pakistan in the incident”.

The foreign minister thanked his Iranian counterpart for making the visit at this “critical juncture”. On his part, Araghchi conveyed cordial greetings from the Iranian leadership and reaffirmed Tehran’s desire to further deepen bilateral relations with Pakistan.
Dar pointed out that Pakistan had “consistently denounced terrorism in all its forms” and underscored the country’s frontline role in the fight against terrorism.
Both foreign ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to strong Pakistan-Iran ties and agreed to boost cooperation in trade, energy, and connectivity.
They also pledged to maintain strong momentum in Pak-Iran relations, including by maintaining an increased frequency of interaction at the leadership level.
Araghchi also called on President Asif Ali Zardari to discuss matters of bilateral and mutual interest, regional security situation, particularly the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.
The Iranian foreign minister said that he was undertaking the visit on the instructions of the Supreme Leader Khamenei, and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, expressing understanding of Pakistan’s position on the current situation and calling for restraint by both sides to de-escalate the tensions.
The president thanked the Iranian foreign minister for undertaking the visit to Pakistan at a critical juncture.
He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to dialogue and diplomacy, while expressing concern over India’s aggressive posture, which he said was endangering regional peace and stability.
China reaffirms ‘time-tested friendship’ with Pakistan
Earlier today, China reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid escalation with India as President Asif Ali Zardari met with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong.

During today’s meeting at Aiwan-i-Sadr, Zardari expressed concern over the recent “irresponsible and aggressive rhetoric by the Indian government”, saying that such actions threaten regional peace and stability.
The two discussed matters of bilateral importance, with a particular focus on the ongoing situation between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
The Chinese ambassador reaffirmed the “enduring and time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan”, describing the relationship as one of “ironclad brothers” who have always supported each other in challenging times.
He thanked Zardari for sharing Pakistan’s perspective, and emphasised that China would always support its ally to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.
 
 

Zardari conveyed his deep appreciation and gratitude to the Chinese government for its “consistent support, always standing by Pakistan in difficult times”.
On Thursday, PM thanked China’s envoy for endorsing his offer to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack. Last week, China had urged both India and Pakistan to “exercise restraint” as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC).
As Pakistan continues diplomatic engagement with various countries to brief them on the ongoing situation, PM Shehbaz yesterday spoke to his Malaysian counterpart, while Dar spoke to the foreign ministers of Malaysia and Russia.
When war breaks out, you can’t control it: Khawaja Asif
Meanwhile, appearing on Samaa TV programme ‘Nadeem Malik Live’, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reiterated that any Indian attack would be met with a “befitting response”, adding that it would be “a level above what they do”.
“If they attack, which I can’t define right now, our response will be a step up and will not come down,” he said.
When asked about the possibility of an Indian attack on the LoC, Asif responded that there was anticipation that any Indian attack would be contained to the LoC or Sialkot sector.
“Once war starts, you cannot calibrate or control it,” he said. “Starting a war itself is something which is extremely dangerous.
“Modi is fighting a war for his own gains and for votes,” Asif added. “Political compulsions dictate their strategic policy, which is very unfortunate. Votes are more valuable than human lives or international peace.”
 


Info minister refutes claims of ‘terrorist hideouts’ during LoC visit
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar visited the LoC in Azad Jammu and Kashmir with local and foreign media and dismissed India’s allegations of “terrorist hideouts” there, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The visit facilitated by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was aimed at exposing the “false and baseless Indian propaganda”, the report said, pointing out that media representatives were taken to specific locations that India had allegedly “labelled as terrorist hideouts”.
“By witnessing the ground situation, hearing from the local population, and observing the environment firsthand, the media got the opportunity to assess the truth behind India’s claims,” Radio Pakistan noted.
Among the group of international journalists was CNN’s International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson.
 


According to Radio Pakistan, Robertson visited a village where Muhammad Farooq and Muhammad Deen were killed in a “fake encounter by the Indian army”.
The CNN editor interviewed both men’s bereaved families, who appealed for justice through international media, the report said. No statement by Robertson was found on his social media accounts immediately after the visit.
Speaking on the occasion, Tarar said: “India is now claiming the presence of training camps in Bela Noor Shah, which is near Pir Chinasi, and that they were used in the Pahalgam attack.
“This area is 26 kilometres away from the LoC and the purpose of coming here is to show that Indian propaganda is false, fake, and concocted,” he added.

“India’s narrative has failed miserably, and the international media has not picked it up. There are contradictions in India’s response and they are not able to provide evidence,” the minister said.
He asserted: “There are no terrorist camps here. There are beautiful mountains and people [only].”
“Don’t resort to any misadventure,” Tarar warned, adding that Pakistan would give a befitting response to any Indian aggression and would go to any extent to defend its sovereignty.
Echoing Deputy PM Dar’s statements, Tarar said India uses propaganda to “hide its internal failures”.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Army again responded to unprovoked firing by the Indian army along the LoC overnight, state broadcaster PTV News reported.
According to security sources, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked firing on multiple Pakistani military posts in Nakyal, Khuiratta, Sharda, Kel, Neelum and Haji Pir sectors along the LoC.
The action was responded to in a befitting manner by the Pakistan Army, PTV News added. It quoted security sources as saying that the armed forces were “fully alert”.
Pakistani troops had previously responded to “unprovoked” Indian firing on April 30. Both countries have reportedly been trading small arms fire since April 25.

Four survivors rescued after the “panga”-style open fishing vessel washed ashore near Torrey Pines State Beach were transported to hospitals, and two other people found on a nearby beach were detained by authorities, according to US Coast Guard officials.
The two taken into custody were suspected to be smugglers, Coast Guard spokesperson Hunter Schnabel told Reuters.
Earlier Coast Guard accounts put the number of people missing from the overturned craft at nine, but Schnabel said the tally of those unaccounted for was revised to seven after confirmation that two individuals had been detained.

A Coast Guard cutter, an emergency response boat and a helicopter were involved in an ongoing search for the missing, among whom were two children, another Coast Guard spokesperson, Chief Petty Officer Levi Read, said.
At least some of the boat’s occupants were apparently from India, as a number of Indian passports “were found on the beach near where the panga washed up,” Read said.
Shawn Gibson, a special agent in charge of the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agency, said the incident was a “stark reminder of the dangers posed by maritime smuggling.”
“The ruthless smuggling of undocumented individuals is not only illegal, it’s deadly,” Gibson said of the incident, which occurred about 30 miles north of the US-Mexico border. Read said ocean conditions off the San Diego County coast were rough at the time, with two metres seas reported.
Personnel from HSI, the US Border Patrol, the local fire department and law enforcement also responded to the scene, officials said.
So far this fiscal year, since October 2024, the Coast Guard has tracked 277 vessels clandestinely entering US waters from Mexico in the San Diego area, some of the boats being interdicted and others getting away, Read said. Those incidents resulted in 983 people being apprehended.
That compares with 1,354 maritime border-crossing incidents in the same region during the previous 12 months, with 561 individuals taken into custody during that period.
Of the four hospitalised survivors from Thursday’s panga capsizing, one was listed in critical condition when rescued, according to a statement from the city of Encinitas.
One survivor reported that 18 people had been aboard the vessel, and 18 life vests were located on shore, the statement said. But Read said the Coast Guard’s best information was that the boat was carrying just 16 individuals when it capsized.</p><small>2025-05-06 06:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/06100404bf3c5e9.jpg?r=100448' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908736/tax-officers-to-be-stationed-at-business-premises' target='_blank'><strong>Tax officers to be stationed at business premises</strong></a><br><p>• PM says ongoing reforms aimed at reducing burden on the common man
• Chambers, traders’ bodies slam govt for not taking them on board
ISLAMABAD: In what appears to be a major step to broaden the country’s narrow tax base, the government has authorised the stationing of tax officers at business premises to monitor production, stocks, supply of goods and rendering of services in the largely undocumented service sector.
On Monday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was briefed about three major amendments which address urgent legal, administrative and enforcement gaps in the tax system. These amendments were implemented through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025.
The amendment pertains to the posting of FBR officers at business premises under Section 175C and is intended to help monitor the revenue collection of high-end services and sectors operating outside the scope of the existing sales tax regime.
This section will not cover traders who are already regulated under section 40B of the Sales Tax Act 1990.
This step simply brings services into parity and ensures fair and comprehensive oversight across sectors, tackling an underground economy that is estimated to be more than 30pc of the GDP.
The measure is a response to the growing tax fatigue among the salaried class and documented manufacturers. Through enhanced documentation of the high-potential service sector, the FBR aims to create a fiscal space that could allow potential downward revisions in personal income tax rates on salaried individuals.
 
 

The service sector, which represents nearly 60pc of GDP, remains largely undocumented as over 70pc of enterprises are reportedly unregistered.
The scope of this section specifically targets high-earning yet under-documented businesses. Prominent among these are restaurants, hotels, guest houses, marriage halls, clubs, courier and cargo services, beauty parlours, clinics, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, gyms, foreign exchange dealers and photographers.
Some private hospitals are reportedly charging Rs100,000 to 200,000 per day for inpatient room occupancy — rates that exceed even those of five-star hotels. Many of these entities are underreporting revenues and do not comply with tax laws, undermining public trust and depriving the state of critical revenue needed for social services and infrastructure building.
This amendment introduces a monitoring mechanism, subject to inter-agency oversight, ensuring that FBR officers cannot act without accountability or beyond the authorised scope. All operations under this provision will be conducted transparently, under strictly defined SOPs, and in coordination with other regulatory authorities to prevent overreach or harassment.
PM’s observations
PM Shehbaz says ongoing tax reforms are aimed at reducing the burden on the common man. He said the amendments in various provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance and the Federal Excise Act will remove obstacles in tax collection.
According to a statement by the Prime Minister’s Secretariat, the amendments will make the tax payment system more convenient and will not affect the rights of individuals and companies who regularly pay taxes.
The premier directed the authorities to expedite measures against tax evasion, under-invoicing and other irregularities in different sectors on priority basis.
He also directed strict legal action against buying and selling of illicit cigarettes and other items.
The meeting was briefed about steps taken against tax evasion in tobacco, cement, poultry, sugar, beverages and other industries. The prime minister was informed that work was underway on digital monitoring and the track and trace system.
The FBR has been successful in identifying irregularities in many industries through video monitoring. The meeting was told that powers to seize illicit products have also been transferred to provinces.
Tax amendments
The first amendment relates to Sections 138(3A) and 140(6A), concerning the immediate payment of tax demand even if a stay is granted or an appeal is pending. Following the recent constitutional amendment, special benches have been established in the superior judiciary to fast-track such cases under the oversight of the Chief Justice of Pakistan. Although the courts are now resolving cases promptly, a lacuna in the law previously allowed taxpayers a 30-day delay in making payments on confirmed demands — even when the matter had been conclusively decided by a court.
As a result, billions in confirmed revenue remained unrealised despite clear court verdicts. The amendment through Sections 138(3A) and 140(6A) seeks to curtail this delay and allow for swift implementation of final judgements issued by the Supreme Court and High Courts.
It is categorically clarified that this provision does not apply to orders passed by lower appellate forums such as commissioners, commissioner of appeals, or Inland Revenue Appellate Tribunals.
It is strictly limited to cases where the highest courts have already adjudicated on the matter and no stay is available. This provision does not overrule any stay granted by the Supreme Court or a high court. On the contrary, it reinforces the tax recovery order adjudicated by the Supreme Court or a high court.
The second amendment addresses the visits of FBR officers to private sector industries not currently accountable to FBR. The visits of FBR officers and officials to business premises engaged in taxable activities — whether earning taxable income or supplying taxable goods and services — are strictly regulated through a series of rules and STGOs. All such visits must be authorised through a bar-coded letter and officials are required to record proceedings on a mobile device for transparency.
Officers are provided with standardized pro forma documents, which are completed during the visit and submitted both electronically via a mobile application and in hard copy to a chief commissioner or to the FBR headquarters.
The conduct of these officers is closely monitored by civil intelligence agencies, and any instance of misconduct — whether reported by intelligence or private businesses — is promptly investigated and addressed.
KCCI, LCCI criticise move
The chief of the Karachi Chambers of Commerce and Industry opposed the insertion of Sections 138(3A) and 140(6A) in the Income Tax Ordinance because these provisions “override judgments of superior courts”.
Mohammad Jawed Bilwani said the business community was worried because the new law would make disputed tax liabilities immediately recoverable even where relief was granted by judicial forums.
Mian Abuzar Shad, who heads the Lahore Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said in a statement that the business community “rejects the controversial amendments” as no stakeholders were consulted.
“These amendments are dangerous and anti-business. Therefore, we unanimously demand their immediate withdrawal or parliamentary review through proper consultation,” Mr Shad said.

During the current tensions between India and Pakistan, the Pakistani patients were sent back from India without completion of their treatment. The CM on Monday directed the health authorities to ensure free treatment of all such patients.
“The patients returning from India will not be left alone under any circumstances,” she said and issued directions for the best treatment of those needing kidney and liver transplants or those suffering from other critical diseases in the province. These patients, who were receiving treatment in India, had to return to Pakistan after the Indian government revoked their visas.
Meanwhile, she lauded the ranking system in the Punjab Police that had led to a decrease in crime rate in Lahore and other cities.

Amid escalating tensions, patients had to return without complete treatment

“By introducing the ranking system in the police department, the crime rate in Lahore and other cities is on the decline. The crime graph coming down is the result of excellent policing. Lahore police operations wing’s laudable performance in the ‘crime index’ has made it a safe city as compared to London and New York. It is a great milestone for the Lahore police and the Punjab government. Lahore city has been included in the Safe City category due to adopting an excellent strategy in combating crime,” the CM said while speaking to IGP Dr Usman Anwar who briefed her on law and order situation and crime rate in the province in a meeting.
CCPO Bilal Siddique Kamyana, DIG Administration Imran Kishwar, DIG Operations Faisal Kamran and DIG Investigation Zeeshan Raza were also present.
Ms Nawaz underscored that protection of the life and property of every citizen was the foremost responsibility of the state. She urged the citizens to cooperate and support the police in order to maintain law and order across Punjab.
She added that despite enormous challenges with regard to maintaining law and order, achieving crime reduction targets spoke volumes of excellent teamwork.
“By introducing ‘key performance indicators (KPIs)’, the performance of the police and administration had significantly improved. Policing has been improved by adopting modern technology, taking immediate feedback and carrying out effective monitoring. The process of accountability has also been ensured in the police,” the CM said.

India took measures such as closing its airspace to Pakistan airlines, while Pakistan barred those owned or operated by its neighbour, suspended trade and halted special visas for Indians, although it let international airlines use its airspace.
Lufthansa Group’s airlines are  “avoiding Pakis­tani airspace until further notice”, it said in a statement to Reuters.
The Pakistan Civil Avi­a­tion Authority declined a Reuters request for comment.
However, flight tracking data showed some flights of British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates turning north towards Delhi in order to avoid Pakistani airspace, after travelling over the Arabian Sea.
British Airways and Emirates did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“The airline has decided to suspend overflight of Pakistan until further notice,” Air France said in a statement, citing the  “recent evolution of tensions” between India and Pakistan.
The carrier said it was altering its flight schedule and flight plans with destinations such as Delhi, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh, entailing longer flight times.

• Decreased inflows at Marala will result in more water shortage for crops, Irsa warns
• Reuters report claims New Delhi plans to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects
NEARLY a week after its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, India on Monday virtually stopped water discharges from the Chenab River into Pakistan without prior notice, reducing flows in the river manifold.
Water flows in the Chenab, recorded at the Marala headworks, decreased from up to 35,000 cusecs on Sunday to about 3,100 cusecs on Monday morning.
 
 

“They have almost blocked the River Chenab flows to downstream (Pakistan) after they (Ind­ian authorities) took the dec­ision on Sunday,” a senior official of the Punjab irrigation department confirmed on Monday.
“Currently, they are using our water to fill up their dams/hydropower projects in the Chenab basin. They cannot do this since it is a grave violation of the Indus Water Treaty…,” the official deplored.
According to a document seen by Dawn, India has three major hydropower projects in the Chenab Basin. The first is the 1,000MW Pakal Dul Dam, having an 88,000 acre-feet reservoir storage capacity and a 10km head race tunnel to divert water south.
The second is the Baglihar Dam (88km from Pakal Dul upstream). This is a 900MW power generation plant, having a 321,002 acre-feet reservoir storage along with a spillway capacity of 582,692 cusecs.
The third one is Salal Dam, located 78km from Baglihar, having an installed power generation capacity of 690MW along with 228,000 acre-feet reservoir storage and spillway capacity of 792,012 cusecs.
“From Salal Dam, Marala Barrage (in Pakistan) is situated 76km away. The reason behind the massive reduction in the flows is the filling of these dams, which have a total storage capacity of over 1.2 million acre-feet. And if they keep filling their dams and avert discharging, they (India) may leave us without water for four to five days more,” the official warned.
To a question, he said that if India suddenly started discharging water downstream, there could be a flood-like situation in Chenab, putting the local population at risk.
To another question, he said Marala’s capacity was 1.1 million cusecs, whereas the total storage capacity of India’s dams in the Chenab basin was over 1.3 million acre-feet. “However, they don’t have control over the water inflows to Pakistan in the river from the Jammu-Tavi and Munawar-Tavi distributaries,” the official added.
According to the official, Chenab is very important for Pakistan’s irrigation system, as its canals, including the UCC and BRB canals, irrigate a vast tract of agricultural land in Punjab.
According to the daily water report issued by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the water inflows in Chenab at Marala were recorded at 5,300 cusecs, whereas there were zero outflows on Monday.
The inflows and outflows in the river at Marala on Sunday were 34,600 and 25,400 cusecs, respectively.
Shortage for Kharif crops
Separately, a meeting of the advisory committee of the Indus River System Authority also expressed concerns over the unilateral Indian decision that would cause additional shortages to Kharif crops, already facing an estimated 21pc shortfall.
“…sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortages in early Kharif season,” said a statement issued by Irsa. The water regulator declared an overall shortage of 21pc for the remaining early Kharif season in case supplies in River Chenab remained normal. However, the situation would be monitored on a daily basis and if the decrease continues, the shortages would be revisited accordingly, Irsa said, adding the late Kharif shortages were expected to be 7pc.
An official told Dawn that Chenab flowed at 35,600 cusecs on Sunday at Marala headwork, but dropped to 3,177 cusecs on Monday morning, showing a reduction of almost 11 times. He said three storages — Baglihar, Dulhasti and Salal — on Chenab in Kashmir had the capacity to stop river flows.
Sindh’s concerns
Sindh representatives recorded their objections over the operationalisation of Chashma-Jhelum Link Canal by Punjab, but was explained that Punjab was using its own share. Sindh, nevertheless, insisted that the opening of the emergency link canal affected Sindh’s allocated share downstream.
Sindh was also told that its share of 76,000 cusecs was being released, which would reach its canal command areas in five to six days. Punjab’s discharges were reduced from 84,000 cusecs to 65,000 cusecs at its request.
The Irsa meeting worked out Punjab’s water availability estimate at 31.35 million acre feet (MAF) for the entire Kharif season, followed by Sindh’s 28.85MAF. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan would get 0.82MAF and 2.86MAF, respectively, during the season.
Work on Indian dams
Separately, the Reuters news agency reported that India has begun work to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects.
A “reservoir flushing” process to remove sediment began on Thursday, carried out by India’s biggest hydropower company and authorities in the occupied Kashmir, it reported.
The process initially results in sediment-laden waters being released downstream from the reservoirs, potentially causing sudden inundation, followed by a reduced flow of water as the reservoirs are refilled, one of the unnamed sources cited by Reuters said.
The report said the work may not immediately threaten supply to Pakistan, which depends on rivers flowing through India for much of its irrigation and hydropower, but it could eventually be affected if other dams launch similar efforts. There are more than half a dozen such projects in the region.
“India did not inform Pakistan about the work at the Salal and Baglihar projects, which is being done for the first time since they were built in 1987 and 2008/09, respectively, as the treaty had blocked such work,” Reuters said, quoting sources.
The report said the Indian authorities had also asked officials concerned to open the adjustable gates for cleaning, which they did from May 1. The effort was aimed at freeing dam operations from any restrictions, it added.
