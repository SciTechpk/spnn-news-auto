The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the operation was conducted based on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian Proxy Fitna al Khwarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the ISPR stated.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as the relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement read.
On Tuesday, 22 terrorists were killed during an IBO in Bannu, the ISPR said in a statement.
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-11-27 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/271538592f03306.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957713/uae-not-issuing-visas-to-pakistanis-interior-ministry-official-tells-senate-body' target='_blank'><strong>UAE not issuing visas to Pakistanis, interior ministry official tells Senate body</strong></a><br><p>Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chaudhry said on Thursday that the United Arab Emirates had not been issuing visas to Pakistanis.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.
The secretary made this revelation during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, further stating that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”.
“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” he warned.
The official said that currently, the UAE was only issuing visas to blue and diplomatic passport holders.
Separately, Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who heads the Senate committee on human rights, also confirmed that the interior ministry official’s remarks to Dawn. She said the bar was attributed to concerns about people travelling to the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.
The committee was told that the UAE was not issuing visas to Pakistanis and that very few had been issued in the recent past “after much difficulty”, she said.
Meanwhile, a senior diplomat in the UAE embassy, who wished not to be named, dismissed social media speculation that there was a ban on visas for Pakistanis. Answering a question related to the purported “ban”, he told Dawn that “there’s no ban on visas for Pakistani citizens.”
UAE envoy shares steps to facilitate visa processing
On the other hand, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M. Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi shared “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis” with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb today, the latter’s ministry said.
The reforms discussed during their meeting in Islamabad included online visa processing, e-visas without passport stamping, and faster system-to-system linkages, the finance ministry said on X.
Nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, the statement added, further outlining reforms shared by the envoy.







Ambassador Al Zaabi emphasised boosting bilateral cooperation in trade, investment and cultural ties, while “appreciating the longstanding contributions of Pakistanis working in the UAE”.
Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to strengthen the fraternal, strategic, and economic partnership between their countries, the statement said.
They also reviewed ongoing defence cooperation and agreed to continue working closely to unlock new opportunities in trade, investment, technology, people-to-people ties and other areas, it added.
Past UAE visa issues
Visa rejections were also faced by Pakistani citizens in early July, which prompted Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to raise the issue with his UAE counterpart.
In a meeting on July 11, UAE Lt Gen Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured Naqvi of “full support” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens as the Pakistani minister sought “relaxation in visa policies”.
In April, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi announced that visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could now avail a five-year visa.

 

This came after the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis, in January, was told that some visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed”.
Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig had said the above, adding that the UAE government had reservations that Pakistanis on “visit visas, not work visas”, resort to begging in the country.
However, the committee’s chairman, Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, said there were “no restrictions on work visas” for Pakistanis travelling to the Gulf country.</p><small>2025-11-27 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27220944ea71a5f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957735/police-move-shangla-woman-to-shelter-home-over-fears-her-family-will-attempt-to-kill-her' target='_blank'><strong>Police move Shangla woman to shelter home over fears her family will attempt to kill her</strong></a><br><p>Shangla police on Thursday sent a woman to a Darul Aman shelter home after expressing fear for her following a video of her that went viral on social media.
Aloch Police Station House Officer (SHO) Khurshid Ali told Dawn that the woman contacted the station, stating that her life is at risk and that her family is plotting to kill her.
“We sent a team to the area and brought the woman to the police station, where we recorded her statement,” SHO said.
He further said that the woman said a man filmed a video with her and uploaded it to social media, which drew the ire of her family.
“She said in the statement that her family might kill her and requested police protection,” SHO Ali said.
The officer added that the woman was produced before the magistrate on duty in the Chakesar courts, where, on his order, she was moved to the shelter home in Swat.
“We have started work on the case and submitted it to the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency,” SHO Ali added.
Replying to a question, he elaborated that the suspect had fled the area, but expressed hope that they would arrest him with the help of the NCCIA.
“The woman was married to a man in a village in Puran,” the SHO added. “However, due to domestic issues, she had filed for divorce and the case is still ongoing.”
In September, a judicial magistrate in Karachi sentenced a man to a total of six years in prison for creating fake Facebook accounts in his friend’s name and misusing them to share her inappropriate photographs in an attempt to blackmail her.
Judicial Magistrate (East) Yusra Ashfaq found Abdullah Saleem guilty of offences under Sections 20 (dignity of natural person), 21 (modesty of natural person and minor) and 24 (cyberstalking) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016, and awarded him two years’ imprisonment on each count.</p><small>2025-11-27 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/271814161dc4691.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957725/local-rivals-hamza-noor-set-for-cas-squash-final-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Local rivals Hamza, Noor set for CAS squash final clash</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s squash renaissance is guaranteed a homegrown champion as young compatriots and relatives Hamza Khan and Noor Zaman Khan stormed into the final of the Chief of Air Staff (CAS) Serena Hotel International Squash Championship on Thursday, setting up an all-Pakistan title decider.
The final, to be played on Friday, pits the world number 101, Hamza, against the second seed and world number 43, Noor, with both players expressing their ambition to restore Pakistan to its former glory on the global squash scene.
Hamza continued his sensational run in the tournament, adding Switzerland’s David Bernet to his list of scalps just a day after stunning top-seeded Egyptian Karim El Hamamy.
He secured a gripping 11-9, 11-13, 12-10, 11-5 victory in a 55-minute semi-final thriller.
After an evenly matched first game, Bernet mounted a comeback, edging a nail-biting second set. Hamza reclaimed control, winning a tight third set before dominating the fourth with powerful cross-court shots to seal the match.
“I am super happy for winning this match. For the first time in my career,” Hamza said while talking to Dawn.com. “I am going to play this level of PSA tournament of US $35000. This will help improving my ranking,” added the 20-year-old.
He expressed excitement about facing Noor in the final, recalling their last meeting.
“Last time we [I and Noor] played each other in USA Junior Open in 2021, where I defeated Noor 3-1 and now after four years, we are going to play another final.”
“I am fully prepared to put strong fight in final. I am hopeful for victory as throughout in this tournament my performance remained outstanding as I caused upset against top seed,” he said, while also appreciating Noor’s performance.
Highlighting the broader success for Pakistan, he noted: “This a great thing that in this championship, we defeated all around eight Egyptian players, so our squash is on right track and hopefully, we will bring lost glory back.”
While citing legends Jansher and Jahangir Khan as inspirations, Hamza also highlighted the influence of his family.
“But, I will also highlight name of Shahid Zaman and Mansoor Zaman, whose game inspire me a lot as squash is our family game.”
Reflecting on his journey Hamza added that he started playing from a young age of 11 and after a lot of hard work clinched the junior championship in 2023.
“It was a proud moment as Pakistan had to wait for 37 long year to win this title after Jansher.”
In the second semi-final, Noor’s path to the final was less arduous as his opponent, Nasir Iqbal, conceded the match due to a stomach ailment.
After Noor won the first set 11-5, during which Nasir took a three-minute medical break, the latter retired after just two points in the second set, handing the Under-23 world champion an 11-5, 11-1 triumph.
Noor, the 21-year-old grandson of legend Qamar Zaman, said he is in good form and hopeful for the final.
“It was unfortunate that after Jansher and Jahangir era, our squash gradually faced decline, but now things are improving,” Noor told Dawn.
“I love squash. At the age of seven, I started playing under the valuable guidance of my grandfather legendary Qamar Zaman, now my main target is to improve my ranking and become part of world top 30 players within one year and so,” he added.
Nasir explained his decision to retire was precautionary.
“Recently, I was infected with dengue and still am not fully fit,” the 31-year-old Nasir revealed while talking to Dawn.com. “So I decided to give up this match to keep myself fit for upcoming mega international squash tournament, which will be held in Karachi in January.”</p><small>2025-11-27 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27213749f3550cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957734/three-chinese-citizens-killed-in-tajikistan-in-attack-launched-from-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Three Chinese citizens killed in Tajikistan in attack launched from Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>At least three Chinese workers in Tajikistan were killed in an attack launched from Afghanistan near the border, Tajik authorities said on Thursday.
Tajikistan has strained relations with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and several border clashes have broken out in recent months.
The foreign ministry said a drone and firearm attack hit workers of a Chinese company in the country’s south.’
“The attack, carried out with firearms and a drone loaded with grenades, claimed the lives of three employees of Chinese nationality,” it said in a statement.
Dushanbe rarely comments officially on such incidents, and it did not say who it suspects carried out the attack.
Militants are active in the mountainous border region, which spans around 1,350 kilometres between the two countries.
Muslim-majority Tajikistan, one of the poorest countries in the former Soviet Union, has been concerned about possible flare-ups in extremism since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon, in power since 1992, is openly critical of the Taliban and urged the group to respect the rights of ethnic Tajiks, estimated to make up around a quarter of Afghanistan’s 40-million population.
At the same time, Tajikistan has cautiously engaged in some areas, including through diplomatic meetings, the opening of markets in border towns and supplying electricity.
Tajikistan’s foreign ministry said on Thursday, “Criminal groups located in the neighbouring country (Afghanistan) continue to commit acts aimed at destabilising the situation in the border regions.”
Several Chinese companies operate in Tajikistan, particularly in mining and natural resources, often located in the mountainous border areas.
One Chinese worker was killed last year in a similar attack near the Afghan border.</p><small>2025-11-27 17:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/272152267e7fc8c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957719/brilliant-chameera-seals-thrilling-win-over-pakistan-as-sri-lanka-make-t20-tri-series-final' target='_blank'><strong>Brilliant Chameera seals thrilling win over Pakistan as Sri Lanka make T20 tri-series final</strong></a><br><p>Dushmantha Chameera held his nerve with a barrage of pinpoint yorkers in the final over as Sri Lanka defended 184 to beat Pakistan by seven runs in a nerve-jangling Twenty20 International tri-series encounter at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Thursday night.
Needing 10 off the last six balls with three wickets in hand, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha (unbeaten 63 off 44) could only manage a single and watch helplessly as Faheem Ashraf (seven) holed out to long-on and Mohammad Wasim blocked the final perfect yorker.
A packed house fell silent as Sri Lanka clinched victory and stormed into the Saturday final.
Pakistan were reeling at 43 for 4 in the sixth over after Chameera removed Sahibzada Farhan (nine) and Babar Azam (zero) in the space of three deliveries and young pacer Eshan Malinga rattled Saim Ayub’s (27 off 18) stumps.
From that precarious position, Salman and Usman Khan (33 off 23) launched a spirited counter-attack, adding 56 for the fifth wicket and keeping the asking rate in sight.
Usman fell trying one big shot too many against Wanindu Hasaranga (1-27), but Mohammad Nawaz (27 off 16) joined his skipper to raise Pakistan’s hopes again.
The pair smashed 70 in just 36 balls for the sixth wicket, with Nawaz clubbing two sixes and Salman bringing up a classy fifty. When Nawaz skied one to long-off with 22 needed off 12, the equation still looked gettable.
However, Chameera — who finished with superb figures of 4-20 — returned to dismiss Faheem in the penultimate over and then sealed the game with ice-cool execution under pressure.
Pakistan’s chase had begun confidently with Sahibzada and Saim adding 28 in the first three overs. But Chameera’s double strike in the fourth over — Sahibzada caught at cover and Babar trapped plumb in front — triggered a familiar top-order wobble.
Saim’s flamboyant 27 ended when Malinga (2-54) dragged one back to crash into off-stump, and when Fakhar Zaman (one) miscued to midwicket, Pakistan were staring at another collapse.
Salman, though, stood firm. Elegant drives were followed by audacious ramps and inside-out lofts as he carried the fight almost single-handedly.
His unbeaten 63 — laced with four fours and three sixes — ensured Pakistan took it to the final delivery, but it proved just short.
Earlier, Kamil Mishara’s scintillating 76 off 48 balls — studded with six fours and three sixes — formed the backbone of Sri Lanka’s imposing 184 for 5.
Put in to bat by Pakistan, Sri Lanka lost Pathum Nissanka early to a beauty from Salman Mirza, but Kusal Mendis (40 off 23) and the 23-year-old Mishara added a brisk 66 for the second wicket to wrest the initiative.
Even after Mendis fell lbw to a straighter one from leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed, Mishara continued to dominate, reaching his fifty in style with an inside-out six off part-timer Saim.
Pakistan’s bowlers struggled to contain the flow of runs on a batting-friendly surface. Wasim and Faheem proved expensive, while Abrar  (2-28) was the pick of the attack with his clever variations.
A late flourish from Dasun Shanaka (17 off 10) and a run-out off the final ball — Shanaka stranded after a mix-up with Janith Liyanage (24 not out) — pushed Sri Lanka past 180, a total that looked unlikely during a brief mid-innings wobble.
Sri Lanka raced to 58 without loss in the six-over powerplay, with Mendis particularly severe on anything short. The wicket of Nissanka — bowled by a clever slower cutter from Salman — briefly applied the brakes, but Mendis and Mishara ensured the scoring rate never dipped below nine an over.
Abrar provided Pakistan their second breakthrough when he trapped Mendis in front with one that skidded straight, ending a dazzling knock that contained six fours and a six.
Kusal Perera’s struggle continued as he holed out to backward point off Saim for a labored six, leaving Sri Lanka 96 for 3 in the 11th over.
Mishara, however, refused to allow Pakistan any breathing space. He switch-hit Abrar for six, lofted Nawaz over long-on and punished anything short or wide with disdain.
His dismissal in the 17th over — skying a slog-sweep to long-on off Abrar — finally gave Pakistan some relief, but by then the damage was done.
Liyanage and Shanaka added 31 in quick time for the fifth wicket. Shanaka’s cameo included two towering sixes and two crunching fours, though his innings ended in unfortunate fashion when a desperate second run off the last ball resulted in a run-out, Babar’s direct hit from midwicket finding him well short.</p><small>2025-11-27 16:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/271954228058755.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957731/fbi-director-says-suspect-in-us-national-guard-shooting-worked-with-partner-forces-in-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>FBI director says suspect in US National Guard shooting worked with partner forces in Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>US FBI Director Kash Patel said on Thursday that the suspected shooter of two National Guard members had worked in Afghanistan with partner forces.
“We are fully investigating that aspect of his background as well to include any known associates that are either overseas or here in the United States of America, that is what a broad-based international terrorism investigation looks like,” Patel said at a news conference.
The suspect worked with “the US government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar,” during the US war in Afghanistan, CIA Director John Ratcliffe told the New York Times and Fox News.
The two soldiers, part of a militarised law enforcement mission ordered by President Donald Trump months ago and challenged in court by Washington DC officials, were hospitalised and had come through surgery, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.
The suspect, who was wounded in an exchange of gunfire before he was arrested, was identified by the Department of Homeland Security as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national.
Bondi told Fox News on Thursday that the two wounded soldiers were a man and woman.
She said the US government planned to bring terrorism charges against the gunman and seek a sentence of life in prison “at a minimum.”
Investigators seized numerous electronic devices from the suspect’s house in Washington state, including cellphones, laptops, and iPads, Patel said at the news conference.
US Attorney for Washington, D.C. Jeanine Pirro identified the two wounded Guardsmen as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24. She said they had been sworn in as National Guard members fewer than 24 hours before the shooting.
Pirro said the suspect ambushed the two while they were patrolling near the White House. Armed with a powerful handgun, a .357 Magnum, he shot one Guardsman who fell and then shot again before firing multiple times at the second Guardsman.
Processing of Afghan immigration requests halted
Trump, who was at his resort in Florida at the time of the attack, released a prerecorded video statement late on Wednesday calling the shooting “an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror.” He said his administration would “re-examine” all Afghans who came to the US during Joe Biden’s presidency.
The US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency later said that it has halted processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely, “pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”
According to the DHS, Lakanwal entered the US in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program to resettle thousands of Afghans who assisted the US during the Afghanistan war and feared reprisals from Taliban forces who seized control of their homeland after the US withdrawal.
NBC News, citing an interview with an unnamed relative of the suspect, reported early on Thursday that Lakanwal served in the Afghan army for 10 years alongside US Special Forces troops and was stationed in Kandahar for part of that time.
The relative also said Lakanwal was working for online retail giant Amazon.com the last time they spoke several months ago, according to NBC News.
The DHS did not include other details of his immigration record, but a Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024 and was approved on April 23 of this year, three months after Trump took office.
Lakanwal, 29, who resided in Washington state, had no known criminal history, the official said.
The shooting unfolded at midday outside a subway station in a bustling commercial area within a few blocks of the White House. Secret Service agents placed the presidential mansion under a security lockdown immediately after the shooting as a precaution.
In response to Wednesday’s shooting, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had asked to send another 500 National Guard troops to join the more than 2,000 Guard soldiers previously mobilised in the nation’s capital.
Vice President JD Vance, who was in Kentucky on Wednesday, said in a post on X that the shooting proved that the Trump administration’s immigration policy was justified.“We must redouble our efforts to deport people with no right to be in our country,” he said.







Critics of the Trump administration’s immigration policy say it has employed illegal harsh tactics and swept up immigrants indiscriminately, including some with no criminal history and others in the United States legally.

Attack outside subway station
Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has clashed openly with Trump over the deployment of Guard troops in her city, told reporters hours after the incident, “this is a targeted shooting.”
At the same news briefing, Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, said the two Guard soldiers were “ambushed” and that the known assailant appeared to have acted alone.
The two soldiers, members of the West Virginia National Guard, were on a “high-visibility patrol” outside the entrance to a subway station when the suspect “came around the corner,” drew a weapon and immediately fired at the pair, Carroll said.
After an exchange of gunfire, other National Guard troops subdued the suspect, he said.
Trump said in August he was ordering the National Guard deployment to fight crime in a city he said had become unsafe, despite objections from District of Columbia officials who challenged the move in court as an infringement on local government control.</p><small>2025-11-27 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2713505125c9ded.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957707/imaan-mazari-hadi-ali-chatta-object-to-new-court-appointed-lawyer-after-previous-counsels-vanishing-act' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari, Hadi Ali Chatta object to new court-appointed lawyer after previous counsel’s vanishing act</strong></a><br><p>Lawyer and rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, on Thursday objected after the apparent vanishing act of the court-appointed lawyer representing them in the controversial social media posts case and the appointment of a new counsel.
Judge Afzal Majoka, who has been presiding over the case’s proceedings, too, was also seemingly unaware of the finalisation of the appointment of the new counsel when Advocate Taimur Janjua showed up in the Islamabad district and sessions court instead of Advocate Shakeel Jatt.
Advocate Jatt, who attended the case’s hearing as Imaan and Hadi’s court-appointed defence counsel for the first time on Tuesday, had previously refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying that he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.
“I am in favour of a fair trial. I cannot ask questions that are dictated [to me]. My conscience does not allow this,” he had said. The counsel had alleged without sharing any specific details that he had “received 15 questions with the instructions that he should ask them during the cross-examination”.
Advocate Jatt had also sought more time from the court to prepare for the case, but Advocate Janjua showed up at the hearing today to represent Imaan and Hadi.
When he informed the court that he had been appointed as the couple’s counsel, Judge Majoka said the court had not yet received a notification in this regard.
A three-member prosecution team present at the hearing assured the court that the relevant notification would be submitted.
For her part, Mazari objected to the change, questioning who had made the new appointment and through what process. She also raised concerns over the “disappearance” of Advocate Jatt.
Mazari contended that she or Chattha had not expressed any lack of confidence in Advocate Jatt and requested the court to record their statements on the matter.
She further raised doubts over an application said to be submitted by Advocate Jatt for his removal as the duo’s lawyer. Moreover, she questioned why the court had not objected to the disclosures made by Advocate Jatt at the previous hearing.
After the court provided a copy of Advocate Jatt’s application to Chattha, the latter requested the judge to summon the lawyer. He also contended the defence had “not rejected” the counsel.
However, the prosecution objected to Chattha’s request, arguing that “while a sessions judge is the appropriate authority to summon a state-appointed counsel, the court hearing the case is not the relevant forum for such an action”.
The proceedings were suspended for a while after Mazari and Chattha requested for time to consult the newly appointed counsel. Judge Majoka accepted their request and the hearing was later adjourned for Saturday.
Earlier in the day, the court had suspended the proceedings twice, first until 10 am and later until 11 am, awaiting the appearance of the accused and a clarification about the appointment of a counsel for them.
An order from the office of the Islamabad west district and sessions judge regarding the appointment, a copy of which is available with Dawn, states: “Consequent upon the request made by Mr Muhammad Afzal Majoka, additional sessions judge Islamabad west, for the appointment of a defence counsel at state expenses, for Hadi Ali Chattha and Imaan Zainab Mazari accused […] Muhammad Taimoor Janjua is appointed as the defence counsel on state expenses.”
The proceedings were resumed after Mazari and Chattha held a meeting with Advocate Janjua. In a joint statement recorded before the court, the couple claimed that the new counsel was not following their instructions and that they did not trust him.
For his part, Advocate Janjua denied compelling them to follow any directions of his, saying that he only acted under the court’s instructions.
Chattha also filed an acquittal application during the hearing, urging the court to hear his arguments before calling the witnesses for cross-examination.
In his arguments, Chattha maintained that the first information report (FIR) registered in the case with the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) was based on a “flawed source report”.
He alleged that the FIR was based on a source report that did not comply with legal requirements, and that screenshots submitted by the prosecution as evidence were taken from different devices and then combined to form a single image.
No mobile device had been seized, and no verification was obtained from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, he argued.
Moreover, the FIR was registered 22 days after the date visible in the timestamps in the screenshots, he further alleged.
Chattha also read out complainant Shehroz Riaz’s statement in the court.
He contended that the entire case was based on “just two Twitter accounts and a single report”. The NCCIA’s procedure for the registration of the FIR was not followed, he claimed, urging the court to accept his acquittal application.
The case against Imaan and Chattha has been registered with the NCCIA on accusations of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country in the case.
The two were indicted in the case on October 30, a day after the latter was arrested outside the courtroom over non-appearance. Mazari said that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom”.
Speaking to reporters after his release, Chattha had maintained that he had appeared in court five minutes ahead of time for the proceedings on October 29, but the judge had issued an arrest warrant “to his face”.
Before Tuesday’s hearing, Mazari had also alleged that the court had “forcibly appointed [a] state defence counsel” for her and Chattha.</p><small>2025-11-27 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/272018356b946c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957732/fia-initiates-action-against-social-media-accounts-spreading-reports-of-arbitrary-offloading-of-passengers' target='_blank'><strong>FIA initiates action against social media accounts spreading reports of arbitrary offloading of passengers</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has initiated legal action, through the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), against those involved in spreading fabricated information on social media regarding the offloading of passengers.
Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. Earlier this month, FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.
According to sources, more than 15 such social media accounts have initially been found to be involved in spreading baseless propaganda and hatred against provinces.
It has been learned that the FIA has initiated action by identifying social media accounts spreading fabricated information. Legal action is being taken through the NCCIA under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, against those involved in the baseless propaganda.

 

According to FIA officials, some elements were sharing fake and misleading posts regarding the offloading of passengers, aimed at damaging the institution’s reputation and creating concern among the public. They added that the FIA Immigration Wing does not offload passengers who have complete documents and a legitimate reason for travel at any airport in the country.
Passengers with incomplete or fake travel documents are offloaded. Those who provide suspicious or unclear information, as well as those suspected of being influenced by human traffickers or illegal agents, are also offloaded. In the past, strict action was taken against individuals with a history of illegal activities or problematic travel records, added the officials.
The FIA officials made it clear that the public should not be overly concerned about the matter. Rather, they should stay away from illegal agents and always travel with complete and verified documents.
They advised that in case of a complaint, the public should contact the deputy director of the FIA Immigration Wing or its helpline at 1991.
Earlier today, the agency clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.
In a video statement shared today, FIA Lahore Zone Director Captain (retired) Muhammad Ali Zia addressed the recent issue of “misleading AI-generated videos and false information circulating on social media regarding alleged offloading incidents at airports”.
“All these rumours have no connection with reality,” Zia said, referring to reports of people being offloaded “for no reason”.</p><small>2025-11-27 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27185419032d3ff.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957730/afghans-say-last-path-to-safety-shuts-as-us-halts-visas-after-dc-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>Afghans say last path to safety shuts as US halts visas after DC shooting</strong></a><br><p>Afghans who fled the Taliban and have waited years for resettlement decision from the United States say their last path to safety has shut since Washington froze all Afghan immigration cases following a shooting near the White House.
The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said late on Wednesday it had halted processing for Afghan nationals indefinitely, hours after an Afghan man shot and critically wounded two National Guard soldiers in Washington.
US President Donald Trump called the attack “an act of terror” and ordered a review of Afghans who entered the country during Joe Biden’s presidency.
For Afghans sheltering in Pakistan, tens of thousands of whom are awaiting US resettlement decisions, the announcement felt like their last safe route had closed.

‘If I go back you will hear news of my arrest or my death’
“I was deeply distressed when I heard this news. We have completed all the required review procedures,” said Ahmad Samim Naimi, 34, from Afghanistan’s Panjshir province, who had worked as a TV presenter and press adviser under the previous, US-backed government.
He fled to Pakistan after the Taliban began detaining journalists and former government workers and he had applied for resettlement in the United States.
“If I go back, one day you will certainly hear news of either my arrest or my death,” he said.
Remaining in Pakistan has become increasingly difficult as the authorities have launched a crackdown on Afghans without formal refugee status.
Pakistan has deported more than half a million Afghans in the past year and intensified detentions in major cities.
The information and interior ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did Afghanistan’s refugee and foreign affairs ministries.
The Taliban have previously said Afghanistan is now at peace and safe for citizens to return home.
‘Risk of destruction’
Rights groups say former government workers, journalists, soldiers and people linked to Western forces face detention, disappearance or execution under Taliban rule, while women face sweeping restrictions on movement, work and education.
Another applicant for US resettlement living in Pakistan, a 40-year-old former civil servant from Kabul who declined to give his name for security reasons, said the freeze had erased everything he had built his family’s future around.
“I cannot put myself and my family at risk of destruction,” he said about returning to Afghanistan.
Single incident shuts a door for many
US forces and aid bodies employed thousands of Afghans as interpreters and local staff during America’s longest war, which ended when the Taliban seized power in 2021.
After abandoning Kabul, the Biden administration announced Operation Allies Welcome to offer refuge to Afghans at special risk of persecution because of their association with the United States.
But there have been long waits, including for those granted priority treatment “P1” for those who worked directly for the US government and “P2” for those who worked on US-funded projects or for media, aid or civil society organisations.
Officials identified the suspected Washington gunman as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, who arrived under Operation Allies Welcome and was granted asylum earlier this year. Authorities say he served in the Afghan army and had no criminal record.

Shawn VanDiver, president of AfghanEvac, a volunteer group seeking to assist Afghans who helped US forces, said about 200,000 Afghans had arrived in the United States since 2021 through refugee and special visa programmes after vetting.
“These folks don’t deserve this they’re just trying to get their shot at the American dream,” he said. “This is going to cause a lot of harm across the Afghan community in the United States.”
He said another 265,000 Afghans are still being processed abroad, including about 180,000 in the Special Immigrant Visa pipeline for those who worked for the US government. Many are waiting in countries such as Pakistan, Qatar and North Macedonia, while others remain inside Afghanistan.
Naimi said he still hopes Washington will reconsider: “I hope that the United States will reconsider the cases of those with P1 and P2 status and restart the process.”</p><small>2025-11-27 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27190646db59ffa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957728/human-rights-minister-assures-eu-mission-of-commitment-to-gsp-plus' target='_blank'><strong>Human rights minister assures EU mission of commitment to GSP Plus</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan assured the visiting European Union (EU) Monitoring Mission on Thursday of its total and complete commitment to the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+).
The country was granted GSP+ status by the EU in 2014, resulting in a 108 per cent increase in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs. In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan.

 

A seven-member EU delegation is currently visiting Karachi as part of the fifth Biennial Review of the GSP+ scheme. It is led by Sirgio Baliberia, adviser to the GSP+ Directorate in the Directorate General for Trade. The monitoring mission will scrutinise Pakistan’s record on 27 international conventions tied to the trade scheme. Maintaining GSP+ status is critical for Pakistan to keep export costs low.
A press release issued by the human rights ministry today said Human Rights and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar welcomed the delegation at its headquarters today.
“Pakistan reaffirmed its strong commitment to the GSP+ framework, emphasising that the Pakistan–EU partnership remains central to governance reforms, institutional strengthening, and sustainable development. As one of the largest beneficiaries of GSP+, Pakistan highlighted the programme’s role in advancing human-rights protections and aligning domestic legislation with international standards,” the press release said.
The delegation was briefed on “significant legislative and policy progress” since 2014, including strengthened protective mechanisms for women, children, labour, marginalised groups and people with disabilities.
The Pakistani side reaffirmed its commitment to uphold human rights despite “challenges posed by counter-terrorism and climate change” and institutional advancements were highlighted with the retention of the National Commission for Human Rights’ “A” status under the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions and the continued independent functioning of the National Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC) and the National Commission on the Status of Women.
The delegation was also informed that implementation of the National Action Plans on Human Rights and Business and Human Rights was ongoing at the federal and provincial levels.
It was also briefed on key initiatives promoting gender equality, including the National Gender Policy Framework (2022), gender-responsive budgeting and provincial measures.
“Flagship programmes such as the Benazir Income Support Programme, benefiting over 9.1 million women and the Prime Minister’s Women Empowerment Package were highlighted as major drivers of women’s socio-economic inclusion.
“Progress on child rights was emphasised, including the establishment of NCRC, Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Agency and Child Protection Institutes, alongside recent child marriage restraint legislation. Efforts continue to address child labour, online exploitation and out-of-school children,” the press release said.
The Pakistani side further reaffirmed its commitment to freedom of expression and media safety, supported by the National Commission for Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals, and provided updates on sensitive human-rights measures, including reductions in capital offences, implementation of the Mercy Petition Policy, enforcement of the Torture and Custodial Death Act and an over 85 per cent resolution of cases by the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances.
Tarar also underlined the country’s “robust constitutional and legal safeguards”, noting Pakistan’s recent election to the UN Human Rights Council as a “testament to the international community’s confidence in its constructive role”.

 

The press release pointed out that the delegation highlighted “certain areas for further attention” regarding human rights in the country and key issues requiring government action, including the need for strengthened policies, legislation, and robust institutions to effectively fulfil Pakistan’s obligations under the 27 core United Nations conventions.
“The minister reassured the delegation that the government of Pakistan remains fully committed to these obligations and noted that progress achieved to date, ongoing challenges, and future plans would be shared in detail during the delegation’s ongoing visit.
“The minister welcomed the EU’s constructive suggestions on enhancing data integration, inter-provincial coordination, treaty reporting and implementation mechanisms. Pakistan has taken these points on board and is advancing progress through strengthened reporting, provincial engagement and robust monitoring,” it said.
The press release concluded by saying that the ministry officials also commended ongoing EU-Pakistan cooperation under the Huqooq-i-Pakistan Project and reaffirmed its commitment to sustaining GSP+ progress, advancing human rights and promoting an inclusive, rights-based, and sustainable future.
GSP+ status is a special incentive awarded to developing countries to “pursue sustainable development and good governance” in exchange for cutting import duties to zero on two-thirds of the tariff lines of its exports. Governments with this status need to implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour rights, good governance and the environment.
Pakistan and the EU underlined the importance last week of further deepening trade and investment ties, including through the GSP+ scheme, as a driver for sustainable growth, export diversification, job creation and mutually beneficial economic opportunity.
Earlier that week, EU Ambassador to Pakistan Raimundas Karoblis had said the country needed to “do more” in terms of fulfilling its commitments under the GSP+ scheme ahead of a review.</p><small>2025-11-27 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27191547ad93e06.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957729/what-we-know-about-the-us-national-guard-shooting-suspect' target='_blank'><strong>What we know about the US National Guard shooting suspect</strong></a><br><p>The man suspected of shooting two National Guard soldiers near the White House on Wednesday was an Afghan national who worked alongside US forces in Afghanistan, US media reported.
Washington has labeled the violence an “act of terror” and announced increased oversight of foreigners who entered the United States from Afghanistan in recent years.
What we know about the suspected shooter
Former Afghan military - Multiple media outlets, including CNN, The New York Times, CBS and NBC identified the man as 29-year old Rahmanullah Lakanwal and say he arrived in America in 2021.
A relative of Lakanwal told NBC that he arrived after serving in the Afghan army for 10 years in support of US Special Forces.
The relative told NBC that Lakanwal originally came from Afghanistan’s southeastern Khost province and had spent some of his military service at a base in the southern province of Kandahar.
Kandahar is the birthplace of the Taliban and was the center of heavy fighting during the 20-year war between the then-insurgents and foreign-backed forces.
2021 arrival
US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the suspected shooter “was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome.” She said the Afghan national, whom she did not name, entered the United States on September 8, 2021, less than a month after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban.
US President Donald Trump signed an agreement with the Taliban in February 2020 to pave the way for the significant drawdown of US troops in Afghanistan by the end of that year – though the timeline was pushed back and conducted under the subsequent Biden administration.
‘Operation Allies Welcome’
Shortly after the Taliban took over Kabul on August 15, 2021, and as US forces withdrew, then-president Joe Biden introduced “Operation Allies Welcome” to coordinate efforts across the multiple government agencies resettling Afghans, including those who worked with US forces.
At the time, more than 40 percent of Afghans included in the program were eligible for “Special Immigrant Visa” (SIVs) for those who took “significant risks to support our military and civilian personnel in Afghanistan” on behalf of the US government in Afghanistan, as well as their family members.
Other vulnerable groups, such as advocates and journalists, also entered the US under the program. Authorities have not confirmed whether Lakanwal received an SIV.
Those who entered the United States under Operation Allies Welcome received security vetting from several government agencies, including the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center.
The Biden administration renamed the efforts in September 2022 “Enduring Welcome” (EW) to signify a pivot to a long-term strategy that would focus on helping Afghans obtain more durable, long-term legal status, primarily through the SIV program or the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).
Mass evacuations
During the turbulent US withdrawal from Afghanistan that saw Kabul’s airport deteriorate into chaos as thousands tried to evacuate, Biden pledged his administration would find a way out for those who helped the US.
Hundreds of thousands of Afghans worked for foreign forces and embassies and joined US-funded NGOs throughout the 20-year foreign presence. Many feared that made them a target for violence, including by the Taliban.
The United Nations has reported extrajudicial killings and disappearances of former Afghan officials under the Taliban authorities, despite them declaring an amnesty against former enemies.
More than 190,000 Afghans have been resettled to the United States through EW and its predecessor Operation Allies Welcome since the Taliban takeover, according to the US State Department.
Tens of thousands more, including many former military translators and members of the Afghan security forces, are in the pipeline for resettlement, according to advocacy groups.
In June, Trump declared a sweeping new travel ban on 12 countries, including Afghanistan, which complicated matters, according to Shawn VanDiver, the president of the AfghanEvac non-profit group.
VanDiver said it was especially hard for some 12,000 people awaiting reunification with family members already living in the United States.</p><small>2025-11-27 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/271907070c8c5c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956540/cinemascope-predatory-behaviour' target='_blank'><strong>CINEMASCOPE : PREDATORY BEHAVIOUR</strong></a><br><p>With Predator: Badlands, director Dan Trachtenberg (of the brilliant 10 Cloverfield Lane) brings one of cinema’s most semi-appealing alien species closer to first-tier status — if not fully, then nearly.
But to make it to the big league, the aliens from the hardcore hunting species, the Yautja (that’s their name) needed a bigger brand and a little mythic scaffolding: the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, the malevolent backbone of the Aliens franchise.
For those to whom these names sound like gobbledygook, here’s the gist: since the first two Predator movies — the wildly popular 1987 original with Arnold Schwarzenegger and the less financially successful 1990 sequel with Danny Glover — the franchise has been in a persistent rut. Despite novel and comic publishers regularly putting Predators on shelves (the Yautja have fought Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Wolverine and even crossed paths with Archie), the films were sporadic and uneven in terms of their storytelling and lore-making. Predators (2010), starring Adrien Brody, was a moderate success — it made three times its $40 million budget — and The Predator (2018, starring Olivia Munn) was less successful.
For a while, Predators leaned heavily on Aliens for support. The clash has long been a fan favourite, birthed in the comics, spawning two Alien vs Predator (AvP) films — both of which were atrocities, though they were financially successful to a degree. Yet they did little to boost the Yautja’s fortunes at 20th Century Fox.

Although Predator: Badlands is not built on an original premise, it is a superior, familiar story that works

That changed when Trachtenberg arrived with Prey (2022), a Hulu original set in 1719. He followed it with the animated anthology Predator: Killer of Killers (2025), again for Hulu, nudging the Yautja mythos credibility up a notch. Even so, the franchise still needed the Aliens heft.
This brings us to Badlands — a film that wholeheartedly extends itself into the Aliens lore (and not in the janky manner of the AvP movies). Rather than throw Xenomorphs yet again into the fray, Trachtenberg and screenwriter Patrick Aison (who also wrote Prey) bank on another nefarious creation of the Aliens stories: the androids called Synthetics.
Elle Fanning plays the synthetic Thia and her ‘sister’ Tessa. Tessa, pressured by the corporation, is cold and ‘robotic’, while Thia — bubbly and talkative — sits decapitated on a hill, surrounded by plants that fire paralysing darts into a world called Genna, a planet even Yautja fear because it teems with lethal wildlife.
From Genna, the Weyland-Yutani Corp wants Kalisk, the apex predator of this world, which cannot be killed because of its regenerative abilities; the Yautja — especially Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi), the runt of the clan — crave it as a warrior’s trophy.

Dek’s father is a ruthless clan leader and though his mission begins as one of redemption and revenge, it gradually becomes one of friendship, with the Yautja strapping the half-decapitated torso of Thia on his back like a backpack (Vikram Baital and Demon Slayer much?) as he braves the treacherous terrain. The two also find a critter companion — named Bud — and become a small clan of sorts.
Badlands, though not built on an original premise, is a superior, familiar story that simply works. Trachtenberg is not a refined director, but his storytelling carries the film well enough through a first half that doesn’t always look visually believable (we finally see the fabled world Yautja Prime, but it lacks visual appeal). The second half is a notable improvement, as the story rumbles toward a feel-good climax.
Badlands leads directly into a sequel — one that brings in another character from Predator lore — and, with the way things have been handled, Trachtenberg and Aison’s sincere approach would be more than welcome.
Released by 20th Century Fox and HKC, Predator: Badlands is rated PG-13 and offers action-science-fiction adventure buffs plenty to appreciate

He made the remarks while addressing the business community in Manama. The premier had arrived in the country’s capital a day earlier and held delegation-level talks with Bahrain’s leadership at Al Qudaibiya Palace.
In his address, PM Shehbaz said that strategic cooperation had existed between the two countries for decades.
Addressing Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, he said: “Pakistan is ready to enhance economic cooperation with Bahrain in the fields of agriculture, information technology, artificial intelligence, financial technology and all other areas where our two countries can really work together, and create synergy through our efforts and our knowledge and our experience and our commitment to support each other.”
He said ties between Islamabad and Manama were based on cultural, religious, mutual respect and trust. These “are the pillars of our relations”, he added.
He termed his recent meetings with Bahrain’s leadership “extremely productive”.







“I am not a visitor here. I have come here to meet my family members, our Bahraini brothers and sisters,” he said.
“This is what our relationship is all about. Now we have to convert these wonderful relations into economic cooperation,” he added.
The premier highlighted that Pakistan possessed a “great youth bulge”.
“Sixty per cent of our population comprises young boys and girls within the [age] bracket of 15 to 30 years,” he said.
He added that the country was “committed” to converting this challenge into an opportunity by empowering the youth and training them in the fields of information technology and artificial intelligence, along with providing vocational and skills training.
“Together with our Bahraini brothers, entrepreneurs, we will create a great momentum in this field,” he said.
“I think this is the time to really catch up because time and tide wait for none,” PM Shehbaz stressed.
He also talked about the Pakistani community in Bahrain. The premier added that in every country he visited, he interacted with Pakistani communities and listened to the “stories of men and women whose love for Pakistan has never faded, even as they have dedicated their talent, loyalty and hard work to the progress of other nations and cultures”.
“The more I learn of these journeys, the more convinced I become that the Pakistani identity is not bound by geography. It is in the hearts of our people wherever they may be. Here in Bahrain, that spirit is visible beyond any ray of doubt,” he emphasised.
PM Shehbaz appreciated the Pakistanis living in Bahrain for their services to both countries.
“You are great ambassadors of Pakistan, and we are very proud of your contribution to Pakistan’s national economic development,” he said.
“Your hard-earned money, valuable remittances amounting to $484 million in the last financial year, is indeed highly appreciated.”







He also expressed gratitude to the Bahraini leadership for its love, affection, and support for the Pakistani diaspora.
PM Shehbaz added that Islamabad offered scale, talent, resources and a growing consumer market that was “strategically located, connecting to the wider region”.
“Combined with Bahrain’s financial expertise, business acumen and global outlook, the potential is huge and enormous,” he said, adding that Pakistan was undergoing a structural transformation, embodying economic reforms, digital modernisation and a decisive push for a private sector-led growth.
“We have cut red tape forever, strengthened our regulations and opened new sectors such as agri-business, information technology, minerals, energy and tourism for long-term partnership,” he highlighted. He added that Pakistan wanted to work with Bahrain and learn from its experience and expertise.
He further mentioned that the Gulf Cooperation Council Free Trade Agreement (GCC FTA) had been “nearly finalised and is expected to be signed soon”.







“This will enhance trade between Pakistan and the GCC countries, particularly with Bahrain,” he said. The premier ended his address by encouraging Bahraini investors interested in collaborating with Pakistan to “let this moment be your launching pad for a bold and meaningful collaboration”.
In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said engaging with Bahraini business leaders was a pleasure and said that there is significant potential in healthcare, energy, tourism and other high-growth sectors.
“Pakistan stands ready to facilitate Bahraini investment and deepen mutually beneficial collaboration,” the PM wrote.







Dar meets Bahrain’s finance minister, discusses economic cooperation
Earlier today, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who is accompanying the premier on his visit, met Bahrain’s Finance Minister Sheikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa.







In a press release, the Foreign Office said that the two ministers had a “fruitful discussion” that focused on enhancing cooperation in the finance sector.
“Bahrain has made significant progress in fintech and offered to share its expertise with the Pakistani banking sector,” the FO said.
It said that the two ministers discussed avenues of cooperation between the central banks of the two countries.
“The two sides further decided to establish teams of relevant officials to chalk out a roadmap for future collaboration in the fields of finance, banking, commerce and economy,” the FO added.</p><small>2025-11-27 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27131841b4cc8ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957695/death-toll-from-massive-hong-kong-blaze-rises-to-65-with-over-250-missing-police-blame-construction-firm' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from massive Hong Kong blaze rises to 65, with over 250 missing; police blame construction firm</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from a massive blaze in a Hong Kong apartment complex rose to 65 on Thursday, with over 250 still missing, as police said the fire may have been caused by a “grossly negligent” construction firm using unsafe materials.
Almost a full day after the fire began, firefighters were struggling to reach residents potentially trapped on the upper floors of the Wang Fuk Court housing complex due to intense heat and thick smoke from the blaze that erupted on Wednesday afternoon.
Hong Kong’s government said the death toll from the fire had risen to 65.
The fire had “claimed 65 lives and injured 70 people” by 8pm local time (5pm PKT), a government spokesperson told AFP, citing fire service figures, adding that 10 firefighters had been injured since the blaze broke out yesterday.
The tightly packed complex in the northern Tai Po district has 2,000 apartments in eight blocks that are home to more than 4,600 people in a city struggling with chronic shortages of affordable housing.
“We bought [a place] in this building more than 20 years ago. All of our belongings were in this building, and now that it has all burned like this, what’s left?” asked a 51-year-old resident with the surname Wan.
“There’s nothing left. What are we supposed to do?”



A firefighter was among those killed, with dozens in hospital in critical condition, Hong Kong authorities said on Thursday afternoon. Around 279 people remain uncontactable.
Among the dead was a 37-year-old firefighter, who was found with burns on his face half an hour after losing contact with colleagues, according to the fire service director Andy Yeung.
Earlier in the day, a government spokesman told AFP that 56 people were being treated in hospital. Sixteen were in a critical condition, 24 in a serious condition and 16 were stable.
Eileen Chung, a Hong Kong police superintendent, said 900 residents were spread across eight shelters.
The fire was still burning in the afternoon, more than 24 hours after it started.
Sections of charred scaffolding fell from the burning blocks, and flames could be seen inside apartments, sometimes belching out through windows into the night sky, casting an eerie orange glow on surrounding buildings. An AFP reporter heard loud cracking sounds, possibly from the burning bamboo.

A 65-year-old resident surnamed Yuen said he had lived in the complex for more than four decades and that many of his neighbours were elderly and might not be mobile.
“The windows were closed because of the maintenance, [some people] didn’t know there was a fire and had to be told to evacuate via phone calls by neighbours,” Yuen told AFP. “I’m devastated.”
A woman surnamed Ng, 52, was distraught as she searched for her daughter outside a shelter. “She and her father are still not out yet. They didn’t have water to save our building,” she sobbed, carrying her daughter’s graduation photo.
Authorities said they had brought the blaze in four of seven blocks under control, with operations continuing in three. Bamboo scaffolding is a mainstay of traditional Chinese architecture but has been subject to a phase-out in Hong Kong since March for safety reasons.
Three arrested
Police officers searched the housing estate’s building maintenance company on Thursday morning, seizing documents that mention Wang Fuk Court, local media reported. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“We have reason to believe that the company’s responsible parties were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,” said police superintendent Chung.
Three men from the construction company, two directors and one engineering consultant, had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter over the fire, she added.
Police said in addition to the buildings being covered with protective mesh sheets and plastic that may not meet fire standards, they discovered some windows on one unaffected building were sealed with a foam material, installed by a construction company carrying out year-long maintenance work.







Indonesia’s foreign ministry said on Thursday that two Indonesian migrant workers “in the domestic sector” died in the fire and two others were injured.
The death toll is now the highest in a Hong Kong fire since 1948, when 176 people were killed in a warehouse blaze. Hong Kong’s corruption body said it has launched an investigation into suspected corruption related to the renovation.
China’s Xi urges ‘all-out’ effort against fire
From the mainland, China’s President Xi Jinping urged an “all-out effort” to extinguish the fire and to minimise casualties and losses, China’s state broadcaster CCTV said.
Xi expressed condolences to the victims, including “the firefighter who died in the line of duty”, according to state media.







Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened at the tragic loss of lives and property.
“Our heartfelt condolences go out to President Xi Jinping and the Chinese nation, particularly the people of Hong Kong on this tragic incident,” he said.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families, and we wish a speedy recovery to all those injured,” he said.
“Pakistan stands in solidarity with the people and government of China, especially the Hong Kong SAR (special administrative region), during this difficult time. May the affected families find strength and healing. Pakistan and China will always stand together,” he said.







Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also said he was deeply saddened to learn about the “devastating fire”.
“On behalf of the government and people of Pakistan, I extend our deepest condolences and profound sympathy to you, the Hong Kong special administrative region government, and especially to the families of the victims. Our thoughts are with those who have lost their loved ones, and we pray for the swift and complete recovery of the injured,” he said.







Searching for relatives
Harry Cheung, aged 66, who has lived at Block Two in one of the complexes for more than 40 years, said he heard a loud noise at about 2:45pm (11:45am PKT) and saw fire erupt in a nearby block.
“I immediately went back to pack up my things,” he said. “I don’t even know how I feel right now. I’m just thinking about where I’m going to sleep tonight.”

Another long-time resident, a woman surnamed Chu, said she still had not been able to contact her friends who live in the next block. After staying over at a friend’s place on Wednesday night, the 70-year-old came back to see her home still burning.
“We don’t know what to do,” she said.
An online app showed missing persons reports submitted through a linked Google document that detailed residents of individual towers and rooms.
It includes descriptions like “Mother-in-law in her 70s, missing”, or “one boy and one girl”, or “Rooftop: 33-year-old male.” One description simply says “27th floor, room 1: He is dead”.
Reuters could not independently verify the information on the app.
The fire has prompted comparisons to the Grenfell Tower inferno that killed 72 people in London in 2017. That fire was blamed on firms fitting the exterior with flammable cladding, as well as failings by the government and the construction industry.
“Our hearts go out to all those affected by the horrific fire in Hong Kong,” the Grenfell United survivors’ group said on social media. “To the families, friends and communities, we stand with you. You are not alone.”







A Tai Po resident surnamed So, 57, said the fire was “heartbreaking”.
“There’s nothing that can be done about the property. We can only hope that everyone, no matter old or young, can return safely,” So told AFP.
An apartment owner in his 40s who did not want to give his name told AFP that the government needed to help those made homeless by the blaze.
“The fire is not yet under control and I dare not leave, and I don’t know what I can do,” he said.
Residents were seen being evacuated via large coaches, with local media reporting that adjacent blocks were also being cleared. Sections of a nearby highway were also closed by the firefighting operation.
Hong Kong’s sky-high property prices have long been a trigger for social discontent in the city and the fire tragedy could further stoke resentment towards authorities ahead of a city-wide legislative election in early December.

Deadly fires were once a regular scourge in Hong Kong, especially in poorer neighbourhoods. However, safety measures have been ramped up in recent decades and such fires have become much less commonplace.
Wang Fuk Court is one of many high-rise housing complexes in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Tai Po, located near the border with mainland China, is an established suburban district with some 300,000 residents.
Occupied since 1983, the complex is under the government’s subsidised home ownership scheme, according to property agency websites. According to online posts, it has been undergoing renovations for a year at a cost of HK$330 million ($42.43m), with each unit paying between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000.</p><small>2025-11-27 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2718031334dd9ea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957712/sindh-assembly-rejects-indian-defence-ministers-delusional-remarks-on-province-as-attempt-to-distort-history' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh Assembly rejects Indian defence minister’s ‘delusional’ remarks on province as attempt to distort history</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Assembly on Thursday rejected the remarks of India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh regarding the province as “delusional” and said they were a deliberate attempt to distort history.
On Sunday, Singh said that “civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India”, and that “who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again”. His words were strongly rebuked by the Foreign Office as “dangerously revisionist remarks” that revealed an expansionist Hindutva mindset.
The Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution today, stating that the House “unequivocally condemns the Defence Minister of India’s statement as delusional, inflammatory, and a deliberate distortion of history, made in violation of diplomatic norms and international law”.
The resolution, moved by Excise Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla, said the assembly asserted “with absolute clarity that Sindh is, and will forever remain, an inseparable and integral part” of Pakistan, and rejected any narrative, however absurd, which suggested otherwise.







The lawmakers rejected “with full force all revisionist, expansionist, and politically motivated claims emanating from India that attempt to rewrite the history of Sindh, Pakistan, or the movement for independence”.
It further condemned the extremist policies of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government that “threaten regional peace, undermine civilisational heritage, weaponise water resources, and endanger the environmental security of millions”.
The resolution also called upon the government to “pursue decisive diplomatic, legal, and multilateral action to protect the Indus River, defend Pakistan’s rights under international treaties, and hold India accountable for violations of water, environmental, or humanitarian norms”.
New Delhi unilaterally held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in April this year based on unsubstantiated claims regarding the Pahalgam attack, which were strongly refuted by Islamabad. A Sydney-based think-tank warned last month that India could manipulate river flows in the near term, presenting an “acute” danger for Pakistan.

 

In its resolution, the House expressed “firm solidarity with all communities, within Pakistan and across India, who respect the sanctity of the Indus, reject extremism and revisionism, and uphold the principles of justice, coexistence, and peace”.
The resolution presented by Chawla noted that Sindh was an “ancient civilisation with its own enduring identity, culture, a political consciousness, rooted in history far older and deeper than any modern state”.
It highlighted that the “people of Sindh, asserting their right to autonomy and dignity, chose in 1936 to separate from the Bombay Presidency, long before the creation of Pakistan, thereby demonstrating a clear and unequivocal will for self-governance”.
“Sindh was the first province to adopt the historic resolution in favour of the creation of Pakistan, playing a decisive and irreplaceable role in the establishment of the nation envisioned by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah,” it stated.

 

The House described statements made by senior members of the Modi government as not only “historically baseless but also reflect a reckless, provocative, and revisionist agenda aimed at distorting facts and destabilising the region”.
“The people of Sindh, the people of Pakistan, and all fair-minded citizens of India reject such destructive policies and recognise the Indus as a sacred, life-giving artery of our collective civilisation,” it added.
The resolution stated: “The Modi government has overseen the gravest aggression against the Indus River in recorded history — an act that constitutes a violation of international laws and a breach of the Indus Waters Treaty, and an assault on the very ecological civilisational foundations of South Asia.
“An attack on the Indus River is an attack on a shared civilisation and millions of livelihoods, and on the cultural and environmental heritage that binds the region together,” it added.
The National Assembly later passed a similar resolution by PPP MNA Asad Alam Niazi denouncing the remarks.
“These statements are historically incorrect, politically irresponsible and contrary to the recognised geopolitical realities of the Indo-Pak region. The House reaffirms that Sindh is an integral part of the sovereign State of Pakistan and urges all individuals and institutions to refrain from making misleading, biased and destabilising statements,” it reads.







CM Murad urges Centre to raise issue on int’l level
During the assembly session, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah delivered a strong speech, condemning Singh’s statements and demanding that the federal government raise the issue at the international level.
“We demand from the Centre through this resolution that the Government of Pakistan raise this matter before the world,” he said.
“The Government of Pakistan should send this resolution to the world and tell them that India wants to occupy the Sindh River,” the chief minister added.

 

Reaffirming the province’s loyalty, he declared: “Sindh is a part of Pakistan and will always remain so, and its boundaries can not be changed.”
CM Murad stressed that the international community must be informed of India’s aggressive actions and statements. Following his speech, the resolution against the Indian defence minister’s remarks was unanimously approved by the Sindh Assembly.
The chief minister labelled Singh as panicked. “He is suffering from a state of perplexity. India’s panic began after [a specified event].
“The Indian defence minister was born in Uttar Pradesh. He has never drunk the water of Sindhu (Indus), and that is why his mind is corrupted,” Murad quipped, accusing India of attempting to weaponise the river.







Emphasising the historical and cultural significance of Sindh, the chief minister said, “The impression given by the defence minister of India is deplorable.”
He highlighted Sindh’s ancient history, noting its existence even before the Common Era. “The resolution that was presented narrates the entire history,” he pointed out. “Multan and Makran were included in the ancient maps of Sindh,” he added.
CM Murad highlighted the contributions of Sindhi leaders to the nation’s founding. “The Muslim League Sindh Chapter presented the Pakistan Resolution,” he said, adding that Pakistan was formed “due to the sacrifices of our elders”.

CM Afridi was also denied a meeting with Imran at the jail last Friday. Speaking to reporters, he stated that it was unfortunate that, despite having orders from the Islamabad High Court (IHC), he was not permitted to meet the patron-in-chief of his party. He added that he wrote to the chief justice but received no response regarding the issue.
The CM and party supporters originally intended to march to the prison, where Imran is incarcerated, but were stopped by a heavy contingent of police personnel at Factory Naka.
The CM offered prayers at the sit-in, which were led by Punjab lawmaker Hafiz Farhat Abbas.
Speaking to reporters earlier today, Afridi said that police had stopped him this afternoon at Factory Naka, near the jail. This is the same area where the party staged a sit-in after being denied a meeting with Imran earlier this week.
“I told the police that I was stopped last time, and I am also being stopped this time,” CM Afridi said. “I told them, ‘If you stop me, then tell me why you are defying court orders in writing.’ They did not give me a reason.”

The KP CM added that the situation is “worsening” and questioned why the authorities are not complying with court orders.
“A province is being treated like a stepmother,” CM Afridi remarked. “If the representative of 25 million people is being treated like this, then it is not a good thing.
“Would you like it if it happened to someone else in another province tomorrow?”
The CM added that nobody was allowed to meet the PTI founder, be it his sisters, doctors, lawyers or party leadership.
“These people (authorities) need to decide who they are standing with. If they continue with this attitude, then we will take a final option,” he said, not elaborating on the “final option” itself.







PTI concerned about Imran’s health
The PTI expressed concern over Imran’s health while incarcerated, as he has been barred from seeing his family and lawyers for over three weeks.
Former PM’s aide Zulfi Bukhari said no one has seen Imran since November 4 and no reason has been given for denying meetings.
“His health is our concern. We are worried about his illegal isolation,” Bukhari told Reuters, demanding the government give Imran’s family immediate access to him.
A jail official told Reuters that the former premier was in good health and that he was not aware of any plans to move him to any other facility. He spoke on the condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
The Interior Ministry did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment.</p><small>2025-11-27 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27151134f553f20.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957710/50pc-of-afghans-travelling-abroad-used-pakistani-passports-senator' target='_blank'><strong>50pc of Afghans travelling abroad used Pakistani passports: senator</strong></a><br><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Pakistan (JUI-P) Senator Attaul Haq on Thursday stated that Afghans with Pakistani passports travel abroad and if they engage in crime, it reflects badly on Islamabad.
Speaking during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, he said, “Fifty per cent of Afghans travel abroad using Pakistani passports. Whenever Afghans are caught by authorities abroad, they are carrying Pakistani passports.”
An official from the interior ministry acknowledged that this had occurred, but assured the committee that the practice had stopped.
“In the past, when people were deported from Saudi Arabia, it was found that deportees were Afghan citizens carrying Pakistani passports.”
Earlier today, the committee condemned Justice Ali Baqar Najafi’s remarks in the Noor Mukadam case that surfaced a day earlier, deeming them “ridiculous”.
Justice Najafi, who is now part of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), observed that the Noor Mukadam case was the direct result of a “vice” spreading in society known as “living relationship”. It appeared the judge was referring to a live-in relationship, where two unmarried individuals in a romantic relationship cohabitate.
In a meeting today, the committee questioned what “would happen to the conviction rate in cases against women, which is already shameful, if a judge himself has made such remarks.”
The committee summoned advocate generals, prosecutor generals, police officials and all relevant authorities due to the low conviction rate.
Conviction rate in cases of gender-based violence (GBV) is reportedly as low as 1.2 per cent due to weak prosecution and judicial delays.
Women’s rights advocates say there is also no centralised GBV database, hindering data analysis. Furthermore, due to resource constraints, shelters and crisis centres, GBV courts, police protection cells, and the like are underfunded.
Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at the Islamabad residence of Zahir Zakir Jaffer in July 2021. In May, a three-judge Supreme Court bench, led by Justice Hashim Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Najafi, had upheld the death sentence awarded to Zahir, who was convicted by an Islamabad trial court in 2022.
Last month, the apex court had taken up Zakir’s review petition challenging the capital punishment awarded to him. During the hearing, Justice Najafi told senior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, representing the convict, that it would be more appropriate for him to start arguments after going through the additional note he had not yet issued at the time.
Later, Justice Najafi was sworn in as a judge of the FCC, established earlier this month after the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
In an additional note on the Noor murder case, which was uploaded on the SC website on Wednesday, Justice Najafi upheld the sentence handed to Zahir and observed that “the present case is a direct result of a vice spreading in the upper society which we know as ‘living relationship’ [sic]”.
He stressed that such relationships ignored “societal compulsions” and “defy not only the law of the land but also the personal law” under Sharia.
The judge’s observations, which surfaced just a day after the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, also triggered criticism from many on social media, including lawyers and journalists.

The ruling PML-N secured close to 64 per cent of the total votes polled in the by-elections for six National Assembly constituencies held on Sunday as it emerged victorious on all seats. Five constituencies were located in Punjab and one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. These seats, except for one, were vacated due to the disqualification of the opposition PTI MNAs.
The PML-N also won six out of seven Punjab Assembly seats in the province by securing 82.41pc of the polled votes. On the seventh seat, it had not fielded its candidate in PP-269, Muzaffargarh, against PPP nominee Alamdar Qureshi.
The ECP notified the following PML-N members as MNAs: Mahmood Qadir Khan for NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan-II), Mohammad Nauman for NA-129 (Lahore-XIII), Muhammad Tufail for NA-143 (Sahiwal-III), Danyal Ahmad for NA-104 (Faisalabad-X) and Babar Nawaz for NA-18 (Haripur).
Excluding Nawaz, the four were later administered their oath by NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq as the assembly’s 22nd session commenced.







Meanwhile, PPP’s Qureshi was notified for PP-269 (Muzaffargarh-II) and PML-N’s Sultan Ali Ranjha for PP-73 (Sargodha-III), Ali Haider Noor Khan Niazi for PP-87 (Mianwali-III), Azad Ali Tabassum for PP-98 (Faisalabad-I), Tahir Pervaiz for PP-115 (Faisalabad-XVIII), Ahmad Shehryar for PP-116 (Faisalabad-XIX) and Muhammad Hanif for PP-203 (Sahiwal-VI).
Meanwhile, for NA-96, ECP spokesperson Duriya Amir said: “Notification of the success of the successful candidate from NA-96 Faisalabad has been stopped. A code of conduct case is pending in the election commission against Talal Chaudhry and Bilal Chaudhry.”
The ECP had decided on Monday to withhold Bilal’s victory notification over the minister’s alleged violation of the code of conduct.
A four-member bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja took up the case for hearing. The state minister, who had been summoned, did not turn up. During the hearing, the bench observed that the state minister clearly violated the code of conduct.
It was emphasised that, as per the code, the minister was not authorised to participate in any election campaign and that strict action should be taken ag­­ainst him. The CEC rem­arked that Talal did not even bother to appear before the bench.
In response, the minister’s lawyer said that his client would appear before the commission. Later, the Election Commission exempted him from attendance for the first hearing. The CEC clarified that Bilal Chaudhry was not being disqualified; only the notification of his victory would be withheld. The hearing was adjourned till December 2.
By-poll performance
The PML-N had bagged 564,400 votes out of a total 883,108 or 63.91pc of the votes cast for the six National Assembly seats. In a surprising outcome, the PML-N also snatched from the PTI the NA-18 seat (Haripur, KP) against all expectations.
Political analysts had been hoping that at least this seat would be retained by the PTI because of certain factors, including the fact that KP is being ruled by the PTI, so there were minimal chances of rigging in the constituency.
“Now the PPP cannot blackmail the PML-N for the passage of the annual federal budget,” Dr Rashid Ahmad Khan, former head of Punjab University’s Political Science Department, had told Dawn, referring to the simple majority the PML-N would attain in the National Assembly after grabbing the six NA seats.
Discussing the factors about the defeat of the PTI in NA-18, he said the voters were alienated, believing that when their ballots were not “honoured” in the 2024 general elections, it would serve no purpose this time either. Also, it became clear that the PTI leadership without Imran Khan was unable to mobilise supporters, he added.
Endorsing his views, Pakistan Study Centre Director Dr Amjad Magsi had said that the PTI leadership was not clear-headed and failed to fully run the election campaign, while the lack of its traditional election symbol also played a role in the defeat. He said the turnout in the by-elections was low due to disappointment among the PTI supporters.</p><small>2025-11-27 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27103523d94dfb8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957697/pti-demands-clarification-from-govt-regarding-rumours-about-imrans-health' target='_blank'><strong>PTI demands clarification from govt regarding ‘rumours’ about Imran’s health</strong></a><br><p>The PTI has demanded a clarification from the government regarding recent “rumours” about the health of jailed party founder Imran Khan, calling on authorities to arrange a meeting between the former premier and his family.
The development comes as Imran’s sisters have in recent weeks been repeatedly denied a meeting with him, leading them to question the whereabouts of the ex-prime minister and stage sit-ins outside the Adiala jail. Further, several social media accounts on X have shared unverified claims of his death, with Indian media also reporting on the alleged rumours about his health. The trend ‘Where is Imran Khan?’ was also trending on X on Thursday morning.
In a statement issued early on Thursday on X, the party said “rumours of a despicable nature” were being spread from “Afghan and Indian media, and foreign social media accounts” regarding Imran’s health.
The party demanded that the “current government and the interior ministry immediately and clearly dismiss and clarify the rumour and immediately arrange a meeting between Imran and his family”.
“A formal and transparent statement should be issued on behalf of the state regarding the health, security and current status of Imran,” the party demanded.







It further called on the state to investigate those responsible for spreading rumours of a “sensitive nature” and demanded that the “facts be presented before the nation”.
The party, in its statement, warned that “the nation will not tolerate any uncertainty regarding the status of its leader (Imran)”.
“The government is directly responsible for protecting Imran’s security, human rights and constitutional rights,” the party said. The PTI also vowed to take “every legal and political step to counter these rumours and bring the truth to light”.
Meanwhile, PTI leader Meher Bano Qureshi, who is also the daughter of former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said on X that rumours regarding Imran’s health were concerning.
“The government is responsible for Khan sahib’s safety and is duty-bound to issue a statement updating the nation. As far as putting an end to these rumours goes, the best, most credible way possible is to allow Khan sahib’s sisters, lawyers and party members to meet with him,” she said.







‘Afghan origin’ claim debunked
Separately, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MOIB) debunked “false claims by Afghan and Indian social media alleging that Imran had been killed in jail”.
“Anonymous Afghan accounts circulated an unverified rumour that Imran was killed in custody and his body moved. Indian outlets repeated the rumour using two old photos from 2013 and 2022 as ‘fresh evidence’,” the ministry’s official fact-checking cell said on X.
It added that “disinformation originated from two Afghan propaganda handles known for fabrications”.







“Their posts appeared only 46 minutes apart, a clear indication of a coordinated attempt rather than independent reporting. Both accounts falsely claimed a “Pakistani source” confirmed the death but provided no documentation, proof, or institutional verification,” it said.
The account clarified that the photos of Imran used by the accounts, and presented as “fresh evidence”, dated back to 2022 and 2013.
The fact-checking account said that the “first image used to support the rumour is actually from 2013, when Imran fell from a forklift stage during an election rally.”
“Afghan and Indian networks repurposed this 12-year-old image to imply a recent incident inside jail,” it added.
It detailed that “at 12:06pm PKT, Republic TV aired a false claim of ‘PTI supporters storming Adiala Jail”. It added that “within hours”, India’s Republic TV started running the rumour as well, followed by other indian outlets at 3pm — all of whom were “relying on the same two Afghan accounts”.
Tracing the origin of the second picture used by the Afghan-origin accounts, the fact-checking account clarified that the picture was from November 4, 2022, from an assassination attempt on Imran in Wazirabad.
“This photo predates Imran’s imprisonment and has zero connection to jail or custody,” it said.
Elaborating on the Indian media’s role in amplifying the rumour, the account said that “despite PTI representatives telling Indian channels that no such information existed, the rumour was aired repeatedly.”
“No journalist, official, hospital, or government agency confirmed any abnormal development,” it said.
Citing Republic TV as an example, the account said that indian channels continued to run the rumour as a “possible developing story” despite admitting that the rumour was of Afghan origin.
It added that the Indian media also misrepresented the “routine, court-ordered family visitation schedule as ‘suspicious.’
“In reality, jail meetings follow judicial guidelines, not intelligence or law enforcement discretion,” it said.
The account noted that the “timing, coordination, and rapid cross-border amplification suggest a deliberate attempt to create unrest within Pakistan.”
“The rumour was designed to provoke agitation, fuel anti-state narratives, and manufacture a false sense of instability,” it said.
‘Imran has TV, allowed use of exercise machine in jail’
Earlier on Wednesday, Defence Minister and PML-N leader Khawaja Asif had responded to a video on X in which Imran criticised ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif for demanding amenities while in jail.
“He (Imran) himself has a TV in his jail cell … and his food comes from outside,” he claimed.
“There are exercise machines available for him as well,” he added.







Asif, recalling his own time in prison, said, “We used to sleep on the cold floor and eat the food [prepared] at the jail.”
He continued: “It was the month of January, and we had only two blankets, and there was no hot water.”
On the other hand, Imran, he alleged, had “a double bed and velvet bedding”, claiming that the jail superintendent personally tended to him.
Asif called on the PTI founder to “listen to his own speech on the jail’s loudspeaker,” adding that “he (Imran) should fear God.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The party has previously also raised concerns over the health of Imran, who is 73-years-old.</p><small>2025-11-27 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2707371092c1a4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957664/2-national-guard-soldiers-shot-near-white-house-trump-terms-incident-act-of-terror' target='_blank'><strong>2 National Guard soldiers shot near White House; Trump terms incident ‘act of terror’</strong></a><br><p>Two US National Guard soldiers were critically wounded on Wednesday after being shot in a brazen daytime attack a few blocks from the White House, with US President Donald Trump terming the incident an “act of terror”.
The incident, which left two Guard members critically wounded, was “an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror,” Trump said.
“It was a crime against our entire nation.”
He confirmed that the man taken into custody after the daylight shooting two blocks from the White House was “a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan”.







The suspect had arrived in the United States in 2021 “on those infamous flights,” Trump said, referring to the evacuations of Afghans fleeing as the Taliban took over the country in the wake of the US retreat after 20 years of war.
“We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan” under former president Joe Biden, Trump said.
“We must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country if they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”







The Department of Homeland Security identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national. According to CNN, the suspect applied for asylum in 2024, which was granted by the Trump administration in April 2025.
Separately, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it had stopped processing all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely.
“The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission,” the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a post on X.







Reacting to the incident, former US president Barack Obama said “violence has no place in America”.
“Michelle and I are praying for the servicemembers shot in Washington, DC today, and send our love to their families as they enter this holiday season under the most tragic of circumstances,” he said.







‘Targeted shooting’
Trump was in Florida at the time of the attack, which prompted the White House to go into lockdown as law enforcement from multiple federal and city agencies swarmed the area.
Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called it “a targeted shooting” by a single assailant.
“That individual has been taken into custody,” she said.
The shooting occurred around 2:15 pm local time, when the two soldiers — a man and a woman — were conducting what authorities described as a “high-visibility patrol”.
According to DC Police Executive Assistant Chief Jeffrey Carroll, the attacker rounded a corner, raised a firearm, and “ambushed these members of the National Guard” without warning.
Both soldiers were struck multiple times and rushed to local trauma centers, where they remain in critical condition. The suspect was also injured during the encounter.
Carroll said investigators were still working to determine whose gunfire wounded him, but confirmed that there were no additional suspects and no ongoing threat.
Senior counterterrorism officials confirmed to ABC News that the FBI was examining the shooting as a possible act of international terrorism, and investigators were looking into whether the attack may have been inspired by a foreign militant group.
Authorities stressed, however, that no motive had been established.
Trump was the first to announce the incident publicly, writing on social media that “the animal that shot the two National Guardsmen” was also severely wounded and would “pay a very steep price”.
He praised the National Guard and federal law-enforcement agencies as “truly great people”.







Following the shooting, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said the president directed him to deploy an additional 500 National Guard troops to Washington “immediately,” saying: “This happened just steps away from the White House. It will not stand.”
A brief security lockdown was also imposed at the White House as the situation unfolded, though Trump was not in the capital at the time.
“The president has been briefed,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.
Confusion briefly erupted when West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey issued — then retracted — a statement saying the two soldiers had died. His office later said the information was based on “early and conflicting reports”.
Unease within Muslim communities
A relative of Lakanwal’s told NBC News that the suspect had arrived in the US in September 2021, after serving for 10 years in the Afghan army alongside US Special Forces.
According to the relative, Lakanwal spent part of his military service stationed at a base in Kandahar. The relative who spoke to NBC News had also served with him, supporting US troops.
“We were the ones targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan,” he said. “I cannot believe that he might have done this,” the relative added.
Lakanwal came to the US five months after Biden announced the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.
Originally from Khost province, Lakanwal had been living in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and five children, the relative said.
The attack also triggered unease within Muslim communities.
“We hope this report is incorrect,” a Muslim political commentator, who declined to be named, told Dawn after initial reports about the nationality of the suspect.
“If it turns out to be true, it may trigger a strong backlash against Muslim communities across the United States.”
National Guard personnel from several Republican-led states, including West Virginia, have been deployed in Washington since August, when Trump expanded an earlier mission aimed at combating street crime and supporting immigration enforcement initiatives.
The soldiers shot on Wednesday were part of that deployment.</p><small>2025-11-27 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/271414093f9cc49.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957708/bangladesh-ex-pm-sheikh-hasina-gets-21-years-in-jail-for-corruption' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh ex-PM Sheikh Hasina gets 21 years in jail for corruption</strong></a><br><p>A court in Bangladesh sentenced ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday to 21 years in prison for corruption, a week after she was given the death penalty for crimes against humanity.
Hasina, 78, is currently residing in India and has defied court orders that she return to Bangladesh.
She was sentenced in absentia on November 17 to be hanged for crimes against humanity after ordering a deadly crackdown against a student-led uprising last year that eventually ousted her.

 

But three other cases had been brought against the ex-leader by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) over land grabs of lucrative plots in a suburb of the capital Dhaka.
Hasina received seven years’ imprisonment in each of the three cases, Dhaka Tribune reported. Several other accused were also handed varying prison terms, it added.
It is unclear if the sentences will run concurrently.
Hasina’s conduct “demonstrates a persistent corruption mindset rooted in entitlement, unchecked power, and a greedy eye for public property”, ruled judge Abdullah Al Mamun.
“Treating public land as a private asset, she directed her greedy eye toward state resources and manipulated official procedures to benefit herself and her close relatives.”

 

Hasina’s US-based son Sajeeb Wazed and daughter Saima Wazed, who has served as a top United Nations official, were sentenced to five years each.
Hasina fled Bangladesh by helicopter on August 5, 2024, after weeks of student-led protests against her autocratic rule.
Public prosecutor Khan Moinul Hasan said he would appeal the verdict in the corruption cases.
“We are not satisfied with the verdict, as we had sought maximum punishment,” he told AFP.
“We will consult our client, the Anti-Corruption Commission, and decide on the next course of action.”
The three cases involve a total of 47 accused, with 23 individuals named across them, according to Dhaka Tribune.
The first case listed 12 accused, including Hasina; the second listed 17, including Hasina and Sajeeb; and the third listed 18 convicts, including Hasina and her daughter Saima.
Bangladesh has been in political turmoil since the end of Hasina’s rule, and violence has marred campaigning for elections slated for February 2026.
The UN says up to 1,400 people were killed in crackdowns as Hasina tried to cling to power.

 

Hasina has called the guilty verdict and death sentence in her crimes against humanity trial “biased and politically motivated”.
She is also being prosecuted in three other corruption cases, along with her sister Sheikh Rehana and her children, including British MP Tulip Siddiq.</p><small>2025-11-27 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27124752363041a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957703/india-approves-800m-plan-to-boost-rare-earth-magnet-production' target='_blank'><strong>India approves $800m plan to boost rare earth magnet production</strong></a><br><p>India has approved a more than $800 million plan to boost production of rare earth magnets in an effort to secure supplies and cut its dependence on imports from countries like China.
Rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs), some of the strongest types of permanent magnets, made from alloys of rare earth elements, are used in many critical sectors, including electric vehicles, aerospace and renewable energy.
New Delhi currently meets its demand primarily through imports, with the government estimating that the country’s needs could double by 2030.
India’s cabinet approved on Tuesday a $815.3m scheme to promote the production of REPMs, which the government said will help secure the “supply chain for domestic industries”.
The plan involves offering sales-linked incentives and subsidies to help establish a manufacturing capacity of around 6,000 metric tons per year.
“This first-of-its-kind initiative aims to establish 6,000 MTPA (metric tons per annum) of integrated REPM manufacturing in India, thereby enhancing self-reliance and positioning India as a key player in the global REPM market,” the government said in a statement.
Local industry groups welcomed the move, with the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) saying it will provide long-term resilience to the automotive supply chain.
It will encourage investments in advanced materials and give India a strong position in global value chains for EVs and clean energy, Vikrampati Singhania, ACMA president, said in a statement.
“This is a strategic and forward-looking intervention that addresses one of the most critical gaps in the EV and advanced mobility ecosystem,” he said.
While India sources rare earth magnets from multiple countries, China’s export curbs earlier this year raised alarm among some Indian firms.</p><small>2025-11-27 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27122808e8c1789.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957696/amid-reports-of-arbitrary-offloading-of-passengers-fia-official-says-only-those-without-valid-documents-being-barred-from-travelling-abroad' target='_blank'><strong>Amid reports of arbitrary offloading of passengers, FIA official says only those without valid documents being barred from travelling abroad</strong></a><br><p>Amid reports regarding the arbitrary offloading of passengers travelling abroad, an official from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Thursday clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.
Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. Earlier this month, FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.
In a video statement shared today, FIA Lahore Zone Director Captain (retired) Muhammad Ali Zia addressed the recent issue of “misleading AI-generated videos and false information circulating on social media regarding alleged offloading incidents at airports”.
“All these rumours have no connection with reality,” Zia said, referring to reports of people being offloaded “for no reason”.
However, the FIA officer noted that a lot of people were those “who get deceived by various human smugglers in some way”.
Zia detailed that FIA immigration officials at airports check the travel documents of “all those people and profile them”, asserting that no one going abroad for a valid purpose was being stopped.
“All those who are denied from going abroad are refused due to them not having valid documents, or if they have permits or visas wherein the companies stated do not exist, and we have suspicions that human smugglers are trapping them and taking them abroad.’’



“We have seen cases where people get deceived by these human smugglers and change their routes mid-transit, or take an accomplice with them in the form of their mother or sister, through which they can exit here with the [safeguard] of an Umrah [visa],” Zia said.
He added there had been past cases where such people were deported from other countries, following which the FIA’s Anti-Human Trafficking Cell registers a case, conducts an inquiry and “such human traffickers are brought to a halt”.
He urged the public not to be fooled by migrant smugglers. The FIA officer said those networks were negatively portraying the matter to “create unrest” and secure financial gains for themselves.
He recalled the Mauritania and Greece boat capsize incidents, saying that innocent people were shown “dreams of Europe” and smuggled out of Pakistan via dunki (illegal land routes) or by transiting in other countries, only to be pressured into handing over exorbitant amounts of cash or even losing their lives.

 

“Not only does Pakistan’s name on an international level get maligned and the value of our green passport declines, but many countries have also created difficulties for us in obtaining visas,” the FIA Lahore director said.
Zia assured the public that immigration staff would facilitate all those who were travelling abroad for legitimate reasons with valid documents.
The FIA’s Facebook post said “such fabricated content aims to misguide the public and undermine institutional credibility”, and urged citizens to rely only on verified information from official FIA platforms.
Earlier this week, BBC Urdu reported that it spoke to some of the offloaded individuals, including a 25-year-old man from Hyderabad who had obtained a work visa for Saudi Arabia.
Another person, aged 35, who hailed from Punjab’s Sargodha, was stopped from travelling to Saudi Arabia from Karachi, and later also barred from travelling to Dubai from Lahore for work.
A resident of Punjab’s Jhang told BBC Urdu he was offloaded from Karachi as officials questioned why he was using that airport instead of the nearby one in Lahore, the reason for which he said was a cheaper ticket.
Earlier this week, it emerged that a number of genuine businessmen and tourists lodged a strong protest against the “harsh policy” to offload even those going for business trips or tourism.
Gujrat Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Ahmed Hassan Mattu told Dawn that he had received several complaints from members of the Gujrat chamber about being offloaded from Lahore, Sialkot and other airports despite having genuine travel documents and recommendation letters.
He said that the business fraternity had been very concerned over such a harsh policy of FIA Immigration as genuine businessmen should not be stopped or bothered at the airports.
When asked about the reasons of offloading, FIA Gujranwala Zone Director Muhammad Bin Ashraf told Dawn that there was no harsh policy or new directions issued in this regard of offloading passengers with fake documents or suspicious motives.</p><small>2025-11-27 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27111220ba39807.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957698/3-cops-martyred-in-terrorist-attack-on-police-checkpost-in-hangu-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>3 cops martyred in terrorist attack on police checkpost in Hangu: CTD</strong></a><br><p>Three police personnel were martyred as law enforcers responded to a terrorist attack on a checkpost in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu on Wednesday night, according to an official statement from the provincial Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD).
The statement, issued late last night, said terrorists carried out a “cowardly attack on the Qazi Talab checkpost in the dark of the night”.
Responding to the attack, Hangu District Police Officer (DPO) Khan Zeb Mohmand led the operation against the terrorists, the statement said.
It added that while the operation was underway, police personnel “surrounded the area and stood firm against the enemy like a wall of lead”.
“Eventually, police foiled the attack,” the statement added. However, three policemen, Head Constable Wahid Shah, Head Constable Hikmat Khan and Abdul Samad, were martyred during the operation.
The CTD statement detailed that “intense fighting” had continued between police and the terrorists for two hours, and there were reports of several deaths among the terrorists.
“The terrorists took advantage of the darkness of the night and the rocky mountainous terrain and fled, taking their dead and wounded with them. However, the body of an armed terrorist was recovered during the search and strike operation,” the statement said.
Condemnations pour in
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi strongly condemned the attack, a statement issued by his office said, adding that the provincial chief executive had also issued instructions to “immediately send additional personnel” to the site of the incident.
“Terrorists have no religion. Cowardly attacks cannot demoralise us,” the statement quoted Afridi as saying. He further said that the terrorists would be brought to justice and the sacrifices of the martyrs “will not go in vain”.
He sought an immediate report on the incident from the KP police inspector general and also called for the immediate provision of medical treatment to those injured in the attack, the CM Office’s statement said.
“The fight against terrorism will continue with an even stronger resolve,” the statement further quoted the CM as saying, adding that he also prayed for the martyred personnel and their families.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack and paid tribute to the martyred personnel.
A statement on the interior ministry’s X account said that Naqvi extended condolences to the bereaved families. “Sacrifice of the martyred personnel will not go in vain,” he was quoted as saying.
“These sacrifices are a testament to Pakistan’s unwavering resolve in the fight against terrorism,” Naqvi said, adding that KP police were on the front lines of this fight.







Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, the TPP had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last night’s attack comes roughly three weeks after an improvised explosive device struck a police convoy conducting search operations near a cemetery in the Doaba area of Hangu. Three police officers, including a station house officer, were injured in the November 2 attack.
In a similar incident on October 24, three cops, including a superintendent of police, were martyred when back-to-back blasts rocked Hangu. According to the police, the TTP was behind the blasts.</p><small>2025-11-27 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27074420f4864dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957620/aurangzeb-shifts-focus-to-steady-sustainable-economic-growth' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb shifts focus to steady, sustainable economic growth</strong></a><br><p>• Says country will no longer chase short bursts of 5-6pc GDP growth• Urges corporates to tap capital markets instead of relying solely on banks
ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has signalled a clear shift in the government’s economic direction, saying the goal is no longer to pursue short bursts of five to six per cent GDP growth that have repeatedly led to instability.
“We do not want to repeat the past cycles of unsustainable growth,” he said while addressing a two-day economic dialogue organised by the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) on Wednesday. The focus, he added, is moving towards steady, sustainable growth that can break recurring boom-and-bust cycles and place the economy on firmer footing.
He said the growth trajectory itself is not the issue; the real challenge is maintaining momentum once achieved. Previous attempts, he noted, proved unsustainable.
He cautioned against repeating earlier patterns and reiterated that export-led growth remains the only path to stronger performance.
Without naming the country, he referred to a neighbouring economy moving towards 8pc growth but facing high unemployment. In Pakistan, he said, the debate centres on equity and representative growth.
Discussing sectoral performance, Mr Aurangzeb highlighted the government’s aim to revive industrialisation, saying the upcoming industrial policy will place special emphasis on this effort. He expressed hope for 3.5pc GDP growth in the current fiscal year.
He projected growth of around 4pc over the next two to three years, with the potential to reach 6-7pc over the medium term, provided the momentum in agriculture, manufacturing and services continues.
He also gave updates on remittances and external inflows, noting stable monthly remittance levels through formal channels and strong performance of the Roshan Digital Account. He said remittances this year are expected to reach around $41 billion.
The minister said easing monetary conditions would help reduce financing costs, but urged corporate leaders to diversify beyond bank borrowing and make greater use of capital markets for longer-tenor, more competitive financing.
Mr Aurangzeb reaffirmed the government’s commitment to addressing structural issues in taxation and energy. “We are going to hold the first tax advisory council meeting on Thursday. The council will now reach out to businesses for input ahead of the next budget.”
Responding to concerns about security raised by foreign investors, the minister stressed that national security is non-negotiable. Security, macroeconomic stability, and smooth profit repatriation, he said, are the basic prerequisites for attracting and retaining global investment.
He said the inaugural meeting of the 11th NFC will be held on Dec 4. “We will engage provinces to come up with some tangible results.”
He also announced that Pakistan is preparing for its first Panda Bond issuance, expected before the Chinese New Year.
Mr Aurangzeb pointed to renewed interest from global companies such as Aramco, and firms from Turkiye and Abu Dhabi, which have begun investing in energy, mining, technology, logistics and automotive sectors. He described this as a sign of growing confidence in Pakistan’s economic direction.
Dr Zeelaf Munir, chairperson of the PBC, highlighted the role of productive businesses in national progress. “Pakistan’s economic strength depends on evidence-based policy, stability and long-term reform,” she said.
She added that growth requires predictability, fairness and confidence for business, and that sustainable progress needs partnership between government, business, academia and civil society.
Long-term stability
At another session, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan said exports must grow faster than imports to ease pressure on the economy and secure long-term stability. He described industrial development as essential for national prosperity and called industry the backbone of economic progress.
He said stronger export performance requires support for manufacturing and local production, adding that producing key inputs such as steel domestically is necessary to expand export capacity. He was of the opinion that Pakistan should strengthen domestic investment before relying on foreign investors. Faster economic progress, he said, is needed to create employment.
Mr Haroon said a tax package under the upcoming industrial policy will be presented to the IMF. The reform measures being prepared, he added, are intended to support long-term, sustainable economic growth.

The committee, headed by Muhammad Farooq Sattar, asked the privatisation commission to present the timeline at its next meeting. The committee also emphasised safeguarding PIA employees’ jobs before the sale.
It called for retaining staff based on performance and merit and ensuring benefits, such as pensions and gratuity, are processed fairly. Officials were instructed to consult the PIA employees’ union and address their concerns to ensure a transparent process.

 

The privatisation commission has already approved a transaction structure to sell a stake of 51 per cent to 100pc in PIACL, along with management control.
Four bidders have been pre-qualified for the sale: Lucky Cement Consortium, Arif Habib Corporation Consortium, Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited Air Blue Limited.
According to the commission, the pre-qualified bidders now have access to a virtual data room, can conduct site visits and participate in the pre-bid conference. Negotiations are ongoing to finalise commercial terms, advancing the privatisation process.
In a separate matter, an additional secretary for the power division told the committee that the government has begun the phased privatisation of public sector power generation companies (GENCOs), under a 2024–29 programme.
He said only operational plants will be offered, with the Guddu (747MW) and Nandipur (525MW) facilities identified for privatisation once pre-conditions are met. Non-operational units are proposed for delisting from the programme.
The privatisation commission advised GENCOs may dispose of old, non-functional assets with the board and ministry’s approval.
The committee also sought a detailed report from the power ministry on the installation of 1.5 million smart meters nationwide and requested a formal briefing for Karachi’s elected representatives about the project’s progress and to explain why Karachi is not included in the current phase.
