“Senior politician and important PML-N leader Siddiqui is extremely unwell. He has been put on a ventilator due to severe illness,” said Chaudhry, who is also a PML-N leader, in a post on social media platform X. He also prayed for the health of the senator.
 






The development came shortly before a session of the upper house of Parliament was slated to begin to discuss the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Siddiqui is the chairman of the Senate’s Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the PML-N’s parliamentary leader in the Senate.
In 2019, he was arrested at his residence in Islamabad for not informing police while renting out his house under the tenancy law. He was later released on bail.</p><small>2025-11-10 04:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/691138153ec6b.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954233/preserving-the-past' target='_blank'><strong>Preserving the past</strong></a><br><p>OVER the last 15-odd years, ways in which history is perceived by the Pakistani state in its official posture as well as the public at large is undergoing some change.
The content of this change is not certain, nor is its direction necessarily set in stone. But what is clear is that there is some reth­in­king of history, memory, and culture taking place.
What does this rethinking mean as far as the state is concerned? A good example comes from the content of the Pakistan pavilion at the Dubai World Expo from a few years ago. We can take that content as the version that the state wishes to show to the world outside. It was decisively more syncretic and multicultural, more accommodative and reflective of ethnic difference, than standard two-nation theory nationalism. It also went a considerable way in grounding the idea of Pakistan in its actual geography, by drawing links to the various riverine civilisations that occupied these lands over several millennia, regardless of their religious affiliation.
One should be wary of reading too much into an external projection, given how the state in many ways continues to deny ethnic and religious difference and suppress history through its practice. But it’s hard to ignore that a variety of different factors have partially compelled a mild rethink of the us­­ual religion-inflected, homogenising idea of what this country really is and what constitutes its past.
Such factors include the rise of anti-state Isla­m­ist radicalism, the rise of aggressive Hindutva na­­tionalism next door, and a change in the character of the state elite into a somewhat more multiethnic coalition. Several decades of territorial integrity, post-1971, and entrenchment of national belonging in the ‘core’ provinces, has also opened space for some experimentation on a firmer footing.

What is interesting and generative of optimism is a reimagination of the past taking place within society.

None of this, though, stands in ignorance of the general hypocrisy of the state: talking about tolerance, while emboldening bigots; restoring heritage sites, while ignoring the desecration of minority places of worship in the present. These contradictions continue to exist and should be called out loudly and categorically.
What is more interesting and generative of optimism is a reimagination of the past taking place within society, well beyond formal state patronage or guidance. Digital platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram provide space for cultu­r­­al enthusiasts and pop-historians of all stripes (and, admittedly, quality). Their output usually takes the form of short-form video essays or photographs that provide narrations about physical heritage and the myriad cultural practices — religious ritual, food, music etc — that exist in Pakistan today.
Some of these outlets have crossed the digital divide and taken on offline forms. Curated walking trips in urban and peri-urban locations, heritage and nature tourism, and even culinary adventures showcasing regional cuisines, are increasingly available to urban audiences. While their small scale is not indicative of anything major or substantial yet, these developments do provide insight into how the public’s relationship to the past is neither homogenous nor settled. And it is certainly not a wholesale acceptance of what the state may have intended.
One such cultural endeavour that recently drew my attention is the work of historian and writer, Syed Faizan Abbas Naqvi in Lahore. A self-declared urban enthusiast, afflicted with what he calls “marz-i-Lahore” (an obsession of the city bordering on ailment), Faizan runs various digital outlets showcasing his adventures at various less-known, ignored, or undiscovered historical sites in and around the city.
His work involves finding bits of history all over, in places remote, such as the border villages to the east, and as mundane as parking lots, housing complexes, and markets. Through these journeys of discovery (as ‘Lahore ka khoji’), Faizan casts light on 135 different historical sites, over and above the usual grand Mughal and British-era buildings that most casual observers and residents of the city are familiar with.
This insurgent history has made its way into published form, with 100 sites now being commemorated and archived in his recently released book, Exploring Lahore, that covers pretty much the entire span of religio-cultural diversity that the city has experienced these past few centuries. For those interested in supporting such valuable work, the book is available through the author’s Facebook and Instagram pages.
Such work is important for several reasons. The first is that far too many sites of historical and cultural significance, especially those representing minority traditions, lie in dilapidated and unprotected shape. Appreciable restoration work in a few locations by WCLA notwithstanding, many sites are already lost or damaged beyond any recovery. In the course of his own documentation, Faizan identified a few sites — including a Mughal-era graveyard — that was lost to commercial development just in the past few years. Recording and archiving their existence takes on great importance in a context where their continued physical existence remains uncertain.
Another reason why such interventions are im­­portant is because they allow for creative ways in which the past can be recovered and reimagined.
Independence came with partition and the wholesale transfer of population to and from the region that became Pakistan. Partly down to the religion-inspired nature of politics, and partly because of physical dislocation, many citizens have spent their lives in an ahistorical state. The city only exists in their present, the past becomes another country.
The process of recovering the past then is also a process of making people historically aware. It is to recognise that their present is a form of shared continuity, not an insulated break. Taken to one of its logical ends, this historical grounding and app­reciation can even have the appreciable and much-needed impact of making people more accommodating and tolerant of difference in the present.

There is not a hint of remorse, not a sliver of guilt.
The interviews published by Indian outlets last week — The Hindustan Times, New Indian Express and The Hindu — or the ones by Reuters, AFP and the UK’s Independent (published on October 29) show that former prime minister, in exile in India since August 5, 2024, remains thoroughly unencumbered by even a touch of introspection or self-doubt.
Going a step further, The Week, also based in India, published a column by Hasina where she deplores the ineptitude of the very institutions her regime had meticulously destroyed. She flails against the interim government for not having the people’s mandate, which she had manufactured to stay in power for years through rigged elections. She berates the BNP for trying to manipulate the caretaker government system, which her regime had abolished. Her deluded sense of being wronged pervades the entire article.
The closest Hasina comes to acknowledging some error of her administration in the article is one that she had already mentioned in her written interviews. She writes, “I mourn the life of every Bangladeshi that has been needlessly lost since the protests in the summer of 2024. While the vast majority of law-enforcement officers acted within their guidelines, mistakes were very clearly made in the way some members of the security forces responded to the rapid upsurge of violence.”
Hasina goes on to write that it was a very fluid and “febrile situation”, and clearly there were “breakdowns of discipline within the chain of command”.
She then states, “However, the Awami League categorically rejects the allegations that we were directly responsible for, or commanded the use of, lethal force against our own citizens. To characterise what happened as a plot by a democratically elected government to commit violence against its own people is entirely wrong. Indeed, I personally took steps to ensure that no firearms were used.”
Throughout all her interviews Hasina maintains that the evidence against her, audio clips of phone calls, were either doctored or taken out of context. She also rejects the UN human rights office estimate that 1,400 people were killed during the July uprising as “inflated”.
She told in her interview with The Hindustan Times rejecting her role in the crackdown, “But to suggest that I was directing minute-by-minute tactical responses from the prime minister’s office is to fundamentally misunderstand how security forces work. I repeat, at no point did I authorise security forces to fire on crowds.”
The Daily Star’s own investigation found Hasina to have personally authorised the use of lethal weapons. This newspaper had reported on a phone recording from July 18, 2024 where Hasina tells her nephew, former Dhaka South Mayor Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, “I have given instructions, now I have given direct instructions; now they will use lethal weapons. Wherever they find them [protesters], they will shoot directly.”
The 78-year-old former leader took the opportunity to express her gratitude to India for offering refuge. “I am deeply grateful to the Indian people for providing me with a safe haven,” she said. “The connections between our two countries are broad and deep. We pride ourselves on being India’s reliable partner.”
While her interviews with the international agencies and the UK newspaper appeared to be somewhat balanced, the ones carried by the Indian outlets are far more incendiary. Sheikh Hasina’s lack of self-reproach aside, the latest round of interviews shirks from providing any context that explain Hasina’s hasty departure. There is little that sheds light on the weeks of untold violence preceding her flight. There is hardly any mention of Hasina’s 17 years of misrule when Bangladesh descended into an autocracy.
 
 

Her interviews and the writeup attempts to portray the Yunus-led government as a usurper without any acknowledgement of how the Awami League regime had fuelled discontent among the protesters as well as the general populace. The underlying message has been the next election will not be inclusive without the Awami League, whose activities are currently banned, taking part.
The publication of these interviews and column could not have happened without the knowledge or consent of Hasina’s host country. Together with the former premier’s write-up, this move can only be seen as an attempt to somehow influence the ensuing election. Hasina is still seen as the one responsible for hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries during the July uprising alone. She would do well to remember that such interviews will not even begin to restore Awami League’s image. Her hosts would do well to remember that under the current circumstances they should refrain from activities that will further their distance from the people of Bangladesh.

Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also accompanied the federal government’s delegates, who ostensibly sought to secure the party’s support for the 27th Amendment, which is currently being piloted through parliament.
The visit came mere hours after the party issued a statement rejecting the government’s move to table 27th Constitutional Amendment in Senate.
In the meeting, which continued for around an hour, the two sides discussed the overall political situation. Sources privy to the meeting claimed the ministers had sought National Party’s support for the amendment.
The government delegation also conveyed a message from PM Shehbaz Sharif.
Earlier, in a statement issued on Sunday, NP’s central spokesperson said that since the amendment was made public, the party had held detailed consultations with its legal experts and deliberated on the matter at relevant forums.
The party, which has representation in the National Assembly, Senate and Balochistan Assembly, insisted that the proposed amendment was tantamount to weakening the spirit and structure of the Constitution.
Therefore, the party’s constitutional bodies had, by a majority decision, decided to oppose the legislation, the spokesperson said.
“The National Party will oppose the constitutional amendment,” he said.

Now a fresh move will reinforce the trend of democratic regression.
The 27th constitutional amendment tabled in parliament will alter the country’s judicial structure with significant implications for governance and democracy.
Last year, when parliament adopted the 26th Constitutional Amendment, it was done in the darkness of night, without providing the final text to lawmakers before being tabled. The entire legislative process lacked transparency and was over in hours in parliament.
Official coercion to secure the required two-thirds vote robbed the process of legitimacy. But the controversial amendment passed, making the judiciary subservient to the executive and undermining the rule of law. Consequently, the government won every case concerning constitutional interpretations.
The proposed 27th constitutional amendment seems to follow a similar path. It was kept under wraps until PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari disclosed the government had sought his party’s support and revealed the amendment’s key elements. This set off a public furore with constitutional lawyers calling this ‘state capture of the judiciary’, opposition leaders dubbing it as a ‘power grab’ directed by the establishment and others deeming it as a ‘threat to democracy’ and ‘assault on the notion of separating justice from politics’.
 
 

As presented in the Senate, the 27th Amendment consists of the following core elements. Establishment of a federal constitutional court, transfer of high court judges between courts and changes to Article 243 which concerns the control and command of the armed forces.

The 27th constitutional amendment is part of the broader trend towards democratic backsliding.

Establishment of a federal constitutional court was also attempted by the government in the 26th Amendment. But due to fierce opposition, constitutional benches were instead set up in the Supreme Court and high courts. That too was criticised because the composition of benches, influenced by the executive, empowered the government to choose which judges could hear constitutional cases of concern. It all but took away that jurisdiction from regular benches.
 
 

Objections to a constitutional court rest on solid ground. Packed with judges chosen by the government it will set up a parallel executive-compliant court. This will denude the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction in constitutional cases and those relating to fundamental rights. Meanwhile, the proposal to transfer high court judges between courts, without their consent, will mean the executive will be able to sideline ‘independent judges’ through its influence on the judicial commission, empowered to do this.
Originally the proposed amendment also included rollback of constitutional safeguards for provincial shares in state revenues determined by the National Finance Commission Award, which guarantees they are not reduced. While the fiscal logic for this was understandable as the federal government is left with limited resources to meet its expenditure, the PPP opposed this as unacceptable erosion of the 18th Amendment. This was then dropped from the amendment but with ministers indicating it might be taken up later.
Modification of Article 243 of the Constitution, which gives the government control and command of the armed forces, is predicated on the argument that defence needs have changed as a result of modern warfare while the post of field marshal necessitates constitutional recognition.
The amendment bestows wider constitutionally sanctioned powers and privileges to the top military leadership. The office of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (headed at different times by the army, air force and naval officers who were supposed to do so by rotation) is to be abolished. Instead, the new post of Chief of Defence Forces will be created, to be held by the army chief.
 
 

The Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force and Admiral of the Fleet are all given legal immunity akin to the president’s and can only be removed by impeachment. They will remain in uniform and retain the rank for life with the same privileges and immunity. The effect of all this is to further shift the power balance to the military from the civilian system.
Seen in the context of democratic erosion in recent years, the 27th amendment delivers another blow to democracy by further emasculating an independent judiciary. There have been a series of democratic reversals under the hybrid government-plus arrangement. Every indicator of democracy has shown regression. Parliament has been reduced to a rubber-stamp, freedom of assembly restricted, opposition suppressed, media controlled, independence of the judiciary compromised and the civil-military balance ske­wed to the latter’s advantage by a ruling coalition happy to act as a subservient junior ‘partner’.
It can be argued that democratic backsliding is nothing new and similar to what happened in the past. Previous periods of civilian rule also saw governments take repressive measures — crackdowns on opposition, jailing of opposition leaders on trumped-up charges, marginalisation of parliament, muzzling the media and undermining judicial independence.
While the present situation has echoes of the past, the nature and extent of democratic erosion makes it different. Previous civilian governments would persecute political opponents and take other autocratic measures including eroding judicial independence and controlling the media, but they would do so mostly on their own without the establishment’s direct involvement.
That changed after 2018 and more so after 2022. The establishment became directly involved in efforts to ‘control’ the opposition, courts, media and digital space. This expanded its sphere of political interventions in an unprecedented way. Perhaps what ‘necessitated’ this was that the government installed after the 2024 election had little political weight as it rested on a dubious mandate. So, it needed to be shored up.
Past periods of civilian democracy did not see continuous bans on political protests and public assembly as happens now. Moreover, targeting of political opponents is now accompanied by efforts at broader repression. Raids on opposition leaders’ homes and incommunicado detention of party activists are part of the present government’s inventory of repressive actions. Because there is more to control, the government has gone much further than its civilian predecessors in micromanaging the electronic media and imposing curbs on digital space.
Against this backdrop the 27th constitutional amendment is part of a broader pattern of Pakistan’s slide to an undemocratic system. But as the country’s history shows, aggrandisement of power and manipulation of law neither makes a government secure nor guarantees its future. It only exposes its lack of self-confidence and absence of faith in democracy.

The main reason for this is the Taliban’s obduracy, and lack of intention in stopping terrorist groups such as the TTP from staging cross-border attacks. The third round of talks in Istanbul wrapped up without any forward movement on Friday, with the extension of the ceasefire agreed to in Doha after hostilities last month as the only saving grace.
Pakistan, indicating its seriousness, sent high-powered negotiators, including the ISI chief. But the Taliban’s refusal to budge from their stance, as in previous rounds of dialogue, resulted in no progress. As the defence minister put it, the talks are currently in an “indefinite phase”, though there are chances that further parleys are possible.
The Taliban have described Pakistan’s demands as “unrealistic”. But there is nothing undoable about preventing militant groups active on Afghan soil from attacking Pakistan. The Kabul regime has vacillated between denying that any terrorist groups are active in Afghanistan, and saying that internal security is Pakistan’s own problem.
 
 

While internal security is indeed Pakistan’s responsibility, Kabul has a duty to stop armed actors from crossing the border and carrying out acts of terrorism in this country. Complicating matters further is the fact that Kabul is unwilling to give written guarantees that it will prevent attacks.
This recurring cycle of negotiations, followed by a breakdown in talks and the threat of renewed hostility, must end; a permanent solution needs to be found soon.
Few in the international community will believe the Taliban when they claim that no TTP fighters, or militants belonging to other groups, are active on Afghan soil. Evidence proving the presence of such groups in Afghanistan is significant.
The Taliban’s ideological affinity with the TTP is also no secret. If the Afghan Taliban seek international recognition, they must realise that this will elude them unless they muzzle their militant comrades, and stop them from attacking sovereign states.
The international community should ignore the threat of Afghanistan-based militants at its own peril. Today, these elements are attacking Pakistan; tomorrow, they may expand their reach to other states. Therefore, if the Taliban are not willing to accept Pakistan’s legitimate demands, Islamabad should work with regional allies to ensure that the Kabul regime incurs costs for hosting terrorist groups.
 
 

This can include limiting diplomatic engagement and trade ties. Pakistan must also be wary of Indian moves to indulge the Taliban. New Delhi has suddenly expressed great affinity for the Taliban — not out of any newfound love for the Afghan people, but to spite Pakistan. Islamabad, therefore, must not let hostile actors create further trouble on the western border.

The Federal Shariat Court, located opposite the Supreme Court building, will house the new FCC.—Tanveer Shahzad/White Star

• Constitutional Bench head Justice Aminuddin Khan among leading candidates for top slot
• Federal court will have exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters
ISLAMABAD: With the 27th Constitutional Amendment progressing smoothly through parli­ament, the government has begun restructuring the superior judiciary, shortlisting seven judges for appointment to the proposed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) — an institution designed to deal with constitutional interpretation and intergovernmental disputes.
Official sources said the government has initiated consultations on the composition of the new court, and Justice Amin­uddin Khan, who presently heads the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, is being considered for appointment as the chief justice of the FCC.
The names of Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Mus­arrat Hilali, Justice Aamer Farooq, and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi from the Supreme Court, along with Justice K.K. Agha of the Sindh High Court and Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, the incumbent chief justice of the Balo­ch­istan High Court, are also being discussed for inclusion in the initial composition of the new court.
 
 

Sources said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require an Act of Parliament.
Officials at the law ministry confirmed that the president, on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint judges to the new court under the proposed amendment.
The FCC proposal has been revived in the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill to streamline the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction and improve efficiency in constitutional adjudication.
The government believes this initiative will ease the SC’s workload, speed up constitutional rulings, and enhance judicial independence and credibility.
The idea of a separate constitutional court was first introduced in the 2006 Charter of Democracy signed by the PPP and PML-N. The CoD proposed a specialised court for constitutional matters to let the SC focus on final appeals. The idea reappeared in the 26th Amendment draft but was dropped due to opposition from JUI-F and others.
The proposal sets the Constitutional Court judges’ retirement age at 68, three years beyond the Supreme Court’s 65, to ensure continuity and attract experienced jurists.
The new court will be housed in the Federal Shariat Court building in Islamabad, while the Federal Shariat Court moves to the Islamabad High Court. This will symbolically and administratively separate the FCC from the Supreme Court and other superior courts.
The FCC will have exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation, intergovernmental disputes between the federation and provinces, and matters arising directly from constitutional provisions. It will also be empowered to examine the legality of presidential orders, constitutional amendments, and questions referred to it by the president or the Parliament.
Judges’ profiles
Justice Aminuddin Khan, the likely nominee for chief justice of the FCC, was born in Multan in 1960. A second-generation lawyer, he earned his LL.B from University Law College, Multan, in 1984 and began practice under his father, Khan Sadiq Muhammad Ahsan.
He became an advocate of the LHC in 1987 and of the Supreme Court in 2001, later rising to the LHC bench in 2011 and the SC in 2019. He has authored several landmark judgements in civil and constitutional law.
Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, born in Karachi in 1962, began practicing law in 1988 and was elevated to the SC in 2023. He is known for his integrity and expertise in constitutional and administrative law.
Justice Musarrat Hilali, the first woman chief justice of the Peshawar High Court, was elevated to the SC in 2023. She has a distinguished legal career and has served as Additional Advocate General of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa and Federal Ombudsman for Protection against Harassment of Women.
Justice Aamer Farooq, former IHC chief justice, was elevated to the SC in February 2025. Educated in London and at Lincoln’s Inn, he specialises in constitutional and commercial law.
Justice Ali Baqar Najafi of the LHC has vast experience in civil, criminal, and constitutional law. He has decided over 37,000 cases and led key inquiries, including the 2014 Model Town investigation.
Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, chief justice of the Balochistan High Court, joined the judiciary in 1998, was elevated to the High Court in 2019, and became chief justice in July 2025.
Justice K.K. Agha of the Sindh High Court has an extensive international career, having served as prosecutor at the UN tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and as senior counsel at the Special Court for Sierra Leone.

• Traffic police advise motorists to use Rashid Minhas Road via Aladdin Park
KARACHI: A new wave of road closures is set to cripple Karachi once again as after the much-delayed Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Red Line project turned major arteries into construction zones, the Karachi Water and Sewerage System Improvement Project (KWSSIP) is bringing fresh digging, roadblocks and traffic congestion to one of the city’s busiest thoroughfares — University Road.
“The closure is necessary for laying new 96-inch and 72-inch pipelines as part of the K-IV augmentation plan,” said a senior official. “This stretch, which is roughly 2.7 kilometres long, will form part of a new network that’s crucial for improving the city’s water supply.”
Digging work has already started on a section of the University Road  between Nipa Chowrangi and The Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science  and Technology (Fuuast).
The second phase will extend from Hasan Square to Nipa Chowrangi, according to project documents.
 
 

Officials have set Dec 30 as the deadline, but many remain “sceptical”, given the city’s track record of repeated delays and missed timelines.
Traffic police have suggested a diversion route via Aladdin Park, Rashid Minhas Road, to ease congestion, though officers admit that alternative roads are already under heavy pressure due to ongoing construction.
However, for hundreds of thousands of daily commuters, the Red Line’s construction has already brought endless congestion, dust and frustration to residents of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Gulistan-i-Johar and adjoining areas.
“It’s been years of digging and no relief,” said Abdul Maalik Atiqi, a commuter who travels daily from Gulshan-i-Iqbal to Saddar. “Now they’re closing another part of University Road. We’re trapped in a city that never stops breaking.”
“In Karachi, progress always begins with a roadblock,” said Nighat Tasneem, a daily user of University Road for her work at I. I. Chundrigar Road.
For city’s weary residents, the new closure marks yet another chapter in the city’s long saga of “development at the cost of daily life.”
Sources within the government organisations involved with the Red Line and K-IV projects admit that coordination between multiple agencies has been poor.
“This is true to a large extent — there’s a serious lack of a unified plan. One department digs up what the other has just restored,” said an official.
The K-IV Augmentation Project involves the construction of a bulk transmission and distribution system to supply an additional 260 million gallons per day of water to Karachi from the main K-IV line.
This project, funded and executed solely by the Sindh government, is a crucial supplementary initiative designed to connect the main K-IV filtration plants to Karachi’s existing water network. However, its University Road section is likely to create political fallout for the Pakistan Peoples Party-led Sindh government.
Opposition parties take PPP to task
The opposition parties have wasted no time criticising the Sindh government.
Jamaat-i-Islami Karachi chief Monem Zafar Khan lashed out, saying the city has turned into a maze of broken roads and failed projects.
“The PPP’s so-called development means endless suffering for Karachi’s citizens,” he said.
Similarly, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders echoed similar frustration, accusing the provincial government of mismanagement and corruption.
“Every few months we hear new deadlines and new projects, but the result is the same — dust, traffic, and despair,” said Fauzia Siddiqi, the PTI spokesperson for the Karachi chapter.

It “directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the US for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits”, KFF reported.
“The guidance says that such people could become a ‘public charge’ — a potential drain on US resources — because of their health issues or age,” the report said.
“You must consider an applicant’s health,” the cable read, according to KFF. It added: “Certain medical conditions — including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions — can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care.”
According to KFF, the cable also encouraged visa officers to consider conditions like obesity — which it noted could cause asthma, sleep apnea and high blood pressure —  while assessing whether an immigrant could become a public charge and should therefore be denied entry into the US.
“All of these can require expensive, long-term care,” the cable read, additionally directing visa officers to determine if applicants had the means to pay for medical treatment without financial assistance from the US government.
KFF reported that the instruction also directed visa officers to consider the health of the applicant’s family members, including children or older parents.
Tommy Pigott, the US State Department’s principal deputy spokesperson, also said in a statement: “It’s no secret the Trump administration is putting the interests of the American people first. This includes enforcing policies that ensure our immigration system is not a burden on the American taxpayer.”
Separately, the official told reporters that the decision to issue a visa had always been at the discretion of an officer.
Officers are not being instructed to reject an applicant because they have a certain medical condition, but to consider the “overall impact” if someone would be unlikely to be able to pay for their own medical care, they clarified.
“It’s addressed on an individual, case-by-case basis,” the official added.</p><small>2025-11-10 03:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/691134944c137.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954222/corporate-window-financing-a-greener-future' target='_blank'><strong>CORPORATE WINDOW: Financing a greener future</strong></a><br><p>Imagine the year 1624. The world does not have New York and her Stock Exchange that would shape global finance. The Industrial Revolution still lies over a century in the future. The Mughal empire is enjoying its heyday in India.
Around the new year, floods hit the town of Utrecht in the Netherlands. Dikes break. Fields are drowned. Livelihoods are washed away. Without a central system of aid and little reserve, authorities at the local level have no money to finance the immediate needs of recovery.
Confronted with the crisis, a small Dutch water board takes an unprecedented decision: it floats a bond. Not to fund war or conquest, but to finance recovery, to repair the dikes and stem the tide. Amazingly, that bond continues to earn interest today, over 400 years later.
A timelessly wise act of climatic foresight, now in the possession of a foundation under the New York Stock Exchange, in a world that would not have known itself in 1624.

In 1624, the Dutch were able to issue a bond to protect their people from flood-born devastation; in 2025 Pakistan struggles to attain finance for disaster recovery despite its institutions, financial markets, and global partnerships

Fast forward to the year 2025. The setting is different, but the crisis is eerily familiar and hauntingly close to home.
This time, it is not Utrecht but Pakistan. The monsoon season unleashes severe flooding across the country. Millions of people are affected. Crops, homes, schools, and critical infrastructure are swept away. The scale of infrastructure destruction is staggering and the estimates suggest that the destruction is likely to carve away 0.3 to 0.7 percentage points from Pakistan’s GDP growth in FY26, reducing the expected rate to 3.5–3.9pc, against the earlier target of 4.2pc.
As in Utrecht, somber questions linger in Pakistan as well. Who will pay to reinstate the swept away bridges that once connected communities and breathe life into the unusable classrooms? Who will help replant the fields that once provided sustenance? And beneath all such questions lies the greatest one of all, how do we truly prepare for the next calamity before it catches us off guard.
In response, the Government of Pakistan mulls over whether or not to launch an international appeal. Development partners pledge support. Humanitarian assistance trickles in. Yet months later, only a limited portion of recovery financing materialises. The funding gap continues to be large as more than 70–80pc of the estimated recovery needs are still unmet.
The contrast is stark. Four centuries ago, a small town had enough foresight to develop an innovative financial product for its residents and infrastructure. But a country of 240 million, with institutions, financial markets, and global partnerships struggles to muster timely and adequate funding for recovery. It’s obvious that adjustments in the current system are not enough anymore. Pakistan needs to reimagine its financial architecture, to make it fit for the sustainability finance era. This requires five key shifts in the financial system.
First of all, albeit the financial system superficially touches upon climate risks, we need to thoroughly embed them into our public financial management system. Every rupee spent should not only be checked for cost-effectiveness but should be exhaustively screened for climate resilience. Public financial mechanisms must essentially become an engine of adaptation and mitigation.
Second, Pakistan must enter global green capital markets with confidence. Resilience-linked green Sukuks would readily fund flood infrastructure and early warning systems. Developing such financial instruments would announce the progressing evolution of a climate-ready Pakistan.
Third, our financial planning for disasters doesn’t consider the  frequency and intensity of these perilous events. The enormous economic shocks suggest that we cannot afford to continue the same way. The financial planning must therefore be risk-informed and follow the risk layered approach, in which, financial instruments are developed and employed according to the frequency and intensity of the events.
That means we retain the financial impacts of high frequency events in the economy, which has low-impact and transfer the risks for medium and low frequency events that have high impact. A policy-level sketch would be wherein we deploy contingency funds for high-frequency, low-impact events and rely on parametric insurance and catastrophe bonds for medium to low frequency and high-impact disasters.
Fourth, the country requires a green financing facility, especially after the approval of the country’s Green Taxonomy. A green financing facility will pool public, donor, and private capital under one roof and will greatly help the first three shifts mentioned above. The facility will also develop a strong equity base for blended finance and reverse our international climate finance drawdown.
Finally, no matter how fancy an instrument looks if the resilience dividends do not trickle down to the masses, the instrument loses its raison d’etre. For this particular purpose, provinces and cities must be empowered both technically and financially so they could seek demand-driven financing for their localised climate solutions.
To make all this work, we need coordination, not chaos. Institutions like the Ministry of Finance, National Disaster Management Authority, National Disaster Risk Management Fund, the State Bank, Securities And Exchange Commission, and Ministry of Climate Change must align around a shared framework for climate finance. No solo-flight is likely to succeed as it’s a whole-of-government mandate.
In 1624, the Dutch issued a bond to protect their people from rising waters. It still functions, centuries later because it was rooted in responsibility, vision, and design. Today, Pakistan faces a similar choice. We can continue reacting to crisis after crisis. Or we can build a system that’s innovative, inclusive, and green.

On paper, these may appear as routine adjustments; for millions of Pakistanis already grappling with a relentless cost-of-living crisis, they represent another seismic shock to their budgets.
Each fuel price hike does not exist in a vacuum; it sends inflationary tremors through the entire economy, rippling across transport fares, food markets, electricity bills, and industrial costs. This chain reaction ensures inflation lingers long after the headlines fade, embedded in daily life.
Pakistan’s persistent inflationary pressure is a complex crisis born of three interlocking pillars: domestic supply shocks, internal policy contradictions, and import vulnerabilities.

Persistent inflation distorts behaviour; businesses delay expansion, and families compromise on nutrition and healthcare, meanwhile, the state borrows more to fund relief, igniting the next round of inflation

Agriculture, once the bedrock of stability, has lost its resilience. A toxic mix of climate volatility, soaring input costs, and post-harvest losses has curbed output. This directly fuels food inflation, which remains stubbornly elevated.
According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, headline inflation climbed to 6.2 per cent year-on-year in October 2025, its highest level in 12 months, driven largely by surging food prices after the monsoon floods and supply chain disruptions after the war with Afghanistan. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is trying to keep inflation in the range of 5–7pc for this fiscal year and that is why it’s kept the policy rate at 11pc.
Food prices continue to rise not just because of post-flood shortages and transportation issues but also because Pakistan, despite being a largely agrarian economy, depends on imported wheat, pulses, cooking oil and tea. Each shipment of wheat, edible oil and pulses ties local prices to global commodity swings and the rupee’s exchange value vis-a-vis the greenback.
Though the rupee is currently stable, external sector vulnerabilities and delays in the International Monetary Fund loan tranche fuel market perception of a weaker rupee in coming months, which they factor into food and non-food prices alike. Similarly, when diesel — the lifeblood of logistics — becomes dearer, the cost of moving food from farms to markets skyrockets, and city prices follow suit.
A deeper contradiction lies in policy. The SBP keeps its policy rate at 11pc to suppress demand, yet the government borrows heavily from commercial banks to finance fiscal deficits. This paradox injects liquidity into the banking system even as productive credit dries up. SBP’s practice of encouraging government borrowing through massive open-market liquidity injections continues unchecked.
As of June 2025, the stock of broad money had climbed near Rs40.8 trillion, while currency in circulation crossed Rs10.6tr, roughly 26pc of total money supply — a record high. Little wonder then that reserve money that affects inflation more directly (and includes currency in circulation) grew about 11.7pc in FY25, the central bank’s data reveal.
Simultaneously, the SBP continued pumping trillions of rupees into the banking system throughout FY25 via reverse-repo operations to ensure settlement liquidity. These measures, while stabilising short-term flows, have also expanded monetary aggregates faster than real economic output, fuelling inflationary pressure across sectors.
The fiscal side mirrors this imbalance. Pakistan’s circular debt in the power sector reached Rs1.7tr by end-September 2025, rising by nearly Rs79 billion in the July–September quarter alone. This persistent fiscal leakage strains energy tariffs, and each delayed adjustment compounds future inflationary costs.
Businesses, squeezed by high borrowing costs and soft demand, pass on their costs to consumers. Untargeted subsidies and delayed energy-price adjustments further entrench inflation.
On that note, inflation is not experienced uniformly. Food inflation is visceral — it defines daily survival. The poorest households spend over half their income on food, leaving little for rent, education, or medicine. Food inflation thus acts as a regressive tax on the poor.
In contrast, non-food inflation — covering housing, transport, utilities, and healthcare — rises more gradually, hitting the urban middle class hardest. The latest fuel price hike will push up electricity tariffs and construction costs. Cement, steel, and logistics firms will pass the burden along. A mere two-rupee rise in petrol, when multiplied across freight networks and daily commutes, morphs into an economy-wide shockwave.
Another corrosive effect of inflation is how it shapes expectations. When people anticipate that prices will keep rising, they buy and hoard, accelerating inflation itself.
For salaried workers, wages rarely keep pace. In September 2025, inflation stood at 5.6 per cent year-on-year, already straining real incomes before October’s spike. The silent erosion of savings and purchasing power breeds frustration and insecurity. Investment retreats from industry toward speculative havens like real estate and foreign currency.
In rural Pakistan, the paradox runs deeper: farmers who produce food are crushed by the cost of diesel for irrigation and transport. They are both victims and conduits of inflation.
Persistent inflation distorts behaviour; businesses delay expansion, and families compromise on nutrition and healthcare. Meanwhile, the state borrows more to fund relief, but those borrowings inflate the money supply, thereby igniting the next round of inflation.
With nearly half of broad money now held as physical cash outside banks, the transmission of monetary tightening has weakened — making inflation less responsive to rate hikes and more resistant to reversal.
Breaking this vicious cycle demands a credible, coordinated framework. The government must curb non-essential spending, rationalise subsidies, and broaden the tax base — particularly in under-taxed retail, real estate, and agriculture sectors.
Ultimately, inflation is more than an economic indicator; it is a moral test of governance.

Talking to journalists at his Srawan House, Mr Raisani said, “Letters were sent to all heads of opposition and other parties sitting in the assemblies and outside, pointing out the efforts were underway to re-approve the controversial Mines and Mineral Act 2025, but not a single leader or party has responded so far.”
Mr Raisani, who previously served as the provincial minister for mineral resources, said he has also taken legal action, approaching a court to request a new review of the law to ensure public control over the province’s natural resources.
He said his letters urged political leaders to “play their role in safeguarding the precious minerals of Balochistan for the next generation and foil any efforts” to loot them.
He argued that Balochistan’s immense natural wealth has historically been exploited. After natural gas was discovered in Sui in 1954, it strengthened Pakistan’s economy and transformed it into an “Asian tiger,” he said.

Says not a single political party responded to his warning letters; pleads to court for a fresh review of the law

Mr Raisani lamented that instead of benefiting the local population, the province’s resources were looted by successive federal governments, leaving 80 per cent of its people below the poverty line, according to a United Nations subsidiary report.
“We, through political movements and parties, are working to raise awareness among the people to stop the plunder of our resources,” he said.
The veteran politician noted that previous public pressure from All Parties Conferences and the provincial opposition had compelled the government to withdraw the legislation through a joint resolution.
He said Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti later announced in the media that the law would be withdrawn via an executive order and reintroduced in parliament only after consultations to address its shortcomings.
“However, no copy of that executive order has been provided to any political party so far, and we have again approached the court to obtain it,” Mr Raisani said, adding that the continued silence from opposition parties rem­­ains deeply concerning.
He stressed that parliamentarians now have a responsibility to correct past legislative errors and draft future laws that protect Balochistan’s interests.
 
 

Mr Raisani stated that while other provinces’ chief ministers worked to secure their water and finances, Balochistan is only subjected to exploitation.
He warned that inaction by political leaders will lead to future generations’ disapproval. He emphasised that elected officials should prioritise citizens’ rights over anything.
“Our mission is to create public awareness and build political consciousness so that no one can again use legislation as a tool to loot Balochistan’s wealth,” Mr Raisani said.

In a statement, a PIA spokesperson also disputed claims about aircraft safety put forward by the Society of Aircraft Eng­ineers of Pakistan (SAEP), which had maintained that its personnel could not compromise on safety and airworthiness.
“The body responsible for air safety in Pakistan is the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA), which regulates all airlines, including PIA, under the strictest international stan­dards and procedures. All matters concerning the use and replacement of parts, the fitness of aircraft for flight, and the routes, sche­dules, or changes thereto are under the direct purview of the PCAA and are executed only after seeking their approvals,” the spokesperson said.
 
 

Referring to images of damage to an aircraft win­dscreen that circulated on the media, the spokesperson said that the use of steel tape for curing (drying) sealant after winds­creen repair was a routine matter. But, he maintained, an impression was wrongly created that “flights were being operated with a windscreen held together by tape”.
The spokesperson also claimed that the PIA management had not taken administrative or retaliatory action against any engineer, adding that the dismissal of the body’s “self-styled” president and general secretary was the result of administrative proceedings ongoing for the past four months.
However, the dismissal letter issued to both men last week stated they had been issued notices for conducting a press conference without prior authorisation and for disclosing official information to the media. The two men were subsequently fired after they failed to appear before an enquiry committee.

It is an attempt to diversify its external financing sources and enhance financial relationships with China.
A Panda Bond is a bond, issued in China, by a foreign sovereign or entity, in Yuan (RMB). It would be the first time that Pakistan attempts to offer a sovereign foreign bond that specifically targets the Chinese investors. It is expected that the sums raised will be large net additions to the foreign exchange reserves over a span of three to five years.
The move is being described by policymakers as a “strategic financial innovation”, one that aims to reduce pressure on the dollar and open access to the deep pool of yuan liquidity within China’s domestic capital markets. For Pakistan, which continues to face persistent balance of payment challenges. This move may reduce dependence on US dollar-denominated borrowing and promote financial deepening with its most important trading partner, China. It is also consistent with the government’s broader objective of expanding Yuan-based settlements for bilateral trade under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) framework.
Panda Bonds have three distinctive features: firstly, these bonds are issued by a non-Chinese entity on the mainland of China; secondly, they are not denominated in a foreign currency but in RMB; and thirdly, they cannot be sold to an investor outside the People’s Republic of China. These bonds are listed on the Chinese Interbank Bond Market (CIBM) and usually guaranteed by international institutions like the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

Pakistan’s launch of Panda bonds is not just a financial transaction but a strong message that Pakistan is ready for innovation and diversification of its debt profile

Over the past few years, several emerging economies, including the Philippines, Egypt, and Hungary, have entered this market to diversify their debt portfolios and hedge against foreign exchange volatility. The first Panda Bonds were issued in 2005 by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and had a yield of approximately 3.4 per cent and 3.34pc, respectively. In 2018 the Philippines was the first Southeast Asian nation to issue a Panda Bond, where it raised RMB 1.46 billion with a 4.75pc yield.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that Pakistan had re-entered commercial markets after two and a half years, securing financing from Middle Eastern banks, and is planning to issue its first Panda bond before the end of the year.
The move, announced by Mr Aurangzeb, signals a strategic shift in Islamabad’s borrowing strategy: tapping the RMB-denominated market to secure longer-term funding, diversify its investor base and reduce reliance on short-term domestic debt and US dollar borrowings.
It has been reported that Pakistan’s deal is supposed to be jointly led by arrangers and advisors from Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and China International Capital Corporation (CICC). During the first stage, the bond shall be focused on institutional investors (banks, insurance companies and pension funds) in China. After the initial issuance is successful, the offering can be made available to retail and individual investors in a gradual process that will be akin to the one discussed earlier in the year 2020.
China’s Panda Bond market is growing rapidly but remains selective. Any country wanting to issue Panda Bonds must go through a rigorous approval procedure and must first secure clearance from key Chinese regulators, including the People’s Bank of China, the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors and the China Securities Regulatory Commission. To gain the confidence of investors, Pakistan has to show that it will manage its debt transparency, reporting standards and macroeconomic stability.
 
 

Pakistan’s recent progress in restoring discipline under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and its renewed focus on fiscal consolidation are likely to play a key role in shaping investor sentiment. The recent development in Pakistan in terms of bringing back discipline in the IMF programmes and the new emphasis of the country on fiscal consolidation will play a key role in creating investor sentiment.
However, Chinese investors, who are typically known for their long-term view of sovereign creditworthiness, will evaluate Pakistan’s structural reform agenda closely. In this context the progress on restructuring state-owned enterprises, rationalisation of energy subsidies and enhancing the tax collection will remain central to their risk assessment.
Beyond its economic rationale, the proposed Chinese bond is an extension of the Pakistani financial diplomacy with China. It complements the ongoing CPEC collaboration beyond the infrastructure and trade into the realm of financial and capital market spheres.
This move also indicates Pakistan’s growing financial integration with the Global South, particularly within the BRICS financial ecosystem. At the same time, such symbolic gestures should not divert attention from ground realities. It will expose Pakistan to yuan exchange rate risk; therefore, transparent governance, effective marketing and sound post-issuance management are critical to sustaining investor confidence. Without macroeconomic stability, the benefits of this new instrument may be short-lived.
The launch of the Panda bond is not just a financial transaction but a strong message that Pakistan is ready for innovation and diversification of its debt profile. This move could open future doors for more financing in yuan and enhance Pakistan’s standing among international investors.
However, the Panda Bond must be seen as a financial catalyst rather than a structural remedy. While it may assist in improving liquidity and risk diversification of funding sources, it cannot substitute structural reforms that are essential for economic resilience. In order to capitalise on this opportunity, Pakistan must complement financial innovation with institutional reforms and rebuild investor confidence through transparency, fiscal prudence and consistent reform implementation.
Ultimately, the success of this initiative will not be measured by the size of funds raised, but by how effectively these borrowed funds are utilised. The real test lies in whether Pakistan can convert this symbolic entry into China’s bond market into a credible step towards disciplined borrowing, a partner that can be relied upon, and an economy that is ready to confidently integrate with the rapidly growing financial markets of the world.

As the third order term expired on Saturday, the Punjab home department on Sunday yet again notified imposition of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, across the province for another seven days.
The Punjab government had initially imposed the ban on Oct 8 for 10 days and then notified extensions on Oct 18, Oct 25, Nov 2, and eventually on Nov 9 for one week ban each.
The home department has extended the ban on rallies, gatherings, carrying of arms, use of loudspeakers and spreading of provocative material.
The home department in its order says review of the latest reports and threat assessments shared by law enforcement and intelligence agencies explains the threat perception to public peace, tranquillity and law and order has not abated.
Extending the ban for the fourth time, the home department asserts continuation of restrictions including assembly, gathering, procession or sit-in of four or more persons in any public place, street, road or open space; carrying of arms, use of loudspeakers as well as publishing, disseminating or display of any provocative material that may incite public sentiment or disturb inter-faith and sectarian harmony.

Israel receives remains of officer killed in 2014
Israel said it had received on Sunday the remains of a prisoner, which Hamas says belong to Israeli officer Hadar Goldin who was killed in the 2014 Gaza war.
“After the identification process was completed… IDF (Israeli military) representatives informed the family of the fallen hostage Lieut­enant Hadar Goldin that their loved one has been returned to Israel and his identification has been finalised,” the prime minister’s office said.
Israel has received, via the Red Cross, the coffin of a fallen prisoner that was transferred to IDF and Shin Bet personnel inside the Gaza Strip, the Israeli prime minister’s office said.
The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigade, said earlier it had found Goldin’s remains in a tunnel in Rafah the day before.
Goldin’s body has been in Gaza since his death in 2014.
Israeli media reported on Saturday that Israel had allowed Hamas and Red Cross personnel to search in an area under Israeli control in Rafah to locate Goldin’s remains.
Another Israeli soldier, Oron Shaul, was also killed in the six-week war in 2014.
His body was recovered earlier this year during the latest all-out war on October 7, 2023.
Goldin, 23, was part of an Israeli unit tasked with locating and destroying Hamas tunnels when he was killed on August 1, 2014, just hours after a 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire took effect.
The army alleged Hamas fighters ambushed his team, killing him and seizing his body.
Israel had listed Goldin among the deceased Israeli prisoners whose remains it seeks to repatriate under the ongoing US-brokered ceasefire deal to end the latest Gaza war.
Goldin’s father said on Sunday that true victory in the current war would only be achieved when all prisoners were brought home.
“What this war has proven is that when we fight for our soldiers, we succeed. Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel,” Simcha Goldin said in a statement.
At the start of the truce, Hamas was holding 20 living prisoners and the bodies of28 deceased prisoners.
It has since released all the living Israeli prisoners and returned 23 remains of the deceased in line with the ceasefire terms.
In exchange, Israel has released nearly 2,000 Pales­tinian that had been in its custody and returned bodies of hundreds of Hamas fighters killed in Gaza.

• Senate body to question industry on steep hikes
KARACHI: Prices of more than a hundred commonly used medicines have increased by an average of 32 per cent since February last year, after the caretaker government lifted price controls under its deregulation policy, prompting concern among officials and calls for the pharmaceutical industry to explain the steep hikes, according to officials and industry sources.
The steep rise has not only fuelled public anger but also caught the authorities off guard, as they had expected that price deregulation would promote competition and eventually bring down costs for consumers. However, the outcome appears to be quite the opposite.
 
 

The surge in medicine prices came to light through recent findings of an ongoing national survey ordered by the prime minister, following complaints from citizens, hospitals, and provincial health departments about soaring drug costs.
Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, Senator Amir Waliuddin Chishti, told Dawn that officials of the federal health ministry and the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) had informed the committee that an overall 32pc increase in medicine prices had been observed since the caretaker government deregulated non-essential medicines in February 2024.
He added that in some cases, prices had risen by as much as 100pc, while an increase of around 50pc was recorded in several others.
Senator Chishti said the purpose of deregulation was to boost competition, attract investment and increase exports, not to burden consumers.
Industry to face questions
He noted that a 32pc overall rise in medicine prices within two years warranted corrective action.
“We have decided to seek justification from the industry in all cases where medicine prices have increased by 50pc or more,” Senator Chishti added.
“We expect to meet industry representatives next month, and if we detect any element of cartelisation by the pharmaceutical sector, we will ask the Competition Commission of Pakistan to look into the matter.”
 
 

He said the committee did not want the pharmaceutical industry to suffer and wanted it to grow, but not at the expense of patients, who were already struggling due to the prevailing economic situation.
He continued that the committee was expecting recommendations from the prime minister on the pricing of non-essential medicines.
Before deregulation, pharmaceutical companies were allowed to increase prices by up to 7pc annually in line with the Consumer Price Index under the previous pricing system.
Officials pointed out that, under this formula, prices would have risen by about 14pc over two years, far lower than the 32pc surge witnessed after deregulation.
Claims rejected
The Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA), however, rejected claims of an excessive price increase. It argued that the survey reflected an average rise of about 15pc and that, if the roughly 3pc linked to the launch of new products and strengths is excluded, the actual two-year increase stood at around 12pc.
PPMA’s Tauqeerul Haq said the deregulation was a timely move that prevented the collapse of the pharmaceutical industry amid soaring input costs, currency depreciation, inflation, rising energy and labour costs, and heavy taxation over the years.
“The policy helped restart production of many previously unavailable medicines, improved their availability, and curbed the circulation of counterfeit drugs during shortages,” he added.
The pharmaceutical industry argues that deregulation was necessary as the previous controlled pricing system made production unsustainable. Even under the old system, prices could not be raised without the federal cabinet’s approval. “Whenever a proposal to raise drug prices was presented, the cabinet would usually reject it due to political pressure,” said an industry representative. “Thus, deregulation was only possible during the caretaker government’s tenure.”
While deregulation has led to an increase in medicine prices, it has had a positive impact by resolving shortages of medicines at the retail level.
Abdul Samad Budhani, chairman of the Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, said the deregulation of medicine prices ensured abundant availability of medicines, ending persistent shortages.
He described deregulation as a necessary step to move away from centralised pricing controls that had hindered the sector’s ability to respond to rising production costs.
However, Mr Budhani noted that challenges remain for essential drugs classified as “hardship cases”.
“The real need for relief was in essential drugs, but their prices were not approved, while non-essential drugs received pricing approvals,” he said, adding that bureaucratic delays had contributed to shortages of some vital medicines.

Islamabad’s participation in the Gaza peace accord brokered by Washington has also strengthened political and diplomatic collaboration between the two nations.
Pakistan’s renewed outreach to the US is hardly surprising given its trade dynamics. The US remains its single largest export market after Europe, where Pakistan maintains a consistent trade surplus; for a long time, it also was a major source of foreign direct investment in the country alongside the European Union and the United Kingdom until China replaced it with large investments in energy, port and transport infrastructure under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) during the last decade.
Not just that, analysts say, Wash­ington’s support has traditionally been considered crucial, given Islamabad’s continued reliance on financial support from multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, controlled by the western powers, for repeated bailouts for its external sector stability.

Islamabad’s new balancing act is being closely monitored in Beijing, where Pakistan’s apparent tilt towards Washington has raised questions, if not caused unease

The goodwill of the country’s present military and political leadership with the current US administration of President Donald Trump has helped Islamabad secure a slightly better tariff deal compared to regional competitors, enabling Pakistan to retain and expand its export share in the world’s single largest market of consumer goods.
While analysts view Pakistan’s renewed economic and diplomatic engagement with the US after more than a decade as a positive development, they also caution that it could pose a new foreign policy challenge for Islamabad given its deepening strategic alliance with China. They note that the reset in ties with Washington will be tested by Pakistan’s close relations with Beijing, which could pull the country in conflicting directions and require a careful diplomatic balancing act.
Besides direct investment in infrastructure, Pakistan’s dependence on China for finished goods as well as raw and intermediary materials has increased manifold over time. Today, China stands as Pakistan’s largest trading partner and principal source of imports — excluding energy and edible oil — of around $20 billion or more.
It is the country’s single largest investor and bilateral creditor, extending critical balance-of-payments support through currency swap arrangements, deposits kept with the central bank and debt rollovers. More than half of Pakistan’s bilateral external debt, nearly $24bn, is owed to China. Beijing also remains indispensable for Pakistan in technology transfer and as the primary supplier of military hardware and support.
Though the country’s civil and military leadership has pledged not to “sacrifice one friend for another”, analysts argue that it is easier said than done. Some China watchers, including Dr Mahmood-ul-Hassan Khan, President of the Centre for Knowledge and Public Policy, say Islamabad’s new balancing act is being closely monitored in Beijing, where Pakistan’s apparent tilt towards Washington has raised questions, if not caused unease.
 
 

Dr Khan maintains that Pakistan’s alleged offer to the US to build a new deep-sea port at Pasni, barely a hundred kilometres from the Gwadar Port developed by China under the CPEC initiative, and Islamabad’s silence on the matter have fuelled speculation in Beijing. He further points out that the expanding Pakistan-US cooperation in rare earth minerals and China’s growing concerns over the security of its workers in Pakistan have raised serious doubts about the future development of Gwadar and the next phase of CPEC.
This became evident from the outcome of last month’s meeting of the CPEC Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) in Beijing, which ended without resolving key issues related to the security of Chinese personnel and payments to Chinese Independent Power Producers (IPPs), two major irritants hampering fresh Chinese investment in the country.
Commitments for major projects such as the ML-1 railway upgrade also remain pending. The dispute over payments to Chinese IPPs persists, as Islamabad has sought to extend the repayment schedule. On the ML-1 project, Beijing has demanded a firm financial commitment from Pakistan before moving ahead with any agreement, particularly in light of the ongoing IMF programme.
Even so, the meeting was hailed as a milestone for marking the formal start of CPEC Phase II. Yet, attracting fresh Chinese investment will remain difficult unless these long-standing concerns are addressed, Dr Khan cautions.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal’s proposal to hold JCC meetings every six months and convene Joint Working Groups quarterly during the first three years of CPEC Phase II underscores the delays and bottlenecks that continue to impede the corridor’s progress. Analysts argue that institutional strengthening, the resolution of pending issues, and enhanced security for Chinese personnel remain essential to sustain momentum and move Phase II forward.
Dr Khan advises that Pakistan must take the Chinese policymakers into confidence to urgently dispel growing concerns that Islamabad is warming up to Washington at the expense of its strategic partnership with its time-tested friend.
“Pakistan has to navigate its foreign policy challenges in a global geopolitical environment that is marked by growing multipolarity but weakening multilateralism and increasing US-China competition. The durability of this China-Pakistan partnership hinges on Islamabad’s ability to address these pressing concerns.”
Analysts say Pak-US ties have been transactional and cyclical in nature, often fluctuating between estrangement and benign engagement. Washington has viewed Islamabad through a transactional lens, one largely shaped by its interests in the region, and has not hesitated to impose sanctions whenever those interests diverged.
The most consequential factor today is America’s policy of containing China and its strategy to rally countries behind efforts to counterbalance Beijing’s growing global influence, analysts observe.
“Pakistan’s relationship with China, by contrast, is strategic, historic, trouble-free and remains pivotal to the country’s foreign policy. While Islamabad may seek to strike a balance between the two powers, it cannot afford to be part of any anti-China strategy. This constraint limits the scope for expanding relations with Washington beyond a certain threshold,” concludes Dr Khan.

Mr Achakzai said the peaceful protest would be held under the slogan of a Habib Jalib ghazal: “Aise Dastoor Ko, Subh-i-BeNoor Ko, Me Nahi Manta, Mai Nahi Janta”.
Speaking at a news conference at the National Press Club, he anno­unced two additional slogans: “death for dictatorship and democracy live long” and “free the prisoners”.
Mr Achakzai described himself as a “true patriotic” who has taken the oath to protect the country five times, noting that the current National Ass­embly speaker, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, administered two of those oaths.

Opposition alliance announces nationwide protests; plans to observe ‘Black Day’

He recalled an exchange from 1993 with then-speaker Gohar Ayub Khan.
“I spoke to the speaker that he has taken an oath of protecting the Constitution from hundreds of people, but how will we protect the constitution,” Mr Achakzai said. “I suggested taking another oath from us that if any general violated the constitution, we will be on the roads. How­ever, my suggestion was not considered.”
Mr Achakzai drew a parallel with Afghanistan, noting the shared language and blood. “We can only forgive them if there will be constitution and democracy in Pakistan,” he said.
 
 

He criticised the country’s economic state, stating that 45 percent of people live below the poverty line while some seek lifetime impunity from the law.
“Then who will be investigated, a drug addict who steals money for the drugs or food?” he asked, claiming that those who commit minor crimes will be punished while those who “loot the country will have impunity”.
Mr Achakzai argued that the country cannot be protected by empowering a single individual but by stren­gthening its constitution and people.
“We appeal to all sections of society that it is an attack on the foundation of the country, so all should rise and resist against the conspiracy to smash the Parliament,” he said. “We all should get united and make a system to protect the country before it gets too late, here people are being killed, and they are being pushed to take the weapons in their hands.”
Another TTAP leader, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, said the 27th Amendment was designed to protect the interests of certain individuals and was disconnected from the issues facing the public.
 
 

A draft of the TTAP’s plans detailed a National Conference to be held this week to strategise against the amendment. The day after the amendment is passed will be observed as a “Black Day,” with lawyers and citizens encouraged to wear black arm strips.
It claimed that the 1973 constitution was no more representative of the masses and was being used to protect the power in Rawalpindi, Lahore and Larkana.
The movement will also involve publishing articles in national and international newspapers and establishing committees to meet with stakeholders, including bar councils and retired Supreme Court judges.

• MQM, ANP proposals for local govt reforms, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa name-change deferred
• Committee’s report on constitutional tweaks to be tabled in Senate today amid opposition boycott
ISLAMABAD: Amid a boycott by opposition lawmakers, a joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s law and justice standing committees on Sunday app­roved the 27th Consti­tutional Amendment Bill with minor changes.
The bill aims to set up a federal constitutional court and grant permanent immunity to the president as well as lifetime status to the field marshal rank, amid criticism that the amendment will erode the judiciary’s independence.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who also attended the meeting, said all key amendments, including changes to Article 243, were amicably approved by both committees. In response to a question about amendments to Article 243, Mr Dar said that all the amendments have been approved. The said article pertains to the military command structure.
 
 

Senator Farooq H. Naek, who was presiding over the meeting, said the bill was adopted with minor changes. He said that the committees empowered him and the law minister to make a couple of amendments.
The committees, however, deferred the proposals of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) seeking to amend Article 140 related to local governments as well as the Awami National Party’s (ANP) amendment for changing the name of the province.
The ANP submitted a proposal to rename Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by removing ‘Khyber’, arguing that Khyber is a district and other provinces do not include district names in provincial titles. Likewise, the Balochistan National Party’s proposed amendment to increase the seats in the province was also deferred.
Earlier in the day, ANP’s Hidayatullah Khan had told reporters that the committee had sought time until tomorrow (Monday) to decide on his party’s suggestion for changing the name of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Meanwhile, Law Mini­ster Azam Nazeer Tarar told reporters it was dec­ided that provinces be taken into confidence on changing the province’s name. MQM-P’s suggestion regarding local governments was also discussed, he said, adding that it was decided that provinces be taken into confidence on changing the province’s name. Mr Tarar further said that the report of the committees would be tabled before the Senate on Monday (today).
Opposition boycott
The standing committees met on Sunday to discuss the proposed bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment a day after it was tabled in the Senate. This bill was approved by the federal cabinet on Saturday hours before it was presented in the upper house of parliament. As Senator Farooq H. Naek chaired the meeting, the PTI, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) and the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) continued their boycott of the parliamentary committee.
Referring to the JUI-F’s absence, the law minister had stated its members had informed the committee on Saturday about their party’s policy. He emphasised that parliamentary parties should utilise their right to vote, rather than boycotting the process altogether.
The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes the PTI, announced a nationwide protest movement against the 27th Amendment, urging the people to take a stand against the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution.
 
 

Separately, PPP’s MNA Kasim Gilani, in a tweet summarised, that the 27th Constitutional Amend­ment “mainly touches 5 key areas: establishment of the Federal Const­itutional Court, transfer of judges (Article 200), fixing the KP Senate election anomaly, [two per cent] cabinet size increase on smaller provinces’ demand (Article 130(6)), [and] amendments in Article 243 on defence services & presidential immunity”.

The session was convened today — on a Sunday in a rare move — with a one-point agenda to deliberate on the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The 26-page Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 was tabled in the Senate yesterday amid the opposition’s outcry over the pace and scope of the proposed changes, just hours after its approval by the federal cabinet.
Senate Chairperson Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani presided over the session today, which began with the House remembering Allama Iqbal on his birth anniversary. Later, the house also passed a resolution in relevance to Iqbal Day.
During the session, PTI lawmakers had pictures of their party founder Imran Khan placed on their desks. At the beginning of the proceedings, a PTI leader raised an objection, to which Gilani replied that as per his ruling yesterday, the senator could bring his concerns to the Senate chairman’s office.
‘You cannot force a Constitution through bullets’
Addressing the upper house of the parliament, PTI Senator Ali Zafar outlined “five points” that he said formed the basic spirit of the 1973 Constitution and were now being “punctured” in the proposed 27th Amendment.
The first, he said, was that Pakistan was a federation with autonomous provinces. Secondly, the elected parliament had authority but was bound to the Constitution. Zafar said the third point was the fundamental rights provided therein, with courts formed to protect and implement them.
Fourth pillar of the Constitution, he added, was an independent judiciary to protect people’s rights and guarantee democracy, while the fifth one was civilian supremacy.
“If you alter this balance of five pillars even slightly through any amendment, the entire Constitution will be shaken and can result in major chaos,” Zafar warned.
At one point, Senator Sarmad Ali objected to the PTI bringing framed pictures and placards, pointing out that it was against the Senate rules, at which Gilani requested the opposition to refrain from doing so.

After presenting his arguments against the proposed legislation, Zafar urged the House to reject the bill for it and invited the treasury benches for further discussions.
“We can sit and think. There are a lot of options how to reduce the pendency of cases. We are ready to talk with you to consider amendments that will benefit the people, but we will not tolerate that you harm the public,” the PTI leader said.
During his speech, Zafar stressed that the Constitution was a contract between the state and the public, with a “spirit of its own”. He added that the document was a pledge that everyone, regardless of the region they hailed from, would live according to the laws.
“When you make any change in the Constitution, it is equal to tampering with the foundation of a building, and if you make any mistake, the entire building can collapse,” he contended.
 
 

Recalling that two dictators made amendments to the 1973 Constitution that “broke it”, Zafar highlighted that even they took “a lot of time” to be passed. He added that the “real spirit” of the 1973 Constitution was restored through the 18th Amendment in 2010.
The PTI senator underscored the need for a consensus on making any changes to the Constitution, contending that consensus and a two-thirds majority were separate things. “You cannot force a Constitution through bullets.”
Arguing that the PTI represented millions of people and was rejecting the 27th Amendment, Zafar said, “Respect the mandate of the people and kindly do not vote for this amendment.”
The lawyer asserted that those bringing any constitutional amendment should be “genuinely elected”, with no personal motives or wishes to stay in power. “This parliament, in my opinion with due respect, is not authorised to pass these amendments,” he added.
Zafar also claimed that the proposed changes related to provincial shares and rights under the 18th Amendment, which were dropped in the current draft, were a “face-saving for the PPP” so certain originally intended amendments could be passed.
He said the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) under the new amendment would end the judiciary’s independence, and the president having the authority to appoint the judges could result in “selection of his choice”. He added that the increase in retirement age of FCC judges from 65 to 68 years was an “incentive for judges to become pliant judges”.
 
 

The PTI lawmaker highlighted the powers proposed for the FCC, including considering cases related to fundamental rights, and cautioned that the court not following previous judicial precedents would result in a “collapse of the system”.
Zafar further termed the provisions related to the transfer of judges without their consent as a “dangling sword” of moving them from one high court to another. “This will bring the judiciary under the executive’s total control,” he argued.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The senator also slammed lawyers citing the reason for the formation of FCC as pendency of cases, calling them “intellectually dishonest”, and asserted that the SC pendency only amounted to two per cent of cases pending across the country.
The PTI senator recalled how the parliament “systematically” reached debating the 27th Amendment today, highlighting the “slow, gradual but effective erosion of democracy and the Supreme Court”.
He then mentioned the Jan 13, 2024 verdict by a bench led by then-chief justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, which revoked the PTI’s electoral symbol a month before the general elections. He also recalled the SC’s ruling in the Article 63A case that struck down an earlier order and allowed the ballots of lawmakers who voted against party policy to be counted.
 
 

“It was as if the judiciary opened the gates for the 26th Amendment through this decision,” Zafar alleged, further claiming that the ruling coalition coerced some lawmakers to vote in 26th Amendment’s favour. The senator clarified that the PTI had never agreed to even the formation of constitutional benches, and had instead termed them “lesser of the two evils” compared to a constitutional court.
The senator then highlighted three verdicts handed by the SC’s constitutional benches — the reserved seats ruling that distributed seats earlier awarded to the PTI to the coalition partners, the order allowing the military trials of civilians, and the ruling in the judges’ transfer case to allegedly “control the Islamabad High Court”.
The upper house of the parliament broke into a loud exchange at one point, when Gilani gave the floor to PTI’s Faisal Javed to speak but a lawmaker interjected. “Who are you to say this to me when the chairman has allowed me to speak?” Javed asked.
Necessary to bring some improvements in judicial system: PML-N’s Pervaiz Rashid
From the treasury benches, PML-N Senator Pervaiz Rashid regretted that Barrister Zafar had presented just one side of the picture, “which is likeable to them”. Zafar did not mention anything about the effort in the past to “convert the judiciary into a tool of a political party”, Rashid said.

The PML-N lawmaker said the members from the opposition benches had spoken on just one point of the proposed amendment, which pertained to the judiciary. He added that he would take it as their acceptance of the rest of the clauses of the proposed amendment.
Rashid further stated that he would have been pleased had opposition members also participated in the meetings of the standing committees so that their input would have been included in their reports and subsequently discussed in the house.
Meanwhile, PPP Senator Syed Masroor Ahsan said the PTI lawmakers were “confused”, which led to an eruption of responses from the opposition benches.
In his fiery speech, Ahsan stated that the PPP had “seen bodies” of its slain leaders, including late prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, his daughter and ex-premier Benazir, Murtaza Bhutto, Shahnawaz Bhutto and Nusrat Bhutto.
“You are in the parliament, you are sitting with politicians, you are also ready to enact legislation with political individuals, but you are willing to talk with someone else only,” he said while addressing the PTI.
The PPP senator also said he wanted the opposition to take part in the meetings of the standing committees, just as they were participating in the Senate proceedings.
 






You cannot end judiciary’s independence because of past decisions: Hamid Khan
In his speech, PTI Senator Hamid Khan took exception to the manner in which the government was trying to amend the Constitution.
 

PTI Senator Hamid Khan addresses a Senate session on Nov 9, 2025. — screengrab via YouTube/ PTV Parliament

“Constitutional amendments are not promulgated in this manner. You first reach a consensus and then amend the constitution,” he asserted.
Khan further stated that he considered the 26th Amendment “the death of the Constitution” and the effort to promulgate the 27th Amendment was akin to an “effort to bury the Constitution”.
“Both these amendments are truly something to be ashamed of.”
He went on to say that some political parties had “complaints that when the judiciary was liberated in the true sense, it issued orders to disqualify two prime ministers”.
 
 

“But this does not mean that they (political parties) get personal […] They [shouldn’t try to] put an end to the same Constitution under which [the prime ministers] were disqualified, to bring about the end of that same judiciary that disqualified them,” he added.
Khan clarified that he understood that those decisions were “controversial to some extent” and he was not supporting those decisions. “But this does not mean that you end the independence of the judiciary because of judges’ past decisions. […] Both right and wrong decision are made in history, but they don’t become a reason to ban courts.”
He questioned that if the existing judicial system ceased to exist, “who will you go to for your fundamental rights?”.
“We are at a historical moment [at present]. And if, for any reason, […] we take a step that results in the destruction and distortion of the Constitution, all of us will have to face its consequences — those who will vote [in favour of it] and the coming generations as well,” he warned.
PTI Senator Azam Swati, addressing the Upper House with a black ribbon tied around his arm, hailed the “amazing” 1973 Constitution introduced by Bhutto and other political leaders, adding that the 27th Amendment would ruin it.
Swati contended that the Statement of Object and Reasons in the proposed bill did not even address the amendments suggested in it, terming them “vague and incomplete”. He further said that the SC’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) had been torn into pieces, and that Articles 175 and 191 did not make up for it.
“May God give you long life, this (legislation) will bite you back one day, and you will admit that you made a major mistake,” the PTI leader said.
PTI’s Mohsin Aziz also questioned the “haste” in passing the Amendment, adding that certain “informed” individuals already knew that this legislation would be introduced.
He said most of the amendments made so far were “benign”, while certain were major such as the 13th, 18th and 25th. “So why is there a need for two amendments in just two years?” he asked.
The PTI lawmaker defended the speeches given by Zafar and Hamid, saying they were not political. “They spoke as opposition not for the sake of opposition, but for the sake of betterment of this country.”
He further said, “Do not be in haste. If there are good amendments, we will definitely sit proudly with you and agree on it.”
‘Are non-Muslims not Pakistanis?’
Balochistan Awami Party Senator Danesh Kumar also spoke during the session,  raising the question that when amendments were proposed, why did they not address the lack of minorities in the federal cabinet.
“When you were proposing amendments to Article 130 and expanding the size of the cabinet, why did you not suggest that at least one member be from the minorities?” he asked, addressing Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar.
“There are no minority members in KP or Balochistan. The only minority member here is a state minister, not a federal minister,” he added.
Kumar then mentioned that according to the Constitution, the prime minister and president have to be Muslim.
“In Article 91, it says the prime minister can only be Muslim. Are we non-Muslims not Pakistani?” he asked. “If you are bringing amendments, then amend these things.”
Later, the Senate session was adjourned until 11am tomorrow.
‘Govt’s haste calls into question the intention behind moving the bill’
Separately, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) issued a statement, deploring “the manner in which the 27th Amendment to the Constitution is being tabled in Parliament”.
“The government’s haste—including the absence of any meaningful consultation with the political opposition, the wider legal fraternity and civil society—calls into question the very intention behind moving this amendment bill.
“Its reported content, with numerous changes designed to reconfigure the judicial system, the office-specific concentration of power ceding more civilian space, and lifelong immunity to certain state offices, has alarmed constitutionalists, the legal fraternity, human rights defenders and many others who believe in the independence of the judiciary and the tenets of civilian supremacy in a democracy,” the statement posted on X said.
It added that the  HRCP planned to hold an urgent consultation with a wide range of stakeholders to examine the proposed amendment and its “far-reaching impact on the country’s polity and society”.
 






Meanwhile, Karachi Press Club (KPC) President Fazil Jamili posted on X that the “ rushed 27th Amendment through Parliament, lacking the meaningful consultation, is deeply alarming“.
“We at KPC deplore the proposed judicial reconfiguration, concentrated power, and lifelong immunity, which gravely threaten the independence of the judiciary and civilian supremacy,” he added.

According to state-run APP, the premier hosted a dinner for the senators — a development that came after the standing committees on law and justice of both houses of Parliament approved the proposed legislation earlier today.
The bill for the amendment, which has been criticised particularly over its clauses pertaining to changes in the judiciary and Article 243 (command of the armed forces) of the Constitution, was tabled in the Senate yesterday amid the opposition’s outcry. Prior to that, the PM had held several meetings with the representatives of the allied parties with the proposed legislation on the agenda.
According to the APP report, addressing his guests today, the PM said he was thankful to the heads of all allied parties and President Zardari.
“All allied parties fully backed this national thought,” the report quoted him as saying. He further stated: “All of us made unified efforts to strengthen the federation, in the broader interests of the country, to increase harmony among the provinces and to improve governance.”
The premier said that all the “milestones” achieved by his government were a result of the coordination with the allied parties.
“Pakistan’s diplomatic successes are a reflection of harmony and unity among the allied parties. It is because of our unified efforts that Pakistan reached a great position,” he said.
He maintained that the country’s economic situation had been improving and Pakistan was now “moving in the right direction” due to political and economic stability.
He stressed the need to work together for the country’s progress.</p><small>2025-11-09 19:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0923543224c2206.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954106/bbc-boss-tim-davie-resigns-following-criticism-over-trump-documentary-edit' target='_blank'><strong>BBC boss Tim Davie resigns following criticism over Trump documentary edit</strong></a><br><p>The director general of Britain’s BBC, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of news, Deborah Turness, have resigned following criticism over bias at the corporation, including in the way it edited a speech by United States President Donald Trump.
The BBC has been embroiled in a spate of allegations that it had failed to maintain political neutrality in its reporting, including in its coverage of Trump, the Israel-Hamas war and over transgender issues.
In the most recent controversy, The Daily Telegraph had reported for days on an internal document produced by a former BBC adviser on standards who had listed a raft of errors, including in the way a speech by Trump on January 6, 2021, was edited.
The document suggested the flagship ‘Panorama’ programme had edited two parts of Trump’s speech together so he appeared to encourage the Capitol Hill riots of January 2021.
“This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the Chair and Board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure, including during recent days,” Davie said in a statement.
“I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering.”
Trump in the BBC documentary was shown telling his supporters that “we’re going to walk down to the Capitol” and that they would “fight like hell”, a comment he made in a different part of his speech.
Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the BBC as “100 per cent fake news” and a “propaganda machine” in an interview published on Friday.
Davie will stay on for the next few months while a replacement is found. A person familiar with the situation said Davie’s decision had left the BBC board stunned by the move.</p><small>2025-11-09 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/092144081db981f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954104/fir-registered-against-kp-cm-afridi-under-peca-law-over-profane-misleading-remarks-about-state-institutions' target='_blank'><strong>FIR registered against KP CM Afridi under Peca law over ‘profane, misleading’ remarks about state institutions</strong></a><br><p>A case was registered against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad over his “profane” and “misleading” remarks about state institutions.
Afridi had made the remarks referred to in the FIR on Nov 6 during an interaction with the media outside Adiala jail after he was once again denied an audience with PTI founder Imran Khan.
He had alleged that security forces in KP would bring dogs into mosques and tie them down there, thereby violating the sanctity of holy places. His statement sparked an outcry, drawing condemnations.
Subsequently, a first information report (FIR) was registered against him today on behalf of the state and under Sections 11, 20 and 26-A of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, stated that following an inquiry dated November 8, it transpired that Afridi and others had “knowingly and deliberately, with mala fide intentions and ulterior motives, uttered false, misleading, derogatory and intimidating words against state institutions, which were recorded [and] disseminated and propagated” through social media platforms. In this connection, the FIR particularly mentioned the PTI’s YouTube channel.
It said that in a video uploaded on the channel, Afridi had made a statement “containing offensive, profane, false, misleading and unfounded allegations, with the intent to malign, defame and cause harm to the reputation and integrity of the state institutions of Pakistan”.
The “false, fake and ill-will content, publicly and intentionally uttered and promoted by the accused and others through social media is an organised attempt to undermine public trust on state institutions, including racial hatred, create unrest in the country and destablise national security”, it was alleged in the FIR.
In the report, Afridi was also accused of being involved in “preparing, publishing, sharing and circulating fake and misleading contents publicly on social media with the intention to incite violence, create racial hatred, panic, fear, disorder and unrest among the general public alongwith promoting anti-state sentiments, which is detrimental to the security, integrity and stability of Pakistan”.</p><small>2025-11-09 16:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091852100322c36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954093/pakistan-saudi-arabia-vow-to-deepen-defence-ties-enhance-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Saudi Arabia vow to deepen defence ties, enhance bilateral cooperation</strong></a><br><p>The military leadership of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia vowed to enhance bilateral defence cooperation and reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen ties between the two countries, a statement from the military’s media wing said.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the commitment was made during a meeting of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, with the Chief of General Staff of the Saudi Armed Forces, General Fayyadh bin Hamed Al-Ruwaili, in Saudi Arabia. The Pakistani official is on an official visit to the Kingdom.
“During the meeting, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional environment and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation,” the ISPR said. “The military leadership reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen the strong brotherly ties and enduring defence partnership between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.”
 






In recognition of his significant contributions in deepening Pakistan-Kingdom of Saudi Arabia relationship, in particular the military to military ties, the CJCSC was conferred with the “King Abdulaziz Medal of Honour of the Excellent Class,“ the ISPR stated.
It further added that the Saudi military leadership lauded the professionalism of the Pakistan armed forces and acknowledged their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
In September, the two countries signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.</p><small>2025-11-09 15:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/09185407814bf55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954100/before-talks-with-trump-riyadh-doubles-down-on-terms-for-israel-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Before talks with Trump, Riyadh doubles down on terms for Israel ties</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump has been talking up the prospects of Saudi Arabia agreeing to normalise ties with Israel, but it is unlikely to happen when Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits the White House this month.
The establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia after decades of enmity could shake up the political and security landscape in the Middle East, potentially strengthening US influence in the region.
Trump said last month he hoped Saudi Arabia would “very soon” join other Muslim countries that signed the 2020 Abraham Accords normalising ties with Israel.
But Riyadh has signalled to Washington through diplomatic channels that its position has not changed: it will sign up only if there is agreement on a roadmap to Palestinian statehood, two Gulf sources told Reuters.

The intention is to avoid diplomatic missteps and ensure alignment of the Saudi and US positions before any public statements are made, they said. One said the aim was to avoid any confusion at or after the White House talks on November 18.
The Crown Prince, widely known as MBS, “is not likely to entertain any possible formalising of ties in the near future without at least a credible pathway to a Palestinian state”. said Jonathan Panikoff, former deputy US national intelligence officer on the Middle East.
MBS is likely to try to use his influence with Trump to seek “more explicit and vocal buy-in for the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state,” said Panikoff, who is now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington.
Trump’s upbeat comments on Abraham Accords
Next week’s visit is the Crown Prince’s first to Washington since the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, an MBS critic whose murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul caused global outrage. MBS denied direct involvement.
The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco have already normalised ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, and Trump has said he expects an expansion of the accords soon.
“We have a lot of people joining now the Abraham Accords, and hopefully we’re going to get Saudi Arabia very soon,” he said on November 5, without offering a timeline.
 
 

In a television interview broadcast on October 17, he said, “I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in. I think when Saudi Arabia goes in, everybody goes in.” But the agreement signed by the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco sidestepped the issue of Palestinian statehood.
The two Gulf sources said Riyadh had signalled to Washington that any move to recognise Israel must be part of a new framework, not just an extension of any deal.
For Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and custodian of its two holiest sites, Makkah and Madina, recognising Israel would be more than just a diplomatic milestone. It is a deeply sensitive national security issue tied to resolving one of the region’s oldest and most intractable conflicts.
Such a step would be hard to take when the Arab public’s mistrust of Israel remains high over the scale of its military offensive during the war against Hamas in Gaza, despite a fragile ceasefire in the conflict that followed the group’s attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.
Saudi Foreign Ministry official Manal Radwan has called for a clear, time-bound Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the deployment of an international protection force and the empowerment and return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza.
These steps, she said, are essential to the establishment of a Palestinian state — the prerequisite for regional integration and the implementation of the two-state solution.
With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu staunchly opposed to Palestinian statehood, Saudi Arabia sees no immediate prospect of satisfying Trump’s demand that it normalise ties with Israel, the sources told Reuters.
Progress on that front depends on concessions neither Washington nor Israel is currently prepared to make, Saudi officials say.
Trump and Crown Prince set to seal defence pact
Saudi officials are intent on steering the Trump-MBS meeting towards defence cooperation and investment, wary that the politically charged issue of normalisation of ties with Israel could overshadow the agenda.
 
 

The meeting is expected to seal a pivotal defence pact defining the scope of US military protection for the de facto ruler of the world’s top oil exporter, and to cement America’s military footprint in the Gulf. The prospective deal has, however, been scaled back.
Two other Gulf sources and three Western diplomats said the defence deal falls short of the full, Congress-ratified treaty Riyadh once sought in exchange for the long-promised normalisation of ties with Israel.
The agreement, loosely modelled on an arrangement with Qatar that was established through an executive order in September, expands cooperation to include cutting-edge technology and defence.
Riyadh, according to the two Gulf sources, pushed for provisions to allow future US administrations to elevate the pact to a full treaty — a safeguard to ensure continuity for a non-binding pact, vulnerable to reversal by future presidents.
“It’s not the treaty they want; they might not see it as perfect, but it’s a stepping stone [to a full treaty],” said David Makovsky, a fellow at the Washington Institute, where he directs a project on Arab-Israeli relations.
The linkage between the defence pact, normalisation with Israel and Palestinian statehood has produced a complex negotiating equation, pushing Riyadh and Washington to settle for a limited defence deal in the absence of progress on the other two tracks, the Gulf sources and Western diplomats said.
That compromise, they say, could eventually evolve into a full treaty if normalisation advances.
“The Saudi-American negotiations have undergone a fundamental shift in environment and context following the developments in Gaza since October 7,” said Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Saudi-based Gulf Research Institute think tank.
He said the direct linkage between normalisation of ties with Israel and Palestinian statehood remained, but Riyadh now wanted Saudi national security requirements addressed separately.
“The Saudi position is clear: meeting the Kingdom’s national security demands will help shape its broader stance on regional issues, including the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,” he said.
Threat from Iran receding
A Nato-style defence pact appears a distant prospect, given the shifting regional calculus and the political hurdles in Washington.
Iran, the main threat once driving Riyadh’s pursuit of binding US guarantees, has been strategically weakened over the past year by Israeli strikes on its nuclear and military infrastructure.
The Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen have also suffered heavy blows.
With pressure from Iran easing, the appetite for a treaty requiring two-thirds congressional approval has diminished, especially in the absence of normalisation with Israel.
The two Gulf sources said such a pact would likely come with conditions, including curbs on Saudi Arabia’s expanding economic and technology ties with China, complicating Riyadh’s drive to balance strategic autonomy with US security guarantees.
The current deal would expand joint military exercises, deepen cooperation between US and Saudi defence firms, and include safeguards to limit Riyadh’s military-industrial ties with China, the sources said.
It would also fast-track advanced US weapons sales to the kingdom, bypassing the delays and political hurdles that have stalled previous deals.</p><small>2025-11-09 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091634186d3679d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954086/afghan-taliban-used-talks-to-prolong-temporary-ceasefire-not-take-action-against-terrorism-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan Taliban used talks to prolong temporary ceasefire, not take action against terrorism: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday stated that the Afghan Taliban only participated in talks with Pakistan this past week to prolong a temporary ceasefire between the two nations and did not take any action against terrorist elements operating from their soil.
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban followed weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month. On Friday, the talks broke down, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying that the negotiations “entered an indefinite phase”, but a temporary ceasefire between Kabul and Islamabad still stands.
In a lengthy statement published today, the FO said: “Anyone following the talks held under the mediation of brotherly countries of Turkiye and Qatar, could easily discern that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna-al-Khawarij) and BLA/FaH (Balochistan Liberation Army/Fitna-al-Hindustan) elements present on Afghan soil.”
 
 

Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“Instead of finding solutions to address Pakistan’s core concern, [the] Afghan regime used the opportunity to malign Pakistan through hypothetical accusations and jingoistic rhetoric,” the statement added. “It prolonged discussions and engaged in futile arguments to stonewall the efforts at reaching any concrete understanding.”
The statement added that at the same time, the Afghan Taliban regime tried to paint the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue.
“In the aftermath of Pakistan’s ‘Operation Zarb-i-Azb’ in 2015, terrorists belonging to the so-called TTP/FaK fled to Afghanistan,” the statement read. “They abetted [the] Afghan Taliban in their fight against the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) and [the] Afghan Government of the time. These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by [the] Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to Afghan Taliban.”
Despite the breakdown of the negotiations, the statement emphasised that Pakistan has never turned down dialogue with “any government in Kabul”, but affirmed that it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.
The FO noted that since the Taliban’s takeover in 2021, terrorist attacks in Pakistan surged, with the attacks “emanating from Afghan soil”. It added that despite the attacks, Islamabad maintained restraint and took no retaliatory action.
“Pakistan’s expectation was that with [the] passage of time, [the] Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the TTP/FaK elements present on Afghan soil,” the statement read, adding that Pakistan tried to foster positive ties through providing humanitarian assistance and encouraging trade.
“However, despite all these positive gestures by Pakistan in terms of trade, humanitarian assistance, educational and medical visas facilitation and efforts at international forums to encourage the international community to engage with [the] Taliban regime in the interest of regional peace and stability, and for the socio-economic development of Afghanistan and its people, the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction.”
The statement reiterated Pakistan’s demand that the Afghan Taliban hand over these terrorists to Islamabad’s custody, adding that Kabul repeatedly refused to do so, citing a lack of control.
“More than being a matter of capability, it has become a matter of intent of [the] Taliban regime. Empty hopes and hollow promises rendered by Taliban regime so far have already outlived their efficacy,” the FO stated.
“[The] Taliban regime is also trying to portray the TTP/FaK and BLA/FaH elements as refugees in Afghanistan. This is not a humanitarian or a refugee issue, but a ploy to frame terrorists as refugees.”
The statement added: “Instead of acting upon the core expectation from Pakistan … not to allow Afghan territory to be used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions.”
The FO said Kabul has tried to “confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues” and keeps trying to “develop a narrative which absolves [the] Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards international community and its own people.”
The statement affirmed that Pakistan’s response to attacks launched from Afghanistan’s territory would leave “no stone unturned” to safeguard its sovereignty and citizens, adding that anyone supporting or abetting terrorists is “not considered a friend” of Islamabad’s.
Narratives and propaganda
The statement added that the Afghan Taliban try to spread narratives about disagreements within Islamabad over Afghan policy.
“Irrespective of this misleading propaganda, there is absolute clarity among the people of Pakistan that the ordinary people of Pakistan are the biggest victims of the terrorist activities by elements hiding in Afghanistan and their abettors,” the FO clarified, maintaining that Pakistan’s armed forces are fully capable of safeguarding the population against any acts of aggression.
Moreover, the FO noted in its statement an attempt by elements in the Afghan Taliban to “instigate Pashtoon (Pakhtun) nationalism” in Pakistan.
“It is a historical fact that Pashtoons in Pakistan are a vibrant part of the society and the state, holding leadership positions across the spectrum of polity and bureaucracy,” the statement read.
“More … Pashtoons live in Pakistan than in Afghanistan … therefore, instead of instigating pashtoonism in Pakistan, it would be wise for [the] Taliban regime to look into its own credentials of inclusivity of all segments of its population in its governance structures.”
‘Strong lobby’
The FO added that there are people within the Afghan Taliban who do not want war with Pakistan, but noted the presence of a “strong lobby, with monetary support from foreign actors that has been tasked to stoke tensions”.
“In search for legitimacy and to unite their fractious government, certain elements in [the] Taliban regime, anti-Pakistan terrorist elements and their abettors have found raising the bogey of Pakistan quite useful,” the statement read.
“These elements have engaged in abuses and outrageous allegations against Pakistan. By doing so, they are fast eroding whatever goodwill they had within Pakistan.”
Border clashes and talks
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha.
Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held several rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement was not achieved.
After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday.
The talks began on Friday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire. Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing.
However, the talks failed as negotiators could not bridge deep differences between the two sides.
“Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” said the defence minister while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’.
The defence minister added that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and that they were not willing to sign a written agreement. “They said that they would only respect the verbal agreement, but there is no room to do that.”</p><small>2025-11-09 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/09141258eab6037.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954078/ttap-rejects-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance TTAP rejects suggested ‘person-specific’ changes in Article 243</strong></a><br><p>Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Saturday rejected certain changes suggested to Article 243 of the Constitution under the 27th Amendment, claiming they were “person-specific”.
Yesterday, hours after the Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act 2025 was tabled in the Senate, the TTAP announced a nationwide protest movement against the proposed legislation starting today.
Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai, who leads the alliance, TTAP Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas addressed a joint press conference in Islamabad.
“Fundamentally, the concept of social contract implies how the state will take care of an individual’s basic rights. This is what the Constitution is all about,” Khokar noted. He stressed the concept of separation of powers provided in the 1973 Constitution, which meant that “no one institution will become so strong as to overpower other institutions”.
“Social contracts have nothing to do with personalities. The amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution are person-specific. They have been drafted by keeping in view the benefits of one position, the position of the field marshal,” Khokhar claimed.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Among the various proposals in the 27th Amendment bill are changes to the military leadership structure by rewriting Article 243 of the Constitution (command of the armed forces).
The bill proposes creating the post of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and abolishing the long-standing office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which was the top military role. If passed, the Amendment would also make the army chief the constitutionally recognised CDF, placing him at the top of Pakistan’s armed services.
The proposed legislation also vests broader, constitutionally protected powers and privileges in the country’s top military leadership.
 
 

Khokhar also termed the proposed lifetime immunity for the president from criminal proceedings as “person-specific”, quipping that the “theatre of the absurd” left the TTAP in surprise.
“These have no connection to the public […] half of Pakistan has gone below the poverty line, but the political, military and judicial elite are making amendments in the Constitution to protect themselves and attain their interests,” the former senator alleged.
“Why should we not think that this is to reward the existing judges in the Supreme Court whose retirements are due,” he added, contending that it was the duty of every segment of society to oppose such legislation.
Khokhar detailed the TTAP’s movement against the proposed Amendment, which included a National Consultative Conference to be held in Islamabad next week, where the future plan of action will be decided.
Khokhar stressed that the fundamental objection to the amendments was that the parliament was “not a representative” of the public as the “mandate was manufactured”, reiterating the rigging allegations during the February 2024 general elections.
The former senator also recalled the “way the 26th Amendment was passed”, indirectly referring to the claims of the PTI and the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) of their leaders being pressured to vote in favour of it.
Khokhar also criticised the Supreme Court for playing the “most important role” in the preparations for the 27th Amendment by allotting the reserved seats to the ruling coalition parties. The ruling, given by the court’s Constitutional Bench formed under the 26th Amendment, struck down an earlier SC verdict that had declared the PTI eligible for those seats.
“They (coalition partners) then got the required number [of lawmakers], as a result of which today they are about to pass the 27th Amendment,” the politician contended.
“We can’t shy away from the facts before us. This parliament does not have the ethical or legal legitimacy to carry out such big amendments,” he asserted.
 


Meanwhile, Achakzai contended that the SC judges should have summoned those parties involved in the Amendment for “attacking the Constitution”. “Until the judges do this, we will take this case of Article 6 (high treason) before the public’s court.”
Addressing the media, the MWM chief detailed the suggested changes to Article 243 and said, “You are giving all the power to one person and making them the head of all, and giving them lifetime immunity. They are making another god.”
Abbas underscored the need for checks and controls on powers, adding that the country was “heading towards fascism”. He alleged that the public’s mandate was “stolen” in the 2024 elections.
“You have destroyed the parliament, as well as the judiciary, and now where are you taking the institution that has to protect Pakistan’s borders?” Abbas said.
“We promise our public to challenge this amendment as much as we can,” he asserted.
Course of action
Later, the opposition alliance also shared its planned course of action to resist the proposed legislation.
The TTAP said in a statement that a “national consultative conference” would be called in Islamabad to devise a strategy, adding that in case of the approval of the bill, a black day would be observed the next day after the development over the “violation and demolition of the Human Contract of 1973”.
It also urged “judges having conscience” to express their stance and reservations over the proposed legislation through letters or in press conferences.
The statement further stated that following the 27th Amendment, the Constitution would no longer be the one agreed upon in 1973 but “an insurance policy for protecting and prolonging the power of Pindi, Lahore and Larkana”.
In this connection, the TTAP stressed that either the Constitution be restored in its original form, as it was till the promulgation of the 18th Amendment, or a debate should be started in Pakistan for a new human contract.
A plan should be presented at the meeting in Islamabad for holding rallies and corner meetings across the country, and an initiative for building public opinion should be undertaken by forming a committee to begin meaningful consultation with and gain support of civil society, media and business community.
“Such committees should be formed up to the union council level and hold meetings with the influencial representatives of trader associations and neighbourhoods and farmers’ bodies.
“Article should be written for local and international newspapers and magazines to present the case of the people of Pakistan on a regular basis,” the statement read.
It further said that the participation of lawyer bodies in this movement should be ensured, and a delegation should be constituted to convince the retired judges of Supreme Court and high courts to participate in the movement or at least gain their support.
PTI parliamentary lea­der Barrister Ali Zafar has contended that the debate on the bill was inappropriate in the absence of a notified leader of the opposition. He accused the government and its allies of being in a “hurry” to pass the amendments.
However, the PML-N and the PPP have rejected the impression that the 27th Amendment bill was rushed through without proper debate, saying the draft has undergone “extensive scrutiny”.</p><small>2025-11-09 12:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/09154911e28ebdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954084/turkiyes-top-officials-to-visit-pakistan-next-week-over-tensions-with-afghanistan-president-erdogan' target='_blank'><strong>Türkiye’s top officials to visit Pakistan next week over tensions with Afghanistan: President Erdogan</strong></a><br><p>Türkiye’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin will visit Islamabad next week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday.
He made the announcement while speaking to reporters on his flight returning from Azerbaijan.
Talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators, broke down on Friday without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to monitor and prevent cross-border terrorism, officials and sources said.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif insisted that the negotiations were “over” and had “entered an indefinite phase”.
“Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” Asif told Geo News, alleging that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and was unwilling to sign a written agreement.
A senior security source confirmed that discussions had hit an impasse. “The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” he said.
However, it is understood that a fragile ceasefire between the two countries is still holding. The defence minister also said that the truce stands for the time being but warned that the “moment there is a ceasefire violation from their side, we will respond befittingly”.
The third round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks began on Thursday in Istanbul and was planned to continue for two days. Pakistan’s delegation, led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Asim Malik, included senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials.
The Afghan Taliban side was headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and included Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib.
Reports from Istanbul suggest that the Pakistani delegation had left the hotel for the airport after the talks broke down. There was no direct meeting between the two delegations on Friday. The sides had met face to face in the presence of Qatari and Turkish mediators the previous day.
The ISI chief and some members of the Pakistan delegation have left Istanbul, but the Pakistani side is still not ruling out resumption of the process. A source said an attempt will be made to break the deadlock. It is believed that some senior officials have stayed behind to work with the mediators.
For most of Friday, mediators engaged the Afghan delegation separately, relaying Pakistan’s concerns and demands. Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesman, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, told reporters in Islamabad that the Pakistani delegation had presented its case in a “comprehensive and evidence-based manner”.
He added, “The Pakistan delegation has handed over its evidence-based, justified and logical demands to the mediators with a singular aim to put an end to cross-border terrorism. They are now discussing Pakistan’s demands with the Afghan delegation point by point.”
The dialogue process was launched after border clashes in early October that left several soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Turkiye and Qatar then stepped in to mediate.
The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire, while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks.
The latest round was aimed at finalising the modalities of that verification and monitoring mechanism.
Afghan negotiators, meanwhile, claimed on Friday that their own proposals were “logical and easily achievable” for Pakistan but described Islama­bad’s demands as “unrealistic and aggressive”, suggesting they might serve as a pretext to create further complications.
According to a source familiar with the discussions, the Afghan side conveyed that “it is up to Pakistan’s own calculations to deal with the situation”.
A source in Istanbul described the late-evening atmosphere at Istanbul’s Conrad Hotel, where the talks were held, as “not positive”.
Iranian FM calls Pakistani, Afghan counterparts
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday spoke to his Pakistani and Afghan counterparts, Ishaq Dar and Amir Khan Muttaqi, discussing bilateral ties as well as the recent negotiations in Istanbul between Islamabad and Kabul, the Iranian and Afghan foreign ministries said.
According to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, Araghchi announced Iran’s readiness for any kind of assistance to resolve differences between the two countries.
“Expressing concern about the current situation between Afghanistan and Pakistan, he emphasised the need for continued dialogue between the two sides with the cooperation of influential countries in the region to resolve differences and reduce tension, and announced the readiness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide any kind of assistance to achieve this goal.
FM Dar, while explaining the latest situation and the results of the talks between his country and Afghanistan following recent developments, stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region, according to IRNA. The two sides also agreed to continue consultations in this regard.</p><small>2025-11-09 11:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091319524033933.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954077/must-remain-fully-accountable-pm-shehbaz-orders-withdrawal-of-immunity-for-premier-in-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>‘Must remain fully accountable’: PM Shehbaz orders withdrawal of immunity for premier in 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday ordered the withdrawal of proposed immunity for the PM as part of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, urging that the premier must remain “fully accountable”.
Taking to X, he ordered the withdrawal of a clause seeking to grant immunity to the PM in the 27th Amendment and said, “On my return from Azerbaijan, I have learnt that some Senators belonging to our party have submitted an amendment regarding immunity for the prime minister.”
“While I acknowledge their intent in good faith, the proposal was not part of the Cabinet-approved draft. I have instructed that it be withdrawn immediately,” PM Shehbaz wrote.
 






“As a matter of principle, an elected prime minister must remain fully accountable, both before the court of law and the people.”
Separately, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while speaking to reporters today, said that PM Shehbaz told him earlier that “he had no interest in getting immunity,” owing to the executive nature of his role as the prime minister.
“The other positions being granted immunity do not have any executive functions,” Tarrar explained.
The statement comes as Senate and National Assembly committees continue to hold discussions on the proposed bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), changes to the appointment process for high court judges, a higher cap on provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure. A set of clauses in the bill also proposes life-long constitutional protection to officers promoted to five-star ranks of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet.
 
 

Such officers would “retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life”, removable only through the impeachment-like procedure under Article 47.
Immunities similar to those enjoyed by the president under Article 248 would apply in this case.
Article 248 of the Constitution stipulates that “no criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the president or a governor in any court during his term of office.”
On Saturday afternoon, the federal cabinet approved the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment, welcoming it to “the fullest extent.”
Subsequently, it was tabled before the Senate, triggering noisy protests from the opposition over the pace and scope of the proposed changes.
PM Shehbaz was elected as the 24th premier of Pakistan in the 2024 general elections. Article 95 of the Constitution of Pakistan allows for a prime minister to be impeached via a no-confidence motion.
It states: “A resolution for a vote of no-confidence moved by not less than twenty per centum of the total membership of the National Assembly may be passed against the Prime Minister by the National Assembly.”</p><small>2025-11-09 10:13</small></div><hr>
