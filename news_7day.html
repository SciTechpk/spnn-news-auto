“Mainly dry weather with clear skies is expected on 6th and 7th February, while dry weather with few cloudy conditions on 8th February, 2026 in Lahore during the Basant 2026,” the PMD said in a forecast posted on the social media platform X.
It added that light westerly/north-westerly winds were likely to blow at the speed of 10 to 15 kilometres per hour, which was “suitable for safe kite-flying”.
The PMD advised the festival participants to “exercise caution while flying kites, especially near electric lines and open roads”.







The three-day Basant festival is set to kick off in Lahore from February 6, following the Punjab government’s decision to lift a ban on the historic event after 18 years, with strict regulations.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has announced a “long weekend” in the province, declaring a “provincial Basant holiday on the 6th, followed by Saturday and Sunday”.

 

The festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.</p><small>2026-02-03 12:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03131703d407f43.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970806/na-adopts-resolution-calling-for-aggressive-national-response-against-terrorisms-sponsors-facilitators' target='_blank'><strong>NA adopts resolution calling for ‘aggressive’ national response against terrorism’s sponsors, facilitators</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Tuesday adopted a resolution calling for an “aggressive” national response against the external sponsors and internal facilitators of terrorism.
The lower house of Parliament continued its discussion on the prevailing security situation in Balochistan in the wake of a series of deadly attacks across the province on Saturday.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tabled the resolution, which was passed with a majority vote.
It stated: “This House condemns in the strongest terms the recent terrorist incidents in Balochistan, in which not only innocent civilians were targeted but also heinous and inhumane tactics such as using women as weapons were adopted.”
The NA further demanded that an “immediate, aggressive, coordinated, and effective national response be ensured against these external sponsors and internal facilitators, funding, smuggling, and propaganda hubs, in which political, diplomatic, military, intelligence, legal, and rhetorical fronts are united”.







The resolution highlighted that “in several cases, evidence available points to external sponsorship, [and] particularly there are serious concerns over the role of India”.
It further said terrorism was “being supported in some neighbouring countries through logistical and operational facilitation, financial support, training, treatment, movement and propaganda networks”.
The resolution also expressed “deep sorrow and concern over the fact that terrorist networks are trying to use women against the state and society through exploitation, coercion and blackmail”, adding that it was completely contrary to Islamic, Pakistani and Baloch values.
It appreciated the “timely and effective measures taken by the security forces, law enforcement agencies, the provincial government of Balochistan and the civil administration”.
Expressing solidarity with the martyrs and the injured, the resolution asserted that attacks on “civilian populations, women, and children are unforgivable crimes, and the state must take decisive action against such elements on the principle of zero tolerance”.
The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a large-scale coordinated attack across Balochistan on Saturday.
The security forces killed 92 terrorists as they responded to the incidents, with more militants being eliminated later to take the 48-hour tally to 177 on Monday.
Lawmakers sound alarm
Lawmakers from across the political spectrum, including those from the PTI, the PPP and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), sounded an alarm on the surge in terrorism in the province.
During some opposition speeches, the proceedings were not livestreamed on the NA’s YouTube channel.
Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai suggested an addition in a resolution that would “recommend that the first right of the children of a province be acknowledged on their respective province’s resources”.
NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq remarked that this was a “constitutionally protected” matter.



In his speech, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said terrorist incidents were taking place in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa frequently.
“If we do not see its root causes and the basic issues leading to this, and do not assess it correctly […], the situation would not move forward,” he said.
Stating that Pakistanis are aggrieved when someone is killed in a terrorist incident, Qaiser said: “We need to see what the fundamental reason is for this insurgency in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at the moment, and that insurgency is not being controlled in any way.”
He further said, “A state is like a mother, and when a state does not do justice to its children, does not give them basic rights, differentiates between them and does not treat them fairly, then it has to face such situations.”
The former NA speaker stressed the need to figure out the root causes behind the rising unrest in Balochistan. “The fundamental thing is democracy,” he added.
“When you do not give importance to the public and do not accept their opinions and suggestions, and when the people think they are beings of a lower level and their thoughts have no value,” he said, before the NA YouTube livestream was disrupted for over a minute.



The PTI leader then lamented that ex-premier Imran Khan was being denied the right to meet his family in jail. He contended that his imprisonment was “unlawful”, and his remarks were not aired for half a minute.
According to a clip uploaded by the NA, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq objected to certain remarks by Qaiser about the judiciary and expunged them.
Echoing the KP government’s stance, Qaiser lamented that the province was not being provided with the funds allocated for it.
He also highlighted the purported difference in the services provided to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz.
“The chief minister of a province sits outside the Adiala jail to beg for a meeting, but he is denied. On the other hand, the chief minister of a province uses a government airplane when going to China and Brazil. Is this not one country but two constitutions?” he said.

 

Noting the planned talks between the United States and Iran over their concerns, Qaiser said, “If Iran and America can sit for talks in Istanbul… then why not with Afghanistan, however much serious your concerns are?”
The PTI MNA affirmed that Pakistan’s cross-border terrorism concerns with Kabul should be addressed, but stressed the importance of using diplomatic channels for it.
“All our trade, our business, our livelihood is linked with Afghanistan, our survival is not [possible] without it,” he said. He asserted that his party wanted full implementation of the National Action Plan and the complete eradication of terrorism.
“Since we are the victims, make a policy after speaking to us. We want the end of terrorism,” Qaiser said, calling for civilian supremacy and strong economic and foreign policies.
Noting that even India and the US, which were seen as having strained relations, have now signed a trade deal, Qaiser contended that Pakistan was “moving towards isolation”.
“We should revisit our policies. The state should act like a mother and remain within its jurisdiction, […] and this parliament should be rightfully elected,” the PTI leader said.
JUI-F MNA Aliya Kamran questioned the “delayed” response of security forces during the attacks, and claimed the situation in some areas had yet to normalise, including in the Nushki district.

 

She said reliable information had not been received from some areas of the province so far, adding that questions raised regarding Balochistan must be answered.
“Where have the terrorists who escaped gone, and why is action not being taken against them?” she asked, stressing that the situation should be taken seriously.
She also urged the House to reflect on why even women were becoming suicide bombers, wondering what reasons were behind this trend. According to the defence minister, women were involved in at least “two attacks in the 12 cities targeted”.
“For God’s sake, save these children,” Kamran said, while suggesting the initiation of dialogue with the people of Balochistan.



Usman Badini, another JUI-F lawmaker, said Balochistan had been “on fire” for the past 48 hours.
“We are sitting here, crying and pleading. For God’s sake, take care of Balochistan,” he said.
“Where was the writ of the state at the time of the attack?” he asked.
“Balochistan gets electricity for only one hour […] the reason Balochistan is falling behind is the denial of rights,” the JUI-F leader noted.







Stating that the people of Balochistan were not beggars, as they had resources, Badini said, “There is no need for anyone to do politics in the name of Balochistan”.
He pointed out that those who spoke about their rights were labelled a traitor.
“Dialogue must be held with all those who accept the flag of Pakistan; otherwise, the problem will not be resolved,” he emphasised.
Speaking after Chaudhry tabled the resolution, PTI’s Noor Alam Khan highlighted the rise in terrorist incidents in KP, pointing out that even school and college buildings were targeted.
“Whoever is doing terrorism in Pakistan cannot be a patriot,” he said.
The PTI lawmaker requested that the terrorism concerns of KP also be incorporated in the resolution as “terrorism is the highest there”.
“Our women, sisters and daughters are unable to study there. Please [add] this in the resolution,” he said.
PPP MNA Sehar Kamran emphasised that the Balochistan attacks could not be seen in isolation, noting there was a “nexus” between the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and India.
“The aim was not just to target Balochistan, but to target Pakistan,” she said, adding that those responsible for “external interference” wanted to create instability in the province and weaken the country.
Sehar backed Alam’s opinion that KP was also adversely impacted by terrorism.
“To attack nine to 12 places in a coordinated manner requires tactical and logistic support. I think it is clear that there is external involvement,” the PPP MNA said, stressing the need for national unity to combat it.
During his speech, Ejazul Haq of the PML-Zia pointed out that the benches of federal ministers were empty despite an “important matter” being discussed.
He noted that Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai had made “correct” statements about the deprivation of Sui-supplied gas faced by the people of Balochistan.
A day ago, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had briefed the lower house of Parliament on the security situation in Balochistan.
In his remarks on the NA floor on Monday, Asif had rejected any attempt to justify violence in the name of political or nationalist movements, saying the state’s “bottom line” was that no such rationalisation would be allowed.
Referring to the recent wave of coordinated terrorist attacks in Balochistan, he said these acts were being falsely portrayed as a freedom struggle to legitimise what he described as organised criminal activity.
‘Province being provided significant financial support’
State Minister for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said Balochistan receives more than 40 per cent higher share than Punjab under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, stressing that the province is being provided significant financial and development support by the federation.
Addressing the house, Chaudhry stated that under the NFC formula, Balochistan receives more than double the per capita funds compared to Punjab and Sindh.
The state minister said 91pc of the “financial resources spent in Balochistan are provided by the federal government”.



Chuadhry further noted that the province has seen major infrastructural and institutional development.
“Balochistan currently has 13 cadet colleges, 321 technical education institutions, and airports even in cities with populations of around 200,000.
“Balochistan has 13 major hospitals, 757 basic health centres, and more than 25,000 kilometres of roads,” he added.
Chaudhry questioned the targeting of public institutions, asking why attacks are carried out on schools and hospitals if the struggle is truly for rights. He emphasised that such acts “harm” ordinary citizens rather than addressing grievances.
“Blocking highways, exploding bridges, and hijacking trains? What is the motive behind it, as common people use them?” he questioned. The interior official asserted that terrorists have no linguistic or religious affiliation.
“TTP is using the beard (religion), and BLA is running their narrative upon Baloch identity; however, they have nothing to do with either of them.”
Responding to the question of why sporting events were being held in the country despite terrorist attacks, he said, “That’s what terrorists want.”
“Terrorists want to tell the world that by halting the business, trade, markets, and sporting events, they have paralysed us. We will not let this happen.”
Chaudhry also criticised New Delhi, saying that despite condemnations from all over the world of the Balochistan attacks, “only India” refrained from it.
He added that security forces were playing their part in the fight against terrorism, and the political leadership had to back them with a joint narrative.
Balochistan attacks
The attacks took place on Saturday in Quetta and several other parts of Balochistan, where militants carried out coordinated assaults on security forces and civilian targets across the province.
According to the military’s media wing, the January 31 attacks were reported from the provincial capital as well as Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni, prompting an immediate and widespread security response.

The Inter-Services Public Relations said security forces and law enforcement agencies launched clearance operations in the affected areas, killing 92 terrorists, including three suicide bombers, while 15 security personnel were martyred.
The attacks also claimed the lives of at least 18 civilians, including women, children, elderly people and labourers, particularly in Gwadar and Kharan.
The military said intelligence reports confirmed that the assaults were orchestrated by terrorist leaders operating from outside Pakistan, who remained in contact with the attackers throughout the incidents.</p><small>2026-02-03 12:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03165825b19354d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970824/fact-check-viral-video-does-not-show-cricketer-wasim-akram-saying-imran-visited-jeffrey-epsteins-island' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video does not show cricketer Wasim Akram saying Imran visited Jeffrey Epstein’s island</strong></a><br><p>Multiple pro-PML-N accounts on social media platform X were sharing a clip since February 1, of cricketer Wasim Akram, claiming that he said PTI founder Imran Khan visited Jeffrey Epstein’s island. However, Akram said no such thing.
Epstein, a convicted sex offender and United States financier, was accused of running a years-long sex trafficking network involving underage girls, with abuse linked to multiple properties in the US and overseas.
He died in August 2019 in a New York jail while awaiting trial on federal trafficking charges. His close associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, was later convicted by a US court for recruiting and grooming minors for Epstein’s abuse and was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022.
Millions of new files relating to Epstein have been released by the US Department of Justice, showing many of the world’s most renowned individuals.
On Feb 1, a user who appears to be a PML-N supporter based on his bio and past posts shared a video of Wasim in a podcast with the following caption: “Imran Khan - Modi - Epstein List. With Modi’s name now also linked to Epstein, the two are being portrayed as spiritual brothers because of their ties to the Jewish community.
According to Wasim, Imran also went to Epstein Island. He claimed, ‘Imran Khan and some youngsters were flown to Epstein Island on Maxwell’s private plane’. How shameful it is that the same person then holds a tasbih in his hand and lectures others about integrity.”
The post gained 46,000 views.
He shared the same video again with the same caption, gaining 28,000 views.
The same clip with a similar claim was shared by another PML-N supporter with the following caption: “In 1988, Imran Khan took us on his private plane with a woman over an island (Wasim Akram). Was it Epstein Island? Was that woman’s name Ghislaine Maxwell? As soon as more truth comes out in front of the public, PTI supporters will start trying to prove Jeffrey Epstein was an angel serving humanity.”
The clip gained 83,000 views.
The video was shared with similar claims by multiple pro-PML-N accounts on X, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the Epstein files.
A reverse image search was conducted to trace the source of the video, which yielded the full podcast of Wasim by an Australian YouTube channel on Nov 24, 2022. The video was titled: “Imran Said Let’s Go To A Nightclub“ | Wasim on Cocaine, Sledging & Sir Viv”.



In the podcast, the viral clip starts at the 17:35-minute mark, where Wasim can be seen talking about clubbing with Imran and does not mention anything related to Epstein or Maxwell.
In the podcast, Wasim mentions their visit to an island in 1988, whereas Epstein bought the islands in 1998; Maxwell was in the UK at that time. She moved to the US after the death of her father in 1991 and met Epstein thereafter.
Furthermore, the same clip was shared with the same claim in 2022, with Wasim debunking it at the time as false on his official X handle.







In addition, the pictures used in the collage with Wasim’s video, which show Imran with Maxwell, were also found to be old from a party in London in 1990.
A reverse image search yielded the images of the party that were uploaded on Shutterstock, a leading global provider of licensed images, videos, music, and other media.
According to the description, the party was hosted by Taki Theodoracopulos, a Greek writer and publisher, to mark the fall of communism at the Savoy Hotel, a year after the Berlin Wall was demolished — October 28, 1990.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video of cricketer Wasim shows him saying that Imran visited Epstein’s island is false. Wasim said nothing of the sort and did not mention or even hint at Epstein, Maxwell or Epstein’s island in his video reminiscing about a trip to an island with Imran on a woman’s personal plane.

The two countries maintain friendly diplomatic relations, with Kazakhstan being Pakistan’s top export destination among Central Asian countries.
The Kazakh president is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising senior cabinet ministers and other high-ranking officials.







In a handout issued earlier in the day, the President’s Secretariat said that President Asif Ali Zardari will confer the Nishan-i-Pakistan, the country’s highest civilian award, on the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan presidents; the latter is expected to visit the country later this month.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), President Tokayev is expected to meet with President Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as well as address the Pakistan-Kazakhstan Business Forum.
President Tokayev’s visit will provide Islamabad and Astana “an important and timely opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review” of bilateral relations, the FO had highlighted.
It added that the two sides will discuss new avenues for broadening cooperation, particularly in trade, logistics, regional connectivity and people-to-people contacts, as well as explore collaboration at regional and international forums.

 

This visit is seen as a win-win situation by both countries. For Pakistan, it will help Islamabad position itself as a land bridge between Central and South Asia and beyond. For Kazakhstan, it will help diversify its international trade amid turbulence in Eurasia in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war.
Kazakh Minister of Science and Higher Education Sayasat Nurbek was already on a visit to Pakistan.
Eight memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were signed on Monday between the higher education institutions of the two countries to promote joint research collaboration, faculty and student exchanges, collaborative academic programmes, and capacity-building initiatives.
As part of the collaboration, Kazakhstan educational centres were inaugurated at three public sector universities in Islamabad.
In September, when then-Kazakh deputy premier Murat Nurtleu visited Pakistan, the two sides signed the Action Plan of Cooperation to boost bilateral ties.</p><small>2026-02-03 12:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0316320320f6263.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970823/spacex-acquires-xai-in-record-setting-deal-as-musk-looks-to-unify-ai-and-space-ambitions' target='_blank'><strong>SpaceX acquires xAI in record-setting deal as Musk looks to unify AI and space ambitions</strong></a><br><p>Elon Musk said on Monday that SpaceX has acquired his artificial-intelligence startup xAI in a record-setting deal that unifies Musk’s AI and space ambitions by combining the rocket-and-satellite company with the maker of the Grok chatbot.
The deal represents one of the most ambitious tie-ups in the technology sector yet, combining a space-and-defence contractor with a fast-growing AI developer whose costs are largely driven by chips, data centers and energy.
It could also bolster SpaceXs data-center ambitions as Musk competes with rivals like Alphabet’s Google, Meta, Amazon-backed Anthropic and OpenAI in the AI sector.







The transaction values SpaceX at $1 trillion, and xAI at $250 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Investors in xAI will receive 0.1433 shares of SpaceX for every share of xAI as part of the acquisition, this person said. Some xAI executives may also opt for cash instead of SpaceX stock at $75.46 per share, the person said.
“This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI’s mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!” Musk said.
Deal breaks record held by Vodafone for world’s top M&A
The purchase of xAI sets a new record for the world’s largest merger and acquisition (M&A) deal, a distinction held for more than 25 years when Vodafone bought Germany’s Mannesmann in a hostile takeover valued at $203bn in 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.
The combined company of SpaceX and xAI is expected to price shares at about $527 each, another person familiar with the matter said.
SpaceX was already the world’s most valuable privately held company, last valued at $800bn in a recent insider share sale. XAI was last valued at $230bn in November, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over $1.5 trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.
SpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The deal further consolidates Musk’s far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem, which some investors and analysts informally call the “Muskonomy”, which already includes Tesla, brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.
“Starlink was already a cash flow engine, and now it adds an AI revenue layer on top while also becoming a distribution surface for AI services and data,” said Ali Javaheri, PitchBook Senior Emerging Spaces Analyst.
“With policy changes that allow certain customer data to be used for model training and the prospect of orbital data centres, SpaceX is positioning itself as an integrated infrastructure platform that can serve commercial and government use cases, which is a much stronger narrative heading into a public offering.”
Deal could draw regulatory scrutiny
The world’s richest man has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla’s stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.
The agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk’s overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.
SpaceX also holds billions of dollars in federal contracts with Nasa, the Department of Defence, and intelligence agencies, which all have some authority to review M&A transactions for national security and other risks.</p><small>2026-02-03 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03162849979dde0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970822/russia-says-india-has-not-said-it-will-halt-oil-purchases-following-us-trade-deal-announcement' target='_blank'><strong>Russia says India has not said it will halt oil purchases following US trade deal announcement</strong></a><br><p>The Kremlin said on Tuesday it had not received any indication from India that it would stop buying Russian oil following the announcement of a trade deal with US President Donald Trump.
Trump said he had struck a deal to reduce tariffs on India and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil over the war in Ukraine.
India’s purchases of Russian oil — discounted due to Western sanctions complicating logistics and cutting off markets — have surged since Russia launched its full-scale military offensive on Ukraine in February 2022.
Ukraine and its Western allies have been seeking to cut off the billions of dollars in revenue, a vital source of income for Russia’s stretched economy and its military.

 

“So far, we haven’t heard any statements from New Delhi on this matter,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, including AFP.
Trump said he was cutting levies on Indian goods to 18 per cent. He had previously imposed 25pc “reciprocal” tariffs on many products, plus an additional 25pc for New Delhi’s purchases of Moscow’s oil.
While Modi thanked Trump for the “wonderful” phone call and the easing of tariffs, he made no reference to Trump’s assertion about halting oil purchases.
In 2024, Russia supplied nearly 36pc of India’s total crude imports, around 1.8 million barrels of discounted oil per day.
But after Trump hit New Delhi with tariffs, India’s monthly oil imports from Russia plunged by 38pc, local media reported, citing India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry’s data.
Russian President Vladimir Putin promised “uninterrupted shipments” of oil during a visit to New Delhi in late 2025.
Bilateral trade between the two sides reached $68.7bn in 2024-25 — almost six times higher than the pre-pandemic levels — dominated by Moscow’s energy sales, with Indian exports to Russia accounting for under $5bn.</p><small>2026-02-03 11:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03150135eb08965.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970818/pakistan-invited-to-participate-in-upcoming-us-iran-talks-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan invited to participate in upcoming US-Iran talks: FO</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has been invited to participate in the Iran-US talks aimed at de-escalation of tensions between Tehran and Washington, the Foreign Office (FO) confirmed on Tuesday.
“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query.
“Pakistan’s participation is seen as crucial to defusing tensions, as Islamabad has been quietly working to facilitate the talks,” a diplomatic source told Dawn.
A diplomatic source added that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is expected to participate in the meeting.

 

The meeting is likely to take place in Turkiye on Friday, an Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.
US outlet Axios cited two unnamed sources and a US official as saying Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible deal on the nuclear issue.
The priority of the talks is to avoid any conflict and de-escalate tensions between the two sides, a regional official told Reuters, adding that some regional powers were also invited.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of the countries invited to the talks at the foreign ministers’ level included Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The person said the format of the meetings remained unclear, but that the “main meeting” would be on Friday and that it was important to start dialogue between the parties to avoid further escalation.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he has instructed FM Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” provided that an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.

 

The talks will be held “within the framework of our national interests”, he said in a series of posts on X.
Trump has maintained he is hopeful that Washington will “work something out” with Iran, but also warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal is reached.
In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”
He added, “In return, we expect sanctions lifting.”
However, Araghchi said Tehran was ready for war if talks fail and warned that a conflict would likely spiral beyond Iran, CNN added.
Turkiye has led a diplomatic push to defuse tensions, with FM Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and speaking with other regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has also said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.</p><small>2026-02-03 11:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/031359069477faa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970815/lhc-issues-notices-seeks-replies-from-punjab-govt-others-in-lahore-manhole-deaths-case' target='_blank'><strong>LHC issues notices, seeks replies from Punjab govt, others in Lahore manhole deaths case</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Tuesday issued notices to the Punjab government and other respondents on a petition seeking action against those responsible for the incident in which a mother and her daughter died after falling into an open manhole near Bhatti Gate.
Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi heard the petition filed by Aamna Malik and the Judicial Activism Panel.
Advocate Azhar Siddique, on behalf of the petitioners, pointed out that incidents of citizens falling into manholes were on the rise, which was a matter of serious concern.
The counsel expressed regret that negligence was shown by leaving a manhole open in a highly populated area. He claimed that the government took merely cosmetic measures instead of proceeding against the officials responsible for the incident.
Siddique asked the court to determine responsibility for the incident and initiate action against those responsible.
The assistant attorney general stated that the petitioner unnecessarily made the federal government a party to the petition, as the matter pertains to provincial authorities.
However, the judge observed that the court would like to know the opinion of the federal government as well.
After hearing preliminary arguments, the judge directed the respondents to submit their replies by March 3.
Earlier, the petitioner’s counsel, on the instructions of the court, removed the national and provincial disaster management authorities from the list of respondents.
The mother and her child had fallen into the sewer at the site of the under-construction Data Darbar expansion project near Bhatti Gate. While the woman’s body was found late at night the same day, the 10-month-old child’s body was recovered after a day.
Officials of the contractor working on the under-construction Data Darbar extension project were arrested for their negligence.
On January 31, a judicial magistrate approved a four-day physical remand of the officials.
Meanwhile, a “high-powered committee” of police officials had launched a fact-finding inquiry to probe the allegations of torture against the husband of the woman.</p><small>2026-02-03 09:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03131944b5a5023.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970812/shireen-mazari-moves-ihc-for-meeting-with-imaan-hadi' target='_blank'><strong>Shireen Mazari moves IHC for meeting with Imaan, Hadi</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Former federal minister Shireen Mazari on Tuesday approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC), seeking urgent judicial intervention to allow her to meet her imprisoned daughter, human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, and son-in-law Hadi Ali Chatha, both held in Adiala jail.
A sessions court had sentenced Imaan and Hadi to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts.
In a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, Mazari, through prominent lawyers including Kamran Murtaza, members of the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) Raja Aleem Abbasi, Chaudhry Hafeezullah Yaqub, Zafar Khokhar, Asif Irfan, Abdul Rehman Hur Bajwa, President Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) Syed Wajid Ali Gillani, President District Bar Association Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar, Riasat Ali Azad, and others, alleged that jail authorities had completely cut off the detainees from family contact and legal counsel, without any written order, recorded reasons, or lawful justification.
The petition states that Imaan and Hadi were convicted on January 24, 2026, in a case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, and have since been held in “continuous judicial custody”. Despite repeated requests, the petitioner — mother of Imaan and mother-in-law of Hadi — has been denied visitation rights and kept in the dark about their physical and mental health, medical care, and jail conditions.
The plea contends that the detainees have also been deprived of confidential access to their lawyers, obstructing their ability to file an appeal against their conviction — a time-sensitive legal remedy. It argues that such “complete and indefinite denial” amounts to “incommunicado detention,” violating constitutional guarantees under Articles 4, 9, 10-A, and 14, which protect the rights to due process, dignity, fair trial, and humane treatment.
The petition further invokes the Punjab Prison Rules, 1978, and international standards such as the UN Nelson Mandela Rules, asserting that the state has a heightened duty of care toward individuals in custody.
In her interim relief request, Mazari has urged the IHC to issue immediate directions allowing temporary family visits and legal consultations pending the final decision of the writ.
The respondents in the petition include the Federation of Pakistan through the secretary of Interior, the inspector general of police Islamabad, and the superintendent of Adiala Jail.
The IHC is yet to fix a hearing date on the petition.
The case
The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCI) in Islamabad.
The NCCIA complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The First Information Report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Judge Majoka issued arrest warrants for the couple on Nov 5, 2025.
Later that month, a court-appointed lawyer for the couple refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.
Subsequently, they were appointed a new lawyer by the court. After multiple hearings and repeated non-appearances, the court cancelled their interim bail on January 14 and days later, reissued arrest warrants for them.
Later, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.
Separately, a case related to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo. The IHC had granted them pre-arrest bail in the case.
Separataely, on January 23, Imaan and Hadi were arrested by the police in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025. They were then sent to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.</p><small>2026-02-03 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/031326097f46d10.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970810/rao-abdul-kareem-notified-as-new-punjab-police-chief-former-ig-appointed-dg-fia-in-major-reshuffle' target='_blank'><strong>Rao Abdul Kareem notified as new Punjab police chief; former IG appointed DG FIA in major reshuffle</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The federal government on Tuesday notified a reshuffle in the Punjab police high command, with Special Branch Additional Inspector General Rao Abdul Kareem appointed as the new inspector general of police (IGP), replacing Dr Usman Anwar.
A day earlier, a highly-placed source confirmed to Dawn that the government has approved a change in the provincial police’s top ranks.
In three separate notifications, available with Dawn, Dr Anwar was notified as the new director general of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), replacing current DG FIA Riffat Mukhtar, who was transferred and directed to report to the Establishment Division, while Kareem was notified as the Punjab IGP.
In a post on X, the Punjab police also confirmed the announcement and expressed optimism that “under his inspiring leadership, the Punjab police will achieve milestones in protecting citizens’ lives and property, ensuring swift delivery of justice, and further strengthening the law and order situation”.







According to a separate press release issued by the Punjab police, Kareem belongs to Nawabshah and joined the police service in 1996 as an assistant superintendent of police (ASP).
“He belongs to the 24th Commons of Police Service of Pakistan,” the statement said.
He has previously held the posts of “commandant Punjab constabulary, DIG Traffic Punjab, RPO Gujranwala, DIG Telecommunication”.
Kareem has also previously served as ASP UT Sukkur, SDPO Sukkur City, Latifabad in Hyderabad and Chiniot, the statement added.
The senior police official was also posted as superintendent of police (SP) in Gujranwala, Lahore, and Sheikhupura, while in Mianwali, Kasur, and Jhang, he served as the district police officer (DPO).
Meanwhile, in a post on X, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi offered best wishes to outgoing IGP Anwar for the new role as DG FIA.
“Dr Usman’s transformational leadership reshaped Punjab police, setting new benchmarks in professionalism, reform, and public service,” the interior minister said.
“As he takes charge as DG FIA, a new era begins,” he added.
Naqvi voiced optimism that “with his (Anwar’s) vision and dynamism, the public will witness real, visible change in the coming months”.







Dr Anwar was appointed Punjab IG during a large reshuffle by the Punjab caretaker government in January 2023. He was performing his duties with the National Highways and Motorway Police before being appointed Punjab’s police chief.</p><small>2026-02-03 09:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03113517650b5da.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970799/gold-up-3pc-in-asia-to-4820-an-ounce-silver-5pc-higher-to-8334-an-ounce' target='_blank'><strong>Gold up 3pc in Asia to $4,820 an ounce, silver 5pc higher to $83.34 an ounce</strong></a><br><p>Gold and Asian stocks were on the rebound on Tuesday as trade took a calmer tone after wild swings in metals markets and a deal to cut US tariffs on India helped the mood, while the Australian dollar rose after an interest rate hike.
Australia’s central bank joined Japan as the only developed-world economy to tighten policy, saying above-target inflation and a tight labour market justified a unanimous decision to lift the cash rate 25 basis points to 3.85 per cent.
Markets had mostly anticipated the move, though are now rushing to price in a follow-up in May, which was enough to push the Aussie about 1pc higher and over 70 US cents.
India’s rupee, and stocks cheered an announcement by US President Donald Trump that tariffs on Indian goods would be cut from 50pc to 18pc in return for New Delhi halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.
Details, however, were scarce.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei jumped 4pc to recoup Monday’s losses, and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 5pc.
S&P 500 futures ESc1 were up 0.1pc with traders eyeing a busy few sessions of earnings.
With so many positions stopped out by collapses in crowded silver and gold bets, investors were taking stock and sitting back, according to Steven Leung, director of institutional sales at brokerage UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.
“It will take a long time for them to rebuild a bull or bear position…so they are staying away from the market,” he said.
Speculation that tax hikes on Chinese telcos could extend to internet giants dragged stocks such as Tencent and Alibaba down by more than 3pc.
Metals stabilise
Gold was up 3pc in Asia to $4,820 an ounce, a bounce of around 9pc from Monday’s lows. Silver traded 5pc higher to $83.34 an ounce.
Gold, silver, stocks, and the dollar have all whipsawed since Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve sent metal prices tumbling. Warsh is seen shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet, pushing up bond yields, which is negative for precious metals that pay no income.
However, the dive in prices on Friday and on Monday went beyond fundamentals and was a wipeout for leveraged positions and sent tremors through global commodity and stock markets as traders sold other assets to bail out losing bets.
Looking ahead, Wall Street earnings are in the frame, with chipmaker AMD and server equipment company Super Micro Computer due to report after market.
Takaichi trade
Currency markets were finding a level after last week’s sharp spike lower in the dollar. The euro bought $1.1809 in the Asia session, off highs hit above $1.20 late in January.
The yen traded at 155.41 per dollar and has retraced about half the gains it made on the greenback that followed talk of possible joint US-Japan intervention to boost the yen.
Polls show Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s Liberal Democratic Party heading for a landslide victory at the weekend’s election – putting pressure on bonds and the yen as it would hand a mandate to her agenda for fiscal loosening.
Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama on Tuesday was downplaying weekend remarks from Takaichi highlighting the benefits of a weak yen, at odds with the authorities’ efforts to support it.</p><small>2026-02-03 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/03115306a07c19f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970804/pakistan-azerbaijan-naval-chiefs-pledge-to-strengthen-bilateral-defence-ties-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Azerbaijan naval chiefs pledge to strengthen bilateral defence ties: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The naval chiefs of Pakistan and Azerbaijan have pledged to strengthen their existing bilateral defence relationship, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
Islamabad and Baku maintain robust defence cooperation. In 2024, Azer­bai­jan signed a massive $1.6 billion deal with Pakistan to acquire JF-17 Block III fighter jets, developed by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group.
According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf met with Commander Azerbaijan Naval Forces (ANF) Rear Admiral Shahin Mammadov, at the Naval Headquarters in Islamabad today, where the two leaders “pledged to further strengthen and diversify the scope of [the] existing bilateral defence relationship”.







The two, during the meeting, also “discussed matters of mutual interest, regional maritime security situation, and avenues for enhanced cooperation in training and defence”.
The Azeri naval commander, upon arrival at the headquarters, was presented with a guard of honour by “a smartly turned out contingent of Pakistan Navy”.
“Thereafter, the dignitary laid a floral wreath at the Shuhada’s Monument,” ISPR said.
“Later, a briefing was also given to the visiting dignitary on Pakistan Navy’s ongoing projects,” the statement read.
“Pakistan and Azerbaijan share longstanding brotherly relations marked by close naval cooperation.
“The visit of commander Azerbaijan naval forces will further enhance bilateral collaboration between the two countries in general and navies in particular,” ISPR added.

There are no trees nearby, no shade. There is only the open road and the sun beating straight down.
The rabrri seller speaks about what Makli (located near Thatta in Sindh) used to be like two decades ago. “Even summers felt different then,” he says. In those days, thick trees lined the road, holding back the heat. Some evenings even brought a light drizzle, settling the dust and softening the air.
People lingered outside and animals existed in their natural habitats. It seemed like there was a balance to things and a natural order. But now, there is only heat — and the trucks.
MANUFACTURING HEAT
A truck loaded with freshly cut wood thunders past. Then another. Then another. All of them are headed towards Karachi with engines roaring, and timber stacked high and loose. Tree varieties of neem, babul and keekarr are all piled atop this truck. Their trunks look thick enough to have been standing for decades.

 

The trucks passing the rabrri seller’s stall are not an anomaly. They form a steady, visible supply chain running from lower Sindh into Karachi. Each one of these trucks carries with it more than wood. These trucks carry away shade from roads such as this one in Makli, cover from fields and riverbanks across Sindh, the homes of various local animals and birds, and the natural setting that gives rise to flora and fauna.

Trucks barrelling across Sindh loaded with illegally cut timber have become an alarmingly routine sight in the province. It is estimated that Sindh has lost nearly 80 percent of its forest cover since Pakistan came into being, much of it in the last 30 years. As this rabid deforestation in Sindh has led to heatwaves and other related calamities year-after-year, are officials simply turning a blind eye, or are they complicit? What policies have led us to this juncture, and can anything be done to reverse the damage?

According to numerous studies, deforestation and the removal of trees is directly linked to an increase in the intensity and frequency of heatwaves. Research shows that cutting down forests removes the cooling effect that trees provide, leading to local surface temperature increases of up to 4.5 degrees Celsius.
As a result of this slow, engineered erasure of the natural ecosystem across Sindh, hundreds of people and livestock are dying every year in the province, as recurring heatwaves continue to ravage the land.
According to a news report published in Dawn on June 22, 2025, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Sindh stated that “the 2024 heatwave alone led to 5,358 hospital admissions for heat-related illnesses and 158 livestock deaths. During the period between April and May, 2025, 675 heatstroke cases were treated across the province. Overall, an estimated 8.6 million people across 26 districts in Sindh faced heightened food insecurity due to compounding heat and drought risks.”

 

This naturally begs the question: given the direct causation between deforestation and the increase in heat-related calamities and ailments, why are the authorities in the province allowing Sindh’s trees to be mowed down?
According to drivers and residents familiar with these routes, each truck pays around Rs 4,000 to officials from the Sindh Forest Department in order to move freely across these lands. Trucks carrying timber from Tharparkar, Badin, Sujawal, Thatta and lower Sindh funnel onto the National Highway N-5 for Karachi. On average, one truck passes every 15 minutes. That amounts to roughly 96 trucks a day. On a single route, that is Rs 384,000 changing hands daily. Over a month, the figure exceeds Rs 11.5 million.
A truck driver tells Eos, “Pay and you can go anywhere. If you don’t pay, then you’re in trouble.” None of the trucks display visible permits and none of them are stopped for inspection at checkpoints.
The Sindh Forest Department, which has publicly emphasised reclamation of encroached lands and afforestation drives, did not respond to requests for comments on the operation of these trucks and the seeming absence of any checks and balances.
These trucks that have, in the words of the rabrri seller, “eaten everything” did not appear overnight. In fact, Sindh’s forests have been slowly dismantled in stages over nearly two centuries now, but the scale and impact has never been this large.
A HISTORY OF DESTRUCTION
When the British annexed Sindh in 1843, the Indus riverine forests were among the first landscapes to be surveyed, mapped and claimed. Timber from babul and keekarr fed railway expansion, cantonments and canal construction.
Forests ceased to be living systems and became inventories. Large stretches of riverine forests were cleared to serve colonial infrastructure and revenue needs as floodplains were also regulated.
In 1932, the Sukkur Barrage diverted water, thus reducing inundations and riverine regeneration. After Partition, the same logic persisted, as Pakistan inherited colonial forest laws. In 1947, the Sindh Forest Department inherited and managed 269,511 hectares of reserved forests and 24,369 hectares of protected forests, mainly riverine forests along the Indus floodplains. These figures marked the baseline for productive cover in the province, with dense stands of babul, keekarr and other species regenerating naturally through annual inundations.
Since then, the nominal area of riverine forests has stayed roughly stable on official records at 241,198 hectares, as per the Sindh Forest Department, reflecting a modest nominal decline of about 28,313 hectares from the 1947 reserved figure.

 

Yet, the effective loss is much steeper due to degradation, encroachment, illegal felling and reduced freshwater flows from barrages. Estimates indicate that up to 80 per cent of riverine forests have been destroyed or heavily degraded.
By the 1950s, barrages such as Guddu and Kotri intensified the issue. The average annual flow from the Kotri Barrage dropped from 41 million acre-feet (MAF) during 1976-1998 to 14 MAF during 1999-2023. By the 1980s and 1990s, forest land in Sindh increasingly existed only on paper. Forest boundary pillars disappeared, while guards were few, poorly paid and easily overruled.
Between the 1980s and early 2000s, Sindh’s forest cover declined drastically, with riverine forests in some areas shrinking by more than two-thirds or more — from over 20 percent to under seven percent of mapped study areas.
Province-wide, Sindh likely lost 50 to 80 percent of its forested areas compared to its mid-20th century levels, with most of that reduction happening through the late 20th century and into the early 2000s.

POLICY FAILURES
In 2005, the Sindh government introduced its Agroforestry Policy, officially aimed at increasing tree cover through private participation. In practice, it opened vast tracts of riverine and irrigated forests to leasing.
Natural forests were often cleared first and replantation was promised later. But oversight weakened as plantation targets were rarely enforced and influential landlords received leases. Environmental impact assessments arrived years late, if at all.
As a result, while it was designed to increase tree cover by engaging local communities, the policy led to widespread deforestation, as land was often acquired by individuals who prioritised agricultural cultivation over planting trees.
Despite this, by 2010, the policy was expanded. Lease terms were relaxed and more land was handed out as forests continued to vanish. In 2014, the policy was officially scrapped. The government announced the reclamation and restoration of encroached lands.
According to the Sindh Sustainable Forest Management Policy 2019, published on May 18, 2023 and available on the Sindh Forest Department’s website, one of the major factors behind the decrease in forest cover has been the “weak law enforcement of the forestry administration.”
It also cites the Agroforestry Lease Policy of 2005 as being “detrimental for the forests.”

 

The Sindh Forest Department has routinely taken budgetary allocations from provincial and federal governments specifically for the purpose of reclaiming encroached forest lands.
But a persistent critique from environmental groups and after media investigations is that a cycle has been created, where funds are drawn for clearance operations while powerful encroachers are still allowed to delay or avoid eviction, thus letting the deforestation continue. This highlights a recurring failure of governance, where policies — whether for leasing or for reclamation — are undermined by weak enforcement and a lack of transparency.



According to the Sindhi newspaper Pehnji Ikhbar, as of January 25, 2026, 75,000 acres of forest department land in Matiari have continuously been handed over to contractors who permit tree-cutting. Despite court orders and government restrictions, wood is still being cut from forest lands and government lands are being cultivated, with the forest department remaining a silent spectator.
Furthermore, the Nasri Forest in Shaheed Benazirabad district (previously known as Nawabshah) has been granted to Bahria Town for the development of their third mega project in the area. Environmentalists and local residents have raised concerns that this move will lead to large-scale deforestation, an increase in temperature, loss of biodiversity and the disruption of the local ecosystem.
IGNORANCE OR COMPLICITY?
Ayaz Samoo has been cutting wood for over 20 years. He has spent decades working in forests, felling trees with skill and precision — first with axes and saws, now with machines. He used to cut trees by relying only on strength, experience and patience. “Back then, it was all hands and sweat,” he says. “Every tree has its own rhythm. You had to move carefully, understand it, or you could get hurt.”
Today, machines have changed his work. Chainsaws roar through the forest where once only the sound of axes filled the air. “It is faster now, yes,” he explains, “but you do not ‘feel’ the tree in the same way.” That’s because cutting down trees has become a ruthlessly profitable business that is coming at the cost of the province and its people.
Advocate Ammar Dayo, a vocal campaigner against deforestation and climate destruction in northern Sindh, calls the situation in Ghotki district “unprecedented”. “During the last three years, forest destruction here has reached levels never seen before,” he says.
“The years 2024 and 2025 have been catastrophic for the following forests: Mirpur, Jahanpur, Adilpur, Jarwar, Sardar, Sandrani and Ronte.
“The Sindh Forest Department is 100 percent involved in this,” Dayo claims. “From conservators to DFOs [divisional forest officers] to guards. Along with them, influential politicians, landlords, the police and even some local residents are involved.”
In the Mirpur and Jahanpur forests, Dayo says mature babul trees — worth Rs 300,000 to Rs 400,000 per tree — have been cut and sold by the thousands. In Jror, Adilpur and Ronte forests, he estimates millions of keekarr and babul trees have been removed.
Court orders banning sawmills within 10 kilometres of forest boundaries exist. On the ground, however, sawmills operate inside forest limits, cutting timber into planks and beams that are then loaded on to trucks. But the men cutting the trees are not the men profiting from them.
In rural Sindh, landlessness and debt pushes labourers into forest-cutting. Daily wages are low, work is seasonal and alternatives are scarce as timber offers quick cash. The legal, ecological and climatic concerns are abstract to these men. Their hunger is not. A cutter in Sujawal tells Eos, “We cut for 500 rupees a day. The agents pay us and we use the money to get food for ourselves and our families.”
But this is only a short-term monetary fix for a long-term monetary disaster. As forests shrink, pastoralists lose grazing land, heat exposure increases, livestock dwindles, families migrate towards cities already stretched thin and poverty deepens.
A MAN-MADE CALAMITY
Environmental expert Nasir Panhwar describes riverine forests not just as scenery but as infrastructure, and this infrastructure is being dismantled.
“Biodiversity has been lost,” Panhwar says. “Some flora and fauna have disappeared entirely. Migration is underway because livelihoods dependent on forests and water are collapsing.”
He estimates that up to 80 per cent of Sindh’s riverine forests have been destroyed.
Official figures by the Sindh Forest Department paint a similar picture. Productive forests — riverine and irrigated plantations — now account for around just two per cent of Sindh’s land area. Nationally, Pakistan’s forest cover stands at around 4.7 per cent, among the lowest in the region.

 

In Sindh, riverine forests have faced sharper degradation despite nominal stability in managed areas. In Thatta district alone, riverine area fell from 45,128 hectares in 1990 to 36,432 hectares in 2010 and then to 25,888 hectares by 2014 — an overall decline of about 43 per cent in that district, with other studies showing up to 89 per cent loss in Thatta’s forest cover from 1979 to 2010 (from 35.11 per cent to 2.23 per cent).
As of 2025, Pakistan has only five trees per person, as per the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) estimates — far below the global average of 422 and the desirable 900 for sustainability. In Sindh, it’s lower still due to urban pressures and riverine loss.
And, as forests vanish, heat intensifies.
Trees lower surface temperatures, retain moisture and break heatwaves. Without them, roads and fields absorb sunlight. Nights offer no relief. A single mature tree provides shade for 10 people, cools the air by 2-5 degrees Celsius through evapotranspiration and absorbs 22 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide (CO2) yearly. In order to offset Sindh’s heat, one person would need a now-impossible number of around 200-300 trees.
Nisar Laghari, a political activist from Hyderabad, disputes official figures on the scale of forest loss, arguing that even existing data understates the damage. According to him, Miani Forest historically spanned nearly 2,500 acres, stretching from the riverine belt up to Hyderabad Taluka. “Local records still show the forest at 2,500 acres,” he says, “but satellite mapping today reduces it to around 1,700 acres, already masking a significant loss.”
Laghari alleges that of the land still visible on satellite imagery, 150 to 200 acres have been converted into agricultural fields through political pressure, while much of the remaining area is under illegal occupation. Adjacent to Miani Forest lies the Nawab Muhammad Khan Forest, covering another 500 acres, which he argues must be counted as part of the same ecological system when assessing total deforestation.
“The destruction was not accidental,” Laghari says. “It became systematic when forest leases began to be issued, despite the fact that forest land is not legally eligible for leasing.” Those leases, he claims, opened the forest to commercial cutting and cultivation, fragmenting what was once a continuous green belt into isolated, degraded patches.
Independent verification of these claims remains limited, but historical maps, satellite imagery and local testimony all point towards decades of gradual, policy-enabled deforestation rather than sudden encroachment.

HOW TO RIGHT A WRONG
Internationally, Pakistan presents itself as a climate victim — and it is. The country ranks among the world’s most climate-affected nations as it continues to be battered by floods, heatwaves and many other disasters.
Ironically, Sindh has become a focal point for blue carbon projects, especially mangrove restoration, thus attracting international attention, consultants and seed funding. Carbon credits are calculated, maintenance budgets are allocated and photo opportunities multiply.
But such efforts are futile if the broader picture across Sindh is ignored by the authorities. The province’s lungs are being depleted, and those tasked with protecting these forests are instead aiding in their destruction through negligent policymaking and a failure to enforce more stringent measures.

 

It is important to stress that deforestation in Sindh is a governance failure. The steady disappearance of riverine forests and inland tree cover reflects weak policy frameworks, institutional complicity and the marginalisation of communities who once acted as de facto custodians of the land. Addressing this problem requires more than tree-planting drives or donor-funded campaigns. It demands structural reform, transparency and a reimagining of how forests are governed in the province.
Reforming the Sindh Forest Department must be the starting point. The department currently suffers from overlapping mandates, poor accountability mechanisms and limited independent oversight. Forest officers wield extensive discretionary power over permits and enforcement, creating opportunities for rent-seeking and collusion with timber mafias. Introducing an independent forest oversight authority could help break this cycle. Regular third-party audits, public disclosure of logging permits and mandatory reporting of forest cover changes would make it harder for illegal activity to thrive under bureaucratic cover.
Closely tied to institutional reform is the need for a clear, enforceable forest policy. Sindh’s forest laws are outdated and often poorly aligned with current land-use realities. Ambiguous classifications such as ‘protected’, ‘reserved’ and ‘unclassed’ forests are routinely exploited to justify encroachment and conversion. Updating forest legislation to remove loopholes, clarify land tenure and impose stricter penalties for illegal logging is essential. Equally important is ensuring that these laws are actually enforced, rather than selectively applied against small-scale offenders while large operators go untouched.
Additionally, both the riverine trees and the mangroves in Sindh need the silt from the Indus in order to flourish, so the Indus River must also be allowed to flow if trees are to grow freely in Sindh once again.
Technology can also play a transformative role in improving enforcement and transparency. Satellite imagery, drone surveillance and real-time forest monitoring systems are already being used successfully in other countries to track deforestation. Sindh could adopt some similar tools to create a publicly accessible forest monitoring dashboard, showing changes in tree cover, district by district. When deforestation becomes visible and verifiable, denial becomes harder and accountability easier.
At the same time, economic incentives must be realigned.
Deforestation persists in part because cutting trees is often more profitable than conserving them. The provincial government can counter this by expanding payment-for-ecosystem-services schemes, where communities are compensated for maintaining forest cover that provides flood protection, carbon sequestration and climate resilience. Agroforestry models that integrate trees into agricultural land can also reduce pressure on natural forests while supporting rural incomes.

 

Finally, deforestation in Sindh has persisted because it rarely carries political consequences. Legislators, ministers and senior bureaucrats must be held publicly accountable for forest loss in their jurisdictions. Environmental protection cannot remain a peripheral concern in a province increasingly vulnerable to climate change.
In the end, reversing deforestation in Sindh is less about planting more trees and more about fixing the systems that allow them to be cut down with impunity. Without institutional reform, legal clarity, community involvement and transparent governance, even the most ambitious afforestation campaigns will amount to little more than greenwashing.
These solutions are not anything new or revolutionary, but what remains uncertain is whether the province’s political and bureaucratic leadership is willing to implement them.
OF TRUCKS AND TORMENT
The trucks do not stop even when the sun sets. Even after the Sindh government announced a ban on night-time transportation of timber and wood materials, which came into effect around November 2025, the loads keep moving in the dark.
The order was meant to curb illegal cutting, give checkpoints better visibility and strengthen forest conservation efforts. But on stretches such as the Thatta-Karachi bypass and the National Highway, N-5, trucks carrying trees continue to roll through the night. Locals say the ban exists mostly on paper, so the wood keeps flowing out from rural Sindh through the night too.
And when the rabrri seller will open his stall in the morning once again, the trucks loaded with timber will still be flowing past.

“Today we cannot talk about having dialogue with the United States, but it is true that there have been communications between the two governments,” deputy foreign minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio said in an interview.
Trump on Sunday claimed the United States was in talks with “the highest people” in Cuba and that he expected to “make a deal” with its leadership, without saying what a deal might look like.
De Cossio repeated that Cuba was “open to dialogue” with the United States amid calls from Cubans for the government to negotiate to avert a humanitarian crisis.
Trump has been ratcheting up pressure on Havana since the January 3 capture by US special forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, a top Cuba ally and financial backer.
Pressured by Washington, Venezuela’s new administration has cut crude shipments to Cuba.
Trump said Monday that Cuba’s other main supplier, Mexico, would also “cease sending them oil” after he threatened tariff rises on any country that allowed Cuba to circumvent the de facto blockade. There was no immediate response from Mexico.
The United States’ largest trading partner had incurred Trump’s ire by sending oil to Cuba to make up for a sharp decline in Venezuela’s output under Maduro.



As recently as December, Mexico was still sending crude to Cuba.
President Claudia Sheinbaum had been loathe to cut the lifeline to Cuba, warning of a “far-reaching humanitarian crisis directly affecting hospitals, food supplies, and other basic services for the Cuban people.”
But she also admitted last week: “We don’t want to put our country at risk in terms of tariffs.” A decree signed by Trump last week effectively forced her and other Cuban partners to choose.
The highest people
The pressure tactics threaten to plunge Cuba into complete darkness, with its power stations already struggling to keep the lights on due to fuel shortages.
Jorge Grosso, a 23-year-old student who spent nearly 24 hours last week queueing at a petrol station to fill up his Lada, told AFP he backed talks “to see what conditions are imposed (by Trump) because in the end they’re strangling us.” For months Cubans have been forced to cope with power outages lasting up to 20 hours a day in rural areas.
On Monday, Trump repeated his claim that Cuba, which is limping through its worst economic crisis in decades, is a “failed nation.” He added he believed “we are pretty close (to a deal), but we are dealing with the Cuban leaders right now.”
His pressure on Sheinbaum comes as the United States and its southern neighbour begin talks on a review of a tripartite free trade deal with Canada, which is crucial to Mexico’s economy.
Over the past year, Sheinbaum has been scrambling to stave off the kind of tariff pain Trump has imposed on other allies.
In a move widely seen as an attempt to appease him, Mexico in January imposed stiff tariffs on imports from China.</p><small>2026-02-03 05:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0308413910f08ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970788/trump-warns-of-bad-things-if-no-deal-reached-with-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Trump warns of ‘bad things’ if no deal reached with Iran</strong></a><br><p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered the start of nuclear talks with the United States, as his counterpart Donald Trump threatened “bad things” if no deal with the Islamic republic was struck.
Following the Iranian authorities’ response to anti-government protests that peaked last month, the US president has threatened military action and ordered the dispatch of an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East.
Trump has maintained he is hopeful that Washington will “work something out” with Iran, but also warned late on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal is reached.







Tehran has insisted it wants diplomacy, while vowing an unbridled response to any aggression.
Iranian state media reported on Monday that President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the start of nuclear talks with Washington.
Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of nuclear talks.
“I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” Pezeshkian said in a post on X.
The talks will be held “within the framework of our national interests”, he said.







A meeting is likely to take place in Turkiye on Friday, following interventions by Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Oman, an Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.
US news site Axios cited two unnamed sources as saying Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible deal on the nuclear issue.
Trump had warned “time is running out” for Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb, a claim Tehran has repeatedly denied.
In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal,” adding that, “in return, we expect sanctions lifting”.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said earlier on Monday that Tehran was working on a method and framework for negotiations that would be ready in the coming days, with messages between the two sides relayed through regional players.
‘Police the world’
Turkiye has led a diplomatic push to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and speaking with other regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
Jordan’s top diplomat, Ayman Safadi, assured Araghchi on Monday that the kingdom would “not be a battleground in any regional conflict or a launching pad for any military action against Iran”.
Iranian authorities, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have warned any US attack would trigger a “regional war”.
In Tehran, pensioner Ali Hamidi told AFP he was a veteran and “not afraid of war”, but that “America should mind its own business, why does it want to police the world?” But, the 68-year-old added, “Iranian officials are also at fault for not providing for the people. The economic troubles are back-breaking… The officials should do something tangible, not just talk.”
The protests were sparked in late December by economic strain and exploded in size and intensity over several days in early January.
Authorities have said the protests were “riots” inflamed by its arch-foes US and Israel, with Khamenei likening them to a “coup” attempt.
Ambassadors summoned
Tehran has acknowledged thousands of deaths during the protests, and on Sunday the presidency published the names of 2,986 people out of the 3,117 whom authorities said were killed in the unrest.
Authorities insist most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”.
Young Iranian Selina, who would not give her full name, travelled to Iraqi Kurdistan seeking some relief from “living in fear”.
“It’s not safe for us” in Iran, the 25-year-old told AFP.
“We don’t even dare to go out after 6:00 pm because soldiers are everywhere.”
The crackdown prompted the European Union to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation, with Iranian lawmakers retaliating on Sunday by slapping the same designation on European armies.
The EU also issued fresh sanctions on Iranian officials, including the interior minister, a move echoed on Monday by Britain, which announced sanctions on 10 individuals over the “brutality against protesters”.
Baqaei said on Monday the foreign ministry had summoned all the EU member state ambassadors in Tehran over the designation, and that other responses were to come.
Iranian state television also announced four foreigners had been arrested in Tehran for “participation in riots”, without specifying their nationalities.
Authorities have continued to announce arrests, with rights groups estimating at least 40,000 people have been detained over the protests.</p><small>2026-02-03 05:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/031113591a6fc54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970792/pakistan-to-participate-in-us-critical-minerals-moot-seeks-strategic-partnerships-and-investment' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to participate in US critical minerals moot, seeks strategic partnerships and investment</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is participating in the inaugural Critical Minerals Ministerial at the US Department of State on Wednesday, as Islamabad seeks to expand foreign investment and forge strategic partnerships in the minerals and energy sectors.
Federal Minister for Energy Ali Pervaiz Malik is representing Pakistan at the two-day conference, which is expected to bring together delegations from more than 50 countries to discuss strengthening and diversifying global supply chains for critical minerals—materials essential for advanced technologies, clean energy transitions and defence industries.
Hosting the meeting, the US State Department said the ministerial aims to “advance collective efforts to strengthen and diversify critical minerals supply chains” and to create momentum for international collaboration to secure resources “vital to technological innovation, economic strength, and national security”.
Opening remarks at the conference are scheduled to be delivered by US Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Global Supply Chains David Copley, and Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Jacob Helberg. Secretary Rubio is also due to hold a press availability with visiting delegations.
Pakistan plans to use the forum to highlight its largely untapped mineral potential, including reserves of copper, gold and rare earth elements. Islamabad has previously signed memoranda of understanding worth about $500 million with US partners for cooperation on the development and processing of critical minerals, reflecting what officials describe as expanding US–Pakistan engagement in this strategic area.
Minister Malik arrived in Washington on Sunday evening with a delegation of senior officials and technical experts who oversee Pakistan’s efforts to deepen foreign investment and international collaboration, particularly through enhanced engagement with friendly partners.
According to the State Department, “strengthening critical mineral supply chains with our international partners is vital to America’s economic and national security, technological leadership, and a resilient energy future.”
US officials say the discussions are expected to focus on supply-chain resilience, investment frameworks, and sustainable mining, processing and recycling capabilities.
The invitation list reflects a growing coalition of mineral-rich and industrial nations, including G7 members, India, South Korea, Australia and several African countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea and Kenya. The DRC, in particular, is expected to be represented at the highest level, with President Félix Tshisekedi attending alongside his mining minister.
For Pakistan, participation in the Washington gathering aligns with broader efforts to position the country as a credible destination for strategic mineral investment, while avoiding entanglement in major-power rivalry over control of these resources.
Pakistan has invited both China and the US to the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum (PMIF) 2026, scheduled for April 8–9 in Islamabad, aiming to secure investment for an estimated $6–8 billion in annual mineral export potential.
The forum will focus on copper, gold and rare earth minerals, with an emphasis on deepening China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)–related cooperation with Beijing, while also engaging other international partners.
Pakistan’s delegation is expected to remain in Washington through the end of the week to participate in related sessions and hold bilateral meetings with government and industry counterparts.</p><small>2026-02-03 04:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/030933239a737b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697/back-channel-talks-underway-after-pakistan-decide-to-skip-india-t20-world-cup-clash' target='_blank'><strong>‘Back-channel talks underway after Pakistan decide to skip India T20 World Cup clash’</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The government of Pakistan’s decision on Sunday not to play its T20 World Cup group match against India, scheduled for Feb 15, has prom­pted the International Cricket Council (ICC) to initiate back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses, Dawn has learnt.
The decision was announced around 15 days ahead of the scheduled fixture, giving the ICC sufficient time to explore possible options, including accommodating any reservations Pakistan may have, sources said.
According to sources, a couple of other cricket boards have also stepped in to assist the ICC in its efforts to reach an amicable solution with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
Pakistan announced its decision without citing a specific reason for boycotting the match against India. In the past, however, Australia and the West Indies forfeited their World Cup matches against Sri Lanka in 1996 on security grounds following instructions from their governments. England and New Zealand similarly forfeited matches against Zimbabwe and Kenya, respectively, during the 2003 World Cup on political grounds.
Some quarters have termed Pakistan’s move a mistake, noting that unlike previous instances involving other teams, no explicit justification was provided. Sources, however, said the PCB has factored this into its position and plans to rely on proceedings of the ICC’s Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) in a case filed by Pakistan against India in 2018.
That case stemmed from India’s failure to honour a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the PCB and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2014, under which the two countries were to play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023.
In return, the PCB had supported the ICC’s ‘Big Three’ revenue-sharing model, under which India, Australia and England received a larger share of ICC revenues.
“During the hearing, the PCB asked the BCCI to explain its refusal to tour Pakistan,” a sou­r­ce familiar with the 2018 proceedings said. “Initially, the BCCI stated that it was not obliged to provide a reason. Later, it claimed that the Indian government had not allowed the tour.”
When the PCB requested written instructions from the Indian government, the BCCI responded that such decisions were conveyed verbally and not documented, the source added.
Despite this, sources expressed concerns that, as in 2018, the BCCI influence within the ICC could again result in a ruling against Pakistan, potentially leading to financial penalties or sanctions. In such an event, the government of Pakistan may consider approaching an international court of arbitration, sources said.
It is believed that Pakistan’s decision was influenced by a recent ICC ruling involving Bangladesh. The ICC had rejected Bangladesh’s request to shift its World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka on security grounds and instead excluded Bangladesh from the tournament, replacing it with Scotland. The decision was passed by a 14-2 majority, with only Pakistan and Bangladesh voting against the move.
The India-Pakistan fixture is considered the most lucrative match in world cricket and a cornerstone of the ICC’s revenue model. Media reports estimate its overall commercial value at around $500 million, factoring in broadcast rights, advertising premiums, sponsorships, ticket sales and ancillary commercial activity. Advertising slots during an India-Pakistan T20 typically fetch between Rs2.5 million and Rs4 million for 10 seconds.
Following Pakistan’s announcement, the ICC issued a strongly worded statement, urging the PCB to “explore a mutually acceptable resolution which protects the interests of all stakeholders”.
“The ICC notes the statement made by the government of Pakistan regarding the decision to instruct its national team to selectively participate in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026,” the statement said. “While the ICC awaits official communication from the PCB, selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event.”
“ICC tournaments are built on sporting integrity, competitiveness, consistency and fairness, and selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competition,” it added.
While acknowledging the role of governments in matters of national policy, the ICC warned that the decision was “not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan”.
There are reports that even if Pakistan maintains its stance, the Indian team will travel to Colombo for the scheduled match. If Pakistan do not field a team at the appointed time, India are expected to claim the points under tournament regulations.

Talking to media persons here on Monday, Mr Reza said suspect Waseem Akhtar Sheikh had escaped with the gold belonging to his fellows of the same market.
He was later booked in multiple FIRs lodged by the victims with the Ichhra police besides his stepmother.
The DIG said the mystery of fraud involving gold worth hundreds of millions of rupees of the traders of Ichhra Sarafa (gold) Market has almost been resolved.
“The investigation police recovered from the nominated accused person 1,734 grams of gold,” Zeeshan Reza said.
A cash of more than Rs30 million was also recovered from him in addition to some vehicles.
After snatching gold from traders, the suspect had fled the market and gone underground in Islamabad.
“Before committing the [pre-planned] crime, the suspect had sold his house and all vehicles belonging to him and his family,” he said.
Immediately after registration of the FIR, different teams of the investigation police were tasked, said Reza.
“During the course of the investigation, we also ensured that the suspect does not flee abroad and is arrested as soon as possible”, said the DIG.
Investigation was carried out using modern technology and human intelligence from both aspects so that maximum recovery could be ensured.
To a question, he said some 20 cases were registered against the suspect at the respective police station so far.

Yet the lake is not doing so well. It is slowly drying.
A recent visit to Haleji Lake organised by Green Media Initiatives in collaboration with Accountability Lab Pakistan and the Sindh Wildlife Department (SWD) helped highlight several issues with this sanctuary.
A man-made lake, Haleji, located some 88 kilometres from Karachi, was constructed during World War II, between 1940 and 1943, by the British rulers in India to provide water to their troops stationed in Karachi. According to In Charge Haleji Wildlife Sanctuary, Sohail Ahmed Khoso this was initially a saltwater lake. But then the British created a small natural depression into a reservoir fed by a feeder canal from the Indus River. “That is how fresh sweet water from the Indus was stored here and supplied to Karachi,” he said.
“Soon after, migrant birds from Siberia started frequenting here. Following the Ramsar Convention in 1971, Haleji Lake was included in the list of protected Ramsar sites, which includes marshes, lakes, mangroves and man-made sites. So far some 172 nations are signatories to the Ramsar Convention of which Pakistan is also one,” he said. “The SWD also made Haleji Lake a protected area in 1972.

Water levels are dropping due to stoppage of inflows from the Indus for eight years now, official says

“We have some 225 wetlands in Pakistan of which 19 are Ramsar wetlands. And nine of those 19 Ramsar wetlands happen to be in Sindh of which the most important lake with so much biodiversity is Haleji Lake,” Mr Khoso pointed out.
Of late, Haleji Lake has become the biggest victim of water scarcity, which carries its consequences. With the levels of water in the lake falling rapidly, the food for the migratory birds is also reduced in quantity. The birds flying by this route include Northern Pintail, white-tailed Lapwing, Egyptian Vulture, Pheasant Tailed Jacana, ducks, Waders, pelicans, Mallards and so many more. The SWD carries out a census of the birds. It is worrisome to note their numbers may be decreasing.
The reason behind the water scarcity at Haleji Lake, as pointed out by Mr Khoso, is the stoppage of inflow of sweet water for eight years now.
“We are no longer getting water from the Indus River. It is being diverted towards water projects such as the K-IV before it reaches here. Earlier, water to Karachi was going from here. With no inflow and no out flow either, Haleji Lake has become a stagnant water body,” he said.
Ecologist Rafiul Haq, added to that by saying that wetlands support life forms. Therefore they are seen as unique ecosystems. “Wetlands also have economic value,” he said.
“One-third of our planet is water and nine per cent of it is taken up by wetlands. It amounts to around 63 million hectares of water bodies, which earns $3.4 billion per year for services such as water purification and supply, flood protection, recreation and tourism,” he said.
But he also regretted that all over the world and not just here in Pakistan, the degradation rate of wetlands is going up. “According to an estimate, it is happening at a rate, which is threefold the rate of deforestation due to climate change. Urban expansion, agriculture land use, construction of dams, pollution and climate change are all contributing factors here. It is also a sad estimate that one-fifth or 20 per cent of the remaining wetlands in the world may vanish by 2050 without urgent action,” the ecologist sighed.
“All over the world, World Wetlands Day is celebrated on Feb 2 to mark the 1971 signing of the Convention on Wetlands in Ramsar, Iran. It is important to celebrate this day and understand the dangers befalling our wetlands.
“Naturally, water bodies grow in size during the monsoon and later as the water level goes down they shrink. That’s when people, thinking that the water will not return from the area which dried up, use that land for agriculture. Dams also hurt lakes. When you hinder the natural flow of water you hurt water bodies. Don’t create such issues that disturb the dynamics or water cycles of water bodies.
“We may be signatories to the Ramsar Convention but we are not really doing our bit by not keeping our promises. We have governance gaps when it comes to caring about our natural resources. Our Ramsar commitments are there but their implementation is weak,” the ecologist reminded. “With the migratory birds, the plantation, the tourism which also helps the local community find its own ways of earning livelihoods, Haleji Lake is a biodiversity hub. It requires wise use. Don’t use it to deplete it. Coexist with it,” Mr Haq urged.

Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir exchanges views with Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar.—PPI

ISLAMABAD: Weeks after signing a more than $4 billion arms deal, Pakistan’s armed forces and Libya’s eastern military on Monday pledged to continue their engagement and collaboration.
“During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on matters of mutual interest, with particular focus on security dynamics in respective regions and professional cooperation,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
The ISPR said Field Marshal Khalifa Abu al-Qasim Haftar, commander in chief of the armed forces of eastern part of Libya, called on Field Marshal Asim Munir, chief of army staff and chief of defence forces, at the General Headquarters. Mr Haftar was accompanied by Osama Saad Hammad, prime minister of Libya’s eastern-based parallel government.
The statement said the discussions underscored the importance of continued engagement and collaboration between the two armed forces, with Field Marshal Munir reaffirming Pakistan’s support for peace, stability and institutional development in Libya.

Field Marshal Munir, Khalifa Haftar discuss regional security dynamics, military cooperation

Mr Haftar’s visit to Pakistan comes roughly six weeks after Islamabad and Libya’s eastern military finalised a major defence agreement during Field Marshal Munir’s visit to Benghazi in December. The deal, signed with Saddam Haftar, Khalifa Haftar’s son and deputy, is valued at over $4bn and is among Pakistan’s largest-ever weapons export agreements.
Under the agreement, Pakis­tan is to supply 16 JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter jets, co-developed with China, along with 12 Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft and other unspecified equipment for air, land and naval forces.
The deal also includes provisions for training, capacity building and potential joint manufacturing, with deliveries expected over the next two and a half years.
Analysts see the reciprocal visit as a signal of follow-through on the December pact for translating the agreement into concrete timelines for deliveries, training and broader military cooperation.
It also projects the relationship between the two sides as a long term strategic partnership rather than a one-off commercial transaction.
If fully implemented, the sale would represent the first export of JF-17 fighter jets to an Arab country, placing Pakistan more firmly within Libya’s eastern military orbit and signalling Islamabad’s intent to expand its defence footprint despite international sensitivities surrounding Libya’s prolonged conflict.

ISLAMABAD: As lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in the lower house of parliament exhibited rare unity on Monday in condemning the deadly terror attacks in Balochistan, with varying opinions on the way of tackling the menace, Def­e­nce Minister Khawaja Asif asserted that backwardness of any area was no justification to stand against the state.
Suggestions came from across the aisles that instead of a mere debate on the grave issue of terrorism, the government should take decisive action to eliminate terrorists with full force so that the life of a common man could be safeguarded.
However, when proceedings concluded, only 10 members were sitting in the house, indicating the seriousness of lawmakers in addressing one of the biggest challenges confronting Pakistan.
Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, who was presiding over the NA session, earlier suspended its agenda and confined its proceedings to the issue of fresh terror attacks in Balochistan.
In his speech on the floor of the house, the defence minister said a total of 177 terrorists were killed within a few days following the deadly attacks in Balochistan that claimed the lives of 10 policemen, one Levies man, six FC personnel and as many as 33 civilians.
The defence minister warned that political polarisation and fragmented national narratives were undermining Pakistan’s fight against terrorism, cautioning that internal divisions only served the interests of militant groups and hostile foreign actors.
He said the country continued to pay a heavy price for past policy decisions, particularly those linked to regional conflicts, adding that the burden of those choices was being borne by civilians and security personnel rather than by those who had made the decisions decades ago.
He urged parliamentarians to demonstrate unity on matters of national security, saying a divided political discourse weakened public confidence and emboldened hostile forces.
Highlighting the human cost of terrorism, the defence minister said civilians in affected areas faced daily threats, while members of the armed forces continued to make sacrifices to safeguard national security.
He ruled out the narrative of disparity and backwardness in Balochistan, saying that banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which he described as India-sponsored, exploited this narrative to gain the sympathy of Baloch youth.
While presenting a comparison between the current situation and that at the time of independence in 1947, he said, “In 1947, there were only 114 schools in Balochistan, whereas today there are 1,596. There was no university in the province at that time, but now there are 12 universities.
Today, Balochistan has five medical colleges, 145 other colleges, 13 cadet colleges, 21 technical institutions, 13 hospitals, 18 teaching hospitals, 23 district headquarters hospitals, 756 basic health units, 841 dispensaries, four cardiac centres and 24 dialysis centres,” he added.
But Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai rejected the claims and figures presented by the defence minister, saying Mr Asif had no understanding of the situation in the province.
He said the unjust distribution of resources had created a sense of deprivation among the people, which fuelled terrorism. “The first right over resources rests with the people of the areas from where those resources are extracted. We can overcome terrorism in a short time by giving due rights to the people,” he added.
An ‘inhuman’ act
Mr Achakzai, however, condemned the attacks and said the killing of innocent labourers, teachers and people from other provinces in Balochistan was an inhuman act and could not be justified.
He urged the National Assembly speaker to hold a marathon session on terrorism lasting two days and to allow all members to speak on the issue.

 

Tracing the history of Balochistan since the British Raj, the opposition leader claimed that the Pashtun population was equal to the Baloch population in the province.
When Mr Achakzai held the country’s intelligence agencies responsible for failing to prevent the attacks, Speaker Sadiq commended the role of the security forces and intelligence agencies and urged the defence minister to provide details of how many terrorist attacks had been thwarted in the recent past.
A critical moment
Taking part in the debate, senior PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf said political disagreements were a part of democratic life, but should not overshadow issues of terrorism, national integrity and security.
He cautioned against targeting national institutions for political gain, saying such actions damaged morale and could be exploited by hostile neighbours. He warned that political infighting and confrontational narratives were weakening the country at a critical moment.
Referring to the sacrifices of soldiers deployed along the borders and in terrorism-affected areas, the PPP lawmaker said any impression that their sacrifices were being undermined could have serious consequences for national resolve. He urged all political parties, including the opposition parties, to rise above partisan interests and present a united front on matters of national security.
The PPP leader called for comprehensive parliamentary engagement on security challenges, proposing that the House hold full debates and form committees to examine the situation and present concrete recommendations.
He stressed that Balochistan’s stability must remain a national priority and should be addressed through consensus rather than political confrontation.
The debate was held following the adoption of a motion to discuss the prevailing law and order situation in the country.
During their speeches, Mehmood Achakzai and Barrister Gohar demanded the release of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and called for him to be allowed to meet his doctors and family particularly in light of reports that he was suffering from ‘a serious medical condition’.

In absolute terms, export proceeds reached $3.061 billion in January, up from $2.951bn in the corresponding month of last year, reflecting an increase of 3.73 per cent, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) said on Monday. On a month-on-month basis, export proceeds grew by 34.96pc in January.
Negative growth in exports has continued since August of the current fiscal year, barring July, when proceeds grew 16.43pc year on year. Export earnings posted negative growth, with proceeds declining by 20.41pc in December.

 

This follows a 14.54pc drop in November, 4.46pc in October, 3.88pc in September, and 12.49pc in August, reflecting persistent pressures on the country’s external trade performance. In the first seven months (July-January), export proceeds recorded negative growth of 7.09pc to $18.195bn compared with $19.583bn in the corresponding period last year.

Trade gap widens 28.22pc to $22.038bn in July-January FY26

The government has recently announced several measures, including a reduction in the energy rates and others, to minimise pressure on the country’s trade performance. Last week, the prime minister announced a decrease of Rs4.4 per unit in the electricity tariff for the industrial sector, in a bid to improve productivity and exports. He also announced a reduction in wheeling charges for industries, stating that “it will be less than Rs9 per unit.” He hoped that the move would help “industries sell their power to neighbouring industries”.
To provide additional relief, the premier said that “with the cooperation and support of Pakistan’s banks, we are announcing a reduction in the export refinance rate from earlier 7.5pc to 4.5pc”.
Currently, the exporters are grappling with subdued global markets and the high cost of doing business in the country. The textile exporters have already complained about contractions owing to the high cost of doing business. In FY25, export proceeds rose 4.67pc to $32.106bn against $30.675bn in the preceding year.
Trade deficit
According to the PBS data, imports fell 1.4apc to $5.786bn in January from $5.904bn over the corresponding month of last year. Month-on-month, imports decreased 4.85pc.
In the first seven months of 2025-26, the import bill grew by 9.42pc to $40.233bn, up from $36.771bn in the corresponding period last year. The import rose 6.57pc to $58.38bn in July-January FY25 from $54.78bn over the previous year.
The trade deficit narrowed 6.61pc to $2.725bn in January from $2.918bn over the corresponding month of last year. The trade deficit swelled 28.22pc to $22.038bn in July-January 2025-26, up from $17.188bn over the corresponding period last year. The trade deficit for FY25 widened by 9pc to $26.27bn, up from $24.11bn in the preceding year.

ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan and Uzbekistan resolved on Monday to expand the scope of their Preferential Trade Agreement to increase their trade beyond $2 billion in two years — from around $450 million last year —and to deepen cooperation in various economic fields.
At a meeting of the Pak-Uzbek Intergovernmental Commission (IGC), the two sides agreed to more than double the list of items for bilateral trade from 17 at present. The two sides had signed the agreement in March 2022 and it came into effect in 2023.
The 10th IGC on Trade, Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation was co-chaired by Haroon Akhtar Khan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Industries and Production, and Uzbe­kistan’s Trade Minister Laziz Kudratov.
“The engagement enabled a comprehensive review of bilateral relations and established a forward-looking roadmap to strengthen joint efforts in major economic and social sectors”, a joint statement said.
The parties welcomed the progress on Phase II concessions of the Preferential Trade Agreement, the statement added.
The two sides “agreed to expedite institutional mechanisms to achieve the agreed target of $2bn in bilateral trade”.
Both sides expressed satisfaction over the steady progress achieved since the previous IGC session last year and reaffirmed their resolve to expand bilateral trade, investment, and economic engagement.
Emphasis was placed on trade facilitation, improved logistics, customs digitalisation, transit trade cooperation, development of regional trade corridors, and enhanced business-to-business engagement, supported by impro­ved visa facilitation for business communities.
The two sides also agreed to establish a joint working group on labour relations, tasked with addressing labour mobility, skills development, workplace safety, and practical considerations linked to employment visas.
Transport and communications
In transport and communications sector, the commission welcomed interest in launching direct air services, reviewed progress on regional railway and connectivity projects, and agreed to advance alternative transport corridors to improve regional trade and transit connectivity.
Cooperation in agriculture and food security featured prominently, with both sides welcoming progress on phytosanitary protocols facilitating the export of fruits from Uzbekistan to Pakistan.
The parties agreed to expand collaboration through additional protocols, joint working groups, and technical cooperation in plant protection, livestock development, and agricultural research, with a shared focus on food security and sustainable agricultural growth.
In higher education, science, and technology, the commission welcomed progress on academic and research partnerships between leading institutions of the two countries.
Both sides agreed to promote joint research, faculty and student exchanges, vocational and technical training, innovation, and capacity building, supported by newly signed agreements in scientific, technical, and innovation fields to strengthen long-term knowledge cooperation and human capital development.
Environmental and climate cooperation was recognised as a shared priority, with both sides agreeing to collaborate on climate resilience, protection of glacial ecosystems, sustainable water management, environmental governance, gender-inclusive climate action, and comm­unity-based adaptation approaches.

In a post on social media platform Truth Social, the US president said that he and the Indian premier spoke about “many things”, including trade and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.
Trump added that “out of friendship and respect” for Modi, the US would lower its reciprocal tariff rate from 25 per cent to 18pc, while India would reduce tariffs on US goods to zero.
“He (Modi) agreed to stop buying Russian oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela,” Trump wrote, adding that this would “end the war” between Russia and Ukraine.







The US president, calling Modi “one of my greatest friends, and a powerful and respected leader of his country”, said that he agreed to “buy American” at a much higher level.
Trump added that India would buy, “over $500 billion of US energy, technology, agricultural, coal, and many other products”.
Later, Modi took to X to hail the discussion and express his happiness with the reduced tariffs.
“Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement,” he wrote.
“When two large economies and the world’s largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation,” Modi said.
The Indian prime minister called Trump’s leadership is “vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity”, adding that New Delhi fully supports his efforts.
“I look forward to working closely with him to take our partnership to unprecedented heights,” Modi said.







The United States is effectively overseeing Venezuelan oil exports since toppling the South American country’s leader Nicolas Maduro in a military operation in January.
Trump hit India, the world’s most populous nation, with 25pc reciprocal levies during his waves of “Liberation Day” tariffs last year. He then stacked another 25pc on top of that over India’s purchases of Russian oil.
Modi was one of the first leaders to visit the White House after Trump’s inauguration for his second term in January 2025, but that has not stopped difficult trade negotiations over the past year.
Trump also said in October that Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil, but an agreement did not materialise at the time.</p><small>2026-02-02 18:09</small></div><hr>
