Pakistan faces a potential 29 per cent tariff on its exports to the US due to a $3 billion trade surplus with the world’s biggest economy, under tariffs announced by Washington last month on countries around the world.
Pakistan’s formal negotiations with the United States on reciprocal tariffs started earlier in the day with a phone call between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, a press release from the finance ministry said.
Trump said he would have no interest in making a deal with Pakistan or India, if they were to engage in war with each other.
The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
“As you know, we’re very close making a deal with India,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews after departing Air Force One.

Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal visited Washington recently to advance trade talks, with both sides aiming to sign an interim agreement by early July.
India faces 26pc tariffs on shipments to the US.
Reuters reported last week that India is likely to allow US firms to bid for contracts worth over $50 billion, mainly from federal entities, as it negotiates a trade deal with Washington.
The increase in trade tariffs on Pakistani products, amongst a global tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump, which were paused, could have a devastating impact on Pakistan’s important exports and serve as a wake-up call for diversification, according to a state-owned think tank.
The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics warned that these tariffs could have a “devastating impact” on the country’s export sector, translating into an annual loss of $1.1-1.4 billion.
Trump’s tariffs, implemented on April 2, introduced a 10 per cent baseline tariff for every country the US trades with, and additional reciprocal tariffs on rivals and allies alike.</p><small>2025-05-31 03:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31082332a4ffad2.jpg?r=083034' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914428/saudi-arabia-tightens-haj-rules-after-heat-related-deaths' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia tightens Haj rules after heat-related deaths</strong></a><br><p>• Applies strict policy of ‘no Haj without permit’
• Deploys drones to spot unregistered pilgrims; hundreds of apartments raided
• Fines doubled for performing rites illegally; violators to face 10-year ban
• Family, tourist visas barred to nationals of more than 10 countries
RIYADH: Saudi Arabia is ramping up a crackdown on unregistered worshippers at next week’s Haj, a year after hundreds perished in scorching conditions.
Regular raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts are aimed at rooting out unauthorised visitors hoping to mingle among the crowds in and around the holy city of Makkah.
The simple message, “No Haj without a permit”, is being blared out in a relentless campaign promoted nationwide at shopping centres, on billboards and across media platforms.
Last year, 1,301 pilgrims, most of them unregistered and lacking access to air-conditioned tents and buses, died as temperatures soared to 51.8 degrees Celsius.
“Since the end of last season, we realised the biggest challenge is preventing unauthorised pilgrims from undermining the success of the Haj season,” said one official helping organise the Haj, requesting anonymity.
Official permits are allocated to countries through a quota system and distributed to individuals via a lottery. Even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs make the irregular route — which costs thousands of dollars less — more attractive.
Saudi officials said 83 per cent of those who died last year did not have official Haj permits. Temperatures of up to 44C are forecast next week.
‘Unprecedented’ security
To seek out unregistered pilgrims, Saudi authorities have rolled out a new fleet of drones to monitor entrances into Makkah.
Security forces have also raided hundreds of apartments in search of people hiding out in the area.
An Egyptian engineer living in Makkah, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said his building was raided multiple times in recent weeks.
“Police officers in uniform came to my home twice and asked to see my and my wife’s residency permits,” he told AFP.
“Almost everywhere, we’re being asked to show residency or work permits in Makkah. The security presence is unprecedented.”
The problem of illegal pilgrims has become acute since Saudi Arabia loosened visa restrictions in line with economic reforms, trying to attract more tourism and business. Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have used family and tourist visas, instead of the designated Haj visa, to enter the country each year.
Fines and bans
Saudi Arabia is now trying to cut off the problem at source, restricting multiple-entry visas for citizens of several countries since January.
Family and tourist visas were also barred to nationals of more than 10 countries, including Egypt, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Jordan.
Umar Karim, an expert on Saudi affairs at the University of Birmingham, said officials previously focused on “deterring people but not stopping them” from coming before the Haj.
“Saudi authorities have seen that once these people are inside the kingdom, stopping them from physically entering Makkah is a difficult task even if a huge number of security officials are deployed,” he added.
For the past month, entry into Makkah has been restricted to individuals with work and residency permits. Many people in Makkah have been forced to send their wives and children, who lack the proper visas, out of the city. Pilgrims coming for Umrah have also been required to leave.
Meanwhile, fines for performing Haj illegally have doubled to 20,000 Saudi riyals ($5,333), with violators facing a 10-year ban from the country.
Those found to be harbouring and helping unauthorised pilgrims can be fined up to 100,000 riyals ($26,666).
“All of this is aimed at ensuring that Makkah is reserved exclusively for authorised pilgrims during the Haj season,” the official added.
Residents of Makkah told AFP that the crowds there have noticeably thinned compared to previous years.
However, officials said on Tuesday that more than a million pilgrims had already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the Haj.
Last year’s Haj-related deaths were a high-profile example of the havoc wrought by heat in 2024, which the Copernicus Climate Change Service said was the hottest year ever recorded.
While the pilgrimage, which follows a lunar calendar, will eventually shift to the cooler winter season, relief will be temporary.
A 2019 study published by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change and the timing of the Haj, heat stress for pilgrims will exceed the “extreme danger threshold” from 2047 to 2052, and 2079 to 2086.

• Says millions of lives must not be held hostage to ‘narrow political gains’
• Terms 2022 floods a consequence of glacial melt
• Tajik president wants global plan to save melting glaciers
DUSHANBE: Rejecting the “weaponisation of water”, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday warned that Pakistan would not allow India to cross the “red line” by suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, describing any such move as a reckless act that would jeopardise millions of lives for narrow political gain.
“India’s unilateral and illegal decision to hold in abeyance the Indus Water Treaty, which governs the sharing of the Indus Basin’s water, is deeply regrettable,” the prime mi­n­ister said while addr­essing the High-Level Int­e­rnational Conference on Glaciers Preservation. “Millions of lives must not be held hostage to narrow political gains, and Pakistan will not allow this. We will never allow the red line to be crossed.”
The three-day conference, held in Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe from May 29-31, brought toge­ther over 2,500 delegates from 80 UN member states and 70 international orga­ni­sations, including prime ministers, vice presidents, ministers, and UN assistant secretaries-general.
 
 

Hosted by the government of Tajikistan in collaboration with the United Nations, Unesco, World Meteorological Organisa­tion (WMO), and the Asian Development Bank, the summit aimed to push forward the agenda for glacier protection and international climate cooperation.
In his address, Prime Minister Shehbaz touched all the relevant issues, including glacial preservation, Pakistan’s climate vulnerability, the 2022 floods in Pakistan, global climate action and responsibility, scientific projections on glacial melt, weaponisation of water, and a call to protect nature and humanity’s shared destiny.
“The world today bears fresh scars from the use of conventional weapons in Gaza that have left deep wounds. As if that were not enough, we are now witnessing an alarming new low — the weaponisation of water,” he told participants.
The 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, through a resolution, declared 2025 as the International Year of Glaciers Preservation, designated 21 March as the annual World Day for Glaciers beginning in 2025, and assigned the government of Tajikistan to host the inaugural international conference on the subject that year.
Prime Minister Shehbaz reminded the international audience that Pakistan, with over 13,000 glaciers, was among the countries most vulnerable to climate change. These glaciers contribute nearly half of the annual flows in the Indus River system, which sustains Pakistan’s civilisation, culture and economy.
“The five great rivers that shape our geographical landscape — Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej — all depend on the stability of glacial systems. This makes Pakistan one of the most vulnerable countries to any climatic changes that impact glaciers,” he added.
He told the international gathering that Pakistan had faced the peril of glacial melt in the form of devastating floods in 2022, which destroyed millions of acres of standing crops and hundreds of thousands of houses and infrastructure, despite Pakistan’s only less than half a per cent contribution to the total world emissions.
Referring to the “sobering” scientific projections, he highlighted that glacial melt in our region was expected to accelerate flooding in the coming decades, followed by a drastic decline in river flows as glaciers recede further.
“These changes threaten our fragile ecosystem. As we inch closer to these grim new realities, we must heed the alarm bells, deflection signs of haunting consequences — lost livelihoods, displaced families and deep chaos,” he warned.
 
 

Highlighting Pakistan’s commitment to shared responsibility and collective action, he called for enhanced global climate action to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.
“The developed countries must meet their climate financial commitments without any delay and with a balanced focus on adaptation and mitigation as well as loss and damage,” the prime minister said.
“Adequate funding for climate resilience, infrastructure and overcoming financing gaps remains critical for climate-vulnerable countries. Investment must be made in early warning systems and disaster preparedness and management,” he added.
Measures to protect glaciers
President Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan, co-hosting the international conference, called on the world to take urgent and coordinated action to safeguard glaciers, warning that their rapid melting poses a global crisis.
“I want to note clearly that glaciers preservation is not just a problem of countries with glaciers but rather a global crisis that deserves the immediate attention of the international community,” President Rahmon said.
He urged comprehensive monitoring and scientific research to better understand glacier dynamics, their role in ecosystems and their socio-economic impacts.
He suggested that countries with the ability to collect accurate data on the state of glaciers, particularly through satellites, should establish a regular exchange of information with countries that lack such capabilities.
The president called for implementing collective actions to address the socio-economic consequences of glacier melting, including its impact on accessing water, ensuring food security, producing electricity, and protecting cultural and natural heritage.
“We must make every effort to ensure the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and take the necessary measures to prevent an increase in global temperature,” he said.
Tajikistan, with 93 per cent of its territory covered by mountains, is home to the largest glaciers in Central Asia. “So far, 1,300 out of 14,000 glaciers have completely melted. These glaciers supply 60pc of the region’s drinking water,” he said.
President Rahmon stressed that climate change had already caused the loss of about a third of mountain glaciers around the world and this process is not just an environmental problem but is closely related to many aspects of human life. “Tajikistan’s glaciers are vital not just for regional rivers, but for climate stability worldwide,” he said.
Citing the Fedchenko Glacier, one of the world’s largest continental glaciers, President Rahmon said it could yield thousands of years of climate data crucial for future strategies. He called on all countries to support Tajikistan’s proposal to develop a global preservation framework under the United Nations.

The reference is based on an application filed by former MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost 2024 general election from NA-18 (Haripur) to Omar Ayub Khan with a margin of 82,000 votes. 
The ECP instantly fixed the reference for first hearing on June 4 and notices have been issued to both Mr Ayub and Mr Nawaz. 
On the same day, the ECP will also resume hearing on a petition filed by Mr Nawaz on May 11,2024 seeking action over alleged rigging in his constituency. 
He had also demanded a thorough probe into the alleged rigging. In his petition, the former MNA had alleged that Mr Ayub was guilty of financial corruption and misrepresentation in the affidavit submitted to the election commission. 
One of the interesting claims made by Mr Nawaz was that the PTI leader had himself complained of rigging in elections on February 9. 
A source in PTI, however, rejected the claim that the party had written a letter to the DRO complaining over its own victory with a margin of 82,000 votes. He said the fake letter had never been written by the PTI and was not there on the official record. 
He said the DRO concerned had also denied receiving such a letter. He also pointed out that Mr Nawaz in his posts on social media including X and Facebook had accepted his defeat with open heart and had congratulated Mr Ayub. 
The source further said Mr Nawaz filed his petition on May 11, 2024, after 24 days from the date of expiry of filing of the petition deadline (April 17). 
He alleged the state machinery and ECP have been activated once again as a tool to deprive PTI of those seats they could not manage to steal after elections. 
On April 18, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had lifted the stay order that had halted the ECP’s probe into alleged rigging in NA-18 Haripur, directing the electoral body to proceed with the case after hearing all concerned parties. 
Announcing the reserved verdict, Acting Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar dismissed the petition filed by mr Ayub, which had sought to block the ECP’s inquiry into the alleged irregularities. 
On April 23, the PTI leader challenged in the Supreme Court the ECP’s jurisdiction to proceed with a representation filed by his rival candidate, Babar Nawaz Khan, under sections 8, 9, and 95 of the Elections Act, 2017.
The petitioner argued that the ECP became functus officio (lacking jurisdiction) after the statutory 60-day period from the Feb 17, 2024 notification of the returned candidate expired on April 17, 2024. Despite this, the ECP continued proceedings, which he contended was unlawful.

“Pakistan’s nuclear weapon program is the sole guarantor of peace and stability in South Asia,” Gen Kidwai said in his keynote at a round table discussion hosted by the Center for International Strategic Studies to mark the 27th anniversary of Pakistan’s 1998 nuclear tests.
Speakers at the event described India’s resp­onse as a reckless attempt to challenge Pakistan’s strategic restraint.
Among others who spoke at the meeting were former foreign secretary Sohail Mahmood, director general of the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad; Muhammad Naeem, former chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission; Dr Adil Sultan, dean of Air University; and retired Brig Dr Zahirul Haider Kazmi, adviser on arms control at the Strategic Plans Division.
The speakers warned of an emerging pattern in which India employs false flag operations as pretexts for limited military strikes, ignoring the risks inherent in a nuclearised environment. Such beha­v­iour, they said, could trigger catastrophic misjudgments with far-reaching consequences.
“India has shown a pattern of conducting false flag operations as a casus belli to justify aggressive actions against Pakistan, disregarding the prevailing nuclear environment and deliberately testing the limits of Pakistan’s conventional capabilities and nuclear thresholds,” CISS said in a statement on the discussion.
“Pakistan’s credible nuclear capability, operationalised through Full Spectrum Deterrence, remains the cornerstone of peace in South Asia,” one of the speakers said, arguing that the recent confrontation underscored the continued relevance of nuclear deterrence in preventing conflict escalation.
They also emphasised Pakistan’s readiness to respond to future provocations with a range of kinetic and non-kinetic options, as part of ‘Quid Pro Quo Plus’ strategy — defined as swift, and precise retaliation aimed at deterring escalation and compelling de-escalation.

The increase in trade tariffs on Pakistani products announced by US President Donald Trump, which were paused, could have a devastating impact on Pakistan’s important exports and served as a wake-up call for diversification, according to a state-owned think tank.
The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics warned that these tariffs would have a “devastating impact” on the country’s export sector, translating into an annual loss of $1.1-1.4 billion.
 
 

According to the finance ministry, Aurangzeb and Greer “exchanged their view point through a constructive engagement, with the understanding that technical level detailed discussions would follow in the coming few weeks”.
“Both sides expressed confidence in advancing these negotiations for successful conclusion at the earliest,” the ministry added.
Trump’s tariffs, implemented on April 2, introduced a 10 per cent baseline tariff for every country the US trades with, and additional reciprocal tariffs on rivals and allies alike.
The steep hike targeting Chinese goods raised Washington’s additional rate on many products to 145 per cent, the White House confirmed. The two nations have engaged in talks, which the US treasury secretary says have “stalled”.</p><small>2025-05-30 18:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/30233851bb93b85.jpg?r=234547' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914331/abortion-pill-inventor-etienne-emile-baulieu-dies-aged-98' target='_blank'><strong>Abortion pill inventor Etienne-Emile Baulieu dies aged 98</strong></a><br><p>French scientist Etienne-Emile Baulieu, the inventor of the abortion pill, died at the age of 98 at his home in Paris on Friday, his wife told AFP.
The doctor and researcher, who achieved worldwide renown for his work that led to the pill, had an eventful life that included fighting in the French resistance and becoming friends with artists such as Andy Warhol.
“His research was guided by his commitment to the progress made possible by science, his dedication to women’s freedom, and his desire to enable everyone to live better, longer lives,” Baulieu’s wife Simone Harari Baulieu said in a statement.
French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to his life, calling him “a beacon of courage” and “a progressive mind who enabled women to win their freedom”.
“Few French people have changed the world to such an extent,” he added in a post on X.
 






Baulieu’s most famous discovery helped create the oral drug RU-486, also known as mifepristone, which provided a safe and inexpensive alternative to surgical abortion to millions of women across the world.
For decades, he pushed governments to authorise the drug, facing fierce criticism and sometimes threats from opponents of abortion.
When Wyoming became the first US state to outlaw the abortion pill in 2023, Baulieu told AFP it was “scandalous”.
Then aged 96, Baulieu said he had dedicated a large part of his life to “increasing the freedom of women,” and such bans were a step in the wrong direction.
On news of his death, French Equality Minister Aurore Berge passed on her condolences to Baulieu’s family, saying on X he was “guided throughout his life by one requirement: human dignity.”
‘Fascinated by artists’
Born on December 12, 1926 in Strasbourg to Jewish parents, Etienne Blum was raised by his feminist mother after his father, a doctor, died. He changed his name to Emile Baulieu when he joined the French resistance against Nazi occupation at the age of 15, then later adding Etienne.
After the war, he became a self-described “doctor who does science,” specialising in the field of steroid hormones.
Invited to work in the United States, Baulieu was noticed in 1961 by Gregory Pincus, known as the father of the contraceptive pill, who convinced him to focus on sex hormones.
Back in France, Baulieu designed a way to block the effect of the hormone progesterone, which is essential for the egg to implant in the uterus after fertilisation. This led to the development of mifepristone in 1982.
Dragged before the courts and demonised by US anti-abortion groups who accused him of inventing a “death pill”, Baulieu refused to back down.
“Adversity slides off him like water off a duck’s back,” Simone Harari Baulieu told AFP.
“You, a Jew and a resistance fighter, you were overwhelmed with the most atrocious insults and even compared to Nazi scientists,” Macron said as he presented Baulieu with France’s top honour in 2023. “But you held on, for the love of freedom and science.”
In the 1960s, literature fan Baulieu became friends with artists such as Andy Warhol. He said he was “fascinated by artists who claim to have access to the human soul, something that will forever remain beyond the reach of scientists.”
Alzheimer’s, depression research
Baulieu kept going into his Parisian office well into his mid-90s.
“I would be bored if I did not work anymore,” he said in 2023.
His recent research has included trying to find a way to prevent the development of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as a treatment for severe depression, for which clinical trials are currently underway across the world.
“There is no reason we cannot find treatments” for both illnesses, he said.
Baulieu was also the first to describe how the hormone DHEA secreted from adrenal glands in 1963.
He was convinced of the hormone’s anti-ageing abilities, but drugs using it only had limited effects, such as in skin-firming creams.
In the United States, Baulieu was also awarded the prestigious Lasker prize in 1989.
After his wife Yolande Compagnon died, Baulieu married Simone Harari in 2016. He leaves behind three children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, according to the statement released by his family.</p><small>2025-05-30 18:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/302156056fab848.jpg?r=215832' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914324/field-marshal-asim-munir-assails-indias-hydro-terrorism-during-address-to-quetta-college' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Asim Munir assails India’s ‘hydro-terrorism’ during address to Quetta college</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Friday emphasised the need for a peaceful resolution to the Kashmir dispute, assailing India’s “unlawful and legally untenable hydro-terrorism,” a statement from the military’s media wing said.
His statement came during a visit to Quetta Command and Staff College where he addressed student officers and faculty of the college. The comments followed a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad retaliated by downing five Indian jets. It took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
India, however, is still weaponising the Indus Water Treaty — a water distribution deal between the two countries — saying that it will no longer abide by the treaty, placing the agreement in “abeyance”.
According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army chief emphasised the need for a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute, and warned against India’s “unlawful and legally untenable ‘hydro-terrorism’.”
“Commenting on the global and regional environment, the COAS shed light on the character of emerging conflict, with particular emphasis on India’s increasingly dangerous propensity to use unprovoked military aggression against Pakistan,” the statement said.
“While reiterating the resolve to defeat any aggression and ability to deal with threats across the entire conflict spectrum, the COAS asserted that Pakistan will never be coerced and inimical designs to distract Pakistan’s efforts against the war on terrorism will be comprehensively defeated.”
The field marshal also paid tribute to the martyrs of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos against India and expressed complete solidarity with their family members.
He said that the Pakistani people became “a wall of steel for the defence of the motherland” under the national leadership.

The ISPR also said that the army chief highlighted the “Indian state’s role in sponsoring terrorism inside Pakistan”, adding that he spoke on the “reinvigorated counter-terrorism drive and expressed confidence that the nation’s fight against terrorism will be driven to a logical conclusion”.
The statement further said, “Talking about leadership, the Field Marshal advised the student officers to fulfill their obligations with utmost dedication, passion and resolve.
“Emphasising the need for innovative thinking and research, he lauded the Command & Staff College Quetta for grooming future military leaders who uphold the highest standards of this sacred profession.”
He was quoted in the statement as saying, “Training must reflect not only the current realities but also prepare us for the future battlefield, one that demands agility, innovation, and unwavering resolve.”
Upon his arrival in Quetta, the Field Marshal was received by Quetta Corps Commander and Quetta Commandant Command and Staff College, it added.
Last week, the government promoted Gen Munir to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his “strategic leadership and decisive role” in defeating India during the military confrontation between the two countries that ended with a US-mediated ceasefire.
Field marshal is the highest rank in armies modelled after the British Army. In Pakistan, it was awarded only once before, to General Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1959.</p><small>2025-05-30 18:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/302249098475f48.jpg?r=224917' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914322/robbers-hijack-rickshaw-carrying-sacrificial-animals-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Robbers hijack rickshaw carrying sacrificial animals in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>Four armed robbers hijacked a Qingqi rickshaw carrying three sacrificial sheep at gunpoint in Karachi’s Ayesha Manzil area, police said on Friday.
According to a first information report (FIR), the complainant Mohammed Rashid Saleem said that he had purchased three sheep and was carrying them in his Qingqi rickshaw on Thursday when the incident occurred.
“Four suspects riding on two motorcycles snatched the rickshaw along with the animals at gunpoint and fled,” the FIR read, adding that the suspects also snatched cash and a cell phone from the victim.
According to a statement from the Karachi Police spokesperson, the Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Javed Alam Odho took notice of the incident and ordered action against the Azizabad station house officer for negligence, issuing orders to suspend his service for one year.
The AIG ordered that the suspects involved in the incident must be arrested within three days, with the recovery of the animals and rickshaw, otherwise, strict legal action will be taken, the statement added.
Days before Eidul Azha, people rush to cattle markets to buy sacrificial animals, with sheep usually costing upwards of Rs30,000.
In 2023, five animals worth Rs800,000 were stolen from a locked shop in Karachi’s Orangi Town, according to ARY News.

“Imane Khelif may not participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup, 5-10 June 2025 and any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes genetic sex screening in accordance with World Boxings rules and testing procedures,” World Boxing said in a statement.
 
 

All athletes over the age of 18 will have to undertake a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) genetic test, which can be conducted by a nasal or mouth swab, saliva or blood, World Boxing said.
“The PCR test is a laboratory technique used to detect specific genetic material, in this case, the SRY gene, that reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is an indicator of biological sex,” the statement added.</p><small>2025-05-30 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606988-adc-martyred-after-terrorists-attack-residence-in-balochistans-sorab' target='_blank'><strong>ADC martyred after terrorists attack residence in Balochistan's Sorab</strong></a><br><p>

Balochistan Government Spokesperson Shahid Rind, in a statement, termed the incident a “nefarious attempt to challenge the writ of the state”.
“A bank was looted and the homes of several government officials were attacked, including Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Hidayatullah Buledi.
“Buledi was martyred while defending his home during the attack,” Rind said in the statement, adding that the official “set a new example of bravery” through his sacrifice.
“Women and children were also present at the residence during the attack,” he added.
The spokesperson added that “Indian-sponsored proxies have taken action on (India’s) behalf”, adding that a search operation was underway in the area.
“We are determined to thwart efforts of anti-state elements,” he said, according to the statement.
Frontier Corps and Levies personnel had arrived at the scene, he said.
Separately, Rind spoke to DawnNews TV and said that “geo-fencing is being used to track down the attackers.”
Dawn.com has reached out to the police and local administration in Surab for comment.
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
In March, the Jaffar Express train was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area, resulting in the deaths of 26 hostages, including 18 security personnel. Five more security personnel were martyred during the operation.
However, a significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS).
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-05-30 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606982-coas-vows-to-thwart-hostile-attempts-aimed-at-derailing-pakistans-anti-terror-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>COAS vows to thwart hostile attempts aimed at derailing Pakistan's anti-terror efforts</strong></a><br><p>

On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
ATC Special Court-II judge Tahir Abbas Sipra handed down the punishment under different sections of the Pakistan Penal Code after finding the accused guilty of attacking the Ramna police station during the May 9 riots.
The accused were sentenced to a total of 27 years in prison along with a fine worth Rs327,000. The sentences shall run concurrently, the judge said.
MNA Abdul Latif, who was elected from NA-1 Chitral, was not present in the court when the verdict was announced. The lawmaker will be disqualified for five years after the conviction.
The judge told the accused that 20 witnesses, including magistrates recorded their testimonies against them, noting that protests should be held peacefully and participants should never take the law into their own hands.
“You are accused of attacking the Ramna Police Station in Islamabad. If you attack your own police stations, the country will no longer be livable,” the judge remarked.
A case had been registered against the accused in Ramna police station under various sections for offences including burning a motorcycle and attacking police personnel.
The eleven accused who were convicted were Zariyab Khan, Muhammad Akram, Meera Khan, Abdul Latif, Sameol Robert, Wazeerzada, Abdul Basit, Shan Ali, Shahzaib, Muhammad Yousaf, and Sohail Khan.
Following the verdict, the police took the four accused present in the court, namely Mira Khan, Muhammad Akram, Shahzeb, and Sohail Khan, into custody. The court also issued arrest warrants for other PTI supporters accused of involvement in the riots but was absent from the court.
The sentences ranged from ten years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs200,000 for terrorism provisions under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, five years in prison and a fine of Rs50,000 for the murderous attack on policemen under Section Section 324 (attempted murder) of the PPC.
Additionally, the accused were sentenced to four years in prison and fined Rs40,000 for burning a motorcycle under Section 426 (punishment for mischief); and a separate sentence of four years in prison and a fine of Rs40,000 under Section 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) for vandalising a police station.
A sentence of three-month imprisonment was imposed for interfering in the work of the police under Section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), one month for violating Section 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon), and two years for committing a crime in a group under Section 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of common object).
Prosecutor Raja Naveed conducted the testimony and cross-examination against the accused.
In December 2024, military courts had sentenced 85 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement in violent attacks on military installations during the riots on May 9.
The military’s media wing said in a statement that the trials of those accused of the May 9 riots under military custody had been “concluded under the relevant laws”, and the “convicts retained the right to appeal and other legal recourses, as guaranteed by the Constitution and law”.
Imran’s nephew Hassan Khan Niazi, who was handed into military custody in August 2023, was among the two people sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.
The military’s press wing later announced that 19 civilians convicted for their involvement in the riots were granted pardon. It said the mercy petitions of 19 convicts were accepted on “humanitarian grounds”.</p><small>2025-05-30 16:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/302101104ffcca5.jpg?r=210202' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914319/flood-death-toll-rises-to-117-in-nigerias-niger-state-emergency-official' target='_blank'><strong>Flood death toll rises to 117 in Nigeria’s Niger state: emergency official</strong></a><br><p>At least 117 people have died and several others are still missing after heavy flooding destroyed thousands of homes in Nigeria’s Niger state, an emergency official said on Friday.
The death toll is a sharp rise from Thursday’s figure of 21 people, Ibrahim Hussaini, head of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, said, adding that some 3,000 houses were submerged in two communities in the north-central state.
Nigeria is prone to flooding during the rainy season, which began in April.
 
 

In 2022, Nigeria experienced its worst wave of floods in more than a decade which killed more than 600 people, displaced around 1.4 million and destroyed 440,000 hectares of farmland.
The flooding incident in Niger state occurred on Wednesday night and continued into Thursday morning, Hussaini said, with a number of people still in the water.</p><small>2025-05-30 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/301953143830f38.jpg?r=203906' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914305/human-rights-defenders-tahira-abdullah-samina-omar-released-after-brief-detention-in-islamabad-hrcp' target='_blank'><strong>Human rights defenders Tahira Abdullah, Samina Omar released after brief detention in Islamabad: HRCP</strong></a><br><p>Human rights defenders Tahira Abdullah and Samina Omar were released following a short detention in Islamabad on Friday, a Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) activist told Dawn.com.
The HRCP earlier condemned the “arbitrary arrest of human rights defenders Tahira Abdullah and Samina Omar in Islamabad” in a post on X. According to the post, the pair was taken into custody outside the National Press Club ahead of a protest in solidarity with the people of Gaza.
“Given that neither of them was part of any public gathering at the time, their actions in no way constitute a violation of Section 144 as the police have alleged,” the statement said.
 






Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
The statement said the commission was “concerned to learn that [the women] are allegedly not being given access to their legal counsel”.
“Both Ms Abdullah and Ms Omar must be released immediately and unconditionally,” HRCP said.
The protest was organised by former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan. Earlier today, he announced the call for protest in a post on X, stating, “This is an appeal for participation.”
Prior to their release, HRCP activist Tariq Mehmood Ghouri told Dawn.com that Abdullah and Omar were being held in custody at the women’s police station in Sitara Market, Islamabad, along with two other female activists belonging to the JI.
“They have been charged under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant),” of the Pakistan Penal Code, he said, adding that one of the JI activists is Mushtaq’s daughter.

Tariq further said that seven men were also arrested and were being held at Kohsar police station.
Ex-senator Mustaq and other activists have been previously arrested as well for staging pro-Gaza protests in the federal capital for violating Section 144.
In September last year, police picked up Mushtaq, his wife and his son along with over two dozen protestors, during a march organised to express solidarity with the people of Gaza.  The ex-senator had called for the rally and asked the people to gather at Express Chowk, one of the entry points of the high-security Red Zone from the D-Chowk side.
In March 2024, the capital police had booked the former senator and 350 others on several charges, including pelting the law enforcers with stones and threatening them with dire consequences, after they organised a protest at Express Chowk in connection with Palestine.</p><small>2025-05-30 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/30191310691a4a6.jpg?r=201252' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914300/pakistani-diplomat-in-afghanistan-granted-rank-of-ambassador-amid-improving-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani diplomat in Afghanistan granted rank of ambassador amid ‘improving ties’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Friday announced its elevation of diplomatic representation in Afghanistan from Charge d’Affaires to Ambassador level as bilateral ties “move on a positive trajectory.”
Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to upgrade their diplomatic relations by exchanging envoys — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.
Ties between the two neighbouring countries had turned sour due to frequent border skirmishes and Islamabad repeatedly demanding that Kabul take action against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan. Kabul has denied the allegations.
The recent understanding was reached during an informal trilateral meeting of foreign ministers from Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan in Beijing earlier this month. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in the Chinese capital.
In a post on X, Dar said, “Pakistan-Afghanistan relations are on positive trajectory after my very productive visit to Kabul with Pakistan delegation on 19th April 2025.
“To maintain this momentum, I am pleased to announce the decision of the Government of Pakistan to upgrade the level of its Chargé d’Affaires in Kabul to the level of Ambassador.
“I am confident this step would further contribute towards enhanced engagement, deepen Pak-Afghan cooperation in economic, security, [counterterrorism] and trade areas and promote further exchanges between two fraternal countries.”
 






Although no country has formally recognised the Taliban regime since its return to power in 2021, several including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia maintain ambassadors in Kabul.  China and the UAE also host Taliban-appointed ambassadors, while Russia has agreed to accept a Taliban ambassador in Moscow.
Recent diplomatic efforts have aimed to turn the tide. In March 2025, Special Envoy for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq visited Kabul for the first time in over a year. His mission was followed by a high-level visit by Dar on April 19, where both sides pledged to prevent their territories from being used for terrorist activities and agreed on trade facilitation measures.</p><small>2025-05-30 15:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/301934098c538a2.jpg?r=194231' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914313/egypt-denies-court-ruling-threatens-historic-monastery' target='_blank'><strong>Egypt denies court ruling threatens historic monastery</strong></a><br><p>Egypt and Greece sought to ease tensions over the historic St Catherine’s monastery in the Sinai peninsula on Friday after a controversial court ruling said it sat on state-owned land.
Cairo has denied that the ruling threatens the UNESCO World Heritage landmark after Greek and church authorities warned of the sacred site’s status.
St Catherine’s monastery was established in the sixth century at the biblical site of the burning bush in the southern mountains of the Sinai peninsula and is the world’s oldest continually inhabited Christian monastery.
A court in Sinai ruled on Wednesday in a land dispute between the monastery and the South Sinai governorate that the monastery “is entitled to use” the land, which “the state owns as public property”.
But on Friday, in a phone call with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said Cairo was “fully committed to preserving the unique and sacred religious status of Saint Catherine’s monastery, and ensuring it is not violated”.
The Greek premier’s office said Mitsotakis emphasised the importance of “preserving the pilgrimage and Greek Orthodox character of the monastery and resolving the issue in an institutional manner”, based on an agreement between the two countries.
A Greek delegation is due to visit Egypt next week, the government in Athens said.
Sisi’s office has defended the court ruling, saying that it “consolidates” the site’s sacred status, after the head of the Greek Orthodox church in Greece denounced it.
Archbishop Ieronymos of Athens called the court ruling “scandalous” and an infringement by Egyptian judicial authoriities of religious freedoms.
He said the decision means “the oldest Orthodox Christian monument in the world, the Holy Monastery of Saint Catherine in Mount Sinai, now enters a period of severe trial – one that evokes much darker times in history”.
The Saint Catherine area, which includes the eponymous town and a nature reserve, is undergoing mass development under a controversial government megaproject aimed at bringing in mass tourism.
Observers say the project has harmed the reserve’s ecosystem and threatened both the monastery and the local community.
Archbishop Ieronymos warned that the monastery’s property would now be “seized and confiscated”, despite “recent pledges to the contrary by the Egyptian President to the Greek Prime Minister”.
Greek Foreign Minister Giorgos Gerapetritis contacted his Egyptian counterpart Badr Abdelatty on Thursday, saying “there was no room for deviation from the agreements between the two parties”, the ministry’s spokesperson said.
In a statement to Egypt’s state news agency, the foreign ministry in Cairo later said rumours of confiscation were “unfounded”, and that the ruling “does not infringe at all” on the monastery’s sites or its religious and spiritual significance.
Greek government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said, “Greece will express its official position … when the official and complete content of the court decision is known and evaluated”.
He confirmed both countries’ commitment to “maintaining the Greek Orthodox religious character of the monastery”.</p><small>2025-05-30 15:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606962-reserved-seats-ecp-says-relief-granted-to-pti-in-july-12-verdict-unconstitutional' target='_blank'><strong>‘Reserved seats': ECP says relief granted to PTI in July 12 verdict ‘unconstitutional'</strong></a><br><p>

Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
According to a press release from the Saudi Embassy, the newly expanded Grand Mosque in Makkah “marks a defining feature of this year’s Haj”, as it is now capable of accommodating double its previous capacity.
“Following months of cross-sector coordination and international cooperation, the kingdom reaffirms its commitment to ensuring that every pilgrim’s journey is not only safe and seamless but also spiritually enriching,” the press release read.
Quoting Dr Ghassan Alnwaimi, the official spokesperson for the Ministry of Haj and Umrah, the press release added, “Our readiness is not just measured in infrastructure and systems — it’s reflected in our care for every individual who arrives in search of spiritual fulfilment.
“Haj is a journey of faith, and we are honoured to support each pilgrim with dignity and devotion,” he added.
In addition to expanding the Grand Mosque, the kingdom has also rolled out the Nusuk application to provide “real-time maps, crowd-aware navigation, emergency alerts, AI-powered voice translation in over 100 languages, and even hydration reminders”.
Additionally, the Makkah Route enabled pilgrims to complete visas, customs and health procedures from their country of origin. Over 250,000 pilgrims made use of the service, according to the press release.  The Makkah Route initiative was also launched in Pakistan in 2019, providing exemption to Haj pilgrims from the immigration process at Saudi airports by clearing them at their respective airports in Pakistan by Saudi immigration officials before boarding their flights.
The press release further added that over 50 Islamic landmarks between Makkah and Madina have been preserved and reopened “to deepen the pilgrims’ connection with their faith and history”, the press release added.
“More than 37,000 field inspections were carried out to verify the readiness of critical services such as electricity, water, transportation, and emergency response, providing pilgrims with the safety and peace of mind they deserve.”
The kingdom is also maintaining its ‘No Permit, No Haj’ policy, to maintain security and regulate authorised pilgrims, while preserving “the sanctity and order of the pilgrimage”.
“As Haj 2025 begins, Saudi Arabia reaffirms its unwavering commitment as Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques — to serve, to protect, and to elevate the pilgrimage experience for every soul who undertakes this sacred journey,” the statement concluded.</p><small>2025-05-30 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/30171817fa4f929.jpg?r=172007' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914297/two-children-found-dead-after-going-missing-in-punjabs-hafizabad-police-report' target='_blank'><strong>Two children found dead after going missing in Punjab’s Hafizabad: police report</strong></a><br><p>Two seven-year-old boys were found dead in a house in Punjab’s Hafizabad several days after they were reported missing, according to a first information report (FIR).
According to a copy of the FIR — seen by Dawn.com and filed upon the complaint of the father of one of the victims — the complainant was heading for work at 7am on Wednesday morning when he learned that his son had gone missing.
“When I returned from work at 9 or 10pm, I could not find my son,” the complainant stated in the FIR. “We went to the house of a neighbour and found my son’s shoe there.”
According to the FIR, when asked about the missing boy, the neighbour said that his grandson had also gone missing. The complainant added that he and other residents searched for the children and performed announcements through mosques, to no avail.
On Thursday morning, the complainant was informed that the boys had been seen with three named and two unidentified suspects.
“We arrived at a house where the suspects were present. When we asked them to open the door, they scattered,” the complainant stated.
Upon entering the house, the complainant noted that there was a foul odour inside, and found the bodies of the two boys in a metal box. “Their bodies bore marks of violence,” the complainant stated.
The incident was reported to police, who registered the FIR under Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (punishment for murder) and 356 (assault or criminal force in attempt to commit theft of property carried by a person) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Meanwhile, the medical superintendent at District Headquarters Hospital Hafizabad, Dr Rizwan, told Dawn.com that the boys’ bodies bore signs of both physical violence and sexual abuse.
“The initial postmortem report showed clear signs of violence on the children’s bodies and evidence of abuse on their delicate organs,” Dr Rizwan said.
He also said that samples had been collected for forensic analysis and the full report detailing the cause of death would be submitted tomorrow.
According to the NGO Sahil, as many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country. It showed that nine children were abused per day during the year, while a gender-divide analysis indicated that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.</p><small>2025-05-30 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/301726055feba43.jpg?r=172625' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914289/cerp-princeton-researchers-initiate-project-to-develop-long-term-energy-transition' target='_blank'><strong>CERP, Princeton researchers initiate project to develop long-term energy transition</strong></a><br><p>The Centre for Economic Research in Pakistan (CERP) and Princeton University researchers have initiated a project to develop a long-term energy transition planning framework, according to a press release issued on Friday.
The press release said that the initiative comes at a time when Pakistan’s energy sector faced high costs, volatility, and an overreliance on imported fossil fuels, which accounted for nearly 60 per cent of the country’s energy supply.
“Outdated infrastructure, inefficient management, and transmission bottlenecks have contributed to persistent power shortages and a growing circular debt crisis, issues that the roadmap aims to address while planning for future growth, sustainability, and climate resilience,” the press release said.
Part of a two-day workshop, the event “Pakistan’s Energy Transition Roadmap” brought together over 50 policymakers, researchers, and private-sector experts.
“Drawing on Princeton’s net-zero project expertise, the initiative would provide Pakistan with practical, evidence-based guidance on how to equitably move from reliance on expensive, imported fossil fuels to cleaner, more affordable energy sources aligned with economic growth and development goals,” it said.
“The Energy and Petroleum Division are working separately, but for the plan to be truly effective, it needs to be built on real, credible data … I believe we need to formalise this relationship with CERP to help us plan better and gain valuable insights from their experts,” Federal Minister for Energy Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari said according to the press release.
“CERP is uniquely positioned to advise us and help us identify the issues they have expertise in,” Leghari said while speaking at the event.
National Disaster Risk Management Fund  Chief Executive Officer Bilal Anwar said that climate risks and natural disasters made planning more urgent than ever to avoid future social and economic costs.
CERP CEO and President Maroof A Syed said that project project wasn’t about imposing ideas, rather it was about co-creating a roadmap that respected Pakistan’s “unique challenges while exploring practical opportunities for cleaner, more affordable energy”.
“At CERP, we ensure that every step we take is rooted in rigorous evidence so that solutions are grounded in real data and tailored to Pakistan’s specific needs,” Syed was quoted as saying.
Senior Research Scientist at Princeton’s Andlinger Centre for Energy and Environment, Dr Chris Greig, said discussions with participants, sector specialists, policymakers and other stakeholders were valuable in helping them understand the real challenges and the urgency of finding context-specific solutions that work for the country’s economy and people.
“They also help us think about development-compatible pathways to Pakistan’s sustainable energy future,” he said.
The press release said that the Julis-Rabinowitz Centre for Public Policy and Finance at Princeton SPIA has cosponsored the workshop series for the last three years.
Centre’s Associate Director Pallavi Nuka said, “Initially focused on capacity building, these workshops have directly contributed to catalysing significant thinking about Pakistan’s energy policies and fostered valuable collaborations.”
“Building on this foundation, this initiative will help policymakers understand the bigger picture when it comes to planning for Pakistan’s future energy needs,” Pallavi was quoted as saying.
“The roadmap project, now beginning its detailed work, will explore multiple, development-compatible pathways to meet Pakistan’s growing energy demand, reduce environmental and economic costs, and identify investment opportunities in renewables that support climate resilience,” the press release said.</p><small>2025-05-30 13:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/301801467892f5e.jpg?r=180421' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914302/uk-man-in-court-after-liverpool-parade-crash' target='_blank'><strong>UK man in court after Liverpool parade crash</strong></a><br><p>A former British Marine appeared in court for the first time on Friday charged with allegedly driving his car into crowds celebrating Liverpool’s Premier League win, leaving 79 people injured.

The 53-year-old confirmed his name, date of birth and address during a brief appearance at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court.
UK media outlets inside the courtroom reported that Doyle — wearing a black suit, white shirt and grey tie — held back tears before the hearing broke for an adjournment.
A total of 79 people aged between nine and 78 were injured when a dark Ford Galaxy ploughed into Liverpool supporters as they celebrated their club’s record-equalling 20th English top-flight title.
There were no fatalities.
Seven people remained in hospital, Merseyside Police assistant chief constable Jenny Sims told reporters on Thursday.
Sarah Hammond of the Crown Prosecution Service said the agency had authorised police to charge Doyle following a “complex and ongoing investigation”.
“Prosecutors and police are continuing to work at pace to review a huge volume of evidence,” she said. “This includes multiple pieces of video footage and numerous witness statements. It is important to ensure every victim gets the justice they deserve.”
UK media have reported Doyle, who lives in a suburb of Liverpool, is a businessman and former marine, with three teenage children.
Hammond said all charges “will be kept under review as the investigation progresses”.
Hundreds of thousands of Reds fans had gathered in Liverpool city centre for the long parade led by the club’s top players when scenes of joy turned to horror.
Images on social media showed the car ploughing through a crowd, running over people and others bouncing off its bonnet. Four people, including one child, were trapped under the vehicle, which had to be lifted to remove them, fire services said.
 


In other clips circulating online, the car was seen being halted and swarmed by angry fans, who smashed the back windows as police sought to hold them back.
Police quickly ruled out terrorism, as well as swiftly revealing the suspect was a white British man, in a rare move to quell misinformation online.
Almost a year ago, Liverpool and north England saw the worst riots in decades after false rumours spread that the attacker who stabbed three girls to death in nearby Southport was a Muslim immigrant.</p><small>2025-05-30 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606950-pakistan-to-upgrade-diplomatic-ties-with-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to upgrade diplomatic ties with Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>

The PCC  was officially launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
According to a press release by the finance ministry, the meeting will be chaired by the Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, serving as a “strategic forum to deliberate on the evolving regulatory and legal framework surrounding digital currency and the broader crypto landscape in Pakistan”.
PCC Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib will also participate in the meeting, along with other PCC members, the press release said.
It also said, “Key items on the agenda include the development of a robust regulatory framework to govern digital and virtual assets in Pakistan, in alignment with global standards and technological advancements.
“A focal point of discussion will be the groundwork for the establishment of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) — a proposed autonomous body to oversee the digital finance and crypto ecosystem in the country.”
 
 

The finance ministry said the PCC aims to establish a “secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment”, to promote “responsible adoption of blockchain technology, protecting investors, and enhancing financial inclusion”.
“The upcoming meeting underscores the government’s commitment to shaping a future-ready financial infrastructure while ensuring stability and compliance in the emerging digital economy,” it added.
A day earlier, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance held a meeting, where PPP MNA Sharmila Farooqi introduced a bill on digital currency regulations. Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said that the ban on cryptocurrency was still in place across Pakistan, stressing the need for its regulation during the meeting.
The same day, Saqib had unveiled the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. In his keynote speech, he announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance”.
Cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum globally as the number of use cases is increasing and many countries are now making them legal. However, it has had a mixed reception by regulators globally.
In some countries, like El Salvador, it has legal tender status, while in others, including Pakistan, India and China, it is not accepted as payment for goods and services, nor can one own it legally, though it is not officially banned either.</p><small>2025-05-30 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/3015522157b9033.png?r=155445' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914287/pakistan-india-close-to-completing-border-troop-reduction-cjcsc-gen-mirza' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India close to completing border troop reduction: CJCSC Gen Mirza</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and India are close to reducing the troop build-up along their border to levels before conflict erupted between the nuclear-armed neighbours this month, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee told Reuters on Friday, although he warned the crisis had increased the risk of escalation in the future.
The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad retaliated by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Gen Mirza said the two militaries had started the process of drawing down troop levels.
“We have almost come back to the pre-22nd April situation… we are approaching that, or we must have approached that by now,” said Mirza, the most senior Pakistani military official to speak publicly since the conflict.

India’s ministry of defence and the office of the Indian chief of defence staff did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment on the remarks by Mirza.
Mirza, who is in Singapore to attend the Shangri-La Dialogue forum, said while there was no move towards nuclear weapons during this conflict, it was a dangerous situation.
“Nothing happened this time,” he said. “But you can’t rule out any strategic miscalculation at any time, because when the crisis is on, the responses are different.”
He also said the risk of escalation in the future had increased since the fighting this time was not limited to the Indian-occupied Kashmir.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned Pakistan this month that New Delhi would target “terrorist hideouts” across the border again if there were new attacks on India.
“This (conflict) lowers the threshold between two countries who are contiguous nuclear powers…in the future, it will not be restricted to the disputed territory. It would come down to (the) whole of India and (the) whole of Pakistan,” Mirza said. “This is a very dangerous trend.”
Mirza warned that international mediation might be difficult in the future because of a lack of crisis management mechanisms between the countries.
“The time window for the international community to intervene would now be very less, and I would say that damage and destruction may take place even before that time window is exploited by the international community,” he said.
Pakistan was open to dialogue, he added, but beyond a crisis hotline between the directors general of military operations and some hotlines at the tactical level on the border, there was no other communication between the two countries.
India’s foreign ministry spokesperson said on Thursday “Talks and terror don’t go together” in response to a question on the possibility of dialogue with Pakistan.
Mirza said there were no backchannel discussions, or informal talks, to ease tensions. He also said he had no plans to meet General Anil Chauhan, India’s chief of defence staff, who is also in Singapore for the Shangri-La forum.
“These issues can only be resolved by dialogue and consultations, on the table. They cannot be resolved on the battlefield,” Mirza said.
India threatens to use navy against Pakistan in future
India will use the firepower of its “navy in response to any future aggression by Pakistan,” India’s defence minister said on Friday.
“If Pakistan resorts to anything evil or unethical, it will, this time, face the firepower and ire of the Indian Navy,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant off the coast of the western Indian state of Goa.
A spokesperson for Pakistan’s military referred Reuters to a May 12 statement, which said there would be a “comprehensive and decisive” response whenever Pakistan’s sovereignty was “threatened and territorial integrity violated”.
Singh said ‘Operation Sindoor’, under which India launched the strikes on Pakistan, was paused, but not yet over.
“We stopped our military actions on our own terms. Our forces had not even started showing their might,” he said.

Delhi suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, shortly after 26 civilians in India-held Kashmir were killed in what India called an act of terror.
Pakistan has denied involvement in the incident, but accord remains “in abeyance” by India despite the two nuclear-armed neighbours agreeing to a ceasefire this month following the worst fighting between them in decades.
 
 

After the April 22 attack, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered officials to expedite planning and execution of projects on the Chenab, Jhelum and Indus rivers, three bodies of water in the Indus system that are designated primarily for Pakistan’s use, six people told Reuters.
The three-day International Conference on Glaciers’ Preservation is being held in Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe from May 29-31.
It is being attended by over 2,500 delegates from 80 UN member states and 70 international organisations, including prime ministers, vice presidents, ministers, and UN assistant secretaries-general.
The event is being hosted by the Tajikistan government in collaboration with the United Nations, UNESCO, WMO, the Asian Development Bank, and other key partners as a historic moment for climate ambition, glacier preservation, and international cooperation.
“India’s unilateral and illegal decision to hold in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty, which governs the sharing of the Indus Basin’s water, is deeply regrettable,” PM Shehbaz said while addressing the conference.
“Millions of lives must not be held hostage to narrow political gains, and Pakistan will not allow this. We will never allow the red line to be crossed,” he said.
During his address, PM Shehbaz touched upon all relevant issues, including glacial preservation, Pakistan’s climate vulnerability, the 2022 floods in Pakistan, global climate action and responsibility, scientific projections on glacial melt, weaponisation of water and call to protect nature and humanity’s shared destiny.
“The world today bears fresh scars from the use of conventional weapons in Gaza that have left deep wounds. As if that were not enough, we are now witnessing an alarming new low—the weaponisation of water,” PM Shehbaz observed.
He added that Pakistan, being home to over 13,000 glaciers, was the most concerning as glaciers contributed nearly half of the annual flows in the Indus river system — “the lifeline of our civilisation, culture and economy”.
 






“The five great rivers that shape our geographical landscape—Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej—all depend on the stability of glacial systems. This makes Pakistan one of the most vulnerable countries to any climatic changes that impact glaciers,” he continued.
He told the gathering that Pakistan had faced the peril of glacial melt in the form of devastating floods in 2022 that destroyed millions of acres of standing crops, thousands of houses as well as infrastructure — despite the country contributing only less than half a per cent of the total world’s emissions and yet being one of the 10 most vulnerable countries.
He prayed that no other country faced such devastation, which necessitated a comprehensive plan and immediate implementation.
Referring to the “sobering” scientific projections, he highlighted that glacial melt in the country’s region was expected to accelerate flooding in the coming decades, followed by a drastic decline in river flows as glaciers recede further.
“These changes threaten our fragile ecosystem. As we inch closer to these grim new realities, we must heed the alarm bells, deflection signs of haunting consequences—lost livelihoods, displaced families, and deep chaos,” he warned.
Highlighting Pakistan’s commitment to shared responsibility and collective action, he called for enhanced global climate action to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.
“The developed countries must meet their climate financial commitments without any delay and with a balanced focus on adaptation and mitigation as well as loss and damage.
“Adequate funding for climate resilience, infrastructure, and overcoming financing gaps remains critical for climate-vulnerable countries,” the prime minister emphasised.
“Investment must be made in early warning systems and disaster preparedness and management.”
PM Shehbaz reflected on his childhood memories of swimming in the Ravi river, underscoring how rivers like Ravi and Tajikistan’s Vakhsh river, fed by glaciers, sustained life across regions, and that the shared water sources symbolised a common ecological destiny, requiring collective efforts for their preservation.
“Let us protect and preserve nature’s precious bounties for our planet and our peoples,” he urged.
The prime minister is currently returning to Pakistan after capping off his four-nation tour of friendly countries, state-run PTV News reported.
 






Earlier this week, the PM and his delegation, including Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, visited Turkiye, Iran and Azerbaijan, expressing gratitude for their support during a recent military escalation with India.
On Wednesday, the PM took part in a trilateral summit with Turkiye and Azerbaijan. He reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to hold talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism, stressing New Delhi wanted the same “in all sincerity”.</p><small>2025-05-30 12:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/30132420f4caaef.jpg?r=134326' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914277/pakistan-becomes-co-signatory-to-chinas-global-mediation-body' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan becomes co-signatory to China’s global mediation body</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan became a co-signatory to China’s newly set up Hong Kong-based International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) on Friday, a statement by the Foreign Office said.
China signed a convention setting up an international organisation for mediation in Hong Kong that Beijing hopes will be on par with the International Court of Justice and bolster the city’s international credentials, Reuters reported.
Pakistan, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia and Serbia were among the countries attending the signing ceremony, while representatives from 20 international bodies, including the United Nations, were also expected to join, public broadcaster RTHK said.
 






“Deputy Prime Minister [and] Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, today signed, on behalf of Pakistan, the convention on the establishment of the International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong,” the statement by the FO read.
Speaking on the occasion, Dar appreciated the Chinese leadership for its wisdom in developing and consistently leading efforts in establishing the IOMed and fostering a global community with a shared future, the statement added.
He added that the creation of IOMed underscores the indispensability and significance of multilateralism as the centrepiece for international peace, stability, and development.
“IOMeD also offers new opportunities and fresh hopes to build a more inclusive, more just and more equitable world. As one of the founding members of IOMed, Pakistan would continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,” the statement quoted him as saying.
The deputy PM underlined Pakistan’s strong commitment to the promotion of peace and security as well as development. He elaborated on the critical importance of advancing and preserving multilateralism through faithful adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions, as well as international law.
He also drew attention to India’s violation of international law through its acts of aggression against Pakistan and its unlawful holding in abeyance of the Indus Waters Treaty. He also highlighted the occupation of Jammu and Kashmir and the occupied Palestinian Territories as drivers of conflict to regional peace and security.
Dar called for the resolution of the longstanding Jammu and Kashmir dispute under the UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.
The idea for the establishment of the IOMed was one of the key outcomes of the 2nd Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing in April 2019. China initiated discussions for the establishment of IOMed in 2021, and invited Pakistan to join negotiations as one of its founding members, the statement added.
The organisation is open to all countries; is based on respect for the sovereignty, core interests and legitimate concerns of every country; aims to promote dialogue and trust between parties concerned based on equality; and desires inclusion of various legal systems, and their mediators, the FO said.
FM Dar visits Hong Kong’s chief executive
Separately, FM Dar, in a meeting with the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, John Lee, congratulated him on the establishment of IOMed, according to a separate statement by FO.
Noting Hong Kong’s growing significance in international mediation efforts, FM Dar highlighted the region’s role as a “global hub, linking east and west”.
The pair discussed measures to “deepen economic investment and trade cooperation” between Pakistan and the administrative region of Hong Kong.
“Hailing the launch of IOMed as a milestone inspired by President Xi Jinping’s vision, the DPM/FM noted its alignment with Pakistan’s commitment to dialogue-driven diplomacy and UN Charter’s principles,” the statement read.
The foreign minister acknowledged the chief executive and SAR government for their “impressive economic and social development strides under the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ framework” while recalling Pakistan and Hong Kong’s “long-standing friendship.”
FM Dar also commended the Pakistani community in Hong Kong for strengthening bilateral ties and contributing to the city’s diversity and economy.
He also took to X to announce the meeting, describing it as “cordial and productive”.
 






Welcoming FM Dar’s visit, the chief executive expressed eagerness to enhance collaboration between Hong Kong and Pakistan further.
Says IOMed reafirms international peace, stability, development
Separately, Dar, while speaking at a ceremony in Hong Kong, said the creation of IOMed reaffirmed Pakistan and China’s shared a view of multilateralism that is the centerpiece of international peace, stability and development.
He said that IOMed offered “new opportunities and fresh hopes to build a more inclusive, more just and more equitable world”.
“Pakistan will continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,” Dar said.
He said that Pakistan would bring IOMed “not just a rich diplomatic experience, but also unflinching commitment to dialog, justice and fair play, excellencies”.
“Let me commit to empower this organisation, allowing it to fulfill its potential in the service of these equity and justice I thank you all,” he said.</p><small>2025-05-30 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606931-pti-leaders-workers-sentenced-in-may-9-police-station-attack-case' target='_blank'><strong>PTI leaders, workers sentenced in May 9 police station attack case</strong></a><br><p>

The country’s once-thriving wetlands, long a sanctuary for millions of migratory birds fleeing Siberia’s brutal winters, are witnessing a disturbing decline in avian visitors.
Experts warn that a mix of prolonged drought, receding water levels, and growing habitat degradation is driving away these seasonal guests — some possibly for good.
According to the Sindh Wildlife Department’s 2024-25 waterfowl count, the number of migratory birds fell sharply from 1.2 million in 2023 to 603,900 in 2024 and just 545,000 this year, a staggering drop of over 50pc in two years.
In 2023, the region experienced an exceptional influx of birds, buoyed by the lingering effects of the catastrophic 2022 floods that, while devastating for communities, temporarily revived Pakistan’s lakes, streams, and lagoons.
The excessive rainfall had replenished many wetlands, making them ideal resting spots for birds making the 4,500-kilometre journey from Siberia to India via the Indus flyway, with stopovers at various lakes and water reservoirs in Pakistan.
However, this year tells a different story.
“Sindh has long been a refuge for migratory birds because of its unique biodiversity and its many lakes, lagoons and other waterways,” Mumtaz Soomro, an official from the Sindh Wildlife Department, told Anadolu Agency.
“But those numbers have seen a gradual decline since 2023 due to receding water levels and droughts.”
Soomro explained that the latest survey — covering 40pc of Sindh’s territory — found notable shortages at key bird habitats, including Manchar, Keenjhar, Hamal and Haleji lakes, Nareri lagoon, and the Rann of Kutch wildlife sanctuary.
These sites, some of which are Ramsar-certified wetlands of international importance, have been pivotal stopovers for migratory birds for decades.
According to Britannica, the Ramsar Convention is an intergovernmental treaty signed in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971 to guide national and international wetland-conservation measures.
“During the survey, our teams reported water shortages at most of the sites, including the marshy Rann of Kutch wildlife sanctuary,” he said.
Shadow of past flocks
The migration is seasonal, with birds arriving by late August and departing by February. Among the over 50 recorded species were gulls, mallards, plovers, snipes, cormorants, cranes, and storks.
The highest number of birds — 112,000 — was spotted at Nareri lagoon, followed by 91,000 at Rann of Kutch.
But even these numbers are a shadow of past flocks.
Zohaib Ahmed, a Karachi-based ornithologist, said climate change is not the only factor pushing migratory birds away from Pakistan, as man-made habitat degradation, pollution, and illegal hunting also play a significant role.
“Human-induced changes and rampant human interference, often in the name of development, has exposed these fragile ecosystems of wetlands to a string of threats,” Ahmed told Anadolu.
He emphasised that if the current trends of environmental neglect persist, Pakistan could lose its status as a preferred stopover for these avian travelers.
While the situation is particularly dire in Sindh, other provinces are also feeling the effects.
In Punjab, although the latest survey is still underway, officials estimate a similar downward trend.
“The decline is not sudden. It’s gradual, and the outcome of climate change, mainly water shortages, seasonal disturbances, and lingering heat spells,” said Mudasser Hasan, deputy chief at the Wildlife Rangers Punjab.
Hasan confirmed that the health of Pakistan’s wetlands has deteriorated in recent years, largely due to climate-related shifts.
“The arrival of these birds in Pakistan is a seasonal migration, and it has understandably been disturbed because of seasonal disturbances,” he noted.
Pakistan ranks among the top 10 countries globally most vulnerable to climate change, with experts warning that erratic monsoon patterns, glacial melt, and rising temperatures are placing unprecedented pressure on natural ecosystems, including those vital to bird migration.
Despite the alarming trends, some officials argue that threats like poaching and trapping have been brought under control.
“Hunters and poachers are there but they do not pose a major threat to migratory birds. It’s climate change that really haunts them,” said Hasan, adding that provincial authorities have tightened anti-wildlife hunting laws in recent years.
But not everyone agrees.
Ahmed, the ornithologist, contests this assessment, particularly in Sindh: “At least for Sindh, I can say with surety that there is no drop in hunting and trapping of migratory birds, especially in the Kirthar mountain range and Karachi’s coastal belt.”
He added that several migratory species are still being openly sold at illegal bird markets, undermining conservation efforts and contributing further to the birds’ decline.</p><small>2025-05-30 10:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606921-indias-strategic-miscalculation-cannot-be-ruled-out-says-cjcsc-gen-mirza' target='_blank'><strong>India's 'strategic miscalculation' cannot be ruled out, says CJCSC Gen Mirza</strong></a><br><p>

“Zaman found his range at the front and back of the court early in the fixture and looked focused as he took a commanding 2-0 lead,” according to a press release by the British Open.
“The Egyptian responded by taking the third game 11-3, firing the ball in short and capitalising on Zaman errors. In a competitive fourth, there was noting to separate the two as the score reached 5-5, Zaman established a two-point lead to pull ahead and secured the game 11-7 to win in 46 minutes.”
The main draw begins on May 31, and Zaman will face England’s Curtis Malik on June 1. The other men to qualify during Thursday’s matches were Emyr Evans of Wales, Moustafa Elsirty of Egypt, and South Africa’s Dewald van Niekerk.
The Diamond level event carries a prize draw of $348,500	each for the men and women’s categories.
As of May 1, Zaman is ranked number three in Pakistan in the men’s senior rankings.</p><small>2025-05-30 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/301313513891254.png?r=131408' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914278/half-the-world-faced-an-extra-month-of-extreme-heat-due-to-climate-change-study' target='_blank'><strong>Half the world faced an extra month of extreme heat due to climate change: study</strong></a><br><p>Half the global population endured an additional month of extreme heat over the past year because of manmade climate change, a new study found on Friday.
The findings underscore how the continued burning of fossil fuels is harming health and well-being on every continent, with the effects especially under-recognised in developing countries, the authors said.
“With every barrel of oil burned, every tonne of carbon dioxide released, and every fraction of a degree of warming, heat waves will affect more people,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and co-author of the report.
The analysis — conducted by scientists at World Weather Attribution, Climate Central, and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre — was released ahead of global Heat Action Day on June 2, which this year spotlights the dangers of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
To assess the influence of global warming, researchers analysed the period from May 1, 2024 to May 1, 2025.
They defined “extreme heat days” as those hotter than 90 per cent of temperatures recorded at a given location between 1991 and 2020.
 
 

Using a peer-reviewed modelling approach, they then compared the number of such days to a simulated world without human-caused warming.
The results were stark: roughly four billion people — 49pc of the global population — experienced at least 30 more days of extreme heat than they would have otherwise.
The team identified 67 extreme heat events during the year and found the fingerprint of climate change on all of them.
The Caribbean island of Aruba was the worst affected, recording 187 extreme heat days — 45 more than expected in a world without climate change.
 
 

The study follows a year of unprecedented global temperatures. 2024 was the hottest year on record, surpassing 2023, while January 2025 marked the hottest January ever.
On a five-year average, global temperatures are now 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — and in 2024 alone, they exceeded 1.5C, the symbolic ceiling set by the Paris climate accord.
The report also highlights a critical lack of data on heat-related health impacts in lower-income regions.
While Europe recorded more than 61,000 heat-related deaths in the summer of 2022, comparable figures are sparse elsewhere, with many heat-related fatalities misattributed to underlying conditions such as heart or lung disease.
The authors emphasised the need for early warning systems, public education, and heat action plans tailored to cities.
Better building design — including shading and ventilation — and behavioural adjustments like avoiding strenuous activity during peak heat are also essential.
Still, adaptation alone will not be enough. The only way to halt the rising severity and frequency of extreme heat, the authors warned, is to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.</p><small>2025-05-30 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606898-pakistan-braces-for-more-rainfall-flood-risks-amid-heatwave-conditions' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan braces for more rainfall, flood risks amid heatwave conditions</strong></a><br><p>
