Pakistan have only one point from two Super Eight matches so now must win their final game and rely on other results going their way to have any hope of reaching the semi-finals.
“We know our fate is not in our hands,” he admitted, “But we need to beat Sri Lanka in our last match on Saturday and then hope other results go our way.”
“It’s not ideal, but it’s like this,” Shaheen said during a press conference after the match.

 

He also hailed Harry Brook’s century in the match against England as a “world-class knock”.
Brook reached his maiden T20 International hundred off 50 balls, with four sixes and 10 fours, as England went past their 165-run target with five balls to spare to win by two wickets.
Afridi jolted the England top order with a burst of three wickets before Brook played the ultimate captain’s innings to steer his side home.
“In my opinion this will be the best innings of his life,” Afridi told reporters. “It wasn’t an easy pitch to bat on but he took the game away from us.”
Promoted to number three after a morning conversation with England coach Brendon McCullum, Brook walked in after Afridi dismissed Phil Salt off the first ball of the innings.
Afridi then removed Jos Buttler and Jacob Bethell to leave England wobbling at 35-3 in the power play.
Brook stood firm, adding 45 for the fifth wicket with Sam Curran and 52 with Will Jacks for the sixth.
His century was the second fastest in T20 World Cup history, and the first ever by a team’s captain.
Only West Indies great Chris Gayle, against England in the 2016 T20 World Cup, reached three figures quicker. He took just 47 balls.
Afridi was clobbered for a six and a four as Brook raced through the “nervous nineties” in two balls, going from 90 to 100 before raising his bat.
The tall paceman bowled Brook with a yorker next ball, but did not celebrate wildly – instead he immediately went to congratulate the England captain in a superb show of cricket sportmanship.
“Brook played proper cricketing shots and he desreved a handshake, so I went to him and shook his hand in appreciation,” said Afridi.</p><small>2026-02-24 19:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699d0b4dd4e7e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975365/eye-for-an-eye' target='_blank'><strong>Eye for an eye</strong></a><br><p>EVERY body part is important, but few are as important as an eye. I use the singular for a body part that comes in pairs because its function is so crucial that one outweighs the combined functions of many others. Even diminished sight is so essential that ‘in the land of the blind, one-eyed man is king’ has become an idiom. Its vernacular version goes something like ‘andhon mein kana raja’ (‘among the blind, the one-eyed rules’).
In an old interview, one of Imran Khan’s sisters reminisced that even as a child he likened himself to a tiger. It’s a coincidence that a very charismatic Indian cricketer of the 1960s and 1970s, Nawab Mansoor Pataudi, was nicknamed Tiger Pataudi. He was a stylish right-handed batsman and considered the best fielder of his day, despite losing vision in his right eye in a traffic accident. He was named captain of the national team at the age of 21. Gen Amir Abdullah Niazi, who surrendered during the 1971 war, also styled himself as ‘Tiger Niazi’. Though his sight was not impaired, he was handicapped in vision and character.
Some physical features are stereotyped in history as characteristics; some archetypes are restricted to a geographical region, while others have universal appeal. For instance, what would a pirate be without an eyepatch? In modern times, the look became notorious when Israeli Gen Moshe Dayan wore an eyepatch. Salman Rushdie lost an eye to a knife attack and uses a dark lens on that side of his spectacles.
Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the famous Sikh ruler who extended Punjab’s borders to Kashmir and the Khyber Pass, did not cover his bad eye. In his early years, he may have been conscious of it, leading to his profile portraits which show only the good eye. Later in life, he wore his disability with aplomb and turned it to his advantage, asserting, “I look at all my subjects with one eye.”

Some physical features are stereotyped in history.

In the olden days, disabilities were described by their attributes, as in the Central Asian tyrant Temur’s name, ‘Lang’, which refers to the limp he walked with. In the Western canon, ‘lame’ became ‘lane’; Tamerlane is the distorted version of Temur-lang. It is another matter, though, that his brutal ways could have earned him the epitaph ‘Temur-out-of-lane’. There was a time when cinegoers were enticed by vernacular translations of English titles. A blockbuster martial arts movie One-Armed Boxer was translated as Tunda Badmash in Pakistan.
Etymology, an utterly fascinating field, does not always make it entirely clear how a particular word or term develops. For instance, in colloquial Urdu, making someone an accomplice to keep them in check is referred to as ‘kana karna’ (blinding someone in one eye). Another proverb in this vein is ‘kana mujhey bhai nahin; kaney bina suhaey nahin’. It roughly translates to ‘cannot live with them, and without them.’ Its applicability in the current political context cannot be denied.
In the game of thrones, especially in South Asia, succession politics included blinding the heir apparent or a pretender by gouging out their eyes. This barbaric practice of rendering the opponent unfit to rule in the rough-and-tumble of dynastic politics and the battlefield demands of physical fitness is generally thought to be a male preserve; however, mothers and even grandmothers are known to have resorted to this.
Allama Iqbal, in his poem ‘Ghulam Qadir Rohilla’, depicts the revenge the Afghan chieftain exacted against the Mughal king Shah Alam II — gouging out his eyes and ordering the women of the royal household to dance in court to entertain the victor. The Rohilla was captured from the battlefield as an eight-year-old boy when the uprising by his father Zabita Khan, an erstwhile army chief of Shah Alam, was crushed. The boy was raised in the royal household and was purportedly castrated. He was returned to his father as a youth after a patch-up with the Mughal ruler. After the elder Rohilla’s death, Ghulam Qadir attacked Delhi and exacted his revenge on the king. As he retreated, he was pursued and captured by the Maratha. Shah Alam II was restored to the throne. He demanded that the Maratha leader, Mahadaji Shinde, send him the Rohilla’s eyes, who obliged. The first line of Iqbal’s poem goes, ‘Rohilla kis qadar zalim, jafaju, keena parwar tha …’ (how brutal, unjust, and begrudging was the Rohilla…). One hopes that an eye-for-an-eye vendetta stops.
As for the pirates, they didn’t always wear an eyepatch because of injury; it gave them a tactical advantage in combat. The human eye takes time to adapt between bright light and pitch darkness. Moving between the mayhem on the upper and lower decks of ships, all they had to do was to switch the patch and strike.

Bhakkar District Police Officer (DPO) Shahzad Rafiq told Dawn that a suicide attack was carried out near the Dajil checkpost.
He said that two policemen were martyred and one was injured, while three passersby were also injured in the blast.
“The suicide attacker came near the check post and blew himself up, while we were conducting a search operation in the area to maintain law and order,” he added.
The deceased policemen were identified as Muhammad Faheem and Muhammad Shehbaz, and the injured as Arshad. The identities of the injured passersby have not yet been ascertained.
The injured were taken to the District Headquarters Hospital, DPO Rafiq said.
In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the terrorist attack. He expressed grief at the deaths of the officials and offered his condolences to the bereaved families.
He also prayed for the swift recovery of the police personnel injured in the attack.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed deep sorrow and grief over the martyrdom of police personnel in the attack, Radio Pakistan reported.
He said the sacrifices rendered by the police in the war against terrorism would not be allowed to go in vain, and reiterated the government’s resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz strongly condemned the attack on the police checkpost. In a statement, she paid tribute to the martyred policemen and saluted their sacrifice in the line of duty.
The chief minister expressed heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the bereaved families. She directed authorities to ensure the best possible medical treatment for the injured policeman and others wounded in the incident.
The development comes on the same day six law enforcement personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police, were martyred after a terrorist attack on a police vehicle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district.
It is worth mentioning that the Dajil checkpost is at the border of Dera Ismail Khan and Bhakkar.</p><small>2026-02-24 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24234433303b35d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975497/iran-fm-says-nuclear-deal-within-reach-ahead-of-us-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Iran FM says nuclear deal ‘within reach’ ahead of US talks</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday that a nuclear deal was “within reach”, ahead of talks with the United States scheduled for later this week.
“We have a historic opportunity to strike an unprecedented agreement that addresses mutual concerns and achieves mutual interests,” said Araghchi, in a post on the social media site X.







He added that a deal was “within reach, but only if diplomacy is given priority”.
The talks are set to take place on Thursday in Geneva, a senior US official said on Monday, with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner slated to meet with an Iranian delegation for the negotiations.
The two countries resumed negotiations earlier this month as the US builds up its military capability in the Middle East. Iran has threatened to strike US bases in the region if it is attacked.
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said on Tuesday Iran is ready to take any necessary steps to reach a deal with the US.
“We are ready to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We will do whatever it takes to make this happen. We will enter the negotiating room in Geneva with complete honesty and good faith,” Takht-Ravanchi said in comments carried by state media.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s first option was always diplomacy but that he was willing to use lethal force if necessary.
A senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday that Tehran would seriously consider a combination of sending half of its most highly enriched uranium abroad, diluting the rest and taking part in creating a regional enrichment consortium — an idea periodically raised during years of Iran-linked diplomacy.
Iran would do this in return for US recognition of Iran’s right to “peaceful nuclear enrichment” under a deal that would also include lifting economic sanctions, the official said.
“If there is an attack or aggression against Iran, we will respond according to our defence plans … A US attack on Iran is a real gamble,” Takht-Ravanchi added.
Indirect talks between the two sides last year brought no agreement, primarily due to friction over a US demand that Iran forgo uranium enrichment on its soil, which Washington views as a pathway to a nuclear bomb.
Iran has always denied seeking such weapons.
The US joined Israel in hitting Iranian nuclear sites last June, with Trump saying its key nuclear sites were “obliterated”.</p><small>2026-02-24 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/242311281b7cb46.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975399/pm-shehbaz-meets-qatars-emir-says-both-countries-to-work-together-for-regional-peace-and-stability' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz meets Qatar’s emir, says both countries to work together for regional peace and stability</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday met Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, saying that the two countries would continue to work together for peace and stability in the region and beyond.

It is worth mentioning that while the security detail from Peshawar was withdrawn, the ex-CM has a police detail from his native Dera Ismail Khan district. It was not immediately clear who ordered the withdrawal of the security from Peshawar, with incumbent chief minister Sohail Afridi’s press secretary denying that orders to this effect were issued.
According to the sources, a 16-member security squad assigned to Gandapur was recalled late last night. The contingent comprised two jammer operators, eight gunmen and six drivers, who had been working in shifts. All personnel belonged to the police department.
Of them, 14 officials had been deployed for Gandapur’s security, while two were assigned to his brother, MNA Faisal Amin Gandapur.
Sources close to the ex-chief minister said that one jammer and one pickup carrier had been returned to the provincial government. The sources said that Gandapur and his brother had personally spoken with the officer who had conveyed KP CM Afridi’s orders to confirm and authenticate the withdrawal of the police escort.
In a statement, Gandapur said that at 11pm last night, Afridi’s deputy chief security officer (CSO) called his security personnel, saying that it was the CSO’s order to withdraw the security.
“I had one jammer and one double-cabin vehicle provided by the provincial government,” he said, adding, “There were 14 personnel deployed with that vehicle.”
“When these personnel informed me, I told them to pack up everything. This is the actual truth,” he said. He stated that even if this security were now restored, he would not accept it.
“I want to tell the chief minister that there is no need to return this security to me now. I do not need it,” Gandapur said.
Gandapur’s spokesperson, Faraz Ahmed Mughal, insisted that the withdrawal was initiated on the instructions of KP CM Afridi. He said the Chief Minister’s Office contacted the security in-charge and directed that the detail be withdrawn, adding that Gandapur followed the directives within minutes.
Meanwhile, in a statement, the KP chief minister’s press secretary said that there was no truth in reports about Gandapur’s security detail being withdrawn by Afridi.
“No such decision has been taken, nor have any instructions been issued to the relevant authorities in this regard,” he said.
Further, an official at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat clarified that the former CM was asked to return two jammers and the associated personnel, which were required for the use of the incumbent chief minister.
“Under the rules, the former chief minister was not entitled to retain the jammers. He was supposed to return the jammers and vehicle”, the official said, insisting that no security detail had been withdrawn from Gandapur.
“He continues to retain a police escort,” the official maintained.
Gandapur had previously faced multiple security threats, and a hand grenade attack also took place at his residence in the past.
Official sources maintained that decisions regarding security deployment and withdrawal were made in accordance with threat assessments and administrative requirements.
Political observers said that the development was also significant in the context of the recent differences between Gandapur and CM Afridi.</p><small>2026-02-24 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/242108332593216.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975483/afghan-taliban-initiated-unprovoked-firing-along-pak-afghan-border-pms-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing along Pak-Afghan border: PM’s spokesperson</strong></a><br><p>Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, said on Tuesday said that the Afghan Taliban regime initiated unprovoked firing along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Torkham and Tirah.
In a post on the social media platform X, he said, “Pakistan’s security forces responded immediately and effectively, silencing the Taliban aggression.”
He said that any further provocation would be responded to “immediately and severely”. He said Pakistan would “continue to protect its citizens and guard its territorial integrity”.







The development comes after Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes.
The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year.
According to an information ministry statement, issued in the early hours of Sunday, the strikes were carried out in res­ponse to a number of terrorist attacks inside Pakistan — such as the suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad and a number of attacks in Bannu and Bajaur.
“Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij at the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers,” it said.
The information ministry said that in a retributive response, Pakistan carried out “intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban [Fitna al Khw­arij] and its affiliates, and [Islamic State-Khorasan] at the border region of Pakistan-Afghan border with precision and accuracy”.
Fitna al Khwarij is the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“Despite repeated efforts by Pak­istan to urge the Afghan Tali­ban Regime to take verifiable mea­sures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the statement noted.
Souring relations
There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded.
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire.
Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast.
Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault.
Then, on Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district.
In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”.
“Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij, irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted.
On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable.
In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces.
At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR.
The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.</p><small>2026-02-24 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24110626f77288a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975395/pti-objects-to-secrecy-after-imran-khan-undergoes-follow-up-treatment-for-eye-ailment-at-pims' target='_blank'><strong>PTI objects to ‘secrecy’ after Imran Khan undergoes follow-up treatment for eye ailment at Pims</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The PTI took exception to the government’s “secrecy” regarding ex-prime minister Imran Khan after it emerged that he underwent a follow-up treatment for his eye ailment at an Islamabad hospital in the early hours of Tuesday.
According to a doctor at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Imran was brought to the hospital for a second dose of anti-VEGF intravitreal injection on February 24.
Imran’s eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January. His first medical procedure, which was carried out on January 24, was confirmed by the government five days later.
Since then, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, of not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran, and of not allowing his personal physicians access to him. The government denies these allegations.
Reacting to the development, the PTI’s official X account said: “The situation demands transparency, not secrecy.” The party said such “clandestine actions only give rise to more questions.”
“What are they hiding?” the party asked, reiterating its demand that Imran be taken to Shifa International Hospital for “independent and transparent medical care”.
The PTI re-shared a video showing a convoy passing through at night, in which a person can be heard saying the vehicles were “returning from Pims”.
It could not be verified whether the convoy was carrying the former premier.







In its statement, the TTAP reiterated that Imran should be immediately shifted to Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, where his treatment should be conducted in the presence of his personal physicians and family members to end all concerns regarding his health.
The party added: “We further demand an immediate explanation for this irresponsible conduct. Any future actions must strictly adhere to legal requirements and fundamental rights.
“A transparent and credible mechanism must be adopted regarding the medical care of the party leader to restore public confidence.”







In her statement on X, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said: “We do not trust the diagnosis or test reports from government medical facilities.”
She said: “From the news, we found out that Imran Khan was taken to Pims again in the middle of the night, supposedly for his second injection in the eye.
“When the law requires that family be informed before any medical procedure is conducted on a prisoner, why was the family not informed?” she asked.
Expressing her lack of trust in the government-affiliated treatments, she claimed, “There are already reports coming from Pims that the doctors are being threatened with serious consequences if any information is leaked about Imran Khan.”
Aleema further said, “Our family rejects their reports, even if they issue these doctored reports to the public.
“We stand by our demand that Imran Khan be examined and treated in Shifa International (Islamabad) by specialists, under the supervision of Imran Khan’s personal doctors and in the presence of his family.”
She contended that Pims was “not equipped to treat anyone for the alleged condition that has developed in Imran Khan’s eye”.
“It is criminal what this government is doing, and they will be held accountable for each and every violation and crime they are committing against Imran Khan,” Aleema asserted.







Former PTI MNA Omar Ayub Khan termed it “totally unacceptable” that Imran was treated in the absence of his personal physicians.
Addressing Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, he said, “Now is the time to stand and be counted. Issue orders to ensure PM Imran Khan’s treatment in the presence of his physicians and in the hospital of his choice (Shifa International Islamabad).”







Night opted for due to ‘security, operational’ reasons: law minister
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Tuesday informed the Senate that the PTI founder was examined by a medical board comprising four expert specialist doctors at Pims, state-run APP reported.
He was responding to “various points” raised by Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, whose remarks could not be immediately ascertained as the proceedings are no longer being live-streamed on the official YouTube channel.
Tarar explained that the examination was scheduled at night due to security and operational considerations, stating that such arrangements helped minimise disruption at the hospital.
He said the decision was taken to ensure smooth medical procedures without affecting emergency services and routine patient care.
The minister stressed that matters relating to release, bail or foreign travel of a convicted prisoner fell under the jurisdiction of courts.
Tarar elaborated that the former prime minister was taken to Pims with his consent, where a board comprising both government and private specialist doctors conducted a detailed medical examination.
He informed the House that specialist doctors — including retinal expert Dr Nadeem Qureshi, the head of department at Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital, and Prof. Arif, the head of ophthalmology at Pims — were part of the evaluation.
He stated that the medical board evaluated his health condition, including ophthalmological assessment, cardiac evaluation and general medical review.
The minister asserted that the examination was carried out within the framework of the law and jail manual, emphasising that medical procedures for prisoners were governed strictly under existing legal provisions.
Tarar said the law did not permit special arrangements outside the prescribed rules.
Tarar reiterated the government’s commitment to implementing legal provisions without discrimination, citing Article 25 of the Constitution regarding equality before the law.
In a post on X, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that Imran would be administered a third injection on March 24.
Chaudhry stated: “According to doctors’ instructions, there was an improvement in the eyesight after the first procedure, keeping in view which expert physicians recommended a second procedure.
“Today’s process was completed successfully and after clearance from the medical team, he was shifted back to Adiala.”
The minister reaffirmed that providing prisoners with medical facilities was the state’s responsibility, adding, “Even in this matter, all arrangements were transparent and according to the regulations.”







Another attempt for jail meeting
Tuesday and Thursdays are court-mandated days for Imran’s family members, lawyers and PTI leaders to meet him.
On Tuesday, Imran’s sisters Aleema, Noreen Niazi and Uzma Khanum headed towards Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated. However, the PTI claimed they were stopped enroute by the police at Dahgal Naka.







During their visit, Noreen got hurt by “slipping and falling into a drain while going to offer prayers”, according to PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik.







Speaking to media persons, outside Adiala Jail, they criticised the government and demanded that Imran be shifted to Shifa International Hospital.
Aleema expressed concerns regarding Imran’s health and lack of access to family and personal physicians. She said that after meeting Bushra Bibi’s sister-in-law, the family received a message from Imran that he was facing serious vision problems.
She alleged that authorities provided inconsistent statements regarding his treatment. She also questioned the credibility of the official medical report prepared by government doctors.
Uzma said that the family only trusted the physicians they knew and they should be allowed to check and talk to Imran. She urged the public to raise their voices for the PTI founder’s health.
Separately, in a post on X, Aleema questioned: “If they have nothing to hide, why are they refusing to allow us to meet our brother?
“If they have nothing to hide, and if they expect us to believe that he is receiving proper medical treatment, why are his personal doctors not being allowed to examine him?”
She contended that Imran has been “kept in solitary confinement for more than four months, with the exception of three 20-minute visits granted to our sister, Dr Uzma Khan, the last of which was on December 2, 2025”.







Opposition, family unaware of visit: TTAP
Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai, speaking to Dawn, said it was unfortunate that no one, especially Imran’s family, was aware of the hospital visit in advance.
Yousafzai said, “Just after getting the information, I contacted Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai and then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, but both were unaware of the development.
“Then I contacted PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and asked about it but he was also unaware,” he narrated.
The TTAP spokesperson quoted Gohar as saying “let me check”, then said, “Later, he (Gohar) confirmed that Khan sahib was brought to Pims but has been shifted back to the Adiala jail.”
Yousafzai asserted that it was the right of PTI founder’s family to know about the treatment.
“Even if the law permits the government to keep it secret, the cultural traditions do not allow anyone to do what was done on Tuesday,” he argued.
He contended: “This action reflects a non-transparent approach and constitutes a clear violation of the fundamental human and legal rights of a former premier and national leader.
“Every person in custody — particularly a former prime minister — is entitled to have their family members and trusted personal doctors present during medical examinations and treatment to ensure transparency.”
In his post on X, Gohar said, “At 2am today, I was informed this much in a message that Khan sahib was brought to Pims for administering an injection.”
“I was not informed in advance,” he insisted.
The PTI chairman stressed, “Our demand even today is the same that a complete checkup and treatment of Khan sahib be performed in Shifa International Hospital in the presence of his personal doctors and family members.”







The government has said it had invited Gohar to be present during an examination of Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 15, but the PTI leader refused, citing party consultations.
Gohar meets SC registar; TTAP protests outside court
Separately, Gohar and MNA Ali Muhammad Khan met the Supreme Court (SC) registrar and requested the early fixation of Imran’s cases pending before the court.
Gohar told the SC registrar the matter of the PTI founder’s health was “not political but humanitarian”, stressing that they have sought his access to personal physicians and family members.
The SC registrar reportedly told Gohar to submit an application seeking the early fixation of cases and assured him of the same once the plea was received.
Speaking to the media outside SC, Gohar said his party had only one demand: “Give justice to Imran.”
He emphasised, “Our request is that a treatment of his choice be provided as per the jail manual.”
Noting that the SC registrar told him to submit a plea for early fixation, Gohar said PTI lawyer Latif Khosa would file it.
“Neither we nor his family was told about the PTI founder being brought to the hospital last night,” he said, adding that he was informed after the ex-premier had been taken back to prison.
Ali Muhammad highlighted, “A former prime minister was brought and taken back in the dark of the night.
“Smugglers operate in the night; not states,” the MNA quipped.
“Our prayer is that the government report of Khan sahib recovering is true. The question is why is there so much secrecy if the report is true?” he wondered.
Meanwhile, members of the TTAP staged a protest outside the SC for a second day.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi; senators Abbas, Faisal Javed Khan and Azam Swati; and MNAs Aamir Dogar, Shandana Gulzar and Shahid Khattak were among those present.
They raised slogans calling for Imran’s release from jail.
The TTAP leaders had also protested outside SC on Monday, demanding that Imran’s cases be immediately scheduled for hearing and that he be allowed to meet his family.







2nd Pims visit
Confirming Imran’s hospital visit, a Pims doctor said: “Prior to the procedure, he was examined by a board of specialists: a consultant cardiologist who also performed echocardiography and ECG (result: normal) and a consultant physician.
“After obtaining informed consent, and under standard monitoring, precautionary measures and protocols in the operation theatre, he was injected with a second dose of intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF under the guidance of microscopy by consultant phthalmologist, and a consultant vitreo-retinal surgeon of Pims and Al-Shifa Eye Hospital.”
The procedure was performed as a day care surgery, the Pims doctor said about Imran’s treatment.
During the course of his stay, Imran remained vitally stable before, during, and after the procedure, and was discharged along with instructions for care, follow-up advice, and the documents, the doctor stated.

 

Another Pims doctor, wishing not to be quoted, told Dawn that security in the hospital was heightened on Monday night.
“At 11:30pm, Imran was brought in the hospital and he was taken back at around 1:30am,” he added.
Replying to a question, the doctor said Imran’s tests and physical examination were held to determine whether he was fit for the procedure.
“The procedure was held in the same operation theatre in which he was brought last time. After the procedure, Khan sahib was shifted to the recovery room and finally, when it was confirmed that he was stable, he was allowed to be shifted to the Adiala jail,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-24 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/241917164f6dd9d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975448/aid-groups-petition-israels-top-court-to-halt-ban-on-gaza-west-bank-operations' target='_blank'><strong>Aid groups petition Israel’s top court to halt ban on Gaza, West Bank operations</strong></a><br><p>More than a dozen international humanitarian organisations have petitioned Israel’s Supreme Court to block an imminent order that would force 37 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to cease operations in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, warning of catastrophic consequences for civilians.
Organisations including Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE were notified on December 30, 2025 that their Israeli registrations had expired and that they had 60 days to renew them by providing lists of their Palestinian staff.
If they fail to do so, they will have to cease operations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including east Jerusalem, from March 1.
The petition, described as unprecedented in its scale and joint nature, seeks an urgent interim injunction from Israel’s top court to suspend the closures pending full judicial review.
The 17 petitioners, which include some of the NGOs hit by the ban, argue the Israeli measures are incompatible with an occupying power’s obligations under international humanitarian law.
The NGOs say compliance would expose local employees to potential retaliation, undermine the principle of humanitarian neutrality and violate European data protection law.
“Turning humanitarian organisations into an information-gathering arm for a party to the conflict stands in total contradiction to the principle of neutrality,” the petition states.
According to the United Nations, 133 NGO workers have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the war started on October 7, 2023, including 15 MSF employees.
The petitioners say they have proposed practical alternatives to handing over staff lists to Israel, including “independent sanctions screening” and “donor-audited vetting systems”.
Supplies blocked
The organisations say that they collectively support or implement more than half of all food assistance in Gaza, 60 per cent of field hospital operations and all inpatient treatment for children suffering severe acute malnutrition.
The petitioners say enforcement has already begun in practice, with supplies blocked and visas denied to foreign staff.
“We haven’t been able to get international staff inside Gaza since the beginning of January. Israeli authorities denied any entry to Gaza, but also to the West Bank,” MSF head of mission in the Palestinian territories Filipe Ribeiro told AFP last week.
“For the time being, we are still working in Gaza, and we plan to keep running our operations as long as we can,” he added.
The ban comes as Israel hardens its stance towards humanitarian actors in general, having banned the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, from Israel in early 2025.
UNRWA, which Israel accused of employing people who took part in Hamas’ October 7 attack, also can no longer coordinate with Israeli authorities in the occupied West Bank, as will be the case for the banned, or deregistered, NGOs.
For international NGOs, the current ban goes back to a change in rules for foreign organisations working with Palestinians in March 2025.
The law updated the framework for how aid groups must register to maintain their status within Israel, along with provisions that outline how their applications can be denied or registration revoked.
The absence of coordination with Israel complicates operations by denying Israeli visas to foreign aid workers, or by denying direct contact to plan around Israeli military operations in the Palestinian territory.
The NGOs argued in their petition that Israel, as an occupying power in the West Bank and parts of Gaza, “must facilitate relief for civilians under its control” under the Geneva Convention.</p><small>2026-02-24 15:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652703-gandapur-says-security-withdrawn-kp-govt-denies-claim' target='_blank'><strong>Gandapur says security withdrawn, KP govt denies claim</strong></a><br><p>

According to a handout by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), a core reform is the statutory introduction of the QR code — a scannable barcode containing horizontal and vertical lines, dots, and patterns — as a defined security and verification feature.
The rules now legally define QR codes as a secure, machine-readable, two-dimensional barcode capable of storing encoded information and converting it into usable identity verification data when scanned.
The amendments further authorise the use of a QR code or “any other technological feature,” in lieu of the current microchip, enabling Nadra to adopt evolving verification technologies without repeated rule amendments.
In operational terms, this establishes a robust legal basis for quick and secure verification of identity credentials in both offline and online environments. This will also enable all citizens to carry a similar card instead of the currently prevalent two types of national identity cards, one of which comes with a microchip and the other without.
This QR-enabled capability directly strengthens Pakistan’s Digital ID ecosystem and supports interoperability through the National Data Exchange Layer.
QR-based credentials allow rapid front-end validation of identity attributes in service delivery settings, while also enabling back-end systems to confirm authenticity and status through trusted exchanges. This is expected to improve speed, transparency and consistency of identity verification across government entities and regulated sectors, reduce manual handling, and lower the risk of fraud and impersonation.
The amendments also strengthen the enforcement effect of card suspension. The rules now clarify that where a card is suspended, all verification, authentication and related services linked to that card shall stand suspended forthwith.
This closes a key risk area by ensuring that once a card is suspended, it cannot continue to be used through digital verification channels or institutional authentication processes.
In addition, the biometric scope has been reinforced through explicit recognition of fingerprints and iris scans within the rules, reflecting a stronger and more modern multi-modal biometric foundation for identity assurance.
On citizen facilitation, the amendments introduce a major improvement for senior citizens. Where a resident or non-resident citizen has attained the age of sixty years, the rules now provide for the issuance of a card carrying a distinct senior citizen logo with lifetime validity. This significantly reduces renewal burden, improves convenience, and reflects a service-oriented approach for elderly citizens.
The amendments also introduce standardised identification for residents of Azad Jammu and Kashmir by requiring an inscription indicating “Resident of Azad Jammu and Kashmir”, thereby ensuring uniform geographic identification on the document.
The schedules have been comprehensively updated through the substitution of specimen formats for a wide range of document categories. Updated smart formats now cover resident citizens, overseas Pakistanis, child registration certificates, persons with disabilities, organ donors, combined categories, and AJK residents.
These updated formats visibly incorporate QR codes and enhanced security layouts, standardising a modern identity document architecture across categories.
Overall, these amendments strengthen the legal and technological foundations of Pakistan’s identity system by enabling secure QR-based verification, reinforcing the integrity of digital authentication services, improving biometric assurance, reducing fraud risk through immediate service suspension controls, and delivering clear facilitation measures such as lifetime validity for senior citizens.
They also advance readiness for integrated digital governance by supporting structured interoperability through the National Data Exchange Layer and a broader Digital ID ecosystem.</p><small>2026-02-24 15:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24181131711fbc4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975431/police-constable-martyred-as-unidentified-assailants-open-fire-in-wana' target='_blank'><strong>Police constable martyred as unidentified assailants open fire in Wana</strong></a><br><p>LOWER SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: A police constable was martyred after unidentified armed men opened fire in the Wana tehsil of Lower South Waziristan district, officials said on Tuesday.
According to District Police Officer (DPO) Mohammad Tahir, the attackers carried out a sudden assault in Mughal Khel village, leaving a constable, identified as Attaullah, critically wounded. He succumbed to his injuries on the spot.
His body was taken to the district headquarters hospital (DHQ) in Wana for legal formalities, the DPO said.
Police officials said security in the area was tightened following the incident, while an investigation had been launched to trace those involved.
“Efforts are underway to identify and apprehend the perpetrators,” DPO Tahir said, adding those responsible would be brought to justice.
The funeral prayers for the martyred official were later offered at the Police Lines in Wana. Subsequently, the body of the martyred constable was transported to his native village, Doag, where he was laid to rest with official honours.
KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.</p><small>2026-02-24 15:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/241930449ec56e6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975455/uk-govt-backs-releasing-documents-tied-to-rude-ex-prince-andrew' target='_blank'><strong>UK govt backs releasing documents tied to ‘rude’ ex-prince Andrew</strong></a><br><p>The UK government said on Tuesday it supported the release of documents on ex-prince Andrew’s past role as a trade envoy, hours after a veteran politician was quizzed by police in the widening Jeffrey Epstein scandal.
US authorities last month published millions of files related to late sex offender Epstein, containing revelations which have rocked British political and royal circles.
It has ramped up pressure on Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government to release its own vetting documents and sparked two separate, high-profile police investigations.
The Liberal Democrats party tabled a motion in parliament on Tuesday to force the government to release vetting documents on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s appointment as trade envoy, a post he held from 2001 to 2011.
The former prince was arrested last week on suspicion of misconduct in public office, and his brother King Charles III has said the “law must take its course”.
Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey said Andrew’s association with Epstein, and that of former government minister Peter Mandelson, who was arrested Monday, were a “stain on our country”.
“We must begin to clean away that stain with the disinfectant of transparency,” he said.
The push for the files on Andrew comes as the government prepares to release in March a first set of documents relating to the appointment of Mandelson as UK ambassador in Washington.
Mandelson, a key figure in British politics for decades and Britain’s envoy to Washington till September, was arrested on Monday in a separate misconduct in public office probe, also related to his links to Epstein.
‘Rude, entitled’
Mandelson’s appointment has triggered a political storm with two of Starmer’s top aides resigning over the row and raising questions about the prime minister’s judgment.
Minister Chris Bryant told parliament the government supported the release of the vetting documents from Andrew’s appointment as envoy under then-Labour prime minister Tony Blair 26 years ago.

 

He said it was “the least we owe the victims” of Epstein, adding Andrew was “a rude, arrogant and entitled man”.
Bryant cautioned, however, that the government would have to be guided by police as to what documents can be released so as not to jeopardise their investigation.
Mountbatten-Windsor, who was stripped of his titles last year, is being probed by police over allegations that he shared sensitive documents with Epstein during his time as envoy.
The former prince, long embroiled in scandals over his friendship with the late US sex offender, has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.
Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide last year, claimed she was trafficked three times to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor, starting in 2001 and twice when she was 17.
Andrew settled a US civil lawsuit in 2022 brought by Giuffre while not admitting liability.
When Andrew was appointed trade envoy, Mandelson was then a pivotal figure in the party, helping to secure Blair’s election victory, ousting the Conservatives.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s biographer Andrew Lownie told AFP Blair and Mandelson “pushed his appointment through”.
‘Push ahead’
The motion brought to parliament — called a “humble address” — was used successfully this month to compel Starmer to release documents related to Mandelson’s 2024 appointment as ambassador to Washington.
Mandelson was sacked from the top envoy role after just seven months over revelations about the depth of his ties to Epstein.
Government minister Bridget Phillipson told Sky News on Tuesday the government would “push ahead” with publishing the first of thousands of Mandelson documents in “early March”, despite his arrest.
She also cautioned that the police investigation could determine which documents are released.
Starmer has apologised to Epstein’s victims for appointing Mandelson, and accused the ex-envoy of lying about the extent of his ties to the tycoon during the vetting process for his Washington posting.
Mandelson, who was released on bail early on Tuesday, has previously apologised for his friendship with Epstein and insisted he did not know about the financier’s sexual offences, despite Epstein’s 2008 conviction for child prostitution.
Neither Mandelson nor Andrew has been charged with any offence.</p><small>2026-02-24 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652683-pakistan-committed-to-expanding-defence-collaboration-with-qatar-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with Qatar's emir, PM says both countries to work together for regional peace</strong></a><br><p>

A senior police officer told Dawn that six police personnel — the DSP, an inspector and four constables — were martyred when the vehicle, which was transporting two individuals for a court appearance, was attacked.
He added that one of the two individuals was also killed in the attack. The attackers also torched the vehicle after the ambush.
Earlier in the day, state-run APP reported that heavy firing by armed assailants targeted the DSP of Lachi police station near Shakardara Road.
Following the attack, additional police contingents were dispatched to the area, and a search operation was launched to apprehend the attackers.
Authorities have cordoned off the area, while investigations into the incident have begun.
Condemnations
In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack. Paying tribute to the fallen police personnel, he expressed heartfelt sympathy and condolences to their families.







KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also strongly condemned the terrorist attack.
The governor paid glowing tribute to the DSP and other police officials who embraced martyrdom in the line of duty and prayed for their elevated ranks. He also extended heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and wished for the speedy recovery of the injured police personnel.
Kundi noted that the law and order situation in KP’s southern districts had deteriorated significantly. He said the police were fighting on the front lines in the war against terrorism and rendering immense sacrifices.
The governor termed the sacrifices of police officers and soldiers for establishing peace a source of pride for the nation.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the attack and expressed sorrow over the loss of lives, as per a statement issued via the PPP’s media cell.
As per the statement, Bilawal paid tribute to the KP police for their “unwavering resolve and sacrifices in the war against terrorism”.







KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.
On Monday, three Federal Constabulary (FCN) men were martyred in a terrorist attack in KP’s Karak district, officials said.
According to Karak police spokesperson Shaukat Khan, Rescue 1122 teams arrived at the site of the incident, but their ambulances were ambushed by the terrorists near Ghole Banda Dam.
As a result, three FCN personnel were martyred, and three Rescue 1122 officials were injured, while the ambulances caught fire and were destroyed.
Last week, a terrorist attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in KP’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel. The military’s media wing said that an “innocent young girl” was also martyred during the incident, while another seven people were also injured, including women and children.

The Indian prime minister will visit Israel from February 25 to 26, India’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday. It will be Modi’s second visit to Israel.
According to the report, the opposition — led by Yair Lapid — is in a “standoff” with Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana due to his decision not to invite the Israeli Supreme Court President Isaac Amit to attend a special session of the parliament “as is customary”.
The report said that Lapid on Monday urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure Amit’s invitation.
According to Haaretz, Lapid, in a post on X, said: “We want to be in the session, we need to be in the session. Prime Minister Netanyahu must instruct Ohana to allow us to participate in the session.”







As per the report, Lapid, while speaking in the Knesset last week, warned that “boycotting Justice Amit is also a boycott of the opposition, and will not allow us to attend the session”.
He further said that the opposition “does not want India to be embarrassed, with the leader of a nation of one and a half billion people standing here before a half-empty Knesset”.
Haaretz quoted him as claiming that “the Indian embassy was ‘in a panic’”.
“Knesset speaker Ohana, however, in response to the boycott, maintained that he plans to invite former lawmakers to fill the seats of boycotting opposition lawmakers,” Haaretz reported, citing Israel’s public broadcaster Kan.
According to the report, Ohana also urged Lapid not to harm Israel’s foreign relations with “one of the most significant powers in the world,” terming the boycott an “illegitimate weapon in a political struggle”.
The report further added that the decision came amid the Israeli government’s efforts to “advance legislation to overhaul the powers of Israel’s judiciary”.

Albanese was evacuated from The Lodge, his official residence in the capital Canberra.
National broadcaster ABC reported the threat sparked a significant police operation, and led to the prime minister being taken to another location for several hours.







Police said they had responded to an “alleged security incident” around 6pm (07:00 GMT), without giving more details on the nature of the incident.
“A thorough search of a protection establishment was undertaken and nothing suspicious was located. There is no current threat to the community or public safety,” an Australian Federal Police spokesperson said in a statement.</p><small>2026-02-24 12:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24172602170aa89.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975423/paris-st-germain-defender-achraf-hakimi-to-face-trial-for-rape' target='_blank'><strong>Paris St Germain defender Achraf Hakimi to face trial for rape</strong></a><br><p>Moroccan soccer player Achraf Hakimi is to face a rape trial, the defender, who plays for Paris St Germain and the Moroccan national squad, said in a social media post on Tuesday. He denies the allegation.
“Today, a rape accusation is enough to justify a trial, even though I deny it and everything proves it’s false,” Hakimi said in a post on X.







“This is as unjust to the innocent as it is to the genuine victims. I calmly await this trial, which will allow the truth to come out publicly,” he said.
Hakimi’s lawyer Fanny Colin said a trial had been ordered and the prosecutor in the Nanterre suburb of Paris confirmed.
“A trial has been ordered on the basis of an accusation that rests solely on the word of a woman who obstructed all investigations, refused all medical examinations and DNA tests, refused to allow her mobile phone to be examined, and refused to give the name of a key witness,” Colin said.
PSG coach Luis Enrique when asked about it at Tuesday’s press conference, ahead of the Champions League play-off second leg match with Monaco, said: “This matter is in the hands of the authorities.”
The plaintiff’s lawyer, Rachel-Flore Pardo, said her client was relieved to hear the case was going to court.
She said the judiciary had been exemplary in handling the case.
But its treatment in general showed “there are still areas where the #MeToo movement has not yet breached the sound barrier, chiefly in men’s football,” she added.
The Nanterre prosecutor’s office had opened an investigation in 2023 after an allegation of rape was made against him.
The prosecutor confirmed on Tuesday that Hakimi’s case had been sent to trial.
Paris St Germain will face Monaco in Wednesday’s return leg of their Champions League knockout round playoff tie. Hakimi was in the initial squad list published last Tuesday.</p><small>2026-02-24 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24161147a4de67c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975415/senate-deplores-netanyahus-plan-to-forge-alliances-with-india-others-against-muslim-nations' target='_blank'><strong>Senate deplores Netanyahu’s plan to forge alliances with India, others against Muslim nations</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Senate on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution condemning Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s remarks about a plan to ally with India and other countries to counter Muslim nations.
The resolution moved in the House by PPP’s Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan deplored the continued provocative steps and statements by the Israeli leadership that threatened the regional and international peace and stability, including the latest statement about forming “alliances” against Muslim nations.
Addressing a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country “will create an entire system — essentially a kind of hexagon of alliances — around or within the Middle East”, Times of Israel reported.
Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus, and “unnamed Arab, African and Asian countries”, the report added.
“The intention here is to create an axis of countries that see reality, the challenges, and the goals in the same way, in contrast to the radical axes,” he was quoted as saying.
“Both the radical Shia axis, which we have hit very hard, and also the emerging axis — the radical Sunni axis,” Netanyahu added.

 

The Indian PM is also set to visit Israel this week.
In its resolution passed today, the Senate also condemned any attempts by Israel to undermine the “sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of brotherly Islamic countries and rejected” the announcement made by Israel recognising the independence of the so-called Somaliland region of Somalia.
On Dec 26, 2025, Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, sparking strong condemnation from Pakistan, 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
The Senate also condemned in the strongest possible terms the Israeli occupying power’s continued violations of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, as well as its blatant disregard of international law, the UN Charter, relevant UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, and the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
The House took strong exception to the “vile proclivity of the leadership of the Israeli occupying power towards diminishing the unity and integrity of Muslim Ummah on political and ideological grounds”.

 

It rejected any attempt by Israel to change the legal or historical status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the status of the holy sites; enforce any new legal and administrative reality in the occupied territory, especially the Occupied West Bank; expand its illegal settlement activities in the occupied territory, and encourage settler violence; or forcibly displace Palestinians from their land.
The Senate urged the international community to “end Israeli impunity and to hold it accountable for its crimes against humanity, as well as its provocative actions that pose a threat to all regional countries”.
It demanded full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories; increased, sustained, and unimpeded humanitarian assistance to the beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza, including through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA); and an early start of the recovery and reconstruction process in Gaza.
The House reaffirmed historic and unwavering support of the people of Pakistan for the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination and for the establishment of an independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.</p><small>2026-02-24 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/24171907769c715.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975414/pakistan-attracts-79-new-foreign-firms-rs407bn-investment-in-three-years' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan attracts 79 new foreign firms, Rs40.7bn investment in three years</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is attracting substantial foreign interest across a broad spectrum of sectors, including energy, logistics, information technology, agriculture, mining, and digital infrastructure, with much of this activity taking place through partnerships and joint ventures with local companies.
Over the past three years, 79 new foreign companies have commenced operations in the country, while foreign firms invested Rs40.7 billion in key sectors during the same period.
According to data released by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), 1,157 foreign companies are currently registered and operational in Pakistan.
Nineteen foreign companies exited the market over the last three years. In 2023, 31 new companies entered Pakistan while six ceased operations. In 2024, 21 entered and nine exited. In 2025, 27 new companies registered, compared to just four closures.
Beyond new market entries, foreign participation has also expanded through equity transactions. A total of 61 shareholding transactions involving foreign companies and local entities were recorded during this period.
Of these, 29 involved transfers to other foreign companies, four to foreign individual investors, 20 to local individual investors, and eight to local corporate entities. Many of these deals were driven by global portfolio restructuring among multinational corporations.
Saudi Arabia’s Wafi Energy acquired Shell Pakistan’s operations as part of Shell’s global reorganisation strategy. Dubai-based PTA Global Holdings secured a majority stake in Lotte Chemical Pakistan following an international agreement between Lotte Chemical and TotalEnergies. Switzerland’s Gunvor Group and Total Parco Limited acquired equal stakes in TotalEnergies Pakistan, while Saudi Aramco purchased a 40 per cent equity stake in Gas & Oil Pakistan Limited.
In logistics, UAE-based DP World entered into a joint venture with the National Logistics Corporation, strengthening Pakistan’s transport and supply chain infrastructure.
In the digital sector, Bazaar Technologies acquired Wemsol, and Saudi Arabia’s Waqub Data Company secured an 80pc stake in Pakistani technology firm Woot Tech.
In the telecommunications sector, PTCL acquired Telenor Pakistan’s operations as part of regional restructuring in the telecom sector.
In pharmaceuticals, Pfizer transferred its Karachi manufacturing plant and related assets to Lucky Core Industries to ensure continuity of local production, while France’s Sanofi sold its majority stake to a local investor consortium, after which the company was renamed Hoechst Pakistan Limited.
Agriculture has attracted strategic foreign partnerships as well. Italy’s Euricom S.p.A. acquired a 50pc stake in Fatima Euricom Rice Mills. Meanwhile, Netherlands-based Berkeley Square Holding B.V. obtained 50pc shareholding in Ogilvy & Mather Pakistan, Mindshare Pakistan, and Soho Square Pakistan.
The mining and minerals sector has seen growing international interest, with investment activity from Barrick Gold, Strategic Metals US, and Nova Minerals US.
The electric vehicle segment is also emerging as a new frontier, with entrants such as BYD, Chery Automobile, and NWTN Motors exploring opportunities in the local market.
In technology and telecommunications, global firms including Google, Samsung, Relational, IceWarp, Pro Device, and Russoft Synercon are expanding operations.
Infrastructure development is being supported by Abu Dhabi Ports and Portugal’s Mota Engil Group.
Existing foreign investors have likewise deepened their commitments. Mashreq Bank has launched and is expanding Pakistan’s first digital bank, while Kuwait-backed Raqami Digital Bank plans to invest $100 million.
UAE telecom group e& announced the successful completion of the acquisition of Telenor Pakistan by PTCL, a subsidiary in which it holds a 23.4pc effective economic interest.
Nestlé is investing an additional $60 million, and VEON Group has increased its investment in Mobilink Bank.
The Engro Jazz consortium is committing more than $550 million toward digital infrastructure expansion.
Additional major inflows include a $1 billion commitment from the UAE government through a local partner, a $160 million cement capacity expansion by the Mansha Group, the entry of global logistics firm Nippon Express into TCS, and renewed capital injections into the mining and minerals sector.
Meanwhile, the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has accelerated industrial cooperation, resulting in 24 business-to-business agreements worth more than $1.5 billion, alongside memoranda of understanding exceeding $7 billion across agriculture, renewable energy, information technology, minerals, and industrial relocation.
Overall, this signals an influx of foreign capital in traditional manufacturing-heavy industries along with digital and technology-focused industries.</p><small>2026-02-24 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652666-when-will-eid-ul-fitr-be-celebrated-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>When will Eid ul Fitr be celebrated in Pakistan?</strong></a><br><p>

A final-year MBBS student, buried in exam preparation, says his nights are the only moments that feel truly his. “The whole day is scheduled, lectures, wards, studying,” he says. “Night is the only time that feels like my own.”
Between lectures, clinical rotations and the relentless pressure of becoming a doctor, Daniyal squeezes his passions, travel, fitness and photography, into whatever hours he can reclaim.

But when he checks his screen-time report, often stretching beyond four or five hours, the realisation hits. “I think I’ll scroll for a few minutes, and suddenly it’s 2am,” he says. “That’s when I realise I’ve delayed sleep again.”
Those late-night hours are both comforting and costly. For Daniyal, they are a way of taking control, a quiet rebellion against packed schedules and constant responsibilities. “It feels like I’m reclaiming time,” he says. “But the next day is brutal.”
The morning after, he says, brings heavy fatigue, fading motivation, and the feeling that one bad night can derail an entire week. “You wake up tired, irritated, and then the cycle repeats,” he adds.
Daniyal has tried small fixes, drinking water before touching his phone, experimenting with supplements and imagining a future where sleep trackers and cleaner air might help him rest better. Still, he admits that scrolling before bed has become a ritual he wants to break.
“I know it’s unhealthy, but it’s hard to stop,” he says. “It has become a habit.”
Daniyal is not alone.
Amna Aslam, a second-year university student, describes her relationship with her phone as both disciplined and indulgent.
“I use my mobile most of the time during the day, but I limit my usage during my blocks and modules,” she says. “During exams, I avoid any kind of usage, even YouTube Shorts.”

“But nights are different. At night, I reward myself for the work of the whole day. For some dopamine rush, I use my mobile phone for 30 to 120 minutes,” she explains.
Instagram is her main source of entertainment, but she admits it is highly engaging. “It requires a lot of time, so I limit my use of Instagram to weekends only. In my daily routine, my usage is limited to WhatsApp, YouTube Shorts and Netflix.”
Amna prefers shows with multiple short episodes and watches them at a faster speed. “As a university student, I have developed a habit of watching everything at 1.5x to 2x speed to cope with my workload,” she says.
However, she admits that the habit has sometimes led to consequences. “There were times when my excessive mobile phone usage at night led to serious problems, like missing my classes or lectures the next day, or feeling very drowsy,” she says.
Reclaiming time after dark
What Daniyal and Amna experience is known as “revenge bedtime procrastination”, a phenomenon that refers to the deliberate delay of sleep to engage in activities individuals feel they do not have time for during the day.
These activities may include scrolling through social media, watching videos, chatting online, or simply staying awake to enjoy uninterrupted personal time. While it is often framed as relaxation or “me time”, it comes at the cost of adequate sleep.

The term “bedtime procrastination” was first introduced in an academic paper published in 2014, which described it as going to bed later than intended without any external reason.
The word “revenge” was later added in China, where long working hours — sometimes stretching to 12 hours a day — led workers to sacrifice sleep as a way of regaining control over their lives.
The concept gained wider attention after a viral post by journalist Daphne K. Lee, who described the behaviour as something that happens when “people who don’t have much control over their daytime life refuse to sleep early to regain some sense of freedom during late-night hours”.
From exhausting routines to everyday habits
While the phenomenon is closely linked to China’s demanding “996” work culture, its reach is no longer limited to one country. A BBC report citing a 2018 national survey found that nearly 60 per cent of people born after 1990 in China were not getting enough sleep, particularly those living in major cities dominated by technology-driven work environments.
Experts say similar patterns are now visible globally. Extended screen time, blurred boundaries between work and rest, remote employment, and academic pressure have normalised delayed sleep, especially among young people.
When delayed sleep becomes a clinical concern
Speaking to Dawn, Dr Bilal Saleem, General Physician at the Bahawal Victoria Hospital (BVH), Bahawalpur, says patients who seek medical help for sleep-related issues often do so when they are already experiencing psychological or psychiatric conditions.
“Most patients who come to us are already in a diseased state, such as depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia or manic episodes,” Dr Saleem explains. “In mania, there is pressure of thoughts; in anxiety, people wake up due to overthinking and restlessness.”
He adds that people without diagnosed mental health conditions rarely visit doctors simply to explain why they sleep late.
“People don’t come and say, ‘Doctor, I sleep late because I use my phone too much,’” he says. “They usually think it is normal behaviour and not a medical problem, so they never report it.”

“For the general population, the common reasons are lifestyle-related factors such as excessive mobile use, social media, daytime sleeping, work stress or night shifts,” he says.
Dr Saleem notes that people who approach doctors with complaints related to revenge bedtime procrastination usually do so when they are already in a diseased state, often linked to underlying mental health conditions.
“Normal people don’t consider delayed sleep a health issue,” he adds. “They only seek help when their condition affects work, studies or mental health. Otherwise, they adjust their routine themselves and assume it is just part of modern life.”

He says a major reason people do not report the condition is a lack of awareness that what they are experiencing is a behavioural or health issue.
“Most people don’t even know there is a term for this. They think sleeping late is normal in modern life,” he says. “They don’t realise that this habit is quietly damaging their health, productivity and emotional well-being.”
Many young people, he explains, normalise exhaustion and irregular sleep patterns as part of academic pressure, work culture and digital life. “They say, ‘Everyone sleeps late, so what is the problem?’ But over time, it makes their lifestyle difficult. They feel tired, lose focus, become irritable, and their mental health suffers.”
According to the physician, people usually seek help only when the consequences become severe. “When studies, work, or relationships start getting affected, then they realise something is wrong. Before that, they just adjust and accept it as routine.”
He adds that awareness is key. “If people understood that poor sleep is not just a habit but a health issue, they would seek help earlier and change their routines.”
Psychology of control and autonomy
From a psychological perspective, revenge bedtime procrastination is closely linked to autonomy and control. Qulchaq Alam, an MPhil student at the University of Karachi and a practising psychologist, explains that individuals who spend their days following schedules imposed by work, study, or family often use nighttime to reclaim personal freedom.

“Late-night hours become the only time when they can choose what to do without interruption,” she told Dawn. “While doing so provides temporary relief and a sense of control, the coping mechanism becomes counterproductive when practised regularly.”
She added that over time, disrupted sleep patterns can lead to physical fatigue, emotional instability and broader psychological problems.
Youth, self-worth and emotional regulation
Dr Farah Iqbal, psychologist and professor of criminology at the University of Karachi,  explains that sleep procrastination among youth is strongly associated with emotional dysregulation and unresolved psychological stress.
“Fear, anxiety and uncertainty, particularly those intensified during the pandemic, have impaired young people’s ability to manage emotions effectively.”

She noted that low self-esteem also plays a central role. “In the real world of work and education, young people often feel undervalued and unable to compete. Constant comparison with peers of the same age who appear more successful creates a sense of deprivation, damaging self-esteem.”
Social media, she said, then becomes an alternative space where individuals can construct identities, play with self-image and escape feelings of inadequacy.
Dr Iqbal added that such behaviour is not innate or natural. It has developed over time due to early exposure to gadgets, changing work patterns and a lack of healthy leisure during the day, which pushes young people to treat nighttime as their only personal space.

“Revenge bedtime procrastination also reflects resistance. When young people cannot express injustice, frustration or lack of control during the day, they take revenge at night by staying awake.”

“It can also function as a subtle act of defiance against authority figures like parents or guardians who insist on early bedtimes and allow youth to assert control over their own time,” she said.
Why does ‘FOMO’ keep young people awake?
Fear of missing out, or FOMO, often intensifies the behaviour. Teenagers stay awake watching shows, scrolling through feeds or replying to messages, not always out of interest, but out of fear of being excluded from conversations, trends or shared experiences. The need to stay connected overrides physical exhaustion, pushing sleep further into the background.
“You don’t want to be the only one who doesn’t know what everyone is talking about the next day,” Daniyal says. “So you keep scrolling, even when you’re tired.”
For Daniyal, the quiet rebellion of staying awake feels temporary, tied to the pressures of medical school and the uncertainty of a demanding career path.

“It’s my way of taking back some control,” he says. “But it’s a control that costs me energy the next day.”
Yet he knows the irony of sacrificing sleep while training to become a doctor.
“Sleep is one of the most underrated pillars of health,” he says, aware that poor rest affects mood, productivity and physical well-being.
He hopes that once exams are over and life slows down, nights will no longer be spent chasing time through endless scrolling, but reclaiming it through the deep, restorative sleep he believes is essential — not just for patients, but for himself.

Topline Securities noted that the session witnessed pronounced volatility, with the index staging a brief rebound to an intraday high of +1,546 points before intensified selling pressure pushed it to a low of –3,783 points.
Despite the decline in points, trading activity remained robust, with total volumes clocking in at 687 million shares and turnover reaching Rs38.4 billion.
The top active stocks were led by K-Electric Limited, falling 1.17pc to Rs7.57 at a volume of 64,848,829, followed by The Bank of Punjab, declining 1.62pc to Rs29.70 at a volume of 49,139,683, and Worldcall Telecom Limited, falling 0.76pc to Rs 1.31 at a volume of 45,981,935.
The top advancers were led by Abdullah Shah Ghazi Sugar Mills Limited, rising 12.32pc to Rs9.12, followed by Chenab Limited, rising 11.79pc to Rs9.48, and Ittefaq Iron Industries Limited, rising 10.49pc to Rs8.11.

This 0.85pc fall from its previous close of 167,691.08 points comes on the heels of the index’s bloodbath on Monday, the third major meltdown at the PSX in the past two weeks, with the KSE-100 losing 5,149.80 points on February 16 and 6,683 points, the steepest single-day decline in history, on February 19.
Mohammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, noted that the market is in “correction mode.” He stated that the current sell-off “appears to be driven by above-average foreign selling, Reko Diq-related concerns, softer corporate results, and stock futures unwinding”.
Interestingly, he cautions against deeming this as a bearish market, calling it an “11pc correction instead”.







AKD Securities believed that geopolitical developments and the outcome of the upcoming IMF review mission, due to arrive next week, will be crucial in determining investor sentiment.
Investors will also be looking towards corporate earnings reports for a possible upside.
Pakistan Oilfields Ltd announced its 2QFY26 results today. The company recorded a profit of Rs6.3bn, down 17pc YoY but up 16pc QoQ. This takes 1HFY26 earnings to Rs41.29/share, up 16pc YoY, according to Topline Securities.
The brokerage house noted that earnings came out higher than expectations, driven by higher-than-expected other income and a lower Effective Tax Rate (ETR), which stood at 26pc in 2QFY26, compared to 37pc in 2QFY25 and 33pc in 1QFY26.
Additionally, Hub Power Company announced its 2QFY26 results today. The company reported earnings of Rs10.6bn, an increase of 152pc YoY. Their profits were down compared to the previous quarter by 9pc due to higher ETR. According to Topline Securities, this result came lower than expectations due to a higher-than-expected ETR.</p><small>2026-02-24 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652643-opposition-denounces-suspension-of-senates-live-broadcast' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition denounces 'suspension' of Senate's live broadcast</strong></a><br><p>

According to District Police Officer (DPO) South Waziristan Lower Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir, the explosion destroyed parts of the Government Middle School (GMS) Boys’ Sharif Khan Kot, including two classrooms, bathrooms, the main gate, and one side of the boundary wall.
Initial reports confirmed no casualties were reported.
The blast was so powerful that it was heard in distant areas. According to police sources, nearby houses were also affected. Solar panels, walls, and windows sustained partial damage from the blast.
Following the explosion, police launched an investigation into the incident and began collecting evidence from the site.
Local authorities reiterated their commitment to ensuring the safety of educational institutions and maintaining peace in the region.
Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi strongly condemned the incident. In his statement, the governor said that those responsible for targeting an educational institution in South Waziristan are enemies of knowledge, development, and the younger generation.
He added that the entire nation stands with the state and its institutions to thwart the malicious designs of Fitna al-Khawarij.
The governor further stated that such cowardly attacks cannot weaken the nation’s resolve. Instead, these acts would only strengthen national unity against forces seeking to disrupt peace and progress, he said.
In December, 2025, terrorists blew up a government primary school in the Mirali tehsil of North Waziristan district, spreading fear and anxiety among students.
According to police, the incident occurred in Eppi village, where unknown assailants planted explosive material inside the building of the government girls’ primary school during the night, triggering a powerful blast that destroyed the structure.</p><small>2026-02-24 10:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652641-noreen-niazi-injured-after-fall-at-construction-site-in-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>Imran's sister Noreen injured after fall at construction site in Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>

Experts say Iran has a poor air safety record, with repeated crashes, many involving aircraft bought before the 1979 Islamic Revolution and lacking original spare parts for maintenance.
Last week, a US-built F-4 fighter belonging to Iran’s regular air force crashed in the western province of Hamadan, killing one pilot during a training flight.

The Beechcraft C90 plane, operated by Redbird Airways, took off from state capital Ranchi but requested a change to its flight path due to weather, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said on Monday.
The aircraft subsequently lost communication and radar contact, the regulator said.
Rescue and medical teams rushed to the site of the crash, which local media said was deep inside a difficult-to-access forest.
“The team of doctors found them, and declared them dead,” local administrative official Keerthishree G told reporters, adding that two of the seven people killed were crew members.
“We have pulled out the bodies and sent them for post-mortem and further investigation,” the official said.
Keerthishree G is the deputy commissioner of Chatra district, where the crash occurred during a thunderstorm.
A team from India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has been dispatched to investigate the cause, the regulator said.
Most air crashes are due to a combination of factors and can take at least a year to investigate, according to industry experts.
Relatives of the patient, Sanjay Kumar, told reporters he was injured in a fire and was initially undergoing treatment in Ranchi.
“His condition had become worse so we were taking him to Delhi by air ambulance,” said Vijay Sau, his older brother.
Last month, a Learjet 45 charter aircraft crashed killing all five people on board, including the deputy chief minister of India’s wealthiest state of Maharashtra and two members of his staff.

Thousands of party elites have packed the capital Pyongyang for a once-in-five-years summit of the ruling Workers’ Party, a gathering that directs state efforts on everything from diplomacy to war planning.
Kim Yo Jong — long considered one of her brother’s closest lieutenants — was promoted to department director within the party’s apex central committee, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
Although it was not clear which department she would lead, she has previously held a senior role within the party’s propaganda unit.







Kim Yo Jong has in recent years emerged as one of the most powerful figures in North Korea, playing a highly visible role in diplomacy, nuclear negotiations and other matters of state.
“Kim Yo Jong is one of the very few people Kim Jong Un can trust and rely on,” said Ahn Chan-il, a researcher originally from North Korea.
“She also served as a working-level official for Kim’s summits with Trump in Singapore and Hanoi. She is experienced and seasoned,” he told AFP.

 

Kim Yo Jong burst on to the international scene in 2018, when she was dispatched to Seoul as North Korea’s envoy for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
With that trip, she became one of the first members of the ruling Kim dynasty to set foot in the South since the Korean War.
Since then she has gained a reputation for her vitriolic denunciations of Washington and Seoul.
She once derided the government of former South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol as a “faithful dog” of the United States.
Her tone has softened somewhat since South Korea’s incumbent leader Lee Jae Myung — who has sought to mend ties with the North — took office last year.
Kim Yo Jong’s latest advancement “amounts to promotion to ministerial rank,” said Lim Eul-chul from the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University.
Rapid rise
Remarkably little is known about Kim Yo Jong given her prominent role in North Korea’s dealings with the outside world.
Born in 1988, according to the South Korean government, she is one of three children born to Kim’s father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il, and his third known partner, former dancer Ko Yong Hui.
She was educated in Switzerland alongside her brother and rose rapidly up the ranks once he inherited power after their father’s death in 2011.
Pyongyang has never officially disclosed any information about Kim Yo Jong’s marital status or children.
Rare footage released by state media last year showed her attending an art show with two young children.

The Workers’ Party congress offers a rare glimpse into the political workings of reclusive North Korea, and is widely seen as a forum for Kim to flex his grip on power.
It is just the ninth time the gathering has been called to order under North Korea’s decades-spanning Kim dynasty.
There is keen interest in whether the congress might also promote leader Kim Jong Un’s teenage daughter Kim Ju Ae.
Kim Ju Ae has emerged as a clear frontrunner to continue the family dynasty, according to South Korea’s national intelligence service.

 


United States President Donald Trump stepped up his courtship of Kim Jong Un during a tour of Asia last year, saying he was “100 per cent” open to a meeting.
But the North Korean leader has so far largely shunned efforts to resume top-level diplomatic dialogue.</p><small>2026-02-24 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/241219200eaa689.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975403/uk-police-release-ex-envoy-peter-mandelson-on-bail-in-epstein-case' target='_blank'><strong>UK police release ex-envoy Peter Mandelson on bail in Epstein case</strong></a><br><p>London police released former ambassador Peter Mandelson on bail in the early hours of Tuesday, in a probe into his ties to disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein, only days after ex-prince Andrew was arrested.
Mandelson, a pivotal figure in British politics and the UK’s former envoy to Washington, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office around 17:00 GMT (10pm PKT) on Monday following allegations arising from the latest set of documents linked to Epstein.
“A 72-year-old man arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office has been released on bail pending further investigation,” the Metropolitan police said in a statement around nine hours after he was taken in to an unnamed London police station.
Images on UK television earlier appeared to show Mandelson, 72, being driven away from his north London home, accompanied by a man and a woman, after police raided his properties earlier this month.
The arrest came days after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, King Charles III’s younger brother, was detained on Thursday and released under investigation in a separate misconduct in public office investigation also related to the latest Epstein documents.

 

Mandelson is being probed over allegations that he sent sensitive documents to the late US sex offender when he was a government minister, including during the 2008 financial crash.
Police have not specified which documents are part of the probe.
The veteran ex-politician was sacked by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as envoy to Washington in September when an earlier release of documents linked to Epstein showed the extent of their friendship.
But Mandelson’s appointment has unleashed a political storm with two of Starmer’s top aides resigning over the row.
Starmer apologised to Epstein’s victims for appointing Mandelson, and accused the ex-envoy of lying about the extent of his ties to the financier during the vetting process for his Washington posting.
Pressure rising
Law firm Mishcon de Reya, representing Mandelson, said earlier this month that he “regrets, and will regret until his dying day, that he believed Epstein’s lies about his criminality”.
“Lord Mandelson did not discover the truth about Epstein until after his death in 2019,” said the statement.
“He is profoundly sorry that powerless and vulnerable women and girls were not given the protection they deserved.”
The government is to release tens of thousands of emails, messages and documents on Mandelson’s vetting procedure, which could ramp up the pressure on the prime minister and other senior ministers.
Government minister Darren Jones on Monday said the first set of documents relating to Mandelson’s appointment will be published in early March.
Starmer fought off calls to resign earlier this month after he admitted he knew about Mandelson’s ongoing friendship with Epstein — which seemed to continue after the financier was convicted of child prostitution in 2008.
Mandelson, also a former European Union trade commissioner, stood down from parliament’s unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords, earlier this month.
The advisory firm he co-founded, Global Counsel, also approached bankruptcy last week as it stopped trading and appointed administrations in a bid to salvage some assets.
Several major clients, including Barclays, Tesco and English football’s Premier League, have cut ties with the firm in recent weeks, according to press reports.
Officers from the Met’s specialist crime team were deployed earlier this month to search two of his addresses, one in the western English county of Wiltshire and the other in London, according to the police.</p><small>2026-02-24 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652607-islamabad-international-airport-goes-fully-cashless' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad airport becomes Pakistan's first fully cashless airport</strong></a><br><p>

• Senate opposition leader asks govt not to complicate PTI chief’s health matters; says Imran not looking for deal
• Upper house approves criminal procedure code tweaks to prevent police from holding suspects incommunicado
ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Monday extended an olive branch to the PTI to advance the ‘Charter of Democracy’, signed between the PPP and the PML-N in 2006, and asked opposition lawmakers to rejoin parliamentary standing committees to kick-start the political process for reconciliation.
The offer was made by PML-N Senator and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah in his Senate address, while responding to a speech by Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas.
“Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the charter of democracy,” Mr Sanaullah said, adding that the government was ready for a dialogue to strengthen democracy and avoid confrontation and deadlock.
“We are ready to sit with you for the betterment of the country,” he asserted, maintaining that parties in the current ruling coalition had stressed the need for talks, even when the PTI was in power.
This is not the first time the ruling coalition has invited the PTI for talks. In November and December last year, the government leaders made similar proposals to the opposition to break the political deadlock; however, these offers did not lead to anything substantial.
Speaking in the upper house, Mr Sanaullah blamed the incarcerated PTI leader, Imran Khan, for the impasse, claiming that the former prime minister’s “stubbornness” was a major hurdle in talks. The PM’s adviser said the opposition wanted a dialogue with those who did not want to engage in talks with it. “You don’t want to talk to those who desire so,” he said, adding that the government was ready to move forward democratically.
He said that the government wanted the PTI to become part of parliament by rejoining its standing committees, adding that the opposition was reluctant to become part of the political process.
Referring to Raja Nasir Abbas, the PML-N senator said that the opposition leader was part of the committee which refused to talk to the government at the direction of the top leadership.
He invited the opposition to collaborate on economic and democratic pacts, emphasising that negotiations occur between political parties, not through external forces.
To break the political deadlock, the government and the opposition had earlier engaged in a dialogue, following the formation of respective committees in December 2024. However, the talks collapsed after multiple rounds, as both sides refused to soften their stance. In these talks, the PTI had demanded the formation of two separate judicial commissions to probe the May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, incidents, as well as the release of jailed PTI leaders and workers.
Imran’s health
In his speech, Rana Sanaullah also touched upon the PTI’s concerns about the health of its jailed founder.
The PML-N senator said that the matter was before the court and the government had implemented its directions regarding his treatment. He claimed that the government included an eye specialist in the medical board at the PTI’s request, who examined Mr Khan in Adiala jail.
Commenting on the cases against the PTI founder, he said the courts were the appropriate forum and could grant relief in accordance with the law.
He said entry to Parliament House was sealed during the opposition sit-in earlier this month for “security reasons”. He said that the opposition had given a call to its workers to reach the protest venue, which prompted the police to make security arrangements.
‘Peaceful sit-in’
Earlier, in his speech, Raja Nasir Abbas regretted that parliament was shut down to confine opposition lawmakers who had been staging a “peaceful” protest on the premises. “Is this not an insult to parliament,” he asked.
He said that their only demand was that the PTI founder be provided treatment in the presence of his personal physicians and to the satisfaction of his family. “The founding PTI chairman neither wanted to come out of jail nor did his family make such a demand,” he said, adding that they only sought a fair trial for him.
Urging the need to restore confidence, the opposition leader requested that the government not transform this issue into a full-blown crisis and instead resolve the matter.
He assured that the opposition would never become part of any conspiracy to topple the government on the dictation of any dictator, even though the legitimacy of the incumbent setup was questionable. He also reiterated his demand that a parliamentary committee should be formed to meet the jailed ex-premier and examine his health conditions.
The proceedings also witnessed an uproar by the PML-N lawmakers when PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz raised questions about the purchase of a luxury jet by the Punjab government, which cost about Rs10 billion.
CrPC amendment
The upper house also passed some key legislation, including a landmark bill seeking to prevent the police from keeping individuals in custody without informing their family members.
The Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill moved by PPP lawmaker Shahadat Awan sought to insert a new section, 59-A, to the Code of Criminal Procedure which read: “When a person is arrested and held in custody in a police station or other premises, he shall be entitled to have a family member, friend or other person known to him (or likely to take an interest in his welfare) informed by the officer in charge of the police station about his arrest.” It read that a police officer not below the rank of the superintendent of police may authorise a delay only if he has reasonable grounds to believe that informing the named person will lead to interference.
As per the bill’s statement of objects and reasons, the new section aimed to stop the abuse of process by the police officials who, in many cases, keep the suspect in custody without a formal arrest. It also said that an amendment to Section 431 and the insertion of 431A aimed to provide legal heirs the right to contest a case on behalf of the deceased to remove any kind of stigma.
The house also passed a bill to include the Senate opposition leader in the National Security Council. This bill was moved by Shahadat Awan.

Dr Mehwish Hasnain was killed late on Sunday as she was going home after performing duty at the KDA hospital.
The police said they had registered an FIR against unidentified people for the murder.
The protesters blocked the KDA Road and demanded the immediate arrest of the killer. They also called for tight security for themselves.
The protesters insisted that Dr Mehwish was shot by an attendant whom she earlier asked to leave the space reserved for women patients.

DPO says three teams formed to arrest killer

Spokesman for the YDA’s provincial chapter Hafeez Orakzai said that the woman doctor left the hospital alone for home, considering the incident a minor one.
“When Dr Mehwish was shot multiple times by the same visitor outside the hospital, she died on the spot,” he said.
The spokesman said staff members had suspended all services at three major hospitals in the city, including KDA Hospital, Liaquat Women and Children’s Hospital and Dental Hospital, to protest the murder.
“Only emergency care will be provided to visitors until the killer is arrested,” he said.
However, the doctors resumed work at the emergency department at the request of district police officer Shahbaz Khan, to the relief of patients from Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu and Karak districts.
Mr Hafeez said that it was the second such incident in Kohat.
He insisted that hospital visitors often thrashed staff members in the emergency departments, wards and labs.
When contacted, the DPO revealed the formation of three teams to arrest the killer(s) and said that he supervised the operation.
The doctor’s funeral prayers were offered at Sava Lakh graveyard on Monday, with her colleagues and officials of civil and police administrations in attendance.
The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Pakistan condemned the murder and insisted it was not an isolated incident.
“Repeated incidents of violence against women doctors in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa point to systemic gaps in workplace safety, security enforcement and institutional accountability. Such acts endanger healthcare workers and undermine public confidence in essential medical services,” the society said in a statement.
It urged the government to ensure a transparent and time-bound investigation for early punishment of culprits, strict security measures at all public health centres and formulation of a policy on prevention of workplace violence in healthcare settings, with special focus on the protection of women health professionals.
“Violence justified under the guise of ego or so-called honour has no place in a lawful society.”
The society said authorities should ensure justice was delivered and meaningful staff protection was ensured.
