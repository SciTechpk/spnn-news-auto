During the massacre, 147 people were killed, including 132 students and 15 staff members, while 180 others were wounded in the attack on December 16, 2014.
The siblings and parents of the martyred students and staff members assembled on Shami Road and walked to the school, raising slogans and demanding justice for their martyred children.
The parents also lit candles at the Shuhada Monument inside the school and offered prayers for the martyred students.

Shuhada APS Forum President Ajoon Khan told Dawn that despite 11 years having passed since the massacre, justice has not been delivered to the bereaved families.
He demanded that the authorities punish those advocating for the resettlement of the terrorists involved in the incident, and said a judicial inquiry should be conducted into the matter.
Khan further demanded that the report of the judicial commission, which probed the APS massacre on the Supreme Court’s directive, be shared with the parents.
Regarding activities for the 11th anniversary, Khan said that a main function would be held at the APS campus in the morning, while parents would light candles at the Shuhada APS Monument near the Archives Library on Sher Shah Suri Road.
In response to the brutal attack, the government in January 2015 launched the National Action Plan (NAP) — introducing a series of kinetic and non-kinetic measures to counter terrorism, one of which was the decision to try terrorists in military courts. In 2021, the PTI-led government decided to review NAP.
A judicial commission report submitted to the Supreme Court in 2020 highlighted the belated response to the terror attack, while acknowledging that further devastation was foiled by Mobile Vigilance Team-2 (MVT) and the Quick Response Force (QRF).
The commission also made certain recommendations, including medical and psychological treatment of the injured and the martyrs’ close relatives, as well as provision of free education to the injured and the martyred students’ siblings.</p><small>2025-12-16 03:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16075007bd54699.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961401/after-two-decades-gilgit-baltistan-to-have-local-government-polls-on-feb-14' target='_blank'><strong>After two decades, Gilgit-Baltistan to have local government polls on Feb 14</strong></a><br><p>GILGIT: After a gap of 20 years, the Gilgit-Baltistan chief election commissioner on Monday announced the holding of local government (LG) elections in the region for February next year.
Separately, the GB Election Com­mission convened a multiparty conference (MPC) on Dec 18 to consult political parties on the general elections scheduled for Jan 24 next year.
According to the schedule issued by the GB Election Commission, polling for LG elections will be held on Feb 14. In this regard, a public notice will be issued on Dec 19, while nomination papers can be filed from Dec 22 to 26.
In a statement, CEC Raja Shahbaz Khan said LG elections in GB were the need of the hour and that the election commission was fully prepared and committed to conducting the polls.

Election commission to convene MPC on 18th for consultation on next month general elections

He said LG elections had not been held in the region for the past 20 years and that their conduct would help resolve public issues at the grassroots level, enabling citizens to secure rights at their doorsteps.
CEC Khan described LG elections as a milestone for strengthening democratic institutions and promoting development in the region, saying local governments play a key role in any democratic system.
He said the elections would provide people with an opportunity to directly participate in decision-making and local development, adding that the election commission was determined to hold the polls in a clean, transparent, fair and lawful manner.
Multiparty conference
Meanwhile, the GB Election Commission has convened the MPC at 11am on Dec 18 (Thursday) at its secretariat to consult political parties on the holding of general elections scheduled for Jan 24.
CEC Khan expressed the hope all political parties in Gilgit-Baltistan, or their authorised representatives, would participate in the conference. The purpose of the meeting was to seek views, suggestions and guidance on key electoral matters to make the process more effective, transparent and in line with democratic principles, he added.
He asked the leaders of all political parties to attend the consultative meeting and share their valuable views and suggestions with the election commission. He reaffirmed the commission’s determination to ensure the conduct of free, fair and transparent elections with the cooperation of all stakeholders.
Due to harsh weather conditions in the region, sources said, political party leaders had already opposed the holding of the general elections on Jan 24.
While the MPC is expected to demand a delay in the polls until May, the election commission in such scenario is considering to hold the general and local government elections simultaneously, the sources added.

In a late-night announcement, the Petroleum Division said the revision followed movements in international markets and recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to the announcement, the ex-depot price of HSD has been reduced by Rs14 per litre (5pc) to Rs265.65 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs279.65 per litre. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD.
Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells, threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Transporters had already increased their fares based on an approximate Rs27 per litre increase between May and August, and have not reversed them despite a Rs9 per litre cut.
The ex-depot petrol price was kept unchanged at Rs263.45 per litre. Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government is charging Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs82 per litre on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and an Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs16-17 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and HSD are the major revenue spinners with their monthly average sales of about 700,000 – 800,000 tonnes per month compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene. The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy alone in FY2025 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470 trillion during the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-12-16 02:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16073513d5e7d8e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961376/rate-cut-too-meagre-to-address-major-challenges-industry-leaders-complain' target='_blank'><strong>Rate cut too meagre to address major challenges, industry leaders complain</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The decision of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to lower the policy rate by 50 basis points to 10.50pc drew mixed reactions on Monday, with a foreign investors’ body welcoming it while the country’s wider business community criticised it as marginal and ineffective for boosting local production and exports.
The Overseas Investors Cham­ber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) viewed the rate cut as a prudent measure.
“The State Bank has taken a cautious and measured step to ease financing conditions,” OCCI’s Secretary General and Chief Executive Abdul Aleem said.

 

Mr Aleem said the unexpected reduction is positive and will help stimulate business activities by lowering borrowing costs while preserving overall economic stability.

MNCs’ association terms SBP move ‘cautious’ for fostering stability

He added that the chamber notes that a gradual approach “allows businesses to plan investment decisions with greater confidence and helps ensure that the impact of ease remains aligned with sustainable economic growth objectives”.
However, local business leaders expr­essed immediate and deep disappointment, arguing the minor adjustment fails to address the severe challenges they face.
“Such a token adjustment falls far short of what is urgently required to revive Pakistan’s fragile economy and restore business confidence,” Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Muhammad Rehan Hanif said.
Mr Hanif said the marginal cut neither reflects prevailing economic realities nor offers meaningful relief to businesses struggling under an exceptionally high cost of doing business. Despite a visible decline in inflation, borrowing costs in Pakistan remain among the highest in the region, he said.
“Regional economies such as China, India, Bangladesh, Viet­nam, Indonesia and Sri Lanka maintain single-digit interest rates, enabling their industries to access affordable financing, expand capacity, and remain competitive in global markets, while the situation in Pakistan is opposite,” Mr Hanif said.
Mr Hanif noted when the cost of financing remains prohibitively high, businesses defer expansion plans, shut down marginal units, and reduce employment, ultimately leading to lower economic output and reduced government revenues.
Echoing that sentiment, leaders from other major trade bodies said the small reduction would fail to encourage new investment or create jobs.
“The 50 basis point cut would not resolve the industries’ problems and fail to boost exports under the challenging business environment,” Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry’s (FPCCI) Senior Vice President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon said.
“The interest rate should be brought down to a single digit to at least come at par with regional peers.”
Industries are currently burdened with exorbitant energy tariffs, high fuel prices, excessive taxation and a volatile exchange rate. Business leaders argue that maintaining a high interest rate regime suffocates productive economic activity.
Ahmed Azeem Alvi, president of the SITE Association of Industry, termed the move insufficient. “People are losing jobs every day.
The government must bring the policy rate down to single digits so that the economy can breathe and employment opportunities can grow,” he said.
Alvi added that bureaucratic hurdles and IMF conditions were preventing effective decision making.
Businessman Diwan Fakhr­uddin outrightly rejected the reduction, noting that high interest rates have made bank financing difficult to obtain, forcing manufacturing units to operate below capacity and leading to rising unemployment.
He stressed that small and medium enterprises have been particularly hard hit.
“As a result, not only has the establishment of new industries come to a halt, but existing manufacturing units are also being forced to operate below capacity,” Mr Fakhruddin said.
He urged the SBP to take into account the ground realities and announce an immediate, substantial, and effective reduction in interest rates.
Pakistan Chemicals and Dyes Merchants Association Chai­rman Saleem Valimuha­mmad said if the interest rate remains at this level, it will be impossible for businesses to grow, and the overall economic growth will continue to slow down. Unless the interest rate is brought down to single digits, there will be little hope for the improvement of the economy.

Trump accused Britain’s publicly owned broadcaster of defaming him by splicing together parts of a January 6, 2021 speech, including one section where he told supporters to march on the Capitol and another where he said “fight like hell”.

 

It omitted a section in which he called for peaceful protest.
Trump’s lawsuit alleges the BBC defamed him and violated a Florida law that bars deceptive and unfair trade practices. He is seeking $5 billion in damages for each of the lawsuit’s two counts.
The BBC has apologised to Trump, admitted an error of judgment and acknowledged that the edit gave the mistaken impression that he had made a direct call for violent action. But it has said there is no legal basis to sue.
Trump, in his lawsuit filed on Monday in Miami federal court, said the BBC despite its apology “has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses”.
The BBC is funded through a mandatory license fee on all TV viewers, which UK lawyers say could make any payout to Trump politically fraught.
A spokesman for Trump’s legal team said in a statement the BBC “has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda”.
A BBC spokesperson told Reuters earlier on Monday that it had “no further contact from President Trump’s lawyers at this point. Our position remains the same.”
The broadcaster did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the lawsuit was filed.
Crisis led to resignations
Facing one of the biggest crises in its 103-year history, the BBC has said it has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary on any of its platforms.
The dispute over the clip, featured on the BBC’s ‘Panorama’ documentary show shortly before the 2024 presidential election, sparked a public relations crisis for the broadcaster, leading to the resignations of its two most senior officials.
Trump’s lawyers say the BBC caused him overwhelming reputational and financial harm.
The documentary drew scrutiny after the leak of a BBC memo by an external standards adviser that raised concerns about how it was edited, part of a wider investigation of political bias at the publicly funded broadcaster.
The documentary was not broadcast in the United States.
Trump may have sued in the US because defamation claims in Britain must be brought within a year of publication, a window that has closed for the ‘Panorama’ episode.
To overcome the US constitution’s legal protections for free speech and the press, Trump will need to prove not only that the edit was false and defamatory but also that the BBC knowingly misled viewers or acted recklessly.
The broadcaster could argue that the documentary was substantially true and its editing decisions did not create a false impression, legal experts said. It could also claim the program did not damage Trump’s reputation.
Other media have settled with Trump, including CBS and ABC when Trump sued them following his comeback win in the November 2024 election.
Trump has filed lawsuits against the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and a newspaper in Iowa, all three of which have denied wrongdoing.
The attack on the US Capitol in January 2021 was aimed at blocking Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s presidential win over Trump in the 2020 US election.</p><small>2025-12-16 02:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16072434e5b0ede.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961408/orchestrated-campaign-against-state-unearthed' target='_blank'><strong>‘Orchestrated campaign against state unearthed’</strong></a><br><p>• Talal Chaudhry claims terrorists using social media to manipulate public opinion• Alleges PTI-linked accounts creating ‘anti-state trends’• Warns citizens against becoming part of ‘paid trends’
ISLAMABAD: As he targeted the opposition for alleged social media campaigns, State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Monday claimed that Pakistan had uncovered extensive evidence of coordinated and paid online campaigns being run through fake accounts operated largely from abroad.
According to the state-run APP, the minister said the government recently provided foreign media with background information on how terrorists and organised networks were exploiting social media platforms to manipulate public opinion in Pakistan.
The minister explained that investigations revealed how artificial trends were created and sold through WhatsApp groups and other platforms.
He said individuals were paid small amounts ranging from a few rupees to cents per post to repeatedly tweet or forward messages, sometimes hundreds of times a day. Many of these accounts, he said, originate outside Pakistan and are operated by companies using fake identities. He added that account names are frequently changed depending on the campaign being promoted, making it harder to trace their origins.
The state minister claimed the same networks had been found promoting content linked to terrorist organisations, as well as ‘unrelated international causes’, demonstrating that the activity was commercial rather than ideological. These trends are not organic or natural, he added.
Mr Chaudhry clarified that the evidence shared was gathered directly from the same social media platforms being misused, including details of temporary WhatsApp groups formed to run trends and then deleted to avoid detection. He said social media companies’ own community guidelines were being violated, leading to account closures and further action by the platforms.
While emphasising that the government did not want ordinary citizens to face criminal cases, the minister issued a clear warning, saying that if people knowingly became part of paid trends that were against the country, they could face legal consequences.
Freedom of expression is not without responsibility, he said, claiming that no one had the right to hurt religious sentiments, target friendly countries, or malign individuals and institutions under the guise of free speech.
Responding to questions, Mr Chaudhry stated that most accounts involved were fake and that privacy laws limited access to IP addresses and ownership details, although Pakistan was engaging with platforms and foreign governments to address the issue. He reiterated Pakistan’s firm condemnation of terrorism in all forms, anywhere in the world, noting that the country has long been on the front line in the global fight against terrorism.
The press conference, he said, was aimed at dispelling the notion that controversial online narratives reflected genuine public opinion. This is not popularity.
This is a money-driven mechanism operated through fake accounts across the world, Mr Chaudhry said, adding that Pakistan would continue to work with international partners to curb such activities.
PTI blamed
Mr Chaudhry also accused PTI-linked social media accounts of receiving foreign funding to promote the “enemy’s narrative and target institutions by creating anti-state trends”. He said that PTI social media accounts were being operated from abroad, mainly from North America, Europe, and some parts of South Asia, and were used specifically to create trends.
He alleged that a malicious campaign was being run against state institutions on social media, vowing that no compromise would be made on national sovereignty. He regretted that the PTI was using social media to promote a ‘specific narrative’ and said coordinated campaigns were allegedly launched to unleash propaganda against national security.
He alleged that some companies auction and sell trends and hashtags. He said certain elements were actively working against the country’s sovereignty, reiterating that the government would not compromise on national security.

Pakistan Railways Rawalpindi Divisional Superintendent Noorduddin Dawar confirmed to Dawn that the Millat Express struck a police vehicle belonging to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) that suddenly tried to cross the track at an unmanned crossing, leaving two constables dead and one injured. He added that two other constables were “safe”.
“SHO (Station House Officer) RPS (railway police station) Sargodha and SHO Cantt Sargodha Punjab Police are present at the site,” he said in a message to Dawn. “This falls under the jurisdiction of Sargodha Cantt District Police. The train has moved after a brief stop.”
Muhammad Sawar Khan, an area officer for Pakistan Railways, confirmed to Dawn that the train — which left Sargodha and headed towards Charnali railway station —was running through the unmanned crossing when a police van belonging to the SIU attempted to cross.
“The driver of the police van tried to cross the unmanned crossing without looking and was hit by the train. Two police constables died in the collision and three were injured, one of whom is in critical condition,” Khan elaborated.
The two deceased cops were identified as Constables Sibtain and Amanullah, while the other three were identified as Head Constable Muhammad Owais, Constable Abrar and Driver Constable Ziafat, according to Rescue 1122 Sargodha.
Visuals of the vehicle showed that the front end of the vehicle had been completely mangled in the collision.
According to the police, the five personnel were performing a routine patrol of the area when they attempted to cross the railway track.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IG) Dr Usman Anwar took immediate notice of the incident and demanded a report from the deputy inspector general of the SIU.
Meanwhile, a Punjab Police spokesperson said that the incident was being investigated and legal action would be taken.
Pakistan Railways has some 4,072 level crossings – 1,341 manned and 2,731 unmanned – on its 8,000 kilometres or so long operational track. At least Rs4 million are required to convert an unmanned level crossing into manned one.</p><small>2025-12-15 20:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639609-moderate-earthquake-shakes-parts-of-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Magnitude-5.2 earthquake shakes parts of Karachi, Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on X, Sadiq, who also holds the special assistant to the prime minister portfolio, said he had held separate meetings with his counterparts from China and Uzbekistan on the sidelines of the Afghanistan Neighbours Conference in Tehran.
“We agreed that collective efforts needed to address this threat,” he said.







Separately, senior diplomats of Afghanistan’s six neighbouring countries and Russia, who met in Tehran on Sunday, supported all efforts to reduce tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
They expressed their readiness to help strengthen these efforts, an Iranian government statement said on Monday.
Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported that the participants also called on Islamabad and Kabul to return to the negotiating table and resolve their problems through diplomatic channels.
In October, border clashes between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban resulted in the martyrdom of 23 troops and left over 200 Taliban fighters dead, including a number of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists.
Without referring to any country, the participants opposed any attempt by foreign countries to have a military presence in Afghanistan.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for taking back Bagram Airbase, north of Kabul.
The Taliban rulers have rejected President Trump’s call.
Expressing security concerns, the special envoys announced and emphasised their readiness to assist Afghanistan in combating terrorism, drug trafficking and human trafficking.
They emphasised the responsibility of the international community to lift sanctions and release Afghan assets, according to the statement.
The US had frozen around $9 billion of Afghanistan’s state bank after the Taliban takeover in 2021.
The diplomats called on international organisations to support the return of Afghan citizens from neighboring countries to their country and to create conditions for their dignified return.
The call came at a time when the repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan and Iran is underway.
They emphasised regional integration and the centrality of the region in resolving existing issues and challenges, including some issues related to Afghanistan. They emphasised strengthening stability in Afghanistan and expressed their readiness to help achieve it if the Afghan side declares a need.
Emphasising the importance of continuing economic and trade relations with Afghanistan with the aim of improving the livelihoods of the people of that country, they pointed out the need for the country’s integration into the political and economic processes of the region.
They also stressed the responsibility of countries that are responsible for Afghanistan’s current situation to help rebuild and improve its economic and welfare situation without turning it into a political lever.
The participants agreed to hold the fifth meeting of foreign ministers of Afghanistan’s neighboring countries in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, as soon as possible.
They welcomed Pakistan’s readiness to hold the second round of the meeting of special representatives of Afghanistan’s neighboring countries in Islamabad in March 2026.</p><small>2025-12-15 18:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/152223434170356.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961287/india-charges-six-over-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>India charges six over Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>India’s counter-terrorism agency said on Monday that it had filed charges against six people in connection with a deadly attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir.
The chargesheet from India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) “charged the banned LeT/TRF as a legal entity for its role in planning, facilitating and executing the Pahalgam attack,” an agency statement alleged.
The Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned in 2002 by the Pakistan government during the rule of then-military ruler Pervez Musharraf. The Resistance Front – a little known oragnisation that was blamed by New Delhi for the attack – was recently designated as a terror group by the United States.
Three of those named are dead, while two are said to be in Indian custody.
The trio were killed by Indian security forces in a forest in held Kashmir weeks after the attack, according to NIA. Two local men, Parvaiz Ahmad and Bashir Ahmad Jothatd, arrested in June on charges of harbouring the attackers, have also been charged.
Pahalgam was the site where gunmen killed 26 tourists on April 22. India blamed the attack on Pakistan, without evidence – an allegation that Islamabad had strongly denied while calling for a neutral investigation – triggering a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures that escalated into a four-day conflict in May of this year.
After the four-day conflict, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to send a diplomatic delegation to important world capitals in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India. He entrusted the PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to lead the delegation.
Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the attack, Indian forces arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes in a sweeping crackdown.
The arrests were carried out across multiple districts, including Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara, Baramulla, Budgam, Islamabad, Pulwama, Shopian and Kulgam.</p><small>2025-12-15 18:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/152209410c65d21.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961286/militants-blow-up-girls-school-in-north-waziristans-mir-ali' target='_blank'><strong>Militants blow up girl’s school in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali</strong></a><br><p>In another attack targeting educational institutions, a government school for girls in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali was destroyed by explosives, spreading fear and anxiety among students.
Last week, unidentified militants blew up a government primary school in the same district, jeopardising the future of more than 600 school-going children.
The latest incident occurred in Eppi village, according to the police. The attackers planted explosive material inside the school building during the night, triggering a powerful blast that completely destroyed the structure.
According to government officials, around 250 girls were enrolled at the school. It was the only educational institution for girls in the area, where students used to travel from far-flung localities for education.
Police officials said the school was closed at the time of the explosion and no loss of life was reported. However, the blast caused severe damage to government property. Following the incident, panic gripped the area. Police reached the site, collected evidence, and launched an investigation against unknown perpetrators.
The targeting of two educational institutions within a week has raised grave concerns among students and parents in the area.
Reacting to the incident, a local tribal elder said, “Targeting educational institutions is an attack on the future of the entire nation. The tribal people will not tolerate such elements under any circumstances, and the government must immediately expose and bring the culprits to justice.”
Meanwhile, the district administration strongly condemned the attack and stated that security at schools was being further strengthened.
“Attacks on educational institutions are intolerable. Strict action will be taken against those involved, and additional security measures are being implemented to protect schools,” said the administration.
Local parents and members of civil society have also urged the authorities to ensure continuity of education by swiftly reconstructing the damaged school buildings and establishing lasting peace in the area.
In October, an explosion at a girls’ primary school in Lakki Marwat district partially damaged the building.
Last year in May, a private girls’ school was blown up by unidentified militants in Tehsil Shewa of North Waziristan district. Similar attacks also took place in May 2023 when two government schools for girls in Mirali were blown up. No loss of life was reported in the incidents.</p><small>2025-12-15 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15221945d5b0e4a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961284/cop-civilian-martyred-as-terrorists-raid-bank-in-balochistans-panjgur' target='_blank'><strong>Cop, civilian martyred as terrorists raid bank in Balochistan’s Panjgur</strong></a><br><p>A policeman and a civilian were martyred when terrorists attacked and looted a bank in Balochistan’s Panjgur area, according to police officials.
According to police sources, a clash erupted when terrorists attempted to raid a private bank in Panjgur city and police responded, triggering a gun battle.
Dara Khan, a constable with the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), was martyred, while another civilian was killed. A source added that two policemen were also injured in the gun battle, while the suspects fled the scene.
AFP, citing a police official, reported that Rs1 million had been stolen.
Panjgur SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) Dost Muhammad Bugti told the media that the suspects arrived in four vehicles and that two bank raids were foiled after police responded.
“If police had not responded, then all five banks in the city would have been robbed,” he said.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti issued a statement praising the response by the police and CTD, lauding them for ensuring the “safety of the lives and property of the people with extraordinary bravery and professionalism”.
“I salute the courage, sense of duty and great sacrifice of martyred CTD constable Dara Khan during the operation,” CM Bugti was quoted as saying. “The sacrifices of brave sons like shaheed (martyred) Dara Khan will never be forgotten. The nation is indebted to the blood of these great martyrs.”
The Balochistan CM added that there is no place for criminals or terrorists in the province and vowed that the state would forcefully pursue anti-national elements.
“The sacrifices of the security forces for the establishment of law and order will never go in vain,” CM Bugti vowed.
On November 30, security forces killed at least three terrorists in retaliatory action after one of the attackers blew himself up at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Balochistan’s Nokkundi, according to a statement issued by the spokesperson for FC Balochistan South.
Pakistan has witnessed an increase in terror activities, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended a ceasefire with the government in November 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, it had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.</p><small>2025-12-15 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15194654cc612c7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961280/atc-lahore-hands-35-year-imprisonment-to-banned-tlp-leader-for-inciting-violence-against-chief-justice' target='_blank'><strong>ATC Lahore hands 35-year imprisonment to banned TLP leader for inciting violence against chief justice</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore sentenced on Monday Zaheerul Hassan Shah, the deputy chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), to 35 years in prison for inciting the public against the then chief justice of Pakistan.
At one of the gatherings outside the Lahore Press Club, where TLP chief Saad Rizvi was also in attendance, Shah delivered remarks amounting to incitement of violence against then Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa.
Qila Gujjar Singh police had registered the case against the cleric in 2024, pertaining to his speech for inciting violence against the top judge of the Supreme Court for issuing the judgment in the Mubarak Sani case.
The FIR, filed on the complaint of Station House Officer Hammad Hussain, was registered under sections 6 (terrorism), 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism), and 11W (printing, publishing, or disseminating any material to incite hatred or giving projection to any person convicted for a terrorist act or any proscribed organisation or an organisation placed under observation) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.
Judge Arshad Javed announced the guilty verdict and handed over the custody of the convict to the superintendent of the central jail Kot Lakhpat.
During the trial, the prosecution presented 15 witnesses in support of the charges against the cleric. Deputy Prosecutor Abdul Jabbar Dogar sought punishment for the accused under the law.
On behalf of the cleric, Advocate Rana Maqsoodul Haq presented final arguments, urging the court to acquit his client.
However, the defence counsel did not fully deny the veracity of the allegations.
The judge awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment to the accused under section 7(1)(b), five-year imprisonment each under sections 7(g), 21(L) and 11 (w) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.
The judge also awarded the accused separate jail terms of seven years, three years, and six months under Sections 505, 117, and 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
A collective fine of Rs600,000 was also imposed on the party leader under the provisions of the ATA.
Several FIRs were also registered against the TLP leaders and workers in different cities after Shah had issued a call for violence against Chief Justice Isa.
Strong condemnation surfaced from political circles and clerics after the incident.
Pakistani government officials vowed to take strict action against “those spreading lies,” stating that elements with “vested political interests” were “spreading blood and violence” in the name of religion.
The defence minister said that the Supreme Court had issued a judgment in the Mubarak Sani case, but the elements concerned were still spreading propaganda based on lies.
“The state will not allow you to issue a fatwa (decree) to kill someone. If we allow this, the writ of the state will crumble,” Asif had said.
Information Minister Atta Tarar had asserted that there was “no space in our society” for such inciting remarks, adding that there were “political motives” behind them. He further highlighted that a case under the anti-terrorism laws had been registered.
He also called out the religio-political group for issuing “politically motivated false statements” against the top judge and said that there was no room for such rhetoric in Pakistan.
“There is no room for such statements in the State of Pakistan, and it will not be tolerated,” Tarar said on the X platform.







The federal cabinet banned the religio-political group TLP under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) in October, days after nationwide protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad.
The group, founded in 2015 as a movement, turned into a political party in 2016. It had also faced a ban by the Imran Khan-led government in 2021 after violent protests.</p><small>2025-12-15 17:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639576-tlp-leader-sentenced-to-355-years-for-threats-against-former-cjp-isa' target='_blank'><strong>TLP leader sentenced to over 35 years for threats against ex-CJP Isa</strong></a><br><p>

On November 25, 2025, the presidents of the UN General Assembly and the Security Council jointly invited all 193 member states to nominate candidates for the post. In a noteworthy departure from past practice, their letter expressly encourages member states to nominate a woman while also underscoring the importance of regional diversity.
“Noting with regret that no woman has ever held the position of secretary‑general, and convinced of the need to guarantee equal opportunities for women and men in gaining access to senior decision‑making positions, Member States are encouraged to strongly consider nominating women as candidates,“ they wrote.
All nine individuals who have previously led the United Nations in its 80‑year history have been men, a fact that critics and diplomats alike increasingly view as a glaring symbol of gender inequality at the highest level of global diplomacy.
A historic moment for gender equality
Calls for a woman to lead the United Nations have grown louder in 2025, with voices from capitals worldwide urging a break from an unbroken tradition that has excluded women from the organisation’s most powerful seat.
At the 80th UN General Assembly, numerous leaders spoke out. Estonia’s President Alar Karis said it was “high time for a woman to be chosen as UN secretary‑general,” explicitly linking gender equality to broader efforts to strengthen the organisation. Slovenia’s President Nataša Pirc Musar echoed this, declaring: “By the end of this session, she should be joined by a madam secretary‑general‑elect.”
Rebeca Grynspan, who was formally nominated by Costa Rica in October 2025, has strongly embraced this narrative. In an interview with Reuters, she said, “We don’t need special treatment. What we are really asking for is no discrimination… equal treatment. If equality will prevail, we will be able to get there.”

Grynspan’s emphasis on equal treatment underscores the subtle shift in diplomatic rhetoric: many states are advocating not just for a woman SG, but for a selection that reflects merit, inclusivity, and diversity, challenging traditional power dynamics within the United Nations.

Civil society organisations and advocacy coalitions such as 1 for 8 Billion and the Global Network of Women Peacebuilders note that dozens of countries have in recent months pressed the UN to consider gender balance in its leadership, with indirect or direct references to the need for the next secretary‑general to be a woman.
Beyond gender: Gaza, credibility, and trust
The push for the first woman secretary‑general is not happening in isolation. The United Nations’ credibility has been intensely debated over its response to the Gaza crisis, where humanitarian needs remain severe and civilian suffering has persisted despite repeated appeals from UN agencies for humanitarian access and protection.
Leaders at the 80th General Assembly condemned the violence and urged action. Jordan’s King Abdullah II described what is happening in Gaza as “one of the darkest moments in the history of the organisation,” questioning the effectiveness of repeated UN statements without tangible protection mechanisms. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan went further, accusing global institutions of failing to safeguard civilians.
This sense of institutional frustration factors into discussions about the next secretary‑general. Many diplomats and analysts believe that gender representation — particularly candidate models associated with empathy, inclusivity, and a focus on humanitarian issues — could be positively correlated with public trust in a UN perceived to be lagging in crisis leadership.
The power dynamics: US, China, Russia and the Security Council veto
Despite mounting support for a woman leader and the broader narrative of inclusion, the realpolitik of the Security Council will likely determine the final outcome. Under Article 97 of the UN Charter, the secretary‑general is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council, where the five permanent members (P5) — the United States, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France — hold veto power.
In October 2025, the United States made its position clear. Deputy US Ambassador Dorothy Shea told the Security Council that the next leader should be chosen in a “purely merit‑based” process with as wide a pool of candidates as possible and that nominees should come from all regional groupings. “The next secretary‑general should bring the UN back to basics… help achieve the bold vision of peace and prosperity” envisioned by the founders, Shea said, invoking former secretary‑general Dag Hammarskjöld’s mission to save humanity from “hell.”
This statement reflects a broader trend in US policy under the Trump administration, which has sought to shape the UN’s leadership while also pressing for institutional reforms.
Washington’s position on this issue increasingly frames the contest in terms of US-desired institutional reforms and alignment with US priorities, even as it acknowledges the momentum behind gender equality.
It’s a known fact that the United States wields considerable influence, but it’s also obvious that China and Russia could veto a candidate seen as advancing US-centric policies.
Russia’s Ambassador to the UN., Vassily Nebenzia, has made the country’s perspective clear: gender is one of many factors, but “merit comes before gender,” and the customary practice of regional rotation should not be dismissed — a point underplayed in Washington.

China, long cautious about overt commentary on gender in high‑level UN politics, has recently signalled that it “would also be pleased to see female candidates presented by Member States.“

But like Moscow, Beijing, too, wants to retain regional rotation while choosing the next secretary-general.
This matters because, despite growing public calls for gender balance, the permanent members wield effective vetoes at the Security Council stage, meaning any candidate must be acceptable to all five for the process to move forward.
Regional rotation and the Latin America factor
Another layer of complexity involves the informal but powerful norm of regional rotation, which has shaped past secretary‑general selections despite not being mandated by the UN Charter. When António Guterres of Portugal was appointed in 2016, Latin America and the Caribbean were widely expected to be next under the customary cycle. The formal start of the nomination period in late 2025 came with renewed emphasis on this unwritten practice.
Latin American leaders have been outspoken about this. Chile’s President Gabriel Boric, while endorsing Michelle Bachelet, framed it as “Latin America’s moment” — not just geographically, but as a region ready to offer leadership on peace, climate justice, and sustainable development.
Costa Rica’s nomination of Rebeca Grynspan, a candidate with a long record in development and multilateral leadership, further reflects this regional push and the broader narrative that the next UN leader should reflect both geographic and gender diversity.
Institutional renewal or geopolitical compromise?
Analysts note that much depends on how member states balance gender advocacy with larger geopolitical interests. A strong push for a woman secretary‑general could unify a majority of member states; research shows that at least 94 countries have recently expressed some form of concern about gender imbalance in the UN’s top ranks, ranging from indirect support to strong advocacy for a woman leader.
But without consensus from the Security Council’s permanent members, even broad General Assembly support may not be enough to secure a nomination. For emerging candidates — particularly women and those from the Global South — navigating the interests and red lines of the United States, Russia, China, Britain, and France will be pivotal.
Why this moment matters
As the nomination process moves into 2026, formal candidacies will be wired to the Security Council, and a series of secret straw polls will begin. These will reveal preference patterns and potential vetoes well before the General Assembly’s final vote later in the year. At stake is not just another leadership transition, but a measure of whether the United Nations can evolve in a world where dozens of crises — from Gaza to Ukraine to climate change — challenge its capacity to act effectively.

Another possibility, although not very visible, is selecting a Muslim woman. It would be historic and would represent not just a symbolic break with decades of male leadership, but a broader acknowledgement of the changing face of global diplomacy.

It would also send a strong signal to millions around the world — especially in societies where gender inequality persists — that the world’s most universal institution is committed to reflecting the diversity of its membership in its highest office.
Muslim Women in the UN: A Possible Path
While no Muslim woman is currently an official candidate, several senior Muslim women hold influential roles within the UN system — showing that such a candidacy is possible under UN rules:
Amina J. Mohammed (Nigeria/UK) — Deputy Secretary‑General, the second‑highest position in the Secretariat.
Nihal Saad (Egypt) — Director of the UN Alliance of Civilizations.
Maimunah Mohd Sharif (Malaysia) — Former head of UN‑Habitat and an Under‑Secretary‑General.
These leaders embody the capacity for both gender and religious diversity at senior UN levels, even if none has yet entered the secretary‑general race.
The process is inevitably shaped by power, politics, and compromise. The United States’ strategic vision, Russia’s emphasis on merit and regional rotation, China’s newly expressed openness, and the fact that all permanent members wield veto power mean that the outcome is far from certain — even if a woman is now the most probable choice.
What is clear, however, is that this race is not simply about filling a leadership position: it is about what kind of United Nations the world wants at a time of profound global challenge.

The development comes after the Punjab government lifted a ban on the Basant festival after 18 years, with the festival slated to be celebrated in February next year. The festival was banned in 2007 because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp kite strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders.
Under the bill, flying kites with metallic wires, nylon cord or strings coated with glass or other sharp materials is prohibited, along with the manufacturing, transport, storage and sale of kites and hazardous strings.
Violators involved in kite-flying could face three to five years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs2 million, while those manufacturing or selling banned materials may be punished with five to seven years in jail and fines up to Rs5m.
All offences under the proposed law will be cognisable and non-bailable.
The bill empowers deputy commissioners to allow “permissible kite-flying” on specific days and at designated locations, subject to government approval and strict conditions. However, the use of sharp or metallic strings will remain banned under all circumstances.
Special provisions are included in the bill that deal with children involved in kite-flying. Minors will be tried under the Juvenile Justice System Act and be fined Rs50,000 for the first offence and Rs100,000 for repeat violations, with parents or guardians held financially responsible in case of default.
The proposed law also introduces the mandatory registration of kite manufacturers, traders and sellers of permissible kite-flying material, as well as kite-flying associations. Police officers not below the rank of sub-inspector will be empowered to arrest offenders without a warrant, conduct searches and seize illegal materials.
To encourage enforcement, the bill includes a whistleblower reward of up to Rs5,000 for providing credible information about violations.
If passed by the provincial assembly, the new law will repeal earlier kite-flying ordinances and establish a uniform, province-wide regulatory framework aimed at protecting lives and public safety.
Kite-flying, particularly in Punjab, has been outlawed due to severe and sometimes fatal accidents.
Last July, a 13-year-old boy was electrocuted while catching a stray kite in Kasur’s Basti Lal Shah area.
The boy rushed to catch a stray kite attached to a metal string. The metal string fell on the transmission line before he caught it.
In March last year, a motorcyclist died after a metal string, believed to be part of a stray kite, cut his throat in Faisalabad. Following the incident, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz ordered a crackdown on those involved in kite-flying.
The provincial government intensified its crackdown on kite-flying by declaring kite-making, flying, and transportation as non-bailable offences in August 2024.</p><small>2025-12-15 15:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15192347070a96c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961278/hero-who-disarmed-bondi-gunman-recovers-in-hospital-as-donations-pour-in' target='_blank'><strong>‘Hero’ who disarmed Bondi gunman recovers in hospital as donations pour in</strong></a><br><p>Donations for a Sydney man who wrestled a gun from one of the alleged attackers during a mass shooting at Bondi Beach have surged past Australian dollars (A$)1.1 million ($744,000), as he recovers in hospital after surgery for bullet wounds.
Forty-three-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed, a father-of-two, hid behind parked cars before charging at one of the gunmen from behind, seizing his rifle and knocking him to the ground. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ahmed’s bravery saved lives.
“What we’ve seen in the last 24 hours was the worst of humanity in a terrorist act. But we also saw an example of the best of humanity in Ahmed Al Ahmed running towards danger, putting his own life at risk,” Albanese told state broadcaster ABC News.
He was shot twice by a second perpetrator, Albanese said. Ahmed’s family said he was hit in the hand and arm.
Australian police on Monday said a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son carried out the attack at a Jewish celebration on Sunday afternoon, killing 15 people in the country’s worst mass shooting in almost 30 years.
Hailed a hero for disarming the gunman
Ahmed’s father, Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed, told ABC News in an interview that his son was an Australian citizen and sells fruits and vegetables.
“My son is a hero. He served in the police; he has the passion to defend people. When he saw people lying on the ground and the blood, quickly his conscience pushed him to attack one of the terrorists and take away his weapon,” Mohamed Fateh said.
Jozay Alkanji, Ahmed’s cousin, said he had had initial surgery and may need more.
Ahmed pictured in hospital
Tributes have poured in from leaders both abroad and at home.Chris Minns, the Premier of New South Wales where Sydney is located, said in a social media post that he visited Ahmed at St George Hospital and conveyed the gratitude of people across the state.
“Ahmed is a real-life hero,” his post said. “Thank you, Ahmed.” A photo showed Minns at his bedside, and Ahmed propped on pillows with his left arm in a cast.







US President Donald Trump called Ahmed “a very, very brave person” who saved many lives.
A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$1.1 million within one day. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman was the largest donor, contributing A$99,999 and sharing the fundraiser on his X account.
Supporters thank Ahmed for saving lives
Outside St George Hospital, strangers came to show their support.
Misha and Veronica Pochuev left flowers for Ahmed with their seven-year-old daughter, Miroslava.
“My husband is Russian, my father is Jewish, my grandpa is Muslim. This is not only about Bondi, this is about every person,” Veronica said.
Yomna Touni, 43, stayed at the hospital for hours to offer assistance on behalf of a Muslim-run charity also raising funds for Ahmed.
“The intention is to raise as much money as possible for his speedy recovery,” she said.</p><small>2025-12-15 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15185101197d067.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961275/punjab-to-field-new-riot-control-force-for-unlawful-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab to field new riot control force for ‘unlawful’ protests</strong></a><br><p>Punjab is set to raise a separate force for handling “unlawful” protests and mobs, as the Punjab Assembly’s Standing Committee on Home Affairs on Monday cleared a sweeping amendment to the Police Order, 2002, to tighten control over riots, violent protests and unlawful assemblies across the province.
The proposed Police Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2025, introduces a dedicated Riot Management Unit (RMU), empowered to manage riots across Punjab with modern gear and training specifically for crowd control.
The RMU will operate under an additional inspector general of police (AIG), supervised by the provincial police officer.
A key feature of the bill is the formal declaration of “riot zones.” Under the new law, the deputy commissioner and district police officer can jointly declare any affected area a riot zone, allowing authorities to cordon off roads, evacuate civilians and appoint an incident commander to coordinate all departments during operations.
The bill grants legal protection to police and RMU personnel for actions taken “in good faith” during riot control, shielding them from lawsuits and prosecutions for lawful use of force.
To strengthen accountability, the amendment makes organisers, instigators and facilitators of riots financially liable. Courts will be required to order compensation for deaths, injuries, mental trauma and property damage caused during riots or unlawful assemblies.
Compensation will be recoverable as arrears of land revenue, with up to three years’ imprisonment for default.
A new chapter, ‘Offences in the Riot Zone’, prescribes up to 10 years’ imprisonment and fines up to Rs500,000 for attacks on police, law enforcement personnel or private individuals, as well as for damage to public or private property.
Such offences will be cognisable, non-bailable and tried by sessions courts on a day-to-day basis, with a mandatory decision within 30 days.
The bill also bars accused persons from transferring property once a case is registered and restricts foreign travel without court permission. The use of modern surveillance technology, including Safe City cameras, is allowed, with video and photographic evidence declared admissible in court.
According to the statement of objects, the amendments seek to address rising public unrest, violent protests and attacks on law enforcement, while ensuring compensation for victims and clearer legal cover for police action.
The bill will now move to the Punjab Assembly floor for enactment.
This development comes several months after the religio-political party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) had begun a protest march in Lahore, which turned violent.
The party — which has a history of violent protests — had set out for what it described as a “Gaza solidarity” march, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. Ahead of its planned march, roads had been blocked in multiple areas of Punjab and mobile internet services suspended in the federal capital and Rawalpindi.
The TLP protesters had camped at Muridke on the night of October 11, the very first day of their march, and later stayed there until an operation by law enforcement personnel on October 13 that resulted in their dispersal.
Dawn reported that the marchers were unable to move forward due to large trenches dug by the district administration along the main GT Road.
Meanwhile, throughout the duration of the protest, reports of clashes between TLP activists and law enforcement personnel kept emerging.
On October 12, law enforcement agencies, including Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) and large contingents of police from five districts, were dispatched to Muridke and were reported to have surrounded the TLP protest camp, in what appeared to be preparations for a large-scale operation.
Subsequently, law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Oct 13 to dismantle the party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests.
In the wake of the violence, the federal government banned the TLP under the Anti-Terrorism Act on October 24, after receiving a recommendation from the Punjab government to place them on the Fourth Schedule of the ATA — a list of proscribed individuals who are suspected of terrorism and/or sectarianism.</p><small>2025-12-15 14:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151818152283265.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961273/mqm-p-proposes-disbursing-local-bodies-share-through-nfc-as-provinces-fail-to-transfer-funds-to-districts' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P proposes disbursing local bodies’ share through NFC as provinces fail to transfer funds to districts</strong></a><br><p>Federal Health Minister and Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Mustafa Kamal shared key features of his party’s draft constitutional amendment, proposing the disbursement of districts’ shares through the National Finance Commission (NFC) as the provinces failed to transfer funds to local bodies.
He was addressing a gathering held at the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industries on Monday.
Kamal said regional autonomy comes when all stakeholders are empowered and autonomous decision-making powers are devolved from the chief minister to union council chairmen.
He said that there is a mechanism for disbursing funds from the federal government to the provinces, but no mechanism for transferring funds from provinces to local bodies.
“It’s up to a person’s will to either grant Rs1,000 billion to someone or to grant nothing to another.”
He highlighted that Article 140a of the Constitution stressed the devolution of political, administrative, and financial powers to elected local representatives.
“Every CM interprets this according to his own will,” the health minister said.
MQM-P leader said, “Our party held deliberations and drafted a constitutional amendment to propose some structural reforms in the NFC divisible pool.”
Kamal maintained that the constitutional amendment draft prepared by his party proposed disbursing the shares of districts and local bodies through the same mechanism used to transfer federal funds to the provinces.
“We want to add the districts in the central divisible pool of the NFC as the provinces are, so the local bodies may get their shares directly from federal government without the intervention of provinces.”
The former mayor of Karachi lamented that his tenure as the mayor ended in 2010; however, the local bodies election held in 2015 was held on the orders of the Supreme Court.
He criticised the then-provincial government for running the affairs of a metropolitan city through a government-appointed administrator rather than a people-elected mayor.
“Can you imagine cities like New York or Shanghai even running for five days without a mayor?” he boasted.
The minister said Karachi was among the 12 rapidly developing cities when he was the mayor.
“I feel saddened by the current situation of this city, as Karachi has now become one of the four worst cities to live in.”
Kamal said, “I have said multiple times on the floor of the parliament that the IMF cannot lift our country from this economic quagmire, but Karachi can.”
“There are two operational seaports in Pakistan, which serve as the economic gateway; both are situated in Karachi, but sadly, this city doesn’t have quality drinking water,” he grieved.
“The tanker mafia steals our city’s water to sell to us because powerful circles are backing them.”
He added that the country’s external enemies cannot harm us; the real threat comes from enemies within.
Kamal also responded to critics of his party for being in government but unable to deliver.
“These ministries that we have are not a benediction bestowed upon us; I handle them with utmost care,” he said.
He added that his party is here to utilise whatever space remains to deliver results.
“We voice our concerns at all the relevant platforms; authorities listen to us, acknowledge our concerns; however, we need an immediate fix.”
“No one ignores the potential of Karachi, no one says that we don’t want to fix the issues of this city, but when will this fixation begin? No one knows.”
He retorted to his political opponents, “We are not in power in this city nor in this province. Those who have been in power could have sidelined us from politics through their performance, but why do people still remember what Mustafa Kamal did?”
“We have never extended our hands in front of anyone for any favour; we want to fix the system through the constitution.”
The federal minister deplored the structural gaps in the system. He said that he feels helpless against the system of this country, as even the transfers and postings in his own ministry are approved by the cabinet.
“It’s already too late. I am scared of reaching the point of no return.”</p><small>2025-12-15 14:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151456016e17c0e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961265/central-bank-slashes-policy-rate-by-50-bps-to-105pc' target='_blank'><strong>Central bank slashes policy rate by 50 bps to 10.5pc</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday reduced its policy rate by 50 basis points to 10.5 per cent, effective from December 16.
In a statement, the monetary policy committee (MPC) noted that inflation remained within the 5-7pc target range on average during July-November FY26, though it said that core inflation proved to be “relatively sticky”.
“On balance, the inflation outlook remains broadly unchanged, mainly owing to the relatively benign global commodity prices and anchored inflation expectations, amidst [a] prudent monetary policy stance,” the statement read.
The MPC further observed that economic activity was increasing based on an improvement in key high-frequency indicators, including a higher-than-anticipated increase in large-scale manufacturing during the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year.







“Nonetheless, the committee noted that the global environment remains challenging, particularly for exports, which may have some implications for the macroeconomic outlook,” the statement read.
“In this backdrop, while ensuring the ongoing price stability, the MPC noted the available space to reduce the policy rate to support sustainable economic growth.”
Additionally, the committee observed some developments since its last meeting in May, namely a rising unemployment rate from 2020-21, increasing foreign exchange reserves and “sizeable” debt repayments and increasing consumer confidence. It did note that business confidence “moderated slightly”.
“Led by sizable SBP profit transfer, the overall and primary fiscal balances recorded surpluses during Q1-FY26,” the statement read. “The global environment remains fluid, characterised by generally supportive commodity prices, but also evolving tariff-related dynamics and challenging financial conditions.”
The MPC added that high-frequency indicators support previous assessments of ongoing momentum in sectors, such as large-scale manufacturing. It further noted that the sale of automobiles, fertiliser, cement and the imports of machinery and intermediate goods, “all signal a positive outlook for industrial activity”.
On the other hand, the committee said that the ongoing challenging export environment poses some risks for industrial outlook.
“In the agriculture sector, incoming information about major crops also support the previous assessment,” the statement read. “The latest information on area under wheat crop, input conditions and government-backed incentive schemes indicates that wheat production may surpass the target.”
The MPC stated that these positive developments are likely to support the services sector and real GDP growth for FY26 is expected to remain in the upper half of the earlier projected range of 3.25–4.25pc.
In terms of the external sector, the MPC said that the current account posted a cumulative deficit of $0.7 billion during July-October FY26, in line with its expectations. Imports continued to grow with improving economic activity and workers’ remittances remained resilient.
“However, exports came under pressure, largely owing to a sharp decline in food exports, particularly rice,” the statement read.
“On the financing side, net inflows remained tepid. Despite this, SBP’s FX (foreign exchange) reserves have crossed the December 2025 target of $15.5bn, led by continued FX purchases by the central bank,” it added.
The statement added that changing trade dynamics may constrain Pakistan’s exports, while lower global oil prices may contain imports.
“On balance, the assessment for the current account is broadly unchanged, and the deficit is projected to remain within 0 to 1pc of GDP in FY26,” the MPC said. “Moreover, with the realisation of planned official inflows, SBP’s FX reserves are projected to strengthen to $17.8bn by June 2026.”
The MPC noted that in Q1-FY26, both the overall and primary balances recorded surpluses, thanks to the transfer of sizeable SBP profit.
“At the same time, the expenditure to GDP ratio remained lower than last year’s comparable level, which also contributed to this fiscal performance,” the statement read.
“Meanwhile, the FBR (Federal Board of Revenue) collection slowed down considerably to 10.2pc [year-on-year] during July-November FY26, implying significant acceleration required to achieve the budgeted tax collection target in the remaining seven months of FY26,” it added.
The committee further said that interest payments were expected to be lower than the budgeted amount for the year and help contain the fiscal deficit.
“The MPC underscored the importance of structural reforms, especially to broaden the tax base and privatise loss-making SOEs (state-owned enterprises), to strengthen fiscal buffers while creating space for public investment and needed spending for socioeconomic uplift,” the statement added.
According to the statement, since the committee’s last meeting, broad money growth accelerated to 14.9pc as of November 28. Due to borrowing by key sectors like textiles, wholesale and retail and chemicals, private sector credit ballooned by Rs187bn between July and November.
“Consumer financing, particularly automobile loans, remained strong in the wake of easing financial conditions, improved consumer sentiments and a stable macroeconomic environment,” the statement read.
“On the liability side, currency in circulation broadly remained unchanged, whereas an increase in deposits led to a moderate decline in the currency-to-deposits ratio.”
The MPC also observed that headline inflation remained within the medium-term target range over the past three months, with food, energy and core components of inflation beginning to converge.
“In this context, the prudent monetary policy stance, complemented by fiscal discipline, is helping stabilise inflation within the target range, despite recent supply-side frictions and relatively sticky core inflation,” the committee stated. “Moreover, inflation expectations also remain anchored.”
However, inflation is expected to rise past the target range towards the end of the current fiscal year, before reverting to base levels in FY2027.
“The committee noted that this outlook is subject to risks from volatile global commodity prices, magnitude and timing of energy price adjustments, fiscal slippages, and uncertainty around prices of wheat and allied products and perishable food items,” the statement added.
‘A welcome move’
In a statement from his office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his satisfaction with the cut in interest rates, hailing the move as a “harbinger of … improvement of the business community and the common man”.
“By the grace of Allah, the hard work of the government’s economic team is bearing fruit, the PM said, praising Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and his team for their efforts.
“There is economic stability in the country and Pakistan is moving towards development,” he added. “The business community and the public have made sacrifices for economic stability. The economic improvement is providing relief to the public as much as possible.”
The PM said that small and medium-sized businesses will benefit the most from the reduction in interest rates and access to loans at low cost.
Yousuf M Farooq, the research director at Chase Securities, called the cut “a welcome move”, provided the current account stays contained and the exchange rate can act as a shock absorber if external pressures re-emerge.
“Lower rates should be supportive for equities by lifting valuation multiples and easing financing costs, particularly for leveraged sectors,” he told Dawn.
“It should also help stimulate domestic demand while reducing the government’s interest expense.”
Farooq noted that while a 50bps reduction is not material on its own, it clearly signals the direction of policy in the coming months.
Meanwhile, AKD Securities Research Director Avais Ashraf told Dawn that the slashed rate would improve domestic industry and make exports more competitive.
“We expect its impact on trade imbalance to remain manageable as food supplies improve,” he said.
Ashraf noted that the recent surge in trade balance was caused by a disruption in food supplies amid higher rains and floods in the monsoon season this year.
“Higher food imports and lower food exports exert pressure on [the] current account that remain manageable given robust remittances and manageable interest payments,” he stated.
Ashraf expressed concern over the growing import of automobiles, which is increasing despite government restrictions on financing terms.
Topline Securities wrote in an X post that the slashed policy rate was a “surprise”, as they expected the rates to remain unchanged.
“In last four monetary policy meetings, [the] SBP observed [the] status quo. [The] last cut of 100bps was announced in [a] May 5, 2025 meeting,” the post read.







The last reduction in the policy rate came in May. Since then, the benchmark rate has been held at 11pc, even as headline inflation dipped to 3pc earlier this year. November inflation was recorded at 6.1pc, compared to 6.2pc in October.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had advised maintaining tight liquidity to curb expected inflation, despite mounting industry pressure.
In a second review released on Thursday, the Fund said the monetary policy needed to remain “appropriately tight and data-dependent” to keep expectations anchored, while noting that the SBP had maintained positive real interest rates on a forward-looking basis.
It said the tight stance had been pivotal in reducing inflation and should be maintained to ensure price stability and support the rebuilding of external buffers.
Industrial leaders had previously called for a reduction in interest rates to help them stay competitive globally.</p><small>2025-12-15 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639535-soldier-martyred-seven-terrorists-killed-in-di-khan-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Soldier martyred, seven terrorists killed in DI Khan IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crackdown was launched on migrant smuggling following the Greece boat tragedy in 2024, one which claimed several Pakistani lives.
In a statement issued today, the minister stated that PM Shehbaz had formed a “special committee” to look into the issue of offloading passengers at airports and to ensure safe migration.
“Recently, despite having complete documentation, some passengers have still been offloaded,” the minister said. “People who held valid visas were offloaded as well.”
The committee will prepare “recommendations regarding the safe migration of people,” the minister was quoted as saying.
He detailed that a meeting of the committee is expected this week.
“By the end of January, we will prepare proposals to address these issues, “ he shared, stressing that safe migration was a “fundamental right”.
The minister also lauded the International Organisation of Migration’s (IOM) work for ensuring safe migration.
Last month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, in a visit to the Islamabad airport, said that no passenger in possession of “genuine and complete documents” should be barred from travelling abroad.
On November 27, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or if authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.</p><small>2025-12-15 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/151724244235b3a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961270/soldier-martyred-in-di-khan-counter-insurgency-operation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Soldier martyred in DI Khan counter-insurgency operation: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A soldier was martyred during a counter-insurgency operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district on Monday, in which seven terrorists were killed, the military’s media wing said in a statement.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in DI Khan’s Kulachi area on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, seven khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement read.
During the battle, Naik Yasir Khan, 34, a resident of Mardan, embraced martyrdom after “having fought gallantly [and] paid the ultimate sacrifice”, the ISPR said.
The statement added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activity in the area.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as the relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Earlier, security forces killed 13 terrorists in two IBOs across KP, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday.
“On 12-13 December 2025, thirteen khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the ISPR said in a statement.
It said that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of the terrorists in KP’s Mohmand district, while the other was carried out in Bannu.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.
Last month, security forces eliminated 22 terrorists during an operation in the Bannu district.</p><small>2025-12-15 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639515-three-children-injured-as-ferris-wheel-collapses-in-sialkot' target='_blank'><strong>Three children injured as Ferris wheel collapses in Sialkot</strong></a><br><p>

In an interview with CNN Business Arabia, Aurangzeb highlighted the vision of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which reflected Pakistan’s renewed economic confidence and reform momentum.
He said that Pakistan has followed a comprehensive macroeconomic stabilisation program for the past 18 months, which has delivered tangible and measurable results, while inflation has declined to single-digit levels from an unprecedented 38%.
On the fiscal front, Pakistan has achieved primary surpluses, while the current account deficit remains well within targeted limits. According to the finance czar, the exchange rate has also stabilised, and foreign exchange reserves have improved to approximately 2.5 months of import cover, reflecting strengthening external buffers.
He maintained that the country has two major external validations, which indicate Pakistan’s improving economic outlook.
Firstly, he said, all three international credit rating agencies have aligned their assessments this year by upgrading Pakistan’s ratings and outlook. On the other hand, the country has completed the second review under the IMF Extended Fund Facility, with the IMF Executive Board granting its approval earlier this week.
He stated that such developments demonstrate growing international confidence in Pakistan’s economic management and reform trajectory.
The finance minister further emphasised that macroeconomic stabilisation has been achieved through a coordinated approach combining disciplined monetary and fiscal policies with an ambitious structural reform agenda.
“Reforms are being implemented across key areas, including taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises, public financial management, and privatisation, aimed at consolidating stability and laying the foundation for sustainable growth,” Aurangzeb said.
The finance minister also highlighted the significant progress in Pakistan’s improvement of the tax-to-GDP ratio.
“During the last fiscal year, it increased to 10.3 per cent, with a clear path towards 11 per cent,” the finance minister said.
He further explained the government’s objective to reach a level of tax collection that ensures fiscal sustainability over the medium to long term.
“This is being pursued through widening the tax base by bringing previously undertaxed but economically significant sectors such as real estate, agriculture, and wholesale and retail trade into the formal net, alongside deepening compliance by reducing leakages through production monitoring systems and AI-enabled technologies. Simultaneously, the tax administration is being transformed through reforms in people, processes, and technology,” he said.
The minister further highlighted efforts to improve governance in [power] distribution companies, involve private sector expertise, advance privatisation, and reduce circular debt, which has long constrained the power sector.
“Rationalising the tariff regime is essential to making energy more competitive for industry, thereby enabling industrial revival and economic growth,” he stressed.
Senator Aurangzeb acknowledged the longstanding support of GCC countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, for their critical role in critical role supporting Pakistan through financing, funding, and cooperation at international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.
“This relationship is now evolving towards a new phase centred on trade expansion and investment flows. Remittances continue to play a vital role in supporting the current account, with inflows reaching approximately $38 billion last year and projected to rise to $41-42 billion this year, over half of which originates from GCC countries,” he added.
He further said, “Pakistan is actively engaging with GCC partners to attract investment in priority sectors including energy, oil and gas, minerals and mining, artificial intelligence, digital infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture.”
Expressing optimism regarding progress on a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the GCC, he termed the discussions at an “advanced stage”.
Senator Aurangzeb reiterated the government’s strategic direction in shifting the collective focus on trade rather than relying on aid.
“Pakistan’s future lies in fostering trade and investment partnerships rather than reliance on aid,” said the finance minister.
He also emphasised the role of foreign direct investment in supporting the higher GDP growth, generating employment opportunities, and delivering shared economic benefits for Pakistan and its partners.
“The government is fully mobilised to translate this vision into reality.” He concluded.</p><small>2025-12-15 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639486-pakistan-condemns-heinous-drone-attack-on-un-peacekeepers-in-sudan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan condemns 'heinous' drone attack on UN peacekeepers in Sudan</strong></a><br><p>

The controversy surrounding the IHC judge’s law degree originated from a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations.
Subsequently, a complaint pertaining to his allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council — the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges — last year in July and a petition challenging his appointment was also filed in the IHC earlier this year by lawyer Mian Dawood.
A two-member IHC bench, led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and also comprising Justice Muhammad Azam Khan, took up the matter on Monday in a packed courtroom.
The same bench had declared Dawood’s plea maintainable at the last hearing on December 9, issuing a verdict that was reserved in July last year. It had also barred Justice Jahangiri from judicial work in September, but the order was later set aside by the Supreme Court (SC).
Arguing his case, Justice Jahangiri raised the preliminary objection that the division bench was “inappropriate” to hear the case as a separate petition concerning its members was pending.
This, apparently, was a reference to challenges to Justice Dogar’s appointment as the IHC CJ.
“We have filed a petition against you. You cannot hear this case,” Justice Jahangiri asserted.
Moving on to defending his qualification, he contended that the case was based on a 34-year-old educational record.
“I am ready to take an oath on the Holy Quran that my degree is genuine,” he contended. The judge also argued that the KU never declared his degree fake.
He also took an exception to the “haste” in which proceedings were being held, arguing against the issuance of a three-day notice to address a decades-old matter.
At the last hearing, the CJ Dogar-led bench had gra­nted Justice Jahangiri thr­ee days to respond to the facts unearthed in the case till date. The registrar’s office had served the notice at Justice Jahangiri’s chamber due to time constraints, and sources had told Dawn that court staff of the judge received the notice and submitted it to his chamber.
After raising objections in this regard on Monday, Justice Jahangiri also criticised the earlier IHC directive barring him from work.
“Never in the judicial history of Pakistan and India has such a thing happened […] Not even a patwari (revenue official) was stopped from work the way I was,” he remarked.
The judge sought an adjournment to be able to hire a lawyer for himself and acquire the complete case record, stating, “So little time has been given. I have to get a lawyer and prepare.”
On the other hand, petitioner Dawood requested the court to hear the case on a daily basis.
The court adjourned the hearing until December 18 (Thursday), summoning the KU registrar in person and seeking the record of Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
The IHC judge was also given time until then to engage a lawyer.
CJ Dogar assured Justice Jahangiri that he would receive justice.
Throughout the hearing, CJ Dogar also repeatedly instructed lawyers, who attended the hearing in large numbers, to return to their seats, emphasising, “Honourable Justice Jahangiri has come to me … I want to hear him.”
Protracted legal trajectory
The controversy around Justice Jahangiri’s law degree has followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.</p><small>2025-12-15 09:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1511231503245c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961250/pakistan-origin-man-living-in-sydney-falsely-identified-as-bondi-beach-gunman-fears-his-life-is-in-danger' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-origin man living in Sydney falsely identified as Bondi Beach gunman fears his life is in danger</strong></a><br><p>A Pakistan-origin man living in Sydney has said he had received death threats and was “terrified” to leave his home after his photo was widely shared online as the gunman responsible for the Bondi Beach shooting, it emerged on Monday.
Two gunmen on Sunday had opened fire at a Hanukkah gathering in Sydney’s Bondi Beach, killing 15 in Australia’s worst incident of gun violence since 1996. Police have not yet disclosed the names of the suspects, who happen to be father and son, or their motives. However, various news outlets identified them as Sajid Akram and Naveed Akram, respectively.
The father first came to Australia in 1998 on a student visa, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told reporters on Monday. He was killed at the scene. His son — an Australian-born citizen according to the home affairs minister — is critically injured and being treated in a Sydney hospital bed under police guard.
Photos of a beaming man in a green Pakistan cricket jersey had subsequently pinged across social media. Some of the posts were shared thousands of times, drawing vitriolic comments.
But the photo was taken from the Facebook profile of a different Naveed Akram, who pleaded on Monday for people to stop the misinformation in a video published by the Pakistan Consulate of Sydney.
The video was also picked up by Australia’s SBS News, with Akram, who runs his own business and arrived in Australia in 2018, saying, “As per media reports, one of the shooters, his name is Naveed Akram. My name is also Naveed Akram. Unfortunately, our names are the same.”
“I just want you to know that that person is a different person,” he added.
“That is not me, and I have nothing to do with that incident or that person,” Akram said as he condemned the shooting. He further said that this “propaganda” was being spread through “Indian accounts”.
He appealed to people to report instances of his photos being linked to the shooting, adding that he was “stressed and scared”.
“I really need your help because this is a life-threatening event and there can be many issues that can arise from this,” he was quoted as saying.
“I can’t even go outside safely,” he added.
The 30-year-old, who lives in a northwestern suburb of Sydney, told AFP he first heard around 9:30pm on Sunday that he had been falsely identified as the shooter.
“I could not even sleep last night,” Akram told AFP by phone, adding he deleted all the “terrible” messages he got.
“I’m terrified. I could not go outside, like it’s a life-threatening issue, so I don’t want to risk anything … my family is worried as well, so it’s quite a hard time for me.”
He asked the Pakistan Consulate to put out the video because relatives in Punjab were getting phone calls as well.
“It was destroying my image, my family’s image,” he said.
“People started to call them. They were worried, and they have told the police over there.”
The Pakistan native moved to Australia in 2018 to attend Central Queensland University and later did a masters at Sydney’s Holmes Institute.
Today he runs a car rental business, and he said Australia is “the perfect country”.

The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has registered cases against several YouTubers on charges of promoting and encouraging a gambling application, including Butt and Mubarak.
Both social media influencers appeared in front of Additional District and Sessions Judge Mansoor Ahmed Qureshi on Monday.
Their lawyers contended that the two wanted to join the investigation against them to prove their innocence.
The judge granted pre-arrest bail to Butt and Mubarak, restraining the NCCIA from arresting them till January 6. The judge also directed both suspects to join the investigation before the next date of hearing.
The development comes days after the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted 10-day protective bail to the social media influencers in response to a petition filed by Butt and Mubarak’s relatives, who had arrived in Pakistan from London on Dec 10.
Subsequently, the two had approached the Lahore sessions court and filed separate bail petitions.
Cases against the two
According to official records, the two are nominated in several FIRs registered under various cybercrime provisions, including allegations related to operating or promoting gambling applications, misuse of digital platforms and online harassment. The FIA had earlier issued multiple notices, but their stay abroad meant no substantial progress could be made in the investigations.
In September this year, Butt was booked by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) for allegedly promoting online gambling apps on social media.
Nadeem was also booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting gambling apps on his social media, but he was also arrested in September for displaying a fake registration number – ‘IK-804’ – on his car.
On being quizzed, he couldn’t satisfy the police with regard to displaying the fake registration number, IK-804, which is said to be the prisoner number allotted to incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
Meanwhile, in March, Butt was also booked under blasphemy and cybercrime laws due to a “religious stir” caused by the launch of his perfume brand that allegedly mocked Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Butt launched his “295” perfume, which refers to the namesake blasphemy law in the Pakistan Penal Code.
Last December, the YouTuber found himself in legal trouble when he was arrested for illegally keeping a lion cub and weapons at his residence. He pleaded guilty in January this year to owning an undocumented wild animal after accepting the cub as a wedding gift.
He avoided jail by promising a judge to post animal rights videos for a year.</p><small>2025-12-15 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639466-lahore-court-grants-interim-bail-to-youtuber-rajab-butt-tiktoker-nadeem-nani-wala' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore court grants interim bail to YouTuber Rajab Butt, TikToker Nadeem Naniwala</strong></a><br><p>

At least six Bangladeshi peacekeepers were killed and eight wounded in a drone attack on a UN base on Saturday in the disputed Abyei region between Sudan and South Sudan, according to Bangladesh’s armed forces.
In a statement released on Monday, the FO said, “Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the heinous attack against UN peacekeepers in Kadugli, Sudan, which has resulted in the tragic deaths of six peacekeepers from Bangladesh serving with the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (Unisfa), and injuries to several others.”
It expressed Pakistan’s deepest condolences to the government and people of Bangladesh on the lives lost, adding that Pakistan stood in solidarity with the bereaved families.
“UN peacekeepers remain at the forefront of international efforts to prevent conflict, protect civilians, and support peace under the UN flag,” the FO statement said.
“We pay homage to the ultimate sacrifice made by these Blue Helmets in the line of duty for peace and stability in the region,” it added.
The FO also called for a swift investigation to identify the perpetrators of the “cowardly attack” and to hold the responsible parties accountable.
“We will also continue to work closely with members of the UN Security Council and the international community to ensure the safety and security of all UN peacekeepers,” it said.







Bangladesh is one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping missions and its troops have long been deployed in the volatile region.
In a statement on Sunday, the Bangldesh armed forces’ public relations division said, “A drone attack was carried out by separatist armed groups on the Kadugali Logistics Base under the UN peacekeeping mission in Abyei, Sudan yesterday (Saturday) from approximately 3:40pm to 3:50pm local time.”
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had also condemned the attack in a post on X, expressing his condolences to the families of those killed and wishing a speedy recovery to the injured.
“Attacks against UN peacekeepers like this one are unjustifiable & may constitute war crimes. I remind everyone of their obligation to protect UN personnel and civilians,” he said.

The work will begin during the annual closure of Kotri Barrage. The barrage feeds an offtaking canal, the KB Feeder, which then fills the Keenjhar Lake — a principal source of urban water usage for Sindh’s capital city.
Usually, there is a fifteen-day closure for the maintenance of the barrage and its four canals during winter, ie from Dec 25 to Jan 10. However, considering the importance of lining the KB Feeder, the closure will be extended to 25 days, as far as the KB Feeder is concerned. The canal will be closed for five days before the scheduled closure and will be opened for regular operations five days later, according to project management.
The KB Feeder Lining project was part of the larger K-IV project that was to ensure the required water needs of Karachi from Kotri Barrage. The lining project was being executed on a 50-50 cost-sharing basis by the federal and Sindh governments after having been approved by the Centre. Project officials, including Project Director Ghulam Mohiuddin, pointed out that this year’s lining work will take the overall physical progress to 75–80 per cent completion. The project was divided into three packages for lining.
Due to new rate schedules, the project cost will stand at around Rs50 billion — up by Rs10bn — after revision (currently pending) is approved. The first cost as per PC-I was approved at Rs39.94bn by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council in July 2023.

Though lining barrages will offer some relief to Karachi’s water crisis, permanent resolution is only possible if extension plans at the water source are set in motion

Karachi needs a quantum of 2,400 cusecs of water as agreed by the federal government at the time of the Water Apportionment Accord 1991. The Sindh government had approached the federal government with a request that the 2,400 cusecs of water for Karachi should be made available for the metropolis exclusively out of the ‘national pool’; the issue is pending before the Council of Common Interests. It was also discussed with the Indus River System Authority, which ensures interprovincial water distribution.
The present execution of the KB Feeder Upper’s lining project will ensure a conservation of 500-550 cusecs of water in Phase I. Subsequently, Phase II of the lining of two non-perennial canals of the Kotri barrage, ie Pinyari and New Phulelli, is supposed to be initiated. This would ensure conservation of 700 cusecs of water, leading to a cumulative saving of 1,200 cusecs, and would meet the actual needs of Karachi, ie 2,400 cusecs.
The lining project was being executed by the Sindh irrigation department. Mr Mohiuddin noted that the KB Feeder gets a discharge of 9,000 cusecs, by and large, from Kotri Barrage, inclusive of Karachi’s 1,200 cusec requirement. Once the lining under Phase-I is completed, the barrage will be in a position to save 500-550 cusecs of water that would eventually be diverted to Karachi.
The KB Feeder is a perennial canal that also caters to the agricultural needs of the Thatta and Jamshoro districts before it ends up in Keenjhar Lake in the Thatta district. The Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation lifts water from the lake through the Keenjhar-Gujjo canal for its water supply system to meet the drinking water needs of Karachi’s burgeoning population.
The bigger K-IV, or Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme, has been under progress since 2011 by the Water and Power Development Authority at a cost of Rs126bn. It aims to provide 650 million gallons per day (MGD) of water to Karachi from Keenjhar Lake in two phases, ie 260 MGD in Phase I and 390 MGD in Phase II. During a recent visit to the K-IV site, the Wapda chairman promised its completion sometime in 2026 while linking it with timely funds’ releases under the project.
The Indus River remains the principal source of drinking water supplies to Karachi from Kotri Barrage. The barrage itself lies at the tail-end system of the Indus River System and often faces unprecedented shortages. Surplus flows, if any, are seen only during monsoon season. But shortages quite evidently and invariably remain 70–80pc in the April-May period, undermining Kharif crops’ cultivation even in perennial canals’ command areas.
According to World Urbanisation Prospects 2025, released by the United Nations and reported last month, Karachi is set to become one of the 10 largest cities in the world between 2025 and 2030, with rapid population growth expected to continue through the mid-century. The metropolis could stand as the fifth largest with a projected population of almost 33m by 2050.
Considering the city’s drinking water needs, a separate scheme for ‘Extension of the Keenjhar Lake’ in addition to lining works is being planned. This scheme has been worked out at a total cost of Rs170bn and was forwarded to the Ministry of Water Resources after having been okayed by the Provincial Development Working Party (PDWP) in March this year for inclusion in the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
“The [Keenjhar] lake must have a backup support system for meeting 2,400 cusecs of dependable water supplies to Karachi. This can only be achieved when Keenjhar Lake is expanded,” said retired chief engineer, Haji Khan Jamali. He last served as Kotri Barrage’s Chief Engineer. According to him, the Kotri barrage remains under stress during and after the December period.
“The lining works of KB Feeder Upper, New Phulelli and Pinyari will definitely ensure conservation of water, but we should not lose sight of the fact that the last two non-perennial canals that run for six months of the summer season don’t get the required quantum over the rest of the period; therefore, without enhancing Keenjhar Lake’s capacity, somewhat reliable supplies for Karachi will remain a tricky affair,” Jamali said.
According to the concept paper of the lake’s extension plan, a continuous supply of 1,200 cusecs depletes the lake to a dead level (RL44) in 55 days without inflow. With an inflow of 600 cusecs, it hits dead level in 105 days. Keenjhar Lake has a live storage of 0.429 MAF currently.
However, the K-IV execution that includes an additional 1,200 cusecs supply (as mentioned above) would take the total quantum of water to 2,400 cusecs, which means that the lake would hit dead level within 28-60 days, thus posing a threat to its sustainability. Therefore, “augmentation of Keenjhar Lake is imperative to maintain storage levels and ensure a sustainable water supply to Karachi”, according to the scheme’s concept.

Pakistan has experienced a massive decline in cotton production over the last decade — from 13.9 million bales in FY15 to 7.08m bales in FY25. Meanwhile, the crop area decreased from 7.31m to 5.04m acres as per Pakistan Economic Survey data. Resultantly, State Bank data shows that Pakistan, which was once a net exporter of cotton, imported cotton and cotton yarn (HS code 52) worth $3.13 billion in FY25.
Recently, the Deputy Prime Minister of Pakistan chaired an inter-ministerial meeting — attended by the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association — to deliberate on the revival of cotton. In fact, the revival plan is based on a core assumption: that developing improved seed varieties through intensive research and development, ensuring quality seed production, and delivering these seeds effectively to farmers will restore cotton production. 
However, ground realities have fundamentally changed over the past decade, and the factors driving cotton’s decline have become far more complex than seed quality alone.
For policymakers, it is crucial to recognise that in Pakistan — where crop zoning has never been enforced — farmers increasingly base their crop choices on financial returns. Shrinking landholdings and mounting economic pressures have made profitability the overriding factor. When a crop offers greater returns, a large number of farmers shift quickly, regardless of higher production costs, labour requirements, or operational difficulties involved.

Any agriculture policy that overlooks its impact on farmers’ earnings is bound to fail

A recent example is the rapid expansion of potato cultivation — a cost-intensive crop demanding careful management. Similarly, sesame acreage surged two years ago when local prices hit Rs17,000 per 40kg. However, its area shrank sharply when prices fell to around Rs10,000. Therefore, any policy that overlooks its impact on farmers’ earnings is bound to fail.
In many cotton-growing areas, farmers who traditionally followed the cotton–wheat cropping pattern now have a broader set of options. In well-irrigated zones, crops such as sugarcane, rice, and maize — and sesame in relatively water-scarce areas — have increasingly replaced cotton because they offer higher returns and carry lower production risks.
By contrast, cotton faces the highest production risks due to intense pest and disease pressures. These risks have intensified in recent years because of increased humidity at the microclimate level in cotton zones, caused by the expansion of high-delta crops like sugarcane and rice. Additionally, erratic rainfalls induced by climate change now adversely affect the crop during flowering, boll formation, and later stages.
Surprisingly, the government extension advisory, which once prohibited sowing before May 20, now recommends sowing in February and March so that farmers can get maximum harvest before the onset of adverse weather in July and beyond.
However, early sowing does not align with the cotton–wheat rotation, as wheat fields in Punjab are typically only cleared by mid-April at the earliest. This delay leaves farmers with little choice but to drop cotton from their cropping pattern. Consequently, cotton is now largely concentrated in areas such as the Bahawalpur division (in Punjab), where farmers have limited Kharif alternatives due to water shortages or soils and agro-climatic conditions unsuitable for rice, maize, or sugarcane.
Additionally, in several parts of the cotton belt, farmers have increased cropping intensity to three crops per year — wheat, sesame, and maize or wheat, sesame, and rice (1509 variety) — enabled by the availability of short-duration varieties.
Given the current situation, cotton cannot be revived unless its farm-level economics improve. One option is to raise cotton prices, such as via support prices, but this is unlikely in a deregulated market where prices follow international trends. Furthermore, the growing use of synthetic and plant-based fibres — viscose, tencel, modal — may further constrain cotton prices in the future. Another approach is to lower production costs via crop-specific subsidies, but international financial institutions may resist such measures.
This leaves only one sustainable option: boosting yields. However, it requires high-yielding cotton varieties suited to Pakistan’s agro-climatic zones, resilient to climate change, and compatible with mixed-cropping systems prevalent in historically cotton-rich districts such as Vehari, Khanewal, Lodhran, and Multan.
Unfortunately, such varieties are currently lacking, and developing them locally could take many years. Alternatively, importing proven varieties from reputable multinationals — following successful completion of mandatory two-year field trials — could provide a faster solution.
Unfortunately, even if yields are increased by 50 per cent — the current average being 717kg of lint per roughly 2.5 acres — cotton would still struggle to match the financial returns of sugarcane, rice, and maize. Its high production costs and risks, driven by the need for 10–12 pesticide applications to control sucking pests, make it increasingly difficult to entice farmers back to cotton.
Therefore, rather than pursuing crop zoning — politically contentious and hard to enforce — the most practical strategy is to concentrate efforts on non-traditional areas in Balochistan and Punjab, such as Lasbela, Mianwali, Layyah, Bhakkar, etc. These are predominantly semi-irrigated or water-scarce and naturally experience lower pest pressure. Notably, India has successfully expanded cotton production in its rain-fed regions through introducing Bt cotton hybrids which perform well under water-limited conditions.
In conclusion, Pakistan needs an out-of-the-box, medium-term cotton revival plan that safeguards the interests of all stakeholders — especially farmers. Without such balance, powerful groups will continue to push the revival agenda that best serves their own interests, while ignoring ground realities and the broader needs of the cotton sector as well as the country.
