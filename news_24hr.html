Pakistan has stated that Israel’s “unlawful recognition” is “deeply troubling” against the backdrop of previous references to it being a “destination for the deportation of Palestinian people, especially from Gaza”. The remarks were made by Pakistan’s Deputy UN Ambassador Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon during a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) briefing on Israel’s recognition of Somaliland.
Israel became the first country to recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday.
In his remarks, Jadoon said, “Against the backdrop of Israel’s previous references to ‘Somaliland’ of the Federal Republic of Somalia as a destination for the deportation of Palestinian people, especially from Gaza, its unlawful recognition of ‘Somaliland’ region is deeply troubling.“
In March, the Associated Press reported that the US and Israel had reached out to officials in Sudan, Somalia and Somaliland to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for forcibly relocating Palestinians from Gaza.
“For decades, Israel’s dispossession and occupation of Palestinian land have been a central source of instability and conflict in the Middle East. It is now exporting this destabilising conduct to the Horn of Africa, with serious implications for regional peace and security,” he said.
He said that Pakistan unequivocally rejected any proposals or plans aimed at the forced displacement of Palestinians. He noted that a previous UNSC resolution had endorsed US President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan, noting that it stated that “no one will be forced to leave Gaza”.







“Any actions that advocate or imply displacement or resettlement not only violate international law but also undermine the prospect of a just and lasting peace,” he said.
“We reaffirm our steadfast support for the Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for self-determination. The only path to lasting peace and stability lies in the realization of an independent, contiguous and sovereign state of Palestine on pre-1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital,” he said.
In his remarks, Jadoon also expressed Pakistan‘s “unwavering and steadfast support to the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity” of Somalia. He condemned Israel’s “unilateral and unlawful recognition” of Somaliland, calling it a direct assault on Somalia’s international borders.
“The ‘Somaliland’ region remains an integral, inseparable, and inalienable part of Somalia. No external actor has either the legal standing or the moral authority to alter that fundamental reality,” he said. He also highlighted that a group of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation countries and Pakistan had rejected Israel’s move.
The envoy also said that “continued, predictable support for Somalia’s security sector and stabilisation efforts remains indispensable for preserving the hard-won gains against terrorism”.
“Therefore, at this pivotal juncture, when Somalia is focused on defeating extremism, any action that diverts attention, weakens cohesion, or fuels division is profoundly irresponsible,” he said.
He concluded his remarks by calling on the UNSC and the international community to reject all actions that “undermine Somalia’s unity and territorial integrity”.
“On our part, we remain firmly and resolutely committed to standing with the government and people of Somalia in the country’s march toward peace and prosperity,” he said.
Meanwhile, the 22-member Arab League, a regional organisation of Arab states in the Middle East and parts of Africa, said it rejected “any measures arising from this illegitimate recognition aimed at facilitating forced displacement of the Palestinian people or exploiting northern Somali ports to establish military bases,” Arab League UN Ambassador Maged Abdelfattah Abdelaziz told the UNSC.
Somalia’s UN Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman said Council members Algeria, Guyana, Sierra Leone and Somalia “unequivocally reject any steps aimed at advancing this objective, including any attempt by Israel to relocate the Palestinian population from Gaza to the northwestern region of Somalia“.







Meanwhile, the United States defended Israel’s right to recognise the breakaway territory, comparing it to the recognition of a Palestinian state by numerous countries.
“Israel has the same right to conduct diplomatic relations as any other sovereign state,” Tammy Bruce, deputy US ambassador to the UN, said.
“Earlier this year, several countries, including members of this council, made the unilateral decision to recognise a nonexistent Palestinian state, and yet no emergency meeting was called to express this Council’s outrage,” she added, accusing colleagues of “double standards”.
Slovenian ambassador Samuel Zbogar, whose country has recognised the Palestinian state, rejected Washington’s comparison.
“Palestine is not part of any state. It is illegally occupied territory, as declared by the International Court of Justice, among others,” while Somaliland “is part of a UN member state and recognising it goes against” the UN Charter, Zbogar said.
United Kingdom Ambassador James Kariuki reaffirmed the country’s support for “the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia”.
Israel’s representative Jonathan Miller said the move was “not a hostile step towards Somalia, and it does not preclude future dialogue between the parties,” calling it “an opportunity to strengthen stability”.</p><small>2025-12-30 04:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/30092512c8babdc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963971/law-enforcers-in-karachi-thwart-plot-to-use-radicalised-schoolgirl-for-suicide-bombing' target='_blank'><strong>Law enforcers in Karachi thwart plot to use ‘radicalised schoolgirl for suicide bombing’</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A major terror plot was thwarted by law enforcers in the city on Monday as they rescued a school-going teenage girl who had been radicalised through social media by an outlawed militant group and was being prepared for a suicide attack in Karachi.
This was shared by Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar during a press conference at the Central Police Office.
The minister said that the girl was detained during routine checking by police on the outskirts of Karachi and during the investigation, she revealed the details of the potential terror attack.
Mr Lanjar said that the girl belonged to an ordinary family in Balochistan and had been radicalised by anti-state elements through social media before being recruited by a banned group. She was shown fictitious heroic stories of past suicide bombers and was trained through WhatsApp groups to carry out a suicide attack in Karachi. However, law enforcers “foiled the terrorists’ nefarious designs by rescuing her in time,” he added.
He also said that the girl’s father, a government servant, had passed away, while her mother was alive. One of her brothers is serving in the Balochistan police while the other is employed in a government department.

Home minister claims girl from Balochistan detained during routine checking on city outskirts; alleges outlawed BLA brainwashed her

Additional Inspector General of Police (CTD) Azad Khan said the girl was studying at a local school in Balochistan and that the family’s sole source of income was her father’s government pension. She was initially provided hate material through a mobile phone to mentally condition her. Later, an Instagram handler linked to the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) contacted her, shared extremist content and added her to a WhatsApp group where anti-state material was regularly circulated.
He said the girl was persuaded to “perform a big act” and was gradually trained towards suicide bombing. One day, she left her home and met a woman outside Karachi, who took her to another location where she was further indoctrinated before being sent to Karachi. During police checking, she failed to give satisfactory answers and was taken to a women’s police station, where she disclosed the entire story during debriefing.
The CTD chief said that on the directions of the home minister, authorities had decided not to apply the normal legal process against her and instead adopt a restorative justice approach. “We will treat her as a victim, not an accused,” he said, adding that no explosive or suicide material was recovered from her possession. However, he said her brainwashing was complete and she was close to the “execution phase” when she was rescued.
Responding to a question, the home minister said it was an “open secret” that the BLA was destabilising Pakistan with the direct support of India.
Additional IGP Karachi Javed Alam Odho, the rescued girl, and her mother were also present at the press conference.
In a recorded video message, the girl said she was a student who aspired to become a teacher. She said she first came across a story about Shari Baloch on social media. 
It is pertinent to mention here that Shari Baloch had carried out a suicide attack to target Chinese academics at Karachi University in 2022.
The girl said she developed curiosity about how an educated woman like Shari became a suicide bomber. She watched videos and read material that made her believe there was “some truth” in the propaganda. Gradually, her mindset changed after watching videos and songs glorifying the suicide bomber.
The girl said she now realizes that social media handlers who speak softly and show sympathy are actually “hunters.” She questioned why they do not radicalise their own daughters.
In her video message, the girl’s mother thanked the law enforcement agencies for saving her daughter and protecting their family’s honour.

The big day was a holiday. It was for some a day to introspect, for others an occasion to meet up with the family, often around a large table of Christmas repast. Christmas offered, as it still does, an occasion to enjoy the delightful music of hymns and carols in churches and public events. It was an occasion to join a midnight mass here or listen to the story of Scrooge there, the miserly character from Charles Dickens. And Christmas is also increasingly identified with shopping crowds looking out for ‘Black Friday’ bargains.
For Mother Teresa, Christmas was a living liturgy. She observed it by making the Nativity scene a reality in the slums and hospices of Kolkata. The crib was not just a display; it was the bed of a dying destitute person she was cleaning. The Christmas star was the light of hope in a sufferer’s eyes. For her, the truest celebration was to become a gift of love to those whom the world had forgotten.
Times have changed. There’s a video clip of a Pakistani public intellectual on the internet complaining how, after shutting down children’s parks, playhouses and music and poetry soirées, the country had only one cultural inheritance left to indulge: to go out to eat a lot of good food. ‘What did you do today? Oh, we went to a nice eatery and ate great varieties of meat.’ Whether he was sardonically mimicking a sad truth or exaggerating somewhat, his intervention reminded me of increasing occasions of religious and cultural celebration that have turned into a consumer fest everywhere.
Gandhiji had a soft corner for Christian ethics. He used the teachings of Jesus to critique Western civilisation, pointing out the contradiction between Christian nations professing love and peace while engaging in imperialism, warfare, and industrial exploitation. He challenged Western Christians to embody the ‘prince of peace’. One of his favourite hymns was Abide With Me, a favourite of India’s military bands before the advent of Hindutva rule. Nehru often attended public Christmas events, especially those involving children. He made appearances at Christmas parties organised for orphans, schoolchildren, and the underprivileged. The Nehru family’s Christmas parties at Teen Murti Bhavan (his official residence) were well-known, at which he played a benevolent figure distributing gifts, much like ‘Uncle Nehru’.

Practised cynicism was in evidence on Christmas Day at the highest level of government in India.

That was then. Much of Western Christendom remains in ferment today, grappling with several of the issues Gandhiji had described with reference to the teachings of Christ. In India, however, Christians have become a targeted community. Practised cynicism was in evidence on Christmas Day at the highest level of government. With elections due in Kerala shortly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was beside himself with joy, proclaiming peace and piety at a Christmas service he attended at a Delhi cathedral. “The service reflected the timeless message of love, peace, and compassion,” Modi wrote.
“May the spirit of Christmas inspire harmony and goodwill in our society.” The BJP president was singing paeans to Christmas at another service. As they spoke and earlier, in the run-up to Christmas festivities, Hindutva mobs displayed their brute force of lumpenism — not without police acquiescence. They attacked and terrorised followers of Jesus Christ and the Christmas preparations across the country. The incidents took place almost entirely in states where the BJP runs state governments.
For instance, the BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh ordered schools to remain open on Dec 25, insisting the students had to celebrate the 100th birthday of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In Bareilly, according to reports, Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad members sat outside the church at Bishop Conrad School, reciting the Hanuman Chalisa and shouting “Jai Shri Ram” in full view of the police. In Nalbari, Assam, VHP and Bajrang Dal activists stormed St Mary’s School in Panigaon, chanting “Jai Shri Ram” and “Jai Hindu rashtra” before setting fire to Christmas decorations. VHP district secretary Bhaskar Deka stated: “We don’t want Christian festivals here.” The BJP government reportedly ordered the arrest of four in the incident. Elections are also due in Assam. Yes, every BJP-ruled state witnessed anti-Christmas vandalism.

 

Doublespeak is not anyone’s monopoly, however. Atrocities against minority Christians in Pakistan are only too well documented in the archives of the Human Rights Commission. This is not to deny the occasional empathy or even expression of solidarity offered to the harassed community by Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership. The blasphemy laws remain open to misuse by anyone seeking to settle scores with a Christian individual or an entire community.
In the US, racism has traditionally trumped religious affinity. White Christians have lynched Black Christians. Created by six Confederate soldiers in 1865, the Ku Klux Klan used Christmas-themed events and imagery to promote its white supremacist ideology and recruit members. The hooded brotherhood circulated flyers and held events around Christmas time. These have included recruitment flyers wishing people a ‘Merry White Christmas’ and the use of a ‘Klanta Klaus’ figure to distribute gifts at KKK-sponsored sales and gatherings. The migration of Cassius Clay to become Muhammad Ali was explained by Ali in a lighter vein. He asked his mother why all the angels were white. Why was there no Black apostle at the last supper of Christ? The mother’s answer was withering: “The Blacks must be in the kitchen, darling.”
More recently, during his presidential campaign, Barack Obama shrewdly and swiftly distanced himself from the leading Black American priest who had baptised his daughters. Jeremiah Wright spoke up for Palestine and slammed America in his sermons for wreaking havoc on defenceless people around the world for no legitimate reason. But then, which presidential candidate would not genuflect before the lobby that spearheads Israel’s curious hold over Western Christendom?

Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.
“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the Fajr prayer,” the party said in a statement.







“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.
Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.
Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.
But in late November, she was rushed to hospital, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.
During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus called for the nation to pray for Zia, calling her a “source of utmost inspiration for the nation”.
BNP’s media chief Moudud Alamgir Pavel also confirmed Zia’s death to AFP.
Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.
She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.
There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.
Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.
Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.
‘Committed friend to Pakistan’
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened by Khaleda’s passing. “Her lifelong service to Bangladesh and its growth and development leaves a lasting legacy,” he said.
“Begum Zia was a committed friend of Pakistan. My government and the people of Pakistan stand with the people of Bangladesh in this moment of sorrow,” he said.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends and the people of Bangladesh during this difficult time,” he said.







President Asif Ali Zardari said Khaleda’s “leadership and services will be remembered with respect”.







Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also expressed his condolences at Khaleda’s passing.







‘Battling begums’
Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.
Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of “liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness”.
She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh’s founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990.
But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed “the battling begums”.
Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals.
Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades.
In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the Jamaat-e-Islami.
In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, who was elected three years earlier.
Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win.
Her second term was marred by the rise of militants and allegations of corruption.
In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded.
Khaleda’s government and its allies were widely blamed.
In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh’s highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated.
Detention and freedom
Although Khaleda later clamped down on radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.
The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.
Khaleda never regained power.
With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.
Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.
In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister — charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.
She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.
Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina’s ouster.
In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.</p><small>2025-12-30 04:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/300939064b99a79.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964016/pak-afghan-trade-disruptions-fuel-regional-instability-experts' target='_blank'><strong>Pak-Afghan trade disruptions fuel regional instability: experts</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Exclusionary economic measures cause prolonged disruptions in Pakistan-Afghanistan trade and transit, and generate wide-ranging economic and social consequences across the region.
Uncertainty, rather than cost alone, has emerged as the most damaging factor, eroding livelihoods, weakening regional connectivity and placing disproportionate strain on border communities between the two countries.

 

These concerns were raised at an online dialogue on “Exploring Pathways to Pakistan-Afghanistan Trade and Economic Connectivity” organised by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) as part of it’s the beyond boundaries initiative on Monday.
The dialogue convened policymakers, customs officials, business leaders, and economic experts from Pakistan and Afghanistan to reflect on the evolving trade dynamics and their broader regional implications.
Khan Jan Alokozay, Co-President of the Pakistan-Afghanistan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI), said peace in the region was inseparable from economic stability, adding that robust and predictable trade formed the foundation of durable bilateral relations. Without continuity in trade, he cautioned, broader objectives of peace and regional integration would remain fragile.
Fazal Moqeem Khan, former president Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, called for the establishment of cross-border economic zones to institutionalise trade and transit cooperation with manufacturers on both sides collaborating and heightening joint stakes and move beyond ad hoc arrangements. He warned that isolated or one-sided approaches to trade were not viable and will ultimately weaken both economies.
Highlighting the human cost of trade disruptions, Mujeeb Shinwari, president All Torkham Customs Clearing Agents Association, noted that border communities bear the brunt of repeated closures as their economic lifelines depend directly on cross-border trade. He observed that persistent disruptions had crippled local economies and undermined livelihoods in already vulnerable areas.
Emphasising the political economy of trade, Naqeebullah Safi, executive director AJCCI’s Kabul office, said trade should shape politics rather than be subordinated to it. He noted that while elite groups retain mobility through air travel, lower-income and border populations have suffered disproportionately, warning that continued uncertainty risks permanently diverting Afghan markets away from Pakistan and vice versa.
Ibrahim Shams, former vice president Afghanistan Investment Support Agency (AISA), said economic deprivation lied at the core of instability. He cautioned that prolonged trade blockages exacerbate insecurity rather than mitigate it with ordinary citizens bearing the heaviest costs.

 

Mohammad Ibrar Aimal, an Afghan scholar, highlighted how sustained disruptions have stalled production, disrupted supply chains and resulted in job losses, particularly in agriculture-linked and small-scale industries operating across Pakistan, Afghanistan and the wider region.
Ahmad Shah Yarzada, an Afghan businessman, called for a unified appeal for the normalisation of trade and economic activity, jointly led by traders, tribal elders and border communities on both sides. He noted that with Pakistan–Afghanistan trade repeatedly disrupted, many Afghan businesses have started pivoting towards Iran and Central Asia. While these alternative routes involve higher operational costs, they offer greater certainty, underscoring the urgent need to restore stability and predictability in Pakistan-Afghanistan trade relations.
Focusing on operational challenges, Arbab Qaiser, chief customs wing, FBR Islamabad, highlighted recent efforts to address the issue of pending containers at ports, pointing to measures aimed at easing clearance delays and reducing bottlenecks. He said the interlinked nature of regional economic dependencies required improved operational coordination and smoother communication among relevant stakeholders on both sides.
A common concern raised during the dialogue was the lack of organised and coordinated engagement by chambers of commerce, which has limited structured communication between traders and implementing authorities. The participants stressed the need for stronger private-sector coordination and more organised advocacy to collectively identify procedural bottlenecks and support smoother trade and transit operations.
Imtiaz Gul, executive director CRSS, warned that prolonged deadlock in trade and economic connectivity carried consequences far beyond immediate commercial losses. He said sustained disruptions shrink employment opportunities, expand informal economies and intensify social pressures, ultimately undermining long-term regional stability.

Last month, at a business event in Islamabad, Lt-Gen Sarfraz Ahmed, national coordinator, SIFC, said Pakistan had no growth plan; adding that Pakistan had made a mess of its fiscal situation. He said the government could only think of raising taxes and indicated that the business community was an easy prey because they were already in the net. He said that the high taxes discouraged investment, internally and externally. Speaking of the need to reduce taxes, he was reported as saying the ‘business-as-usual approach’ would not work. More was said in a similar vein, attracting greater attention than speeches at similar business-related events. It was seen by many as an acknowledgment that the economy was not doing all that well and that neither was it sustainable.
Keeping in mind the eternal civil-military dance in this country, the question whispered frequently was whether this was a criticism of the government itself. After all, the civilians in the government, including the prime minister, cannot stop claiming their success in stabilising and improving the economy. Nearly a fortnight after the event, the prime minister, according to a news report, said the economy was out of the woods and the mega indicators were wonderful.
But if the chatter in Islamabad is to be believed, the concerns about the economy are real. Perhaps about as real as the talk about the 28th Amendment and the rejigging of the NFC. And this is lent more credence by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s speech at his mother’s death anniversary where he offered to share the federal government’s financial burden in a speech to the crowd gathered there. One can go so far as to say that he was perhaps trying to pass on a message to the government and others.
Most are agreed that those in power are under pressure to deliver economic relief for ordinary citizens — in terms of lower taxes and power bills and more employment opportunities. This is necessary because in the absence of a free and fair election, there is no other means to acquire legitimacy.
In fact, even the offer by PM Shehbaz Sharif for talks with the opposition (after his cabinet ministers had taken a hard stance against the PTI) is being interpreted within the larger context of the economy. Those in power feel the need to offer talks to the opposition because the former realise they have not been able to achieve much on the economic front. Even some in the opposition view it as such, although they don’t have great expectations.

If the chatter in Islamabad is to be believed, the concerns about the economy are real.

The timing of all these statements including the offer of talks is also important. For the recent constitutional amendments have now ensured a concentration of power in a few hands and any challenge from the judiciary, media and opposition has been successfully overcome by force and by hurried legislation. All of this was done with little regard for the people or their well-being. As a result, now there is no reason left to not deliver: economic relief for ordinary people has become essential for the well-being of the ruling set-up. This is lent further credence by ‘reports’ of meetings where the ‘two sides’ of the government got together to discuss the economy and how to improve it.

 

In fact, the SIFC official was reported as saying there was consensus in the government that taxes had to be reduced. One presumes a consensus was created in some meetings away from the limelight. But few (outside the government) bel­ieve this can happen. Those who are well versed in economic affairs point out how the governm­e­­nt has not carried out any reform so far. This is where some of those with experience of the ga­­m­es played in Islamabad feel the government mig­ht be sent home, a scapegoat for the stagnant eco­­­nomy. According to them, it is seen as not bri­nging any popular support to the set-up and if it cannot help improve the economy, why let it stay in power? At least by sending it home, some bro­wnie points can be earned by removing unpopular faces. However, this is an extreme step.
If a democratic façade is to be maintained there are few individuals and politicians as accommodating and generous as Shehbaz Sharif. Even his worst critics cannot deny this; not even those who sit on television and complain about the inefficacy of the government and parliament.
Another option is for some changes in the cabinet, rather than the entire set-up. Obviously, this will mean the focus will be on key ministries that are linked with the economy. It is noteworthy that the murmurings about a key figure in the economic team are growing. The stories about his aloofness from others in the government are not new but the noise is increasing. Take for instance a recent, relatively unknown podcast in which a ‘journalist’ seen as close to the powers that be spent quite a few minutes holding forth on the economy, raising some of the same points mentioned earlier in the piece. And then he also singled out a cabinet member, raising questions about his performance and his conduct during work hours. The comments did not pass unnoticed.
And now questions are being asked whether these comments were passed in the heat of the moment or because he is aware of a fall from grace. The interviewee is far too careful to make a mistake. It is hard to predict with certainty at the moment but the economy is eventually going to claim some of those in power. It’s simply a matter of time.

In fact, the statistics compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies say that the outgoing year saw the highest level of terrorism-related violence in over a decade, with a 73pc increase compared to 2024.
Other studies have also confirmed these trends. The vast majority of deaths (at least 3,387) are those of terrorists (2,115). However, what is concerning is the high fatality rate of security personnel and civilians in 2025; at least 664 security men were martyred in the outgoing year, along with 580 civilians. Also, in keeping with recent trends, most violent incidents occurred in KP and Balochistan. Furthermore, there was a rise in the number of suicide bombings in the outgoing year.
Much of this violence can be traced to the TTP-led insurgency in KP, as well as Baloch separatist attacks. However, the state — both its civilian and military arms — will need to refine their counterterrorism strategies to bring down these grim numbers in the new year. Pakistan cannot afford to lose such a high number of security personnel and civilians in terrorist attacks.
The TTP problem is complicated due to poor relations with Kabul, as many of the attackers are either Afghans or Pakistani-origin terrorists residing in Afghanistan. It is hoped that recent statements from senior Afghan Taliban leaders about promoting “goodwill” with Pakistan translate to closer CT cooperation, and an end to attacks on this country originating from Afghanistan. The alternative is more conflict, which both states should avoid.
In Balochistan, while kinetic actions are important to clear areas where terrorists are active, the political process, and reconciliation with estranged Baloch forces that renounce violence and accept the Constitution, is recommended. Unless kinetic and political solutions are pursued in tandem, it will be difficult to pacify Balochistan.

 

There is also a need to rethink the overall approach to CT efforts in the new year. This includes differentiating the political opposition from hard-core terrorist groups. Some representatives of the state have conflated both, and arguably, this has hurt CT efforts. Political opponents must be dealt with through political means and dialogue, while bloodthirsty terrorists require completely different strategies to neutralise.
In 2026, the state will need to place renewed focus on CT strategies. Unless there is internal peace, long-term economic revival will be near impossible to achieve. To attract foreign and local investment, the state must ensure an environment free of violence and terrorism. If foreign states are involved in fomenting terrorism, they should be confronted diplomatically, while internal security protocols must be improved. With a dynamic CT strategy, it is possible to bring down incidents of terrorist violence in the coming year.

THE INSV Kaundinya, a wooden ship inspired by a fifth century design, lies anchored along the Arabian Sea coast in Porbandar, Gujarat.—AFP

NEW DELHI: India’s navy boasts aircraft carriers, submarines, warships, and frontline vessels of steel, as it spreads its maritime power worldwide.
But none of its vessels is as unusual as its newest addition, which set sail on its maiden Indian Ocean crossing on Monday — a wooden stitched ship inspired by a fifth-century design, built not to dominate the seas but to remember how India once traversed them.
Steered by giant oars rather than a rudder, with two fixed square sails to catch seasonal monsoon winds, it heads westwards on its first voyage across the seas, a 1,400-kilometre (870-mile) voyage to Oman’s capital Muscat.
Named Kaundinya, after a legendary Indian mariner, its 20-metre (65-foot) long hull is sewn together with coconut coir rope rather than nailed.
“This voyage reconnects the past with the present,” Vice Admiral Krishna Swaminathan said, flagging the ship off from Porbandar, in India’s western state of Gujarat, on an estimated two-week crossing to the Arabian Peninsula.
“We are not only retracing ancient pathways of trade, navigation, and cultural exchange, but also reaffirming India’s position as a natural maritime bridge across the Indian Ocean.”
It evokes a time when Indian sailors were regular traders with the Roman Empire, the Middle East, Africa, and lands to the east — today’s Thailand, Indonesia, China, and as far as Japan.
“This voyage is not just symbolic,” Swaminathan added. “It is of deep strategic and cultural significance to our nation as we aim to resurrect and revive ancient Indian maritime concepts and capabilities in all their forms.” The journey is daunting. Its builders have refused modern shortcuts, instead relying on traditional shipbuilding methods.
The ship’s 18-strong crew has already sailed north along India’s palm-fringed coast, up from Karnataka to Gujarat.
“Our peoples have long looked to the Indian Ocean not as a boundary, but as a bridge carrying commerce and ideas, culture and friendship, across its waters,” Oman’s ambassador to India Issa Saleh Alshibani said.

NEW DELHI / ISLAMABAD: India’s Ministry of Environment has been pondering clearances for a slew of controversial hydroelectric projects on the Chenab River in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident earlier this year. Yet, it does not seem to share serious apprehensions that leading environmentalists have expressed over their threat to a fragile Himalayan ecology.
Last week, a panel under the ministry approved the 260-megawatt Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Kishtwar district of India-held Jammu and Kashmir, according to The Hindu.
Earlier, in October, it was reported that environmental clearances were revived for the larger Sawalkote hydro-electric project on the same river.
The clearances came against the backdrop of India unilaterally suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) after blaming Pakistan over the Pahalgam incident — an allegation Islamabad had denied, terming the suspension of the 1960 treaty “an act of war”.
Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab.
At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty.
The projects
The Sawalkote project has been in the works for decades, and has faced numerous delays related to forest clearances and the compliance compulsions of the Indus Waters Treaty. As of now, the 1,856MW project is still said to be in the pre-construction stage. Its environment clearances have been reheated several times over.
The Dulhasti Stage II is a 258MW project, conceived as a complementary run-of-the-river scheme to utilise the water discharged from the existing 390MW Dulhasti Power Station “more efficiently”. It is a smaller component of the frequently discussed Chenab basin projects. It is expected to cost around $35 million.
According to The Hindu, “With the treaty now in abeyance, the centre is pushing ahead with several hydroelectric projects in the Indus basin, such as Sawalkote, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai I and II.”
The total land requirement for the project is estimated at 60.3 hectares. This project will require 8.27 hectares of private land from two villages, Benzwar and Palmar, in Kishtwar district, The Hindu reported.
Environmental concerns
The question environmentalists are posing focuses greatly on a primary concern related to climate change.
Water bodies are drying up rapidly. Chenab forms at the confluence of Chandra and Bhaga rivers in Lahaul and Spiti, Himachal Pradesh. According to the Indus Waters Treaty, Chenab is a Western River, allocated to Pakistan. India is permitted limited consumption use and unlimited non-consumption use of Chenab.
From the treaty’s signing up to the year 2004-05, studies estimate that glacial volume in the Chenab basin has reduced by a whopping 33.3pc.
This is what the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People NGO says: “For a river whose flows are made up of 50% meltwater when it leaves India at Akhnoor, this is shocking for both India and Pakistan”.
“Glaciers, the water stored in them, the slow release of this water in spring and summers is the key to water security of the entire Himalayan region. Sixty per cent irrigation in the entire Indus basin depends on glacial melt. As the glaciers are concentrated in the Indian Himalayas, their health and sustenance is crucial for millions in both countries.”
In the Hindu mythology, the River Saraswati, which is said to have made up a troika with the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, disappeared in ancient times. In the real world, many more rivers and water bodies face a similar fate. Chenab is among them.
Sherry expresses alarm
While there was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, former climate change minister Senator Sherry Rehman protested against this weaponisation of water, saying that it was “neither sane nor acceptable”.
In a post on X, the PPP leader wrote, “In flagrant violation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), India has just given approval to the Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K).
“As per the IWT, which cannot be unilaterally revoked, as recent UN rapporteurs have confirmed, Pakistan has control over the waters of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers, while the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers fall under India’s control,” she said.







“Following the illegal suspension of the treaty, India has decided to fast-track several disputed hydroelectric projects in the Indus Basin. These projects include Sawalkot, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai-1 and 2. Dulhasti Stage-II is considered part of this strategy,” she said.
“This weaponisation of water is neither sane nor acceptable in a region on the frontlines of climate change and environmental stress. It will inflame tensions in a bilateral relationship already bristling with hostility and distrust,” she said.

In a media briefing after a cabinet meeting here, Mr Jan said that the PTI delegation comprising provincial ministers and members of the assembly and led by CM Afridi, which just concluded a visit to Punjab province to launch a street movement, achieved its objectives as restrictions prevented people from freely moving with PTI flags on Lahore roads.
He said the love of Punjab residents for the PTI was evident from the warm welcome accorded to the delegation on arrival in Lahore.
The chief minister’s aide regretted that the chief minister was denied permission to visit the houses of some PTI workers in the cantonment area.

CM tells cabinet that funding denial by Centre has badly hit uplift projects in tribal districts

He wondered if a chief minister’s entry to the cantonment area could be stopped, how a mob entered the Lahore corps commander’s house on May 9, 2023.
Mr Jan condemned the Punjab government’s conduct towards the KP chief minister during the Punjab visit.
“Curfew was imposed; roads were blocked;all those who invited the PTI team to their areas, were arrested and even members of the Christian community, who were celebrating Christmas, were taken into custody and bundled into a prison van before being taken away,” he said.
Mr Jan accused Punjab Minister for Information Azma Bukhari of allowing nine YouTubers entry to the Punjab Assembly and refusing the same to “genuine” journalists.
He said that the chief minister had ordered an inquiry into the “extra-judicial“ killing of two Swat residents in Gujranwala.
To a question, the aide to the CM said the provincial government wouldn’t allow new military operations in the province.
Earlier in the cabinet meeting, CM Afridi complained about the denial of the Accelerated Implementation Programme‘s funds to the Centre by the Centre, saying the long delays in the release of funding have severely hit work on development projects in the merged tribal districts, according to an official statement.
The chief minister said the federal government owed Rs4.758 trillion to KP and that the finance ministry tried to hold a media trial of the provincial government on the issue of fiscal releases through false propaganda.
He demanded that the federal government disclose complete details of funds released to all provinces and present a comparison of KP’s dues with those of other provinces and directed all departments to write formal letters regarding the outstanding payments and obtain written responses.
The cabinet approved the establishment of Takaful companies in the province in line with Islamic principles, according to Mr Jan.
He said the KP General Takaful Company and KP Family Takaful Company would be established, with Rs2 billion approved for the former and Rs3bn for the latter.
According to him, the General Takaful Company will cover health and other risk-related matters, while the Family Takaful Company will provide financial support to families in the event of the death of the family head.
The cabinet approved a supplementary grant of Rs3.825 ttrillion for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Safe Cities Projects for Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Lakki Marwat and Waziristan districts.
The aide to the CM said significant progress had been made on the Peshawar Safe City project, with 80 per cent of work completed on “some targets“ and over 50pc on others, while work on safe city projects in other cities was under way.
He said recommendations of the cabinet committee regarding the merger of the posts of risaldar and dafadar in the former Fata were laid before the meeting, which granted “nomenclature approval” to 16 remaining posts. These posts will be merged with police after the fulfillment of rules and regulations, according to him.
The cabinet approved the framework as per the prevailing conditions for maintaining the quota system for students from the erstwhile Fata in medical and other educational institutions on a merit basis after dividing South Waziristan into two districts.
It also granted approval to the establishment of a KP cell for the National Finance Commission in the Small Industrial Development Board Plaza in Islamabad, reconstitution of the KP Trade Testing Board, and Rs199 million funding for security and other development needs around the Rashakai CPEC Economic Zone.
The cabinet accepted the proposal to grant Rs168 million to the KP Education Foundation besides budget estimates of the KP Housing Authority and the purchase of four Rs49 million vehicles for the Mansehra Gravity Water Supply Scheme.
It approved financial assistance to compensate owners of rickshaws, petrol pumps, shops, vehicles, flour mills and factories for losses incurred during the 2025 flashfloods.
The cabinet allowed authorities to launch a three-year Ehsaas Education Internship Programme with an initial allocation of Rs207 million for the current year to provide 850 talented youth with internship opportunities in schools every year.
It also approved new mechanisms for contracts for five outsourced hospitals, a special compensation package for those martyred and injured in the Pakistan-India war and an Rs1 million civilian victim compensation package for Shaheed Noor Rahman, son of former member of the United Ulema Board, Shaheed Mufti Fazl Rahman.
Amendments to the Rules of Business of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Service Commission were also approved during the cabinet meeting, according to the statement.

ISLAMABAD: The telecom industry has demanded rational conditions in the spectrum auction policy expected to be announced by the federal cabinet in the coming days, suggesting that the government needs to prioritise long-term economic benefits over short-term revenue generation.
Telecom companies say spectrum is an invisible infrastructure but a crucial one as it drives digital connectivity — the foundation of modern life.
Financial technology adoption, freelancer platforms, and digital tools used by schools and hospitals all depend on mobile broadband capacity.
However, the problem is that while the demand for connectivity has surged in the country, spectrum availability remains scarce.
Currently, Pakistan has just 274 MHz of spectrum allocated nationwide, resulting in slow internet speeds, poor service quality, and limited innovation — constraining households, businesses and government institutions alike.
‘Economic realities’
Aamir Ibrahim, chief executive officer of Jazz, emphasised that Pakistan’s upcoming spectrum auction must reflect the economic realities of the telecom sector.
“Since operators earn in Pakistani rupees, spectrum pricing and payment structures should also be denominated in the same currency to ease financial pressure and accelerate network rollout,” he said in a statement.
Mr Ibrahim added that a pragmatic, long-term approach aligned with national objectives, similar to the PIA auction model, was essential to deliver affordable internet at scale and unlock Pakistan’s digital future.
Greater spectrum availability will also support freelancers, who contributed $400 million in remittances between July 2024 and March 2025 but remain constrained by unstable internet connectivity.
Nearly two-fifths of the country’s adult population remains financially excluded, as digital banking and microfinance services cannot scale without reliable connectivity.
Telecom operators also struggle with an average revenue per user of $1, which is one of the lowest globally, limiting their ability to reinvest in infrastructure.
‘Foundational reform’
The government’s recognition of this bottleneck and its decision to release more than 600 MHz of new spectrum is “therefore as a foundational reform”. It aligns with national digital goals and supports emerging technologies such as AI and the Internet of Things (IoT).
“The issue is no longer whether Pakistan needs more spectrum; it is how the auction is structured to accelerate digital progress,” the statement read. “The GSMA analysis shows that a two-year delay in releasing new spectrum could cost Pakistan $1.8 billion in GDP, while a five-year delay could exceed $4.3bn,” it added.
It warned that a “misaligned policy now means lost jobs, weaker exports and slower innovation”.
Mr Ibrahim stressed that spectrum pricing and policy must reflect domestic realities and national interest. “Clarity on future spectrum availability is essential to restore investor confidence, encourage competition and accelerate infrastructure deployment,” he added.
Rollout obligations, he continued, must prioritise imp­roved customer experience, wider rural access and service quality standards that empower the country’s digital economy.
“These are not concessions but economic enablers that turn spectrum from a one-time revenue stream into a productive long-term national asset,” he said.
“Every additional MHz carries measurable benefits for productivity, innovation, and inclusion.”
Successful test
Meanwhile, as 5G services are set to be launched in Pakistan, Zong and Huawei have successfully tested ultra-high-capacity backhaul technology to meet the growing data traffic in the country.
According to a statement, Zong, in collaboration with Huawei, completed Pakistan’s first field test of a full-duplex E-band microwave link.
With rapidly growing data demand driven by high-definition video streaming, augmented reality, cloud services and low-latency applications, traditional microwave backhaul solutions are facing increasing spectrum constraints.
The full-duplex E-band solution directly addresses these challenges, enabling next-generation network performance.
While the traditional microwave solutions are limited by spectrum resources, the new technology uses high-isolation integrated antenna structures and advanced interference cancellation algorithms to simultaneously send and receive data on the same frequency, double the spectrum efficiency — with a data transmission capacity of up to 50 Gbps per link.
“This innovative technology will be deployed in future network infrastructure, enabling Zong to offer faster, more reliable, and scalable connectivity services, providing users with a smoother and more stable network experience,” the statement read.
Zong’s Chief Technology Officer Mao Weiliang said ultra-high-capacity backhaul solutions were a foundation for Pakistan’s digital future.
“This advancement will support emerging technologies, enhance user experience, and contribute directly to national economic growth and digital inclusion,” Mr Mao added.
The company added that with the successful test, Zong had become the first operator in Pakistan to deploy full-duplex E-band technology, reinforcing its role in the country’s digital transformation.

The position is the highest rank within the Bugti tribe after Nawab Aali Bugti, who heads all six Bugti clans and was chosen as the Nawab following the death of his grand­father, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti.
According to historical records, the title of Chief of Bugti was conferred on Mir Sarfraz Bugti’s grandfather in the early 1800s, reflecting a long-standing tradition of tribal leadership and governance within the Bugti community.
The turban-tying (Dastar Bandi) ceremony was held in the Bekar area of Dera Bugti district and was attended by tribal chiefs, elders and pro­minent figures from the Bug­ti tribes. Mir Sarfraz Ahmed Bugti was formally adorned with the turban, marking his official elevation as Chief of the Bugti tribes.
Members of the Nawab Bugti family, including Nawab­­zada Zamran Saleem Akbar Bugti, were also present.
Addressing the gathering, Mir Sarfraz Bugti called for dialogue and negotiations with the state, urging armed Baloch groups to abandon violence and return to the national mainstream. He said the Baloch nation was being pushed into a futile war and stressed that no political or national objectives could be achieved through violence.
He appealed particularly to Baloch youths who have taken to the mountains to reconsider their path and opt for talks with the state. “I make this appeal on behalf of the state and the government to return and join national institutions. Other­wise, the state knows how to establish its writ,” he said.
The chief minister thanked the Bugti tribes for placing their trust in him, saying the turban was not merely an honour but a sacred responsibility. “This turban is a trust that demands justice, courage, brotherhood, love and sincerity. I promise to stand by you with honesty, hard work and full dedication, and I will never disappoint my people,” he said.
He said the trust reposed in him would be repaid thro­ugh dedicated service, parti­cularly in education. He not­­­ed that the Bugti community had lagged behind in education and said he had already facilitated the admis­sion of several children, including those from Bugti tribes, to institutions such as Lawrence College and Sadiq Public School, Bahawalpur.
Mr Bugti said he had accepted the role of Chief of the Bugti tribes with a deep sense of responsibility and pledged round-the-clock service to his people. He vowed to resolve issues faced by Bugti and neighbouring tribes through dialogue and reconciliation, and to pursue constructive solutions.
Condemning violence against civilians, he said killing unarmed people, labourers, Punjabi workers, engineers and doctors, as well as harassment of women, was against Baloch traditions. “We are custodians of Baloch traditions and cannot allow anyone to impose their ideology at gunpoint,” he said, adding that the writ of the state must be upheld at all costs.
Earlier, tribal elders formally honoured Mir Sarfraz Bugti as Chief of the Bugti tribes, with the turban placed on his head by Nawabzada Zamran Saleem Akbar Khan Bugti, brother of Nawab Mir Aali Khan Bugti, along with chiefs of various Bugti sub-tribes.

Earlier this month, the body of a three-year-old boy, Ibrahim, who fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal was recovered on December 1, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.
Following the tragedy, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials.
The incident also prompted the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to increase the budget of 246 union committees (UCs) to exclusively maintain manhole covers and streetlights.
The latest victim, identified as Dilbar, was playing outside his residence with other area children when the tragedy occurred, Korangi Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Fida Husain Janwari told Dawn.
The child’s relatives rushed to the spot, but were unable to save him. By the time the body was recovered, the child had died. SSP Janwari, along with other officials, later visited the spot where the accident happened and met the bereaved family.
The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal formalities.
According to data released by the Edhi Foundation, 27 people died in Karachi in 2025 after falling into open manholes and nullahs.
In Karachi, responsibilities for drains, roads, footpaths, sewerage, water supply and public safety are divided among the KMC, 25 town municipal corporations, around 250 union committees, the KDA, the water and sewerage corporation, cantonment boards, the Sindh government and private utilities.
The city is run by a patchwork of authorities that rarely coordinate, and often contradict one another.</p><small>2025-12-29 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29224257e58c912.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963946/bangladeshs-gen-z-party-faces-revolt-over-religious-alliance-risking-its-future' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s Gen-Z party faces revolt over religious alliance, risking its future</strong></a><br><p>A Bangladeshi youth-driven party born out of the country’s 2024 uprising is facing an open revolt from within after sealing an election alliance with a religio-political group, a move analysts say could jeopardise its future and reinforce established parties.
At least 30 senior leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP) have openly opposed its alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, announced on Sunday, with several resigning in protest.
The Muslim-majority South Asian nation goes to the polls on February 12.
Before the deal, opinion polls had predicted Jamaat finishing a close second behind the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, while the NCP lagged far behind in third place.
“The NCP presented itself as a youth-driven alternative to traditional power structures. That identity is now under serious strain,” said H.M. Nazmul Alam, an academic. “Youth-based movements do not collapse only because they lose elections. They collapse when they lose clarity and internal unity.”
‘Alliance for greater unity’
The NCP was formed earlier this year by leaders of the protests that ousted long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, forcing her to flee to India. Driven by Gen-Z activists born after the late 1990s, it says it aims to free the nation from decades of nepotism and the dominance of Hasina’s Awami League and the BNP.
With the Awami League banned, the vote will be effectively a direct contest between the BNP and Jamaat, which has trailed the other two in the past and had not been allowed to contest any elections since 2013 after a court said its registration as a political party conflicted with Bangladesh’s secular constitution.
An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus revoked all the restrictions on Jamaat in August 2024.
The NCP’s struggle shows the challenges of turning street power into votes and holds lessons for neighbouring Nepal, where similar youth-led protests ousted the government this year and fresh elections are due in March, political analysts have said.
NCP chief Nahid Islam told a press conference late on Sunday that the recent killing of 32-year-old Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the uprising, forced his party to seek an alliance to keep at bay forces trying to derail the election through violence.
“The dictatorship we overthrew is attempting to sabotage the election. Therefore, for the sake of greater unity, we have reached an electoral understanding with Jamaat, said Nahid, 27.
“This was a majority decision within the party, but some may be opposed to it and they are free to take their own decisions.”
Hadi was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier in December while launching his election campaign as an independent candidate. Police say they have identified the killers but have not apprehended them.
‘Your centrist idea and ideology will vanish’
Nahid earlier told Reuters his organisation was weak because it had not had enough time to build itself. It was also hampered by scarce funds and an unclear stance on key issues such as rights for women and minorities, Reuters reported in early December, citing party leaders who said alliance talks had been underway for some time.
One senior NCP leader to have resigned is Tasnim Jara, a doctor who left a career in Britain to join the party. She is now seeking the support of nearly 5,000 voters to be allowed to contest as an independent.
“I promised you and the people of this country that I would fight for you and for building a new political culture,” she said on Facebook.
“Whatever the circumstances, I am determined to keep that promise.”
Political analyst Asif Shahan, a professor at the University of Dhaka, said the NCP was “doomed”.
“If you go with Jamaat, it will help Jamaat, not you,” he said. “It will give them a liberal cover, and in return, you will become a force for the right. Your centrist idea and ideology - already poorly defined - will simply vanish.”</p><small>2025-12-29 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/291841107bf55dd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963936/major-martyred-5-terrorists-killed-during-ibo-in-kps-bajaur-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Major martyred, 5 terrorists killed during IBO in KP’s Bajaur: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A major-ranked officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‘s Bajaur district, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday.
The military identified the martyred officer as 36-year-old Major Adeel Zaman from Dera Ismail Khan.

On December 29, “security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in general area Khar, Bajaur district, on reported presence of Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij,” it said.
Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of operation, due to effective engagement by own troops five Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,“ said the statement.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, Major Adeel Zaman (age: 36 years, resident of Dera Ismail Khan District), a brave officer who was leading his troops from the front, having fought gallantly, rendered the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat.”
The statement further said that security forces recovered weapons and ammunition from the terrorists, who remained “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies as well as killing of innocent civilians”.
Following the operation, security forces conducted a sanitisation operation to eliminate other terrorists in the area.
“Relentless Counter-Terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” added the statement.
Funeral prayers offered
The funeral prayers of Major Adeel were offered at Peshawar Garrison later in the evening. Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, commander Peshawar Corps and other senior military and civil officers were in attendance.
Paying rich tribute to the officer’s sacrifice, Field Marshal Munir highlighted that the “martyrs of Pakistan Army are the pride of the nation and their sacrifices will forever be remembered,” said a statement by the military’s media wing.

“He prayed for the elevation of the Shaheed’s ranks in Jannah and for patience and strength for the family.”
“Major Adeel Zaman Shaheed laid down his life in the line of duty while leading from the front. Pakistan Armed Forces remain resolute in their commitment to eliminate the menace of terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices further strengthen the nation’s resolve,” added the statement.
The martyred officer will be laid to rest at his native town in Dera Ismail Khan.
Last month, at least 22 terrorists were killed and several were injured in Bajaur district during a successful counter-insurgency operation carried out by security forces.
The IBO in Bajaur’s village of Gadar was termed a “major success” by the security sources in a statement and was carried out “based on highly classified information”.
Last year, the federal government, in a meeting comprising top civilian and military leaders, announced a comprehensive, nationwide anti-militant operation codenamed ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ to mitigate a rise in attacks on security forces by militant groups.</p><small>2025-12-29 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/292050093aeed63.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963944/hamas-confirms-death-of-spokesman-abu-obeida-says-he-was-killed-by-israel-in-august' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas confirms death of spokesman Abu Obeida, says he was killed by Israel in August</strong></a><br><p>Hamas’s armed wing confirmed on Monday the death of its spokesperson, Abu Obeida, months after Israel announced he had been killed in an air strike in Gaza.
The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades released a video statement on its Telegram channel, saying: “We pause in reverence before … the masked man loved by millions … the great martyred commander and spokesperson of the Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida.”
Israel previously announced it had killed Abu Obeida in a strike on Gaza on August 30.
During the war, Abu Obeida, whose real name was Hudhayfa Samir al-Kahlout, emerged as a central figure eagerly awaited by Palestinians in Gaza, as well as by Arab and international media, for official statements from Hamas’s military wing, particularly those related to prisoner-exchange operations.







Born on February 11, 1985 and raised in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, Abu Obeida joined Hamas at an early age before becoming a member of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades.
He later became the group’s sole spokesman, delivering video statements in military uniform with his face consistently concealed by a red keffiyeh. He had also been the target of multiple Israeli assassination attempts.
According to Hamas officials, Abu Obeida embodied what they describe as “resistance” and was known for fiery and impactful speeches, many of which included threats against Israel or announcements of military operations.

“For many years, only a very small circle of Hamas officials knew his true identity,” a Hamas official told AFP.
Israel has decimated Hamas’s leadership, saying it seeks to eradicate the group following Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the war.
The video announcing Abu Obeida’s death was delivered by a masked man dressed in the former spokesperson’s distinctive style, who said he would adopt his predecessor’s name for future statements.
In the same video, he also announced the deaths of four other Hamas commanders in Israeli attacks during the war.</p><small>2025-12-29 16:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29182017fdd5196.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963937/karachi-dhaka-flights-likely-from-january-says-pakistans-high-commissioner' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi-Dhaka flights likely from January, says Pakistan’s high commissioner</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider expressed hope on Monday that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka will start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus.
Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during Sheikh Hasina’s rule. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly, with Professor Muhammad Yunus leading the interim administration in Dhaka.







“During the meeting, both sides discussed ways to expand cooperation in trade, investment, and aviation, as well as scaling up cultural, educational, and medical exchanges to further strengthen bilateral relations between the two South Asian nations,” said a statement shared on X by Bangladesh’s interim leader.
Haider, during the meeting, also noted that bilateral trade has recorded a 20 per cent growth compared to last year, with business communities from both countries actively exploring new investment opportunities.
The high commissioner further highlighted a “significant increase” in cultural exchanges, adding that “Bangladeshi students have shown strong interest in higher education opportunities in Pakistan, particularly in medical sciences, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence”.
“Pakistan has witnessed a rise in patients travelling to its leading hospitals for liver and kidney transplants,” said Islamabad’s envoy.
According to the statement, the high commissioner also stated that Pakistan was ready to offer “training and academic opportunities in transplantation-related medical fields”.
The statement added that Bangladesh’s interim leader welcomed the “growing interactions between the two countries” and emphasised the “importance of increased visits, as well as cultural, educational, and people-to-people exchanges among SAARC member states.”
“Professor Yunus also underscored the need to further boost Bangladesh–Pakistan trade,” added the statement.
Yunus also expressed hope that during the current high commissioner’s tenure, both countries would “explore new avenues for investment and joint venture businesses“.
In August, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also met with Professor Yunus.
During his landmark visit to Dhaka, both countries stressed the need to revitalise regional cooperation through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).
The Foreign Office (FO) termed Dar’s two-day visit — the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years — a “significant milestone” in the two countries’ relations.
Paki­stan and Bangladesh had agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side a month before, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka.</p><small>2025-12-29 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29182430cf34362.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963938/in-letter-to-maryam-kp-cm-expresses-deep-concern-over-treatment-meted-out-to-him-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>In letter to Maryam, KP CM expresses ‘deep concern’ over treatment meted out to him in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter addressed to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday, expressed “deep concern” at the treatment meted out to him during his three-day Lahore visit, stating it was marked by “discourtesy and unnecessary hostility”.
In a two-page letter, posted on X by the KP government, the Afridi recorded his formal objection to the Punjab government’s conduct, and said, “I write to you with deep concern and strong exception to the manner in which my recent visit to the Province of Punjab was handled, and the events that deliberately unfolded during and after the visit.”







He recalled that the “sequence of actions witnessed was neither accidental nor administrative in nature.
“It reflects conduct that is wholly incompatible with the dignity of constitutional office and the spirit of inter-provincial respect,” he said.
CM Afridi told the Punjab CM that he undertook the visit in his capacity as the chief minister.
“Regrettably, the treatment accorded to me was marked by discourtesy, unnecessary hostility, and protocol deviations that cannot be justified under any accepted standard of inter-provincial engagement,” he said.
Afridi maintained that the Punjab government’s adoption of an extraordinary and excessive security posture — including sweeping detentions and visible enforcement theatrics — was “a message of intimidation rather than cooperation”.
He complained that “such measures were neither proportionate nor warranted and conveyed an intent that went well beyond legitimate security considerations”.
The KP chief minister further recalled that “even public places, including food streets and markets, were completely sealed, and whole blackouts were affected, venues denied, paining the common citizens of Lahore at this expense”.
“Free access, as provided for in the Constitution, was even denied at Motorway rest areas,” added the letter.
The KP CM also took note of the “coordinated and malicious social media campaign that accompanied and followed“ his visit.
“Serious insinuations- specifically linking with narcotics were injected into public discourse,” Afridi said.
“These allegations were amplified through accounts widely perceived to be aligned with, or operating under the umbrella of, the Government of Punjab,” he alleged.
He continued: “Let me state this clearly: the use of state-linked digital platforms to circulate or amplify defamatory insinuations against a sitting Chief Minister of another province is unacceptable, irresponsible, and institutionally indefensible.”
“Allegations of such gravity cannot be floated through innuendo or suggestion; they require evidence, jurisdiction, and lawful process,” he told the Punjab CM.
“Anything short of that constitutes character assassination,” he added.
KP CM was of the view that, “taken together — protocol degradation, excessive policing optics, and synchronised digital vilification — the pattern is too consistent to be dismissed as coincidental”.
He alleged that the series of events suggested “planning and intent, aimed at humiliation rather than engagement”.
CM Afridi maintained that “such actions undermine federal harmony, erode public trust in provincial institutions, and [set] a dangerous precedent where constitutional officeholders are targeted through insinuation rather than addressed through formal channels.”
He termed the conduct “beneath the status of a provincial government“, and stressed that it damaged the ”collective credibility of federating units.“
As he concluded his letter to Maryam, the chief minister stated: “I place on record my strong protest and rejection of the treatment meted out to me and of the defamatory narratives propagated during this episode.”
“I expect that your government will ensure that such conduct — administrative as well as digital — is neither repeated nor normalised, and that accountability is enforced where required,” he said.
Punjab govt‘s conduct ‘undemocratic and reprehensible’
Separately, the KP CM also condemned the treatment meted out to him by the Punjab government during a cabinet meeting today, calling it “undemocratic, reprehensible and contrary to national unity”.







The chief minister condemned the treatment and said, “The way me and my cabinet members were treated, the whole world witnessed it“.
“When the country is going through political and economic instability, such an attitude — at a time when we need national unity — will only fan flames of hatred,“ the chief minister said.
“Violence was perpetrated against cabinet members by the Punjab government, and roads were continuously blocked for a provincial chief minister, markets were forcibly shut down, even motorway rest areas were sealed, and turning off the lights during a visit to Mazar-e-Iqbal is extremely regrettable,” the minister was quoted as saying.
He remarked that “such an attitude — reflecting Punjab government’s moral and intellectual depravity — was condemnable and alarming“.
Afridi noted that the actions were “especially alarming given the instability in the country“ and warned that by continuing with such behaviour, “they were sowing hatred and division”.
“We condemn the attitude in the strongest of words,” he said, adding that hateful attitudes were “detrimental to the country”.
KP CM directed his government officials to be hospitable towards any officials or chief ministers visiting KP from other provinces in accordance with cultural traditions and norms.
During the meeting, the chief minister also highlighted that the Centre had yet to release funds owed to the merged districts of KP under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP).
“Work remains stalled in our merged districts because of it,” he said, adding that the Centre owed KP Rs4,758 billion.
“It has been more than half a year, and we have not yet received the funds under AIP,” the chief minister said.
“Even the amount that was already committed is not being given,” he added.
Afridi was in Lahore to launch PTI’s street movement. He had arrived on Friday around 4:30pm, from where he made a beeline for the Punjab Assembly.
However, the visit to the provincial legislature was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while several heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
During his visit, he criticised the Punjab government for its rude behaviour toward him.
“This shows their mean mentality, which cannot be approved in a civilised society,” he lambasted them and alleged that the “Punjab government is fanning hatred between the two provinces.“
Regretting the administration’s attitude on his arrival, he invited CM Maryam to visit KP, saying he would show her how democratic forces respect the office of a provincial chief executive.
In a separate incident during his visit, when CM Afridi’s entourage reached Lahore’s Food Street for dinner, all restaurants were shut with the lights turned off, and even the general public was evicted.</p><small>2025-12-29 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642136-eight-year-old-boy-dies-after-falling-into-sewer-in-karachis-mehran-town' target='_blank'><strong>Eight-year-old boy dies after falling into sewer in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

A special court on December 20 sentenced Imran and Bushra to 17 years imprisonment in the case, which pertained to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price.
During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m.
According to copies of the appeal available with Dawn, the couple’s lawyers contended that the sentencing was politically motivated, arguing, “The overarching objective of the present prosecution appears to be the continued incarceration of the appellant, thereby preventing his participation in national politics and curtailing his political role and influence.”
Furthermore, it was noted that the case, initiated by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), had been transferred to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
“The learned trial court overlooked the methodology adopted by the Federal Investigation Agency in conducting the investigation. In the absence of settled law, precedent, or clear guidance on the subject, heightened care and caution were required in interpreting and applying the governing legal framework,” the appeal read.
“Instead, both the investigating agency and the Trial Court proceeded in a cursory manner. This is evident from the absence of any FIR (first information report) on the record.”
The appeals also noted that the FIA submitted a challan “within two days of the initiation of the investigation”, leaving inadequate time to conduct a fair and transparent probe.
It was further noted that the Toshakhana 2 conviction was the fourth prosecution in the Toshakhana cases and constituted double jeopardy, “reflecting a repetitive and overlapping invocation of criminal process in respect of the same subject matter”.
“NAB deliberately chose to bifurcate the prosecution by selectively proceeding in respect of one set of gifts while deferring or abandoning prosecution in respect of the others. Such a course of action is impermissible in law,” the appeals read, noting that Toshakahana 1 and 2 revolved around different gifts.
“The bifurcation of what ought to have been a single, composite trial into multiple proceedings was undertaken with the ulterior motive of ensuring the continued incarceration of the present appellant,” the appeals argued.
Moreover, the appeals stated that the conviction ignored the 2018 Toshakhana policy, with Clause I, mandating that all gifts received shall be duly reported and deposited with the Toshakhana.
Clause VI “provides that gifts valued above Rs30,000 may be retained by the recipient upon payment of 50 per cent of the value exceeding the basic exemption of Rs30,000”.
The appeals further argued that there was no violation of the Toshakhana policy, as the gifts were deposited and fees to retain the gifts were paid. It further noted that there are no criminal provisions or charges of criminal breach of trust or criminal misconduct envisaged in the policy, making the sentencing unlawful.
“The learned trial judge misread and misapplied the relevant Toshakhana Policy/Rules governing retention of gifts,” the appeals read.
“The prosecution wholly failed to establish the guilt of the appellant and his wife beyond [a] reasonable doubt; however, this fundamental deficiency was entirely overlooked by the learned Special Judge, Central, while recording the conviction.”
Furthermore, the appeals contended that a criminal breach of trust requires the entrustment of property, dishonest misappropriation of such property for the accused’s own use, and in cases falling under Section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by bank, merchant, or agent) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), the accused must be a “public servant”; they contended that Imran and Bushra did not meet these requirements.
“In the present case, the prosecution has failed to establish any of these foundational elements. There was no dishonest misappropriation or conversion, as the gifts were duly retained strictly in accordance with the Toshakhana Policy and Rules after payment of the requisite assessed amount,” the appeals read, arguing that Imran did not fall within the definition of a public servant as per Section 21 of the PPC.
“The learned trial court, in paragraph 15 of the impugned judgment, has manifestly faltered in bringing the appellant within the ambit of the definition of a ‘public servant’ by relying upon the ninth description of Section 21 PPC, coupled with vague precedents from 1957 and 1961. This reflects a flawed, incorrect, and legally unsustainable approach,” Imran’s appeal read.
Bushra’s appeal noted that she was “a housewife who has never held, occupied, or performed the functions of any public office”, meaning that the ruling was “coram non judice, without lawful authority, and liable to be set aside in its entirety”.
The appeals requested that the December 20 judgment be set aside and that Imran and Bushra be acquitted of the charges in the Toshakhana 2 case.
Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year, in October, the two had denied all allegations in the case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.</p><small>2025-12-29 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642119-pakistan-army-major-martyred-five-terrorists-killed-in-kp-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Army major martyred, five terrorists killed in KP IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

Basant is returning to Lahore after 18 years, the way for which was paved by the passing of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025 by the provincial assembly on December 24.
The legislation authorised deputy commissioners to grant conditional permission for kite-flying — which otherwise remains banned in Punjab — on specified days and at designated locations.
Subsequently, a notification issued by the Lahore DC today said: “In exercise of powers conferred under section 6(1) of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025 and in pursuance of approval of the Government, it is hereby notified that kite-flying is allowed within the territorial limits of District Lahore on the occasion of Basant 2026,” subject to conditions.
The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn, did not specify any particular area for flying kites, implying that the government had allowed festivities across the district.
Notifying the manufacturing, trade and sale of “permissible kite flying material”, the Lahore DC said that the manufacturing and trade of permissible kite flying material will be allowed from Dec 30 to Feb 8, 2026, subject to valid digital registration under Rule 3 of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules 2025 and the regulations thereunder.
The sale of permissible kite flying material to the general public shall be allowed from Feb 1-8, exclusively by the registered sellers in accordance with the notified rules and regulations, the notification said.
The registration for manufacturers, traders or sellers of permissible kite flying material will be opened from Monday (today) through the government’s e-biz app or the festival’s website under the notified rules and regulations, it said.
It also prohibited manufacturers, traders or sellers from manufacturing, trading, storing or selling permissible kite flying material unless registered with the DC’s office under the relevant rules and regulations.
It stated that only such kite flying material, as specified in Schedule-I of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules, 2025, was to be manufactured, traded, stored, sold or used during the notified period.
It further directed that the kites should not exceed 35 inches in width and 30 inches in length while the gudda should not exceed 40 inches in width and 34 inches in length.
It also directed that the kite string be made of cotton with no more than nine threads and “no less than 28-count” coated with maanjha (coating) and having a minimum sheesha size of 350 mash. The string is only to be wound in the shape of a pinna (twine balls) and the use of charkhi (spool) is strictly prohibited.
The manufacturing, trade, transport, storage, sale, possession or use of sharp maanjha nylon or plastic cords, metallic wire or any other injurious material coated on the thread has been strictly prohibited.
All registered manufacturers, traders and sellers were directed to clearly display valid registration certificates at approved premises, as required under rule 3(6) of the regulation.
The notification added that complete records of stock, sales and movement would be maintained and produced on demand by registered manufacturers, traders and sellers to any authorised officer of the DC.
All registered kite-flying associations, while complying with the responsibilities assigned under the regulation, were told to remain in close coordination with the DC and the authorised officers for the smooth and safe conduct of the kite flying event, it said.
Permissions granted under the notification were to be regulated and implemented strictly in accordance with the ordinance and its rules.
All motorcycles operating within the Lahore district were directed to comply with the safety specifications as specified in the kite flying regulation.
It directed all departments, attached departments, agencies and organisations of the government to assist the district administration and police to enforce strict compliance with all terms and conditions of the notification as per law, rules and regulations to ensure public safety.
The DC’s notification also called for all motorcycle riders within Lahore district to install safety wires in order to protect their lives.
“Any violation of this notification shall render the offender liable to action under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025, the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules, 2025 and the Punjab Kite Flying Regulations, 2025 including cancellation of permission or registration, seizure of material and prosecution in accordance with the law,” the notification added.
Kite flying is being allowed in Punjab after an 18-year hiatus — former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi had banned the festival in 2007, following an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused to motorcyclists by prohibited sharp strings, as well as judicial pressure.
The Punjab government is now trying to revive the festival, on the recommendation of PML-N chief and former premier Nawaz Sharif following meetings with Basant stakeholders.
The Punjab government has issued strict instructions to the respective divisional commissioners, DCs and district police officers (DPOs) to notify the Basant dates after making arrangements for the festival to remain safe and ensure that no damage is reported to the lives and well-being of the people.
For Basant to be celebrated elsewhere in Punjab, the deputy commissioners of their respective districts will be required to issue similar notifications and ensure the implementation of the conditions and restrictions identified by the Punjab government under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules 2025, a comprehensive legal framework to regulate kite-flying.
Although the ban on kite flying continues in Punjab except on the three notified days, at least two incidents have been reported — one each in Lahore and Pattoki — in which a young man and a minor girl were injured by the string of a stray kite.
In this connection, a source in the Punjab Home Department told Dawn that the department was “disturbed” over these incidents because the manufacturing of string and kites, as well as kite-flying was banned across the province.
“How and where these strings (dor) and kites were manufactured?” the source said, adding that the department was of the view that the respective districts’ administrations should look into the matter and make arrests as these activities were tantamount to violation of notified rules and regulations.</p><small>2025-12-29 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642101-pakistans-conflicts-with-india-afghanistan-can-escalate-in-2026-says-us-think-tank' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's conflict with India, Afghanistan may escalate into armed clashes in 2026: report</strong></a><br><p>

The district police’s spokesperson, Qudratullah, confirming the attack, said that “the official was going to his place of duty in a private pickup when terrorists riding on motorcycles intercepted the vehicle and opened fire on him”.
The incident occurred within the limits of the Shaheed Haibat Ali Khan police station in Darra Pezu Town.
The police official was identified as Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Mumtaz Ali, and was posted as the muharir of City Police Station in Tank.
The assailants managed to flee, while the police have launched a search operation, Qudratullah added.
The body of the deceased was shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital for medico-legal formalities, he added.
Later, funeral prayers for the deceased were offered at the police lines in the District Headquarters Complex, Tajazai.
Recently, many areas of KP have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
On Saturday, district police said that a wanted terrorist commander was killed during an ongoing operation in the district. A day prior, armed locals and police forces killed six terrorists in the same area.
Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022.</p><small>2025-12-29 12:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/291536166c5dfcd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963928/na-secretariat-writes-fourth-letter-to-opposition-chief-whip-seeking-details-of-cases-involving-omar-ayub' target='_blank'><strong>NA Secretariat writes fourth letter to opposition chief whip seeking details of cases involving Omar Ayub</strong></a><br><p>The National Assembly Secretariat on Monday wrote a fourth letter to the opposition’s chief whip, Amir Dogar, seeking a written reply detailing court cases pending against former opposition leader Omar Ayub.
Since Omar Ayub’s disqualification by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the seat of the opposition leader in the lower house has been vacant. Meanwhile, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had maintained that the matter of the nomination of the opposition leader in the house is “sub judice”.
According to the press release issued by the NA Secretariat spokesperson, earlier letters on the same matter were sent on November 19, December 5, and December 19, 2025. “However, no response has so far been received by the National Assembly Secretariat,” it said.







The statement said that the “provision of this information is essential to fulfil the constitutional requirements for the appointment of the Leader of the Opposition”.
“The [National Assembly] Secretariat has been made a party in certain subjudice cases involving the former Leader of the Opposition, making it necessary to obtain the current status of the cases,” the statement said.
“In the letter, the Chief Whip of the Opposition has been requested to provide the requisite information regarding the current status of court cases pending against Omar Ayub, so that the process for the appointment of the Leader of the Opposition may be completed.“
The statement by the NA Secretariat elaborated that the process for appointing a new opposition leader can only proceed “upon receipt of the required information”.
In August, the ECP had disqualified the then-opposition leader in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub, following his conviction in cases related to the May 9 riots.
Later, incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan had nominated Mahmood Khan Achakzai for the post of opposition leader in the National Assembly.
The PTI leadership had emphasised that the protracted delay in the appointment of the opposition leader may erode the parliament’s credibility and undermine the democratic framework.</p><small>2025-12-29 12:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642095-kite-flying-rules-sales-window-notified-ahead-of-basant-festival-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Kite-flying rules, sales window notified ahead of Basant festival in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>

The ordinance, which empowers deputy commissioner-led committees to decide property disputes, has become a point of contention with LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum suspending its operation on December 22 and the provinicial government voicing opposition to the court decision.
Today, Justice Faisal Zaman Khan took up a petition filed by two members of the Punjab Assembly against the ordinance. The petition was filed by MPAs Imtiaz Mahmood and Ijaz Shafi — who are both backed by the PTI, which is in the opposition in Punjab — on Saturday.
Their lawyer, Azhar Siddique, appeared before the court at the hearing where the judge asked him whether the petitioners had raised their concerns against the law in the Punjab Assembly.
The judge further remarked that despite “extensive trolling”, the court had taken up the matter.
He expressed regret that the petitioners had not raised the matter in the assembly and opted to file a petition in the court instead, observing that the issue “should not be politicised” as it involves the property rights of poor citizens.
Justice Khan asked the lawyer whether it was “necessary to politicise the matter”.
He further said that it would have been understandable had the petition been filed by an affected person and regretted that the petition was posted on Facebook before the hearing.
“Principally, you should withdraw your petition,” the judge said while addressing the lawyer.
Observing that there was no urgency to entertain the petition during the ongoing winter vacations, he instructed the court office to fix it before any appropriate bench after the vacations.
LHC suspends decisions taken by DRCs in property disputes
Separately, Justice Muhammad Raza Qureshi of the LHC suspended the decisions of deputy commissioner-led dispute resolution committees (DRC) in four other petitions filed by the aggrieved persons.
Zubaida Bibi from Changa Manga and others had approached the court against the property ownership protection law and decisions taken by DRCs.
Justice Qureshi observed that commissioners and deputy commissioners did not have the authority to “remove the possession of a property on their own”.
For their part, the petitioners pointed out that the disputes over ownership of the land were already pending before civil courts, and the status quo was also maintained by the courts.
They said the DRCs ordered the removal of possession on applications filed by the opposing parties despite the pendency of the matter before the courts.
Justice Qureshi suspended the DRCs’ decisions and ordered the office to fix the petitions before a yet-to-be-formed full bench for further hearing.
The diagreement
The recently passed legislation — Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Ordinance 2025 — mandates resolution of land disputes within 90 days. It was approved by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on October 31.
It empowers DCs to communicate directly with revenue officials and civil courts — a measure that is said to be aimed at preventing unnecessary stay orders that delay justice.
However, LHC CJ Neelum suspended the ordinance’s operation earlier this month, observing that “it appears that some people want to hold all powers”.
She also questioned the purpose of the law and asked how could a revenue officer hand over the possession of a property in a matter pending before a civil court.
The LHC CJ observed that the new law had dismantled the civil setup, civil rights and judicial supremacy. “If it is up to the authorities, they would even suspend the Constitution,” she said.
A day after the LHC CJ’s directive, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz argued against the decision, saying in a statement that it was “not in line with the settled principles laid down by the superior judiciary”.
Its suspension would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”, and the public would perceive it as state patronage of such elements, she said.
The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), on the other hand, had backed the LHC CJ’s decision and cautioned the Punjab government against implementing what it describes as the “unlawful aspirations of land mafias”.</p><small>2025-12-29 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642058-imran-khan-bushra-bibi-challenge-toshakhana-2-case-conviction-in-ihc' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi challenge Toshakhana-2 case conviction in IHC</strong></a><br><p>

“Yes, we have appealed his sentencing,” Hameed’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, told Dawn but did not share any details about the appeal.
Hameed was sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment by a military court on December 11 after being convicted on four counts related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and causing harm to others.
He had a 40-day window following his conviction and sentencing to appeal against the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) decision, according to Section 133B of the Pakistan Army Act.
The appeal is first reviewed by a Court of Appeals, led by a major general or higher, as designated by the army chief. The chief then holds the authority to confirm, revise, or overturn the sentence.
Historically, the military’s appellate process has stretched over several years.
Hameed’s sentencing
Announcing Hameed’s conviction and sentencing on December 11, the military’s media wing had said in a statement that the process of FGCM was initiated against him on August 12, 2024 under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act, spanning over 15 months.
“After lengthy and laborious legal proceedings, the accused has been found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment,” Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said.
ISPR had further stated that the “involvement of convict (Hameed) in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with”.
Hameed was referred to in the statement as “Mr Faiz Hameed, formerly a lieutenant general”, creating the impression he may have been stripped of his rank, although ISPR did not explicitly confirm this.
A source familiar with internal procedures told Dawn at the time any such withdrawal “is done through an administrative order” as per established rules, but declined to confirm whether it had occurred in this case.
Background
Hameed, who retired in November 2022, is the first former ISI director general and only the second three-star general in Pakistan’s history to face a full military trial and be sentenced to a jail term.
The case against him originated from accusations by property developer Kanwar Moeez Khan, who alleged that in 2017 that Hameed — then a major general in ISI — and two officers orchestrated a raid at his home and offices, seized valuables and coerced him into paying Rs40 million and financing a private television channel. The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court advised the complainant to seek remedies through the defence ministry, leading to a formal military inquiry.
While the Army Act typically allows action against retired personnel within six months of retirement, the proceedings reportedly invoked Section 2(d), which extends military jurisdiction to certain offences committed by persons not subject to military law, though exceptions were also available under Sections 31 and 40, which permit court martial regardless of time elapsed for offences involving mutiny, insubordination or fraudulent acts related to property.
A Court of Inquiry convened in April 2024 found grounds to proceed, leading to Hameed’s arrest on August 12 of that year. He was subsequently served a detailed charge sheet covering four categories of alleged misconduct: post-retirement political engagement; violations of the Official Secrets Act; misuse of authority, including the 2017 raid; and causing wrongful loss through coercive actions against Moeez.
The investigation was later widened to include several retired officers, among them retired Brig Ghaffar, retired Brig Naeem Fakhar and retired Col Asim, although the verdict did not state what determination the FGCM made regarding them.</p><small>2025-12-29 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642055-leas-foil-bla-attempt-to-groom-child-for-suicide-attack-via-social-media' target='_blank'><strong>LEAs foil BLA's attempt to groom child for suicide attack via social media</strong></a><br><p>

Last week, mobs armed with wooden sticks vandalised Christmas decorations at a shopping mall in central India, while right-wing groups disrupted school celebrations and burned holiday merchandise in the northeast, according to Indian media. The incidents occurred in the states of Chhattisgarh, Assam, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh ahead of the holiday.
In a statement released on Monday, the FO said, “The persecution of minorities in India is a matter of deep concern.
“Recent condemnable incidents of vandalism during Christmas, as well as state-sponsored campaigns targeting Muslims — including the demolition of their homes and repeated lynchings, notably the case of Muhammad Akhlaq, in which the state worked to shield the perpetrators from accountability — have deepened fear and alienation among Muslims,” it said.







Akhlaq, a 50-year-old man was beaten to death in India in 2015, while his 22-year-old son was severely injured after it was rumoured that the family had been storing and consuming beef in India’s Uttar Pradesh.
Last month, The Hindu reported that the Uttar Pradesh government was seeking to withdraw the case against the accused. Last week, Times of India reported that the government’s plea had been dismissed.
In its statement, the FO said, “The list of such victims is sadly long. The international community should take note of these developments and take appropriate steps to help protect the fundamental rights of vulnerable communities in India.”
Last week, The Indian Express reported that a mob stormed a mall and destroyed Christmas installations in the city of Raipur in Chhattisgarh state.

The incident occurred on the same day the Sarva Hindu Samaj organisation called for a “bandh” — a general strike — to protest alleged religious conversions and recent clashes over the burial of a person from a converted family.
“Around 80-90 people barged in,” an employee of the mall told The Indian Express, adding that the mob threatened and shouted at the staff, and “indulged in violence”.
Separately, in the Nalbari district of Assam, The Hindu reported that members of the Vishva Hindu Parishad Bajrang Dal vandalised a school and disrupted Christmas preparations. The group has been classified as a militant religious organisation by the US Central Intelligence Agency.
An unidentified police official told The Hindu that activists targeted St. Mary’s School in Panigaon village.
“The activists entered the St Mary’s School of Panigaon village and vandalised the preparation of the Christmas Day programme,” the official said. “They burnt down the banner and posters of the celebration.”</p><small>2025-12-29 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642040-weaponisation-of-water-ppps-shery-rehman-slams-india-for-approving-hydropower-project-on-chenab' target='_blank'><strong>'Weaponisation of water': PPP's Sherry Rehman slams India for approving hydropower project on Chenab</strong></a><br><p>

Butt appeared before the sessions court (Central) upon the expiry of his interim bail, which was granted to him on December 20. The hearing, however, was marred by violence and chaos as Butt was attacked.
Butt‘s counsel, Mian Ali Ashfaq, alleged in a post on social media platform X that his client had been attacked by “some lawyers” at Karachi City Courts’ premises during the hearing of a case.







He said the attack was carried out in his presence, in which Butt was injured.
“[They] continued to beat him despite being repeatedly asked to stop,” Ashfaq said, terming “such conduct by the lawyers unprofessional”.
He added, “Taking the law into their hands is weakening the reputation of lawyers in the country.”
Ashfaq further stated that if “lawyers will become a party [in cases] every other day and continue to attack private litigants on court premises,  their respect will suffer an immense and continuous decline“.
“This is an unfortunate aspect that has no place in any educated society,” he said.
A video shared after the incident showed Butt, in a shirt torn from places, moving through a crowd surrounding him.
Another video showed Butt walking along with a group of lawyers, who were raising slogans “Karachi Bar Zindabad” (long live Karachi Bar). Among them was also Riaz Solangi, who is the complainant in the case registered against Butt for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.
In the video, Solangi is seen saying Butt had made a video in which he had used inappropriate words for lawyers. Another person in the group, who also appeared to be a lawyer from his attire, can be seen saying that “what has happened today, we did that over his words for lawyers and misbehaviour against them […] Anyone who says anything against lawyers will end up in the same condition”.
Tiktoker Nadeem Mubarak, also known as Nani Wala, was also present on the occasion and seen one of the videos.
Mubarak and Butt, who have been facing legal proceedings in multiple cases, had returned to Pakistan together on December 10 from London after the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted 10-day protective bail to the social media influencers in response to a petition filed by their relatives.
The have been facing legal proceedings in multiple cases, and Butt’s interim bail in the case that was taken up by the sessions court today has now been extended till January 13.
The case
Solangi had lodged a complaint against Butt in January at the Hyderi Market police station, under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the first information report (FIR), the complainant said that in December 2024, he watched a viral video of the YouTuber in which he was allegedly performing prayer (namaz) while music was playing in the background.
It is pertinent to mention that the FIR was registered after a sessions court allowed the complainant’s application filed under Section 22-A, seeking directives for the Hyderi Market SHO to lodge a case against the YouTuber.
As the video went viral on social media, Butt posted subsequent videos on his official Facebook page in January in which he was seen sitting with scholars from different schools of thought.
In the three-part video, he had issued an apology, stating that if anyone’s feelings were hurt by his unintentional actions, he deeply regretted it.</p><small>2025-12-29 07:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642027-watch-karachi-zoo-gets-new-lion-enclosure-reptile-house' target='_blank'><strong>WATCH: Karachi Zoo gets new lion enclosure, Reptile House</strong></a><br><p>
