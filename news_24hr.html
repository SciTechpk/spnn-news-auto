A single-judge bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kasi, after hearing arguments from both sides, granted bail to Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai against surety bonds of Rs500,000. He was released following the court’s approval of the bail application.
Earlier, police had arrested Sardar Satakzai on the allegation that, as a tribal chief, he had endorsed through a jirga the killing of the woman and the man. Acting on the jirga’s order, the woman’s brother opened fire on his 40-year-old sister, Bano Bibi, in the presence of a large number of people from the area. At the same time, the man, Ehsanullah, was also killed at the same place.
 
 

The incident came to light after a video of the firing went viral on social media more than a month after the killings had taken place. Police launched an investigation and arrested several people, including Sardar Sherbaz Khan Satakzai.
So far, police have arrested 17 people in connection with the case, including Bano Bibi’s mother and another brother. The mother was later released on bail. However, the main accused, who shot and killed his own sister, has not yet been arrested.

Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Raffat Imtiaz had appeared in person before the Supreme Court last Friday to institute constitutional petitions challenging the exercise of administrative powers by the IHC chief justice.
According to the objections, the petitioners invoked the apex court’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but the grievances raised were of an individual nature and thus not maintainable in view of the 1998 Zulfiqar Mehdi case.
In that judgement, the SC had held that Article 184(3) could not be pressed into service for redress of personal grievances.
 
 

Incidentally, the same case law was cited by the SC registrar while returning Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar’s petition, seeking a hearing of challenges to the 26th Amendment, on the same day. The registrar office further observed that the petitioners had not demonstrated what questions of “public importance” were involved for the enforcement of fundamental rights — a condition precedent for invoking Article 184(3), sources said.
It added that the notices issued to the respondents — IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, the registrar of the high court, and the federal government through the law secretary — had not been properly drawn up, since they failed to specify the purpose of the petitions.
In their petitions, the judges sought a declaration that the administrative powers of the IHC chief justice could not be exercised in a manner that undermined judicial authority. They argued that once a bench was seized of a matter, the IHC CJ was not empowered to transfer cases or reconstitute the bench, nor to exclude available judges from the roster at will.
The pleas further contended that constitution of benches, transfer of cases and issuance of rosters could only be undertaken in terms of Articles 192(1) and 202 of the Constitution, and that the “Master of the Roster” doctrine had already been set aside by the SC in its 2024 judgement in the Practice and Procedure case.
They also challenged the formation of the IHC administrative committees through notifications issued on Feb 3 and July 15 this year, terming them mala fide, illegal and coram non judice, and requested the apex court to declare such notifications void.

Expert Opinion by High-Level Panel on Public Interest Media
Governments around the world are chasing the AI dream, pinning their hopes on these technologies to drive economic prosperity. And yet, they are not investing in the foundational resource that underpins all our 21st century economies — independent, verifiable information.
Well-functioning economies rely on widely accessible, verified, and trustworthy information. Public interest journalism provides a vital supply of such information: it exposes corruption, fraud, and market manipulation, brings stability to financial markets, checks misinformation, and it empowers economic actors to make informed investments. Without it, national economies, international trade, and capital flows between countries cannot function properly, with wide-ranging and negative impacts on social welfare.
But this valuable resource is facing an existential financial and political crisis worldwide.
The High-Level Panel on Public Interest Media, including two Nobel laureates, was formed to assess the economic and social implications of the crisis confronting public interest media globally. We have reviewed the evidence and surveyed global trends with a growing sense of alarm.
We are concerned that our economies are increasingly vulnerable to information that is neither independent, nor accurate. In 2024, as many as 90 countries were targeted by foreign state-sponsored efforts to manipulate information. The rise of Generative AI risks accelerating these tactics and heightens the challenges in thwarting the spread of false information online. Meanwhile, independent journalists and media organizations are coming under increasing political and economic pressures as autocracies and vested interests take hold.
Our report, The Economic Imperative of Investing in Public Interest Media, shows why market forces alone are incapable of sustaining this vital public good: historically profitable business models are failing as revenues migrate to online platforms, allowing powerful interests to co-opt, intimidate or neutralize independent media.
While donor support for public interest media has always been low, it is now dwarfed by the amount invested by autocratic actors on propaganda. Russia spends on disinformation and propaganda, including on content directed outside its borders, at least three times the foreign aid of the world’s largest democratic nations in support of free and independent media, and is not alone in doing so.
The situation is even more complicated in developing economies, where growing inequality regarding access to information requires championing local innovation to correct systematic biases and digital inequalities, as can be observed in the African media ecosystem, for example.
Without reliable information, we cannot address the most pressing economic, social, and environmental challenges of our times. From tackling the climate crisis to managing global pandemics, the proliferation of disinformation over facts carries immense costs. Without decisive action, both at domestic and global levels, we are heading towards what Nobel laureate Maria Ressa has called “an information Armageddon” that will jeopardise global economic stability, social welfare, and sustainable growth.
We urgently call for decisive public action now, and lay out two priority sets of action to protect public interest media, and develop the policies needed to shape tomorrow’s information markets for economic prosperity and social welfare.
Both require a fundamental reappraisal of the economic and social value of independent, verifiable information as a foundational infrastructure for thriving markets and societies.
First, governments should invest in the new models needed to incentivize, support and safeguard free and independent media. Financial support to public interest media is one of the most cost-effective interventions to ensure accountable, well-functioning economic systems with potentially large future economic and social returns. However, such investments must be accompanied by strong safeguards to prevent government capture and should foster a pluralistic media ecosystem that includes the private sector and a vibrant civil society.
They should be channeled through proven and effective national and multilateral mechanisms that sustain the supply of factual information and provide guardrails against undue influence. Mechanisms like the International Fund for Public Interest Media demonstrate how independence and scale can be combined to deliver significant global impact, as similar pooled vehicles have done in areas like health and education.
Second, governments need to actively shape information markets in ways that foster independent, pluralistic and reliable information sources. An ‘information industrial policy’ is needed to foster a viable and independent media ecosystem - one that incentivizes market dynamism along with carefully managed regulation fit for an AI-driven economy. Such a policy must better incorporate public needs and oversight, which will be critical in developed and developing economies alike, and reward facts over lies. Multilateral cooperation frameworks like the International Partnership for Information and Democracy can help foster shared learning and best practices on policy interventions.
First signs of progress are emerging. In a few weeks, the Presidents of France and Ghana will host an International Conference to strengthen the response to the global information crisis. Yet more leaders must urgently embrace this agenda. Without decisive action, our information ecosystems will continue to deteriorate rapidly, weakening the benefits of the AI revolution and threatening both global prosperity and social welfare. The moment to act is now.

They found solace in India even if they were not eventually convinced of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s healing powers.
Nelson Mandela needed to thank those who with their moral courage stood by him through the thick and thin of apartheid. He visited India at the top of the list just to express his deep gratitude. India was regarded as a spiritual Alamut and a politically upright comrade, not calculating or self-regarding, but an earnest friend.
It has taken 11 years to sully the image. Hindu Nepal or Muslim Saudi Arabia, Christian US or Buddhist Sri Lanka and, closer to home, the marooned Sikhs in Punjab — the message from everyone is unmistakable and loud. Hindu nationalism has humiliated India and has put it on a slippery slope to a catastrophe.
 
 

All the tight and usually unwarranted embraces the Indian prime minister unleashed on foreign dignitaries over a decade or so and got photographed for a captive media to sing paeans to, ring hollow today.
Indians abroad are increasingly enduring the slings and arrows of racism, jingoism and slur, all because they know that returning home holds even more dire prospects for them. How many Indian prime ministers before the advent of Narendra Modi needed to lunge at heads of state or government to hug them at any opportunity? Or which of them would even remotely consider committing electoral support to a foreign leader as Modi did, least of all to “my friend Donald Trump”?
Indira Gandhi comes to mind for famously ducking a fraternal bear hug from Fidel Castro when he handed her the gavel at the 1983 Non-Aligned Summit in New Delhi. And yes, she did make personal intervention with a foreign government, albeit when she was not in office. That’s when she pleaded with Gen Zia to spare Z.A. Bhutto’s life. She held Nusrat Bhutto’s hand from her rented home in Delhi throughout the traumatic denouement.
As for Modi’s halcyon days with Saudi Arabia before the rippling events of last week, he has much to thank Manmohan Singh for setting it right. During the Cold War, India had scant interest in the Saudi monarchy. In fact, Giora Becher, the Israeli envoy to India in 1992, shared a handy insight. “At any time the United States sold arms to Saudi Arabia, Indian and Israeli ambassadors made a beeline to the State Department to protest. They might have saved money by sharing a taxi, it was so regular.”

It can’t be blamed on terrorism that Modi’s India struggles to find stable relations with other neighbours too — of varied religious hues.

Singh broke the taboo by inviting the Saudi king as chief guest for the 2006 Republic Day parade. It had the high symbolism of A.B. Vajpayee visiting Lahore’s Minar-i-Pakistan in 1999. Why then the brouhaha when Saudi Arabia signed a defence pact with Pakistan?
Riyadh has always had special and equal ties with Islamabad. When the Saudis asked Pakistan to join the war against the Houthis in 2015, Pakistan’s parliament turned down the proposal. But after what Israel did with Qatar, it was a different story. Nobody in the South Asian neighbourhood is as worried as India is. It needn’t have been this way.
The thought is conditional. Had there been routine good neighbourly ties with Pakistan, the Saudi pact wouldn’t have amounted to anything more than its purpose — to vacate any threat to the Gulf state from Israel. Terrorism is cited as a factor for bad ties with Pakistan, which doesn’t wash. It can’t be blamed on terrorism that Modi’s India struggles to find stable relations with other neighbours too — of varied religious hues.
According to Manmohan Singh, both neighbours were close to clinching a win-win closure on Jammu and Kashmir. It was stalled when Musharraf was removed from power.
Which is to say that peace was possible despite the Mumbai carnage of 2008. The idea was to remove terrorism from its roots, and the reflection was discussed in Sharm El-Sheikh. Moreover, Xi Jinping told Modi precisely that during their meeting at a retreat in Tamil Nadu. For India to be truly prosperous, it would require normal ties with China and Pakistan, Xi said. Instead, Modi poked Xi in the eye with what China calls a cartographic aggression over Ladakh in August 2019.
The Galwan episode put paid to any further hopes. The good news is that the recent SCO summit in its statement condemned the horrific killings in Pahalgam, and slammed terror attacks in Pakistan, namely the Jaffar Express slaughter. Ergo: the world is ready to be guarantors against the scourge. It was this confidence that spurred Singh to be positive, which Modi will find difficult to be. He must play to the Hindutva script targeting Muslims and Christians much of the time, Pakistan all the time. The fallout is that India’s image stands dented enormously by its shocking isolation in Operation Sindoor.
In the Middle East, Hindu nationalism has played both sides of the street, embracing a genocidal Benjamin Netanyahu while hugging the sheikhs simultaneously. After the Qatar incident, this luxury may not exist.
Other questions remain though: Netanyahu had a reason to attack Qatar because it was host to the Hamas leadership; Saudi Arabia is inherently anti-Hamas. It’s, therefore, excessive to fear an imminent Israeli attack. But why should India worry about the defence pact? Discussion in the Indian media suggests the ‘suspended’ Operation Sindoor could be adversely impacted. How will Hindu nationalism negotiate that?
Yes, Donald Trump called to greet Modi on his birthday last week. Then he proceeded to give what some cartoonists vicariously described as birthday bumps. Trump slapped prohibitive costs on visas for Indian IT professionals to work in the US with the option of staying on. An all-round humiliation from the one who believes Modi is the father of the Indian nation.
“Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,” The Beatles song from 1965 tugs the heart ever more.

Published in Dawn, September 23rd, 2025</p><small>2025-09-23 03:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68d210a6d6518.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944070/elite-pact' target='_blank'><strong>Elite pact</strong></a><br><p>THERE is a new defence pact in town — or, shall one say, the region.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have signed a defence agreement with pomp and celebration and the announcement has caused much noise and buzz at home and abroad (in some places). Commentary, analyses, songs and discussions, applause — it is all there.
And while the discussion is far from over and one can find much praise and a little bit of criticism from the cheerleaders and doubting Thomases, there is a consensus that very little information is available at the moment. Serious and insightful comment, it seems, will have to wait.
Indeed, more details will need to be filled in and a fuller picture made available before a comprehensive analysis can be undertaken. No wonder then that at the moment, there are more questions than answers and more conjecture than information — questions about what this pact will mean operationally; what the two countries will commit to each other; whether or not this pact has been signed with a specific state in mind or not; and whether it will be expanded to include more countries or followed by more bilateral accords.
But even in the absence of answers, the euphoria in Pakistan is instructive. There is hope, conjecture and even belief that this pact will bring ‘good’ times for the country. And these hopes do not necessarily emanate from officialdom but are also being discussed privately.
Partly, this is understandable because Saudi Arabia has always come to Pakistan’s rescue in the past — with oil on deferred payments as well as loans that help with our forever crisis, ie, low foreign reserves. Even now, the country is one of the biggest contributors to our reserves, with a loan that will be rolled over (and over) whenever the moment arrives.

Domestically, the Pak-Saudi pact is being viewed exactly the same way as some past moments.

So now that there is a formal agreement in place for a bilateral defence pact, in which each promises to come to the aid of the one that is under attack, the conclusions everyone is jumping to are quick. Obviously, Pakistan will provide the muscle power in this relationship, with its well-known military prowess, and obviously, Riyadh will provide some financial concessions or assistance to Islamabad. The good times, they are a comin’.
But these assumptions reveal the elite consensus, shaped over decades, which continues to be in place. A consensus in which the elite want to use external funds to run the economy, wittingly or unwittingly accepting the primary role of the military in not just ensuring these funds but also being the main player domestically. And the politicians are willing to accept the role of the junior partner, in politics and in terms of the share of the money. Funds they too squirrel away while spending a wee bit on the populace.
Even though the past few years seemed to offer little to no chance of geostrategic rents, the ruling elite was and is reluctant to change its mad, bad ways. The previous PML-N government counted on CPEC; the PTI had hopes of investment from overseas Pakistanis; the 2022 floods led to talk of climate-related aid; then came the talk about investment from the Gulf. The common thread running through all this is the notion that some external flows would help end the crisis without the country having to go through the pain of reform and real adjustment.
It is noteworthy that this ‘hope’ was real even though it was accompanied by a public debate on critical economic challenges and problems, in terms of diagnosis and prescriptions — whether it was to increase the tax base or to reduce government spending at the centre or even amend the NFC. The detail with which these discussions took place was unprecedented. But for those in power, even as they took part in these discussions, the political will was missing. Bad habits formed over years are simply part of the explanation.
Another reason for this is also the challenge of legitimacy. Those in power, be it the PTI government in power or the present set-up, are so insecure they would rather offer immediate relief, however unsustainable, than go through the painful reform process.
It is this hope of immediate relief that led to the ‘chatter’ around the domestic implications of this pact. While much of this conversation was positive, there were also comments about the fear of Pakistan selling itself cheap. This stems no doubt from the view that post-9/11, Pervez Musharraf had been overly eager to join the US-led effort and had not bargained well enough. Whether or not one agrees with this view, there is no doubt that the decision allowed the general to successfully create the mirage of economic prosperity and buffer his regime.
 
 

Hence, it is no wonder that, however much the world and Pakistan’s place in it are changing, domestically, this pact is being viewed exactly the same way as some past moments — an opportunity to stabilise and sustain this set-up, along with the balance of power it has put in place.
However, it would be worth asking if the inflow that is being expected is going to be comparable to what came our way in the past — a question which requires the expertise of those more familiar with economic matters. But even if the sums are generous, what will this mean for the populace at large? For this elite consensus, for the most part, has also meant a complete disregard, if not wilful negligence, of the development of the people. And this neglect of the people will continue to pose the biggest challenge to the ruling elite, even if they are able to sustain the current set-up as well as successfully evade the criticism about the quality of democracy. It would be worth paying attention to this in the middle of celebrations.

After 37 years and $22bn, the Independent Monitoring Board has declared that conventional strategies are running out of road.
Its latest assessment, The Glass Mountain, places Pakistan centre stage. The country has reported 27 new cases this year — small in absolute terms, but large enough to confirm what the IMB calls “resurgence” in one of the last reservoirs of wild poliovirus.
The board’s findings are uncomfortable. It argues that Pakistan’s claims that transmission had been interrupted between 2021 and 2023 were an illusion created by Covid-19 restrictions. Lockdowns, not stronger campaigns, suppressed spread. That temporary reprieve has ended. With new infections surfacing, confidence in the programme’s direction is ebbing.
Eradication in Pakistan has long suffered from predictable failings: financing that rewards effort rather than outcomes, superficial ties to routine immunisation, accountability systems that churn out reports instead of penalties, and an unhealthy reliance on donor-driven firefighting rather than sustained domestic leadership. The result is a system skilled at producing plans and press releases but unable to guarantee that every child is immunised. District managers often recycle excuses, while politicians offer rhetorical commitment without following through on resources or enforcement.
The IMB now proposes shifting responsibility for eradication from Geneva to the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office. That change is intended to blunt the corrosive perception that polio eradication is a Western agenda imposed from outside. It may also force local politicians to accept ownership. For years, community hostility — stoked by conspiracy theories, mistrust of outsiders and repeated security lapses — has translated into refusals, boycotts and, tragically, killings of vaccinators.
Recasting the campaign as a regional priority could help repair that legitimacy gap. But the harder work lies at home. Pakistan’s federal and provincial authorities must treat polio not as an externally funded programme but as a national test of competence.
Chronic under-performance in high-risk districts cannot be indulged indefinitely. Integration with wider health services is overdue: routine immunisation and primary care should be the foundation, not an afterthought. Surveillance, meanwhile, needs sharper focus; environmental samples show far more virus in circulation than case counts suggest, signalling invisible chains of transmission that remain unbroken.
Eradication is not impossible. The coming low-transmission season offers an opening, but only if old habits are abandoned. More money and foreign technical help will not suffice. What is needed is innovation, political will and the readiness to hold failures accountable. A virus that once terrified the globe survives here still. Whether it is eliminated or allowed to endure will depend less on donors’ dollars and more on Pakistan’s resolve to climb its own glass mountain.

• Dar attends, but doesn’t address high-level moot
• PM due to meet Trump alongside Muslim leaders
• Palestine flag unfurled at London mission
NEW YORK: France and Monaco extended formal recognition to the State of Palestine at a high-level conference on Monday.
“We must do everything within our power to preserve the very possibility of a two-state solution, Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security,” French President Emmanuel Macron said before announcing the diplomatic move, drawing lengthy applause from the audience.
Macron outlined a framework for a “renewed Palestinian Authority” under which France would open an embassy subject to factors such as reforms, a ceasefire and the release of all remaining prisoners held in Gaza.
 






Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg and San Marino were also expected to recognise a Palestinian state ahead of this week’s UN General Assembly, after Australia, Britain, Canada, Portugal and Malta did so over the weekend.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who represented Pakistan at the conference, was not among the speakers — which inc­luded heads of state and government from countries such as Turkiye, Australia, Brazil and Canada, among others.
PM Shehbaz Sharif, who reached New York on Monday, did not attend the meeting.
In a statement, the Foreign Office said that Pakistan actively participated in the conference. Taking to X, the foreign minister welcomed ann­ouncements regarding the recognition of Palestine by several countries.
 






Recalling that Pakistan was among the first countries to recognize the State of Palestine following its declaration of independence in 1988, he urged all countries that have not yet done so to take similar steps in line with their commitment to international law.
This call was echoed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who addressed the moot via video link after he was denied a visa by the United States.
“We call on those who have not yet done so to follow suit. We call for your support so that Palestine becomes a full-fledged member of the United Nations,” he said, promising reforms and elections within a year of a ceasefire.
The conference with a focus on the two-state solution comes at a time when the Western powers in a break from their decades-old policy have agreed to recognise the Palestinian state. The UK, responsible for the 1917 Balfour Declaration that led to the creation of the State of Israel, also opened the Palestine embassy in London on Monday.
The high-level moot has followed a similar summit in July this year, where the New York Declaration was first drafted, and later adopted by the UN General Assembly on Sept 12.
Earlier in the day, FM Ishaq Dar took part in the Commonwealth Foreign Affairs Ministers Meeting (CFAMM) at UN Head­quarters.
 






He also participated in consultations hosted by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Other participants included the deputy prime ministers of Jordan and UAE, and the foreign ministers of Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye. He also met with his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand.
Meeting with Trump

PM Shehbaz will represent Pakistan at a multilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump, the White House and Pakistani diplomats said on Monday.
White House Spok­esperson Karoline Leavitt did not specify the meeting’s agenda, but sources indicated that the Israeli war in Gaza would be the dominant topic.
The meeting will include leaders of eight Muslim majority countries, including Pakistan, Turkiye, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE and Jordan.
But Trump is expected to address the UN General Assembly ahead of the multilateral meeting. According to Ms Leavitt, the president will also touch upon how globalist institutions have significantly decayed the world order, and he will articulate his straightforward and constructive vision for the world.
Trump himself opposed the moves by Britain, Canada and Australia to recognize the state of Palestine, which France is due to follow on Monday.
 
 

“The president has been very clear he disagrees with this decision,” Leavitt said, noting that he had publicly done so with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during a UK state visit last week.
“Frankly, he believes it’s a reward to Hamas. So he believes these decisions are just more talk and not enough action from some of our friends and allies, and I think you’ll hear him talk about that tomorrow” at the UN, she added.
Flag-raising
Meanwhile, a day after it extended recognition to the state of Palestine, a flag-raising ceremony was held outside the Pale­stinian mission in London on Monday.
Head of Mission Husam Zomlot hailed the “long overdue” recognition as the flag was raised in front of a crowd outside the building in Hammersmith in west London.
Holding up a plaque reading ‘Embassy of the State of Palestine’, Mr Zomlot said it would be put up soon, “pending some legal work, some bureaucratic work”.
He called the recognition move an “acknowledgement of a historic injustice” at a time of “unimaginable suffering” for the Palestinian people in the war in Gaza.
He said the UK’s recognition had particular resonance as Britain was pivotal in laying the groundwork for the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, through the 1917 Balfour Declaration.
UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the Palestinian Authority could now “set up an embassy and an ambassador in the UK”.
Following Sunday’s announcement, Britain’s foreign ministry updated its travel advice page to remove the reference to “Occupied Palestinian territories”, replacing it with “Palestine”.

Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation Chief Mohammad Eslami, who’s also vice president, told Iranian state media that bilateral agreements would be signed during the visit, including a plan to construct eight nuclear power plants as Tehran seeks to reach 20GW of nuclear energy capacity by 2040.
 
 

Contract negotiations have taken place and with the signing of the agreement this week, we will enter the operational steps, Mr Eslami said.
The announcement comes at a tense moment with the West as they accuse Tehran of failing to abide by a 2015 deal with world powers that aimed to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.
Iran denies having any such intention and Russia says it supports Tehran’s right to peaceful nuclear energy.
On Friday, the 15-member UN Security Council rejected a draft resolution to permanently lift sanctions on Tehran. Britain, France and Germany have offered to delay reinstating sanctions for up to six months if Iran restores access for UN nuclear inspectors, addresses concerns about its stock of enriched uranium, and engages in talks with the US.
The council also voted to reimpose UN sanctions that had been frozen, after three European governments activated the “snapback” mechanism in a decade-old nuclear agreement accusing Iran of non-compliance.

• Says state can readily meet targets by aligning its spending with constitutional and legal provisions
ISLAMABAD: Arguing against the Super Tax, senior counsel Ahmed Jamal Sukhera told the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench (CB) on Monday that the Constitution does not permit arbitrary action, including legislation.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the CB was hearing several challenges filed by different taxpayers questioning the constitutional vires of the amended Section 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO), 2001 implemented for the tax year 2023.
Representing Fauji Fertilisers, Mr Sukhera contended that the levy was imposed by the federal government to raise Rs215 billion, merely because it was seeking fiscal space.
In the previous year, the government had imposed taxes of Rs350 billion through sales tax, which was even collected on matchsticks. According to a policy statement, he claimed that this measure had pushed some people below the poverty line.
Therefore, this year, the government had considered taxing high-earning individuals on the grounds that they had made windfall profits, and decided that the solution for fiscal space was to impose a super tax on them, the counsel said.
The counsel stated that only two factors were considered when imposing the super tax: firstly, that the sales tax imposed last year to raise Rs215bn had an inflationary impact; and second, that high-earning persons had made windfall profits and could be taxed to raise the additional Rs215bn.
No other factor was considered, according to the policy statement submitted by the government in its pleadings, the counsel argued, adding that as per reports of the cabinet and the World Bank, fiscal space of up to Rs1.7tr annually could be created simply by aligning federal government spending with constitutional and legal provisions.
The counsel cited seven examples. He said state-owned enterprises incur losses between Rs600 to Rs800bn annually, so the required Rs215bn could instead be raised by curtailing those losses.
 
 

Secondly, the federal government continues to spend on subjects devolved to the provinces under the 18th Amendment, which is not aligned with the Constitution. As per the World Bank report, Rs328bn could be saved this way. Moreover, adopting a treasury single account could save another Rs404bn, according to the same report.
The fourth example he gave was that, according to the federal government figures, electricity thefts and related losses amount to Rs600bn annually. Reducing this loss by just Rs215bn could spare high earning taxpayers from the super tax.
 
 

Fifthly, under the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act, 2005 (FDRLA), the federal fiscal deficit should not go beyond 3.5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the debt-to-GDP ratio should not exceed 60pc. Both these limits have been consistently breached since 2016.
In case of non-compliance, the FRDLA requires the federal government to take corrective measures, including curtailing expenditures from the Federal Consolidated Fund, to return to the debt reduction path within two financial years.
This means that if the debt-to-GDP ratio is not maintained within the prescribed limit, the government must curtail its expenses. However, instead of doing so, the government continues to borrow, and the resulting interest payments — incurred in violation of statutory requirements — are shifted onto existing taxpayers by either increasing tax rates or imposing new taxes.
Mr Sukhera argued that the government is constitutionally and legally bound to spend public money as a fiduciary and trustee of the people of Pakistan, in their best interest. Public money, he stressed, must not be wasted year after year without accountability. He further argued that it was high time the government was compelled to curtail its expenses so that existing taxpayers are not burdened with additional taxes through no fault of their own.

HYDERABAD: The water level in the Indus rises as a medium flood reaches Kotri.—PPI

• Locals in three southern districts complain their houses still under water due to govt failure to plug breaches
• Irrigation minister says 70 and 90pc area of Alipur and Jalalpur Pirwala, respectively, devastated
LAHORE: The residents in different localities of Multan, Lodhran, and Bahawalpur districts remain homeless as the government has failed to plug the breaches at the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the Sutlej River despite the passage of 12 days.
Communities in Noraja Bhutta, Bahadurpur, Basti Lang, Kanu, and Dipal in Jalalpur Pirwala; Tarut Basharat, Daily Rajanpur, and Belaywala in Lodhran; Dunyapur, Jhangra, and Muradpur Soiwala in Bahawalpur were forced to live on the banks of the embankment, as their homes remained inundated.
 
 

Basti Lang resident Muhammad Bakhsh said the water was rising again in his union council, adding it would continue to rise if the Noraja Bhutta embankment was not plugged completely. “We are also hearing about another medium level flood in the Sutlej approaching Jalalpur Pirwala in a day or two, which would further increase the water level around our homes,” he said.
“We are also hearing that the government is plugging the Noraja Bhutta embankment but the water has yet to recede from these areas…,” he rued. Ijaz Khan, from the Tarut Bashart union council, said that the water level was increasing due to the breaches. He said that the government was placing heavy stones around the M-5 Motorway bridge to save it, but the water was not receding.
 
 

Multan Irrigation Department Chief Engineer Nawaz Bajwa told Dawn that three breaches in the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the Sutlej River were plugged to save Jalalpur Pirwala city. He said that they also saved the primary gas pipeline to Punjab.
Punjab Minister for Irrigation Kazim Pirzada revealed that 70 and 90 per cent of the population in Alipur and Jalalpur Pirwala, respectively, was affected by the recent floods. He said that Jalalpur required evacuation and Alipur needed a massive relief operation, with teams working round the clock to deliver essential supplies to Sultanpur, Shahbazpur, Seetpur, and other affected towns.
Normal flow
Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that the water flow across major rivers in Punjab had returned to normal levels. He said a low- to medium-level flood situation continued in the Sutlej River.
According to PDMA data, the Sutlej River is flowing at 95,000 cusecs at Ganda Singh Wala and 81,000 cusecs at the Suleimanki point. The Chenab River shows a flow of 55,000 cusecs at Marala, which reduces to 24,000 cusecs at Khanki Headworks and 29,000 cusecs at Qadirabad.
The flow at Head Trimmu was recorded at 35,000 cusecs. The Panjnad Headworks reported a flow of 118,000 cusecs. Meanwhile, the Ravi River presented lower readings, with 6,000 cusecs at Jassar, 9,000 cusecs at Shahdara, and 30,000 cusecs at Head Sidhnai. The flow at Balloki Headworks was measured at 28,000 cusecs.

She made these remarks while talking to media persons outside Adiala Jail after the hearing of the Toshakhana-2 case.
“Imran has directed party leaders and workers not to contact the establishment, and if the establishment wants to talk, it should directly talk to him,” she said.
Commenting on the Toshakhana-2 case, Ms Khan said that last week, the main witness had been discredited, yet the judge did not close the matter.
“Moreover, Brig Ahmed and Col Rehan [Imran Khan’s former military secretaries] also confirmed that the documentation on gifts was complete. So logically, the case is concluded, but the judge is still recording statements of investigation officers. We strongly believe it will be closed in the next two to three hearings,” she said.
On the Al-Qadir case, Ms Khan noted that Justice Dogar had not taken it up for the past ten months. “However, finally, the case will be heard on the 25th of this month, and we hope that bail will be granted,” she added.
Saudi pact, cricket team
Regarding the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia agreement, Aleema said her brother was already aware of the deal and appreciated it, saying it was the duty of Pakistanis to protect the Haramain Sharifain.
She said Mr Khan had also expressed disappointment over press reports regarding the cricket team’s performance. She quoted him as saying that in October 2021, Pakistan defeated India by 10 wickets with the same team.
Drawing an analogy, Ms Khan said her brother compared Mohsin Naqvi’s management of the Pakistan Cricket Board with the way the country was being governed, saying that both faced the same challenges.
She said her brother had urged the nation to participate in the upcoming Sept 27 public meeting in Peshawar to make it a success. Ms Khan added that Imran had directed Junaid Akbar and Ali Amin Gandapur to make joint efforts to ensure the rally’s success.

• Civilians’ trials in military courts ‘long understood as valid and operative’, says Justice Mazhar
ISLAMABAD: Justice Aminuddin Khan has said that though the procedural framework under the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 includes due process protections, the absence of an independent right of appeal to a civilian court has rendered its application to civilians constitutionally incomplete.
He made these remarks in a 68-page judgement to justify the May 7 short order on a set of 38 intra-court appeals, which challenged the Oct 23, 2023, order on military trials of the civilians. Justice Khan explained that this deficiency required legislative intervention, urging parliament to do the needful in 45 days.
According to Justice Khan, the Constitutional Bench had referred the matter to parliament for the enactment of appropriate amendments, with the expectation that such institutional deference would be accorded due respect. He, however, again sought necessary amendments or suitable legislation within a period of 45 days to provide right of appeal in the high courts against convictions rendered by court martial or military courts under sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of clause (d) of subsection (1) of section 2, read with subsection (4) of Section 59.
Justice Khan observed that a fair trial demanded that the forum should be fair, impartial, and governed by transparent rules. The PAA, as currently framed and applied in the present context, meets this constitutional requirement, Justice Khan said, adding it was held that the conduct of trials under PAA, where exercised within the statutory limits and supported by procedural safeguards, did not violate fair trial standards.
On May 7, a seven-judge Constitutional Bench restored by a majority of 5-2 key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act under which civilians were convicted for their involvement in the May 9, 2023, arson attacks on military installations. The short order had also set aside the Oct 23 judgement, restoring Section 2(1)(d)(i) and (ii) and Section 59 (4) of the PAA. These provisions were struck down by a majority of four to one by a five-judge bench in October 2023.
‘Reading down’ approach
The interpretive technique of reading down, as employed in the Oct 23 judgement, was inapposite, Justice Khan said, adding that the doctrine of reading down was a tool of judicial restraint designed to preserve the constitutionality of statutes by construing them narrowly in case of ambiguity. It cannot be deployed to insert qualifications or restrictions into clear constitutional provisions, he observed.
The Oct 23 order purported to use reading down to override the unambiguous text of Article 8(3)(a), effectively substituting judicial preference for constitutional command, Justice Khan emphasised, adding this approach crossed the threshold of legitimate interpretation and entered the domain of constitutional amendment. The judicial function is to interpret, not to legislate, he stressed.
Article 8(3)(a) is a self-contained constitutional provision. It categorically exempts laws enacted for the Armed Forces, for purposes of discipline and discharge of duties, from the operation of fundamental rights, Justice Khan said, calling it a deliberate legislative choice by the framers.
The introduction of Article 8(5) as a qualifying provision in this context is doctrinally and textually unsound. Article 8(5) deals with the suspension of rights under emergency powers and does not, and cannot, override the permanent structural exclusion under Article 8(3)(a), he added.
Article 8(3)(a) exempts laws relating to the armed forces from the purview of fundamental rights, explicitly recognising a parallel regime for military discipline.
Article 245 further empowers the armed forces to act in defence of Pakistan and in aid of civil authority, indicating that the Constitution contemplates a domain of operations and discipline governed by military command and distinct legal processes, Justice Khan said
Justice Khan said the adjudicatory authority exercised by military courts over civilians does not infringe the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Article 175(3) is not offended by the existence or operation of military courts within their legal remit.
Additional note
Meanwhile, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, though concurring, said in his additional note that the trial of civilians only for specific offences as provided under Section 2 (d) (i) and (ii) was not a new phenomenon.
It is a ground reality that the provisions of PAA extending jurisdiction to certain civilians have stood connected appeals for several decades, receiving the tacit approval of successive legislatures and the silent acquiescence of the Supreme Court.
The fact that these provisions remained unchallenged or were not declared ultra vires at an earlier stage suggests that they were long understood as valid and operative within the constitutional scheme, Justice Mazhar explained.
It was only in the aftermath of the events of May 9, 2023, when prosecutions of civilians under PAA acquired public and political prominence that this question was brought into sharp focus. Against this backdrop, it is necessary to ask whether it is the law itself that is infirm, or whether the sudden urgency of the present moment has led to a judicial reappraisal that stands at odds with decades of settled acceptance, he argued.

The left-arm spinner ended up with career-best figures of 6-26 as the Proteas were skittled out for 115 within 26 overs at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore — before the Women in Green chased it down with 19 overs to spare.
South Africa rested five key players, including the player-of-the-match from their last encounter — Tazmin Brits — who had scored a mammoth unbeaten 171 in the match on Friday.
Nashra’s journey
Nashra had spoken to Dawn.com ahead of the Green Shirts series against Ireland, where she shared her cricketing journey.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

She discussed her struggles as a woman cricketer, the facilities available to girls in cricket today, and the potential for a women’s Pakistan Super League.
Nashra also talked about how she ended up as a left-arm spinner in a country obsessed with fast bowlers.

“I was a fast bowler, but my university coach suggested that you’re a left-armer and aren’t that tall — so you should try spin, and I already used to bowl a bit of spin at home,” Nashra said.

The final ODI before the World Cup
The Green Shirts were bowling first after losing the toss in their third and final ODI of the series, which was won by South Africa 2-1.
Proteas skipper Laura Wolvaardt called the coin toss correctly at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore and chose to bat first.
Eyman Fatima made her debut for the Green Shirts, and spin all-rounder Syeda Aroob Shah returned to the side.
 






Nashra started her six-wicket haul by dismissing Proteas’ Sune Luus, and the South African batters never recovered as the blows continued.
She was adjudicated player-of-the-match for her tremendous performance with the ball on a track which was a typical Lahore wicket.
Nashra became the third — following Nida Dar and Sana Mir — and the fastest among Pakistan bowlers to the 100 ODI wickets milestone — reaching there in just 74 innings.)
 






Skipper Fatima Sana survived an injury scare when she was hit on her shin by a drive by Wolvaardt in her second over. She was taken out of the ground on a stretcher, but returned later in the innings.
South Africa began briskly, reaching 38 without loss in 6.3 overs through skipper Wolvaardt’s 28 off 23 balls, which comprised of six fours.
South Africa’s promising start was disrupted when Laura hit one straight to Muneeba off Diana Baig.

Nashra then ran through the South African batting line-up to take 5-8 in her next six overs as South Africa slumped from 61-3 to 94-8.
All-rounder Syeda Aroob Shah — returning after two years — picked up the last two wickets to wrap up South Africa’s innings as they registered their second-lowest ODI score in the last five years.
Sidra Amin top-scored for the Women in Green again with an unbeaten 50 that anchored the innings after some early jitters — ending her series with two centuries and a 50.
 






In the second ODI on Friday, the Women in Green were all set to chase South Africa’s daunting 313-run total, but fell 25 runs short.
A spectacular knock by Sidra Amin, who became the first Pakistani batter to score consecutive centuries, brought them close, but in the end, the Duckworth-Lewis method adjusted the 313-run target was a step too far.
 
 

Setting a mammoth score to chase after the Proteas batters ruled the roost in the first innings, Sidra stepped up again under the Gaddafi Stadium lights to score a sublime hundred — but failed to close the chase.
The Proteas had sailed to an easy victory over Pakistan after chasing down a target of 256 to win by eight wickets in the first ODI of their series in Lahore on Tuesday.
The ODIs were all staged at the Gaddafi Stadium, with the first ball of all matches bowled at 3:30pm.
Pakistan’s 15-member squad was captained by Fatima, while Laura Wolvaardt lead the visiting side. In the build-up to the series, Pakistan held a two-week pre-series camp in Lahore, which included practice sessions and scenario-based matches.
The squad featured one uncapped player, Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland in Dublin in August.
 
 

The series provides both sides with an opportunity to finalise preparations for the eight-team World Cup, set to take place from September 30 to November 2 in India and Sri Lanka. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka.
Head-to-head, in 28 ODI matches, South Africa had an upper hand against Pakistan, but the last time both sides met, Pakistan defeated South Africa by eight wickets in the ICC Women’s Championship 2022-25 series fixture at the National Stadium in Karachi on Sept 14, 2023.

Goals in each half by Pakistan’s Mohammad Abdullah, from the penalty spot, and Hamza Yasir had levelled the Group ‘B’ clash at 2-2 by the 70th minute but India’s substitute Rahan Ahmed found the winner in the 73rd to take his side through to a semi-final against Group ‘A’ runners-up Nepal.
Pakistan, meanwhile, take on Group ‘A’ winners Bangladesh with both last-four clashes to be held on Thursday.
 
 

Both teams had already secured semi-final berths and heading into the final group game, Pakistan held the advantage by the barest of margins — on goals scored — and a draw would’ve sufficed for Nasir Ismail’s side to avoid Bangladesh, who have ousted them in the semi-final stage of each of the last two editions.
Bangladesh also beat Pakistan in the final of the 2018 edition but the current crop would be confident of their chances, especially after a valiant display against four-time defending champions India.
After even exchanges in the opening half hour, India took the lead in the 31st minute when Danny Singh Wangkhem’s cutback was hammered in by Dallalmoun Gangte.
Pakistan immediately sought an equaliser, and it arrived two minutes before half-time when Hamza’s darting run drew a foul in the box and Abdullah sent Indian custodian Manashjyoti Baruah the wrong way from the resulting spot-kick.
An end-to-end game then swung into India’s favour in the 63rd when Gunleiba Wangkheirakpam ran onto a throughball and slotted it past the advancing Saamar Razzak.
 
 

Hamza ensured parity seven minutes later when he turned in a rebound after Baruah spilt a long-range effort from Mohammad Awais.
It didn’t last long, though, as Rahan reacted first to a save by Razzak and netted the winner.</p><small>2025-09-22 19:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/222326385cf9ee4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943932/irans-araqchi-says-tehran-will-not-respond-to-language-of-pressure-over-its-nuclear-work' target='_blank'><strong>Iran’s Araqchi says Tehran will not respond to language of pressure over its nuclear work</strong></a><br><p>Iran insists diplomacy is the only way to resolve a decades-long nuclear dispute with the West, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Iranian state TV on Monday, adding it was time for the West to choose “cooperation or confrontation” amid looming sanctions.
Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3, launched a 30-day process on August 28 to reimpose United Nations sanctions, accusing Tehran of failing to abide by a 2015 deal with world powers aimed at preventing it from developing a nuclear weapon.
Araqchi said he will meet with his European counterparts and the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, in New York this week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly to discuss Iran’s nuclear programme.
Two European diplomats told Reuters the meeting will be on Tuesday.
“They have tested Iran repeatedly and know we do not respond to the language of pressure and threat,” Araqchi said. “I hope we can find a diplomatic solution in the coming days, otherwise, Tehran will take appropriate measures.”
The European powers have offered to delay reinstating sanctions for up to six months — to give diplomacy a chance — if Iran restores access for UN nuclear inspectors to its nuclear sites, addresses concerns about its stock of enriched uranium and resumes talks with the United States.
But amid the looming threat of sanctions, two European diplomats said Iran’s clerical rulers have so far failed to meet the conditions set by the E3.
“The ball is in Iran’s camp. It is up to it to quickly take the concrete steps in the coming days to avert snapback. If not, then sanctions will be reimposed,” said one of the diplomats.
If Tehran and the E3 fail to reach a deal on an extension by the end of September 27, then all UN sanctions will be reimposed on Iran, where the economy already struggles with crippling sanctions reimposed since 2018 after President Donald Trump ditched the pact during his first term.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that Iran would overcome any reimposition of UN sanctions, but one insider said mounting discontent among many Iranians at the state of the economy was rattling the Islamic Republic, with little sign that its leaders have the answers.
Soon after the US and Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear sites in June, Iran’s parliament passed a law suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and stipulating that any inspections must be approved by Iran’s Supreme National Security Council.
On September 9, the IAEA and Tehran reached a deal to resume inspections at nuclear sites.
“I am in New York to use these remaining days for diplomatic consultations that might lead to a solution … if it is not found, we will continue our path,” Araqchi said.
IAEA says Iran nuclear diplomacy at a ‘difficult juncture’
Meanwhile, Grossi told AFP that diplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute over Iran’s nuclear programme were at a “difficult juncture” but dialogue would continue.
The UN Security Council voted on Friday to reimpose UN sanctions that had been frozen, after three European governments activated the “snapback” mechanism in a decade-old nuclear agreement, accusing Iran of non-compliance.
“It’s obviously quite a difficult juncture. It’s a very difficult situation we are facing right now,” the IAEA chief said, adding that talks between the involved parties were planned in New York for today.
“What’s important is the communications are continuing. We are planning to see each other if possible today, Monday, here in New York, and perhaps more meetings during the week.”
Friday’s vote means that the sanctions, which were suspended in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities set out in the 2015 deal, will take effect again on September 28 unless Iran can persuade the council to relent in the next week.
Tehran said the action by the European powers — Britain, France and Germany — undermined months of engagement with the IAEA aimed at resuming monitoring and ensuring compliance with international rules.
Grossi praised the active diplomacy of French President Emmanuel Macron to salvage a deal, and said that there were still lines of communication between Tehran and Washington.
“Emmanuel Macron is very present, has been historically, and I respect him enormously,” Grossi said.
“I think the special envoy, Ambassador [Steve] Witkoff, has also been involved and actively exploring different channels and presenting a number of ideas,” Grossi said.
Grossi said his dialogue with Witkoff had enabled him to understand Washington’s position and red lines.
“And the IAEA is not a party to the agreement — but it’s indispensable in every scenario. So we continue the work with Ambassador Witkoff,” Grossi said.
Western governments have long accused Iran of seeking a nuclear weapons capability, an ambition Tehran denies.
Tehran has also criticised the IAEA for failing to condemn the Israeli and US strikes.
Paris, London, and Berlin have stressed their demands that the Islamic Republic grant IAEA inspectors full access to nuclear sites, including those damaged by Israeli and American attacks last June.
They also call for a resumption of negotiations, particularly with the US side.
Tehran says it is resisting political pressure and accuses the Europeans of not taking up a “balanced” proposal, the details of which have not been disclosed.
“We are not at a point where people are not talking to each other, and you have to convince them to come together,” Grossi said.
“So does that mean that I am optimistic? Well, neither optimistic nor pessimistic,” he said, adding that he remained hopeful that “we can still have an agreement”.
“If we don’t have it, I think we have to try to (right) the boat as soon as possible to avoid prolonged confrontation and perhaps more attacks.” Grossi also said he would seek to succeed Antonio Guterres as secretary general of the UN when his term ends in December 2026.</p><small>2025-09-22 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625027-controversial-tweet-case-arrest-warrants-issued-for-imaan-mazari-husband' target='_blank'><strong>Controversial tweet case: Arrest warrants issued for Imaan Mazari, husband</strong></a><br><p>

Despite nearly three-quarters of the world’s nations accepting it as one of them, Palestine’s status remains contested. Whilst it has the status of a permanent observer state at the UN, which allows for participation but does not grant voting rights, its actual status seems to be in between — it is neither a state nor entirely not a state. Its status is all the more perplexing given that the issue of how an entity becomes a state in international law is itself highly uncertain.
Becoming a State
States are formally equal sovereigns in international law and all have the same legal personality. In the international system, they are juridically equal, with inequalities of power between them not affecting this inherent equality. The concept of independence and equality of a sovereign state is one of the axiomatic principles of international law. States remain the most fundamental actors in the global legal order as they are able to actually make international law.
The question of what is or is not a state was addressed in Article 1 of the Montevideo Convention (1933) which offers the factual criteria necessary for statehood: permanent population, defined territory, effective government and the capacity to enter into legal relations.
However, these criteria are themselves debated, and often entities become states without fulfilling all of them. For instance, the International Court of Justice has accepted that a precise delimitation of a state’s borders is not necessary. Arguably, the presence of disputed territory does not prohibit an entity from becoming a state. Moreover, even when a state did not emerge onto the international plane with an effective government (such as in the case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo), this was overlooked in determining it to be a state.
These criteria have also not been treated as exhaustive. In the Island of Palmas case, it was held that a state had to be independent from another’s control. Furthermore, in the Åland Islands case (1920), it was held that Finland was not a state until a stable political organisation was created and its public authorities could assert themselves throughout the territory without the assistance of foreign troops.
Some commentators have also posited that states should be democratic to be granted statehood, however, in the Western Sahara Advisory Opinion, the International Court of Justice held that there was no rule of international law requiring that the structure of a state follow any particular pattern.
This is particularly since doing so would discount many states. It has also been argued that the prohibition of racial discrimination is a further criterion for statehood. However, there is no customary international law rule denying statehood to an entity for violating this. For instance, South Africa did not cease to become a state because it was practicing apartheid. These additional factors may however, play a role in other states’ decision to recognise an entity as a state.
Recognition of States
Recognition is the formal acknowledgment of the status of an independent State by other existing states. The role that recognition plays in defining statehood remains controversial and there are two approaches which determine its significance; the declaratory and the constitutive.
Under the declaratory approach to recognition, a state exists as a subject of international law at the moment at which it possesses the marks of a state as defined under the Montevideo Convention.
According to the constitutive approach, the legal existence of a state is dependent upon its recognition by others. Professor Oppenheim asserted that a state becomes an international person through recognition only and exclusively.
However, the problem with this theory is the absence of either the duty to recognise or the existence of an agency which is competent enough to adjudicate on this. It means the question of status is entirely dependent upon the individual position of the recognising state.
And so a state exists in regard to some states which have recognised it and not in relation to others. In that, what if States X and Y recognise A as a state but State Z does not? Is A a state for the former but not for Z? It is difficult to make sense of this approach, as statehood cannot be relative.
Moreover, much denial of recognition can be politically motivated, but even states that do not recognise another sometimes do ascribe responsibility under international law as they would to a state. For instance, the states that do not recognise Israel still believe it to be bound by the Geneva Conventions as if it were a state.
The Role of Non-Recognition
While recognition may not make a state, non-recognition may prevent one from coming into being. The Security Council and the International Court of Justice have enforced an obligation of non-recognition on states, especially when fundamental principles of international law or peremptory norms are violated.
For instance, Turkey recognised the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as a state after it used force to impose that entity in the territory. The Security Council placed an obligation of non-recognition of this entity as a state on the international community. The TRNC is still only recognised by Turkey and no other state.
The Security Council also imposed an obligation of non-recognition on Rhodesia as, if its claim to statehood was accepted, the right of self-determination of the majority of Rhodesians would be violated, given the racist minority regime on which the purported state was found.
Similarly, in the Wall Advisory Opinion (2004) and the Advisory Opinion on Israel’s policies and practices in Occupied Palestinian Territory (2024), the ICJ imposed obligations on states not to recognise the unlawful situation created as a result of Israel’s illegal actions.
Non-recognition is, practically, the only means by which statehood has been withheld. It operates as a sanction in denying state status to entities which became states through violations of international law.
The obligation of non-recognition could also be applied to the case of Russia invading Ukraine shortly after signing a treaty recognising the statehood of the Donetsk and Luhansk republics. Russia then claimed that its military operation was in the collective self-defence of these newly recognised states.
The recognition of statehood here was shrewdly done in order to enable the commission of an internationally wrongful act and therefore should not be recognised by other states. Only two other states, Syria and North Korea, which are allies of Russia, recognise these entities as states.
A Palestinian State
In 2007, Professor James Crawford in his seminal work, The Creation of States in International Law, stated that “the State of Palestine has not yet become a fact as distinct from an aspiration”. It is unclear whether that is any different today in 2025 than it was in 2007.
On September 12, 2025, 142 states voted in favour of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and it is likely more states are looking to recognise Palestine by the end of this month. If independence from another state’s control is indeed a criteria for statehood, then all of Palestine is currently occupied by Israel, and therefore its statehood is compromised as a result until it can relinquish itself of that control.
However, recognition itself in this case may be a way for Palestine to oust Israeli control. It is an indication of the extent to which the international community believes that Palestine’s claim to statehood is valid, and Israel’s denial of it is not.
Ironically, if the law relating to non-recognition was followed in 1948, there would be a duty on the international community not to recognise the Israeli state, as it came into being by violating fundamental principles of international law, including the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people through the Nakba.
However, as Alonso Gurmendi, Lecturer in International Relations at King’s College London states, ‘as international lawyers, we can argue endlessly about the validity of collective (even UN) recognition or whether Palestine really possesses the elements of the Montevideo Convention, but at the end of the day, the international law of state creation is as indeterminate as any law – its rules are always sustained by their exceptions. The real hurdle is that our world order is organised on the basis of racial hierarchies and that communities like Palestine have historically been unequally integrated into a burdened membership.’

Earlier, a senior police officer in the area told AFP on condition of anonymity that “jets targeted four houses, which were completely destroyed”. He, however, did not say who carried out the attack. The incident generated criticism from multiple quarters.
A statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Secretariat said CM Ali Amin Gandapur met a delegation from the district following the incident with PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi, the KP chief secretary, additional chief secretary (home), Peshawar commissioner and other officials also present in the meeting that reviewed the law and order situation in the “context of the unfortunate incident” that occurred in Tirah.
“Martyrdom of civilians in the incident is regrettable and condemnable. Martyrdom of civilians as a result of operations against terrorists is unacceptable,” the statement quoted CM Gandapur as saying.
It added that regret was expressed over the unfortunate incident in the meeting, and prayers were offered for the deceased as well.
The statement said the chief minister announced compensation of Rs10 million each for the families of the victims. The session also held a detailed consideration of an action plan to prevent such incidents in the future.
“In this regard, it was decided to hold a meeting of the jirga consisting of elected public representatives of the area, leaders of all political parties, and local elders with top military officials.
“The future course of action for peace and order in the area will be decided in the meeting of the jirga with military officials,” the statement said, adding that an agreement was reached to adopt a strategy in Tirah to establish peace and order on the model of Bajaur.
During the meeting, special emphasis was laid on the need to gain the trust of locals and residents for peace in the area, the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said it was “deeply shocked” to hear about reports of the killing of several civilians caused by alleged “aerial bombing” in Tirah, and demanded a probe into the matter.
It demanded that “the authorities carry out an immediate and impartial inquiry into the incident and hold to account those responsible”.
“The state is constitutionally bound to protect all civilians’ right to life, which it has repeatedly failed to secure,” the HRCP statement read.
 






KP Assembly Speaker Babar Swati called on the federal and provincial governments to conduct a “transparent and immediate investigation into the incident, identify those responsible, and not only provide immediate relief and compensation to the affected families but also take comprehensive measures for their rehabilitation”.
A statement uploaded on his X account said he expressed his sorrow over the “martyrdom of innocent civilians and the destruction of homes due to the bombardment by jet aircraft”.
 






Special Assistant to the Chief Minister for Communication and Works Sohail Afridi also raised his voice on the matter during today’s KP Assembly session. He said the “horrifying tragedy” occurred at 2am in Tirah.
He alleged that 25 people, including women and children, were killed when “mortar and bombs were dropped” on the locals. He blamed the security forces for the incident. It, however, could not be independently established as to who was responsible.
MNA Iqbal earlier expressed sorrow over the incident in a video message in Pashto, which he shared with the media. He said elderly women and children were killed in “shelling by jets” in Tirah and urged the people to reach the site of the incident to protest the killings.
The MNA said it was not the first time that such an incident had taken place. “The killing of civilians has become a routine.”
In a similar incident in May, 22 people, including seven children, were injured in an alleged quadcopter strike in the Wana tehsil of KP’s South Waziristan district.
That same month, four children were killed and five others were injured in a suspected quadcopter munitions drop in Mir Ali tehsil of the North Waziristan district in KP.
Later, the military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

The proposal moves TikTok’s US operations into a new joint venture based in the United States, a senior White House official told reporters, adding that the entity would involve a “majority-American board of directors.”
Oracle, in turn, is expected to serve as a security provider.
 
 

The agreement provides that a copy of TikTok’s content recommendation algorithm be brought into the US joint venture system, the official said.
“It’s going to be fully inspected and retrained by the security provider on US user data, and then it’s going to be operated by that US entity,” the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Washington has forcefully sought to take TikTok’s US operations from the hands of the Chinese parent company ByteDance over national security reasons.
Under President Donald Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, Congress passed a law to force ByteDance to sell its US operations or face a ban of the hugely popular platform.
US policymakers, including Trump in his first presidency, have warned that China could use TikTok to mine data from Americans or exert influence on what they see on social media.
On Monday, a US official said the algorithm would be “continuously monitored” to ensure it is “not being unduly influenced.”
The latest updates came after Trump hailed progress Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping on issues including TikTok after both leaders spoke by telephone for the second time since Trump’s return to the presidency.
Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week, declaring that the terms of the TikTok deal meet US national security needs, the US official said Monday.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News over the weekend that “there will be seven seats on the board that controls the app in the United States, and six of those seats will be Americans.”
Trump separately added that media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his eldest son, Lachlan, could be among the investors who will take control of TikTok in the United States.
Trump’s TikTok deal will satisfy 2024 law requirements, official says
Meanwhile, Trump will sign an executive order later this week that declares that a deal to divest TikTok’s US operations from its Chinese owner ByteDance will meet requirements set out in a 2024 law, a White House official said.
The US is confident that China has approved the deal and does not plan further talks with Beijing about its details, the official told reporters on a conference call, but added that additional paperwork is required from both sides to approve the deal.
The official added that the valuation of TikTok’s US assets will be “many billions of dollars.” The US government will not take a board seat or get a golden share in the new entity that will own TikTok US, but it is unclear if the US government will get payments as a condition of approval.
ByteDance will own less than 20 per cent while TikTok US will be controlled by a mix of its existing US and global firms as well as a significant number of new investors who have no affiliation with ByteDance, the official said.
The full slate of investors is not yet finalized, but will include major firms like Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake.
Trump said on Sunday that media mogul Lachlan Murdoch and business leaders Larry Ellison and Michael Dell would be involved as US investors in a proposed deal to keep TikTok operating in the United States.
Trump is trying to keep the short video app with 170 million US users from being banned after Congress passed a law that ordered it shut down by January 2025 if its US assets were not sold by the owner ByteDance.
Trump has delayed enforcement of the law through mid-December amid efforts to extract TikTok’s US assets from the global platform, line up American investors and ensure that the new ownership qualifies as a full divestiture needed under the 2024 law.
Trump’s executive order will include a new 120-day enforcement pause to allow the investors and ByteDance to close the agreement, the official added.
Last week’s progress toward a deal on TikTok marked a rare breakthrough in months-long talks between the world’s two biggest economies that have sought to defuse a wide-ranging trade war that has unnerved global markets.</p><small>2025-09-22 17:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625014-army-act-needs-legislative-intervention-over-civilians-appeal-rights-rules-sc' target='_blank'><strong>Army Act needs legislative intervention over civilians' appeal rights, rules SC</strong></a><br><p>

“This amounts to undermining and closing the doors of justice. Will file an appeal,” Khokhar said on X.
 






The 26th Constitutional Amendment takes away the SC’s suo motu powers, sets the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowers a special par­liamentary committee to nominate the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges.
Invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the apex court for the enforcement of fundamental rights under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, Khokhar had pled the apex court on September 4 for the immediate fixation of the pending challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full court, in compliance with the Oct 31, 2024, decision of the judges’ committee under the 2023 Practice and Procedure Act — which called for fixing challenges to the 26th Amendment before a full court.
However, the registrar returned the petition in a September 19 notice to Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, the advocate-on-record for the petitioner, saying that Khokhar had “not pointed out as to what questions of public importance in the instant case are involved with reference to enforcement of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, so as to directly invoke jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution”.
The notice further said Khokhar was invoking the SC’s extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 184(3) for the “redressal of an individual grievance, which is not permissible” in terms of a prior judgment reported as 1998 SCMR 793, “Zulfiqar Mehdi. Vs. PIA, etc”.
“Ingredients for invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of this court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution have not been satisfied.
“Notice issued to the respondents is not properly drawn as it is not mentioned therein that for what purpose this constitution petition is being filed before this court,” the notice said, adding that multiple prayers were made in one constitutional petition.
Last month, CJP Yahya Afridi had ignored the decision made last year by a committee, constituted under the Practice and Procedure Act 2023, to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment of the Constitution before the full SC.
Since October 2024, multiple petitions have been filed with the SC challenging the amendment, contending that it “abrogates, repeals, alters and destroys the basic features of the Constitution” and “violates” fundamental rights.</p><small>2025-09-22 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/22194533f3e7d61.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943921/sahibzada-says-pakistan-confident-they-will-face-india-again-in-asia-cup-final' target='_blank'><strong>Sahibzada says Pakistan confident they will face India again in Asia Cup final</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan batter Sahibzada Farhan has said his team is confident that it would face “India again in the final” of the men’s Asia Cup next Sunday.
India romped home on Sunday with a six-wicket win, chasing down the 172-run target with ease in their second high-intensity encounter against Pakistan in the tournament.
Pakistan rode on a brilliant 45-ball 58 from opener Sahibzada Farhan but managed 171-5 after romping to 93-1 in 9.3 overs.
 


Speaking at the pre-match press conference on Monday, before Pakistan clash with Sri Lanka tomorrow, the opener said: “We are confident that we will face India again in the final (of the Asia Cup).”
Speaking about his celebration after he scored his half-century against India, he said: “I hardly celebrate after a 50. It was a spontaneous thought to celebrate that way — I don’t care for what people are making of it.”
He added that Fakhar’s role from the other end gave him confidence to play his shots.
 
 

In Pakistan’s last match against India, the bitterness between the  two sides — which started with India’s refusal of customary handshakes in the first encounter — had continued as Abhishek Sharma at the post-match ceremony said: “Today (Sunday) it was very simple, the way they (Pakistan) were coming (at) us for no reason, I didn’t like it at all, and this is the only way I could give [an answer] with my bat.”
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking after the match, had said, “We are yet to play the perfect game. We batted really well — but I think when it came to the bowling, they took the game away in the powerplay.”
Earlier, Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka by four wickets in their match in Dubai on Saturday.
The top two teams from Super Four will play the Asia Cup final in Dubai on September 28.</p><small>2025-09-22 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/22155346e471f39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943869/sindh-cm-takes-notice-of-gun-attack-on-anchorperson-imtiaz-mir-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh CM takes notice of gun attack on anchorperson Imtiaz Mir in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Monday took notice of an attack last night on Metro 1 News anchorperson Imtiaz Mir in Karachi’s Malir area that injured him.
According to a statement issued by the Saudabad police station late last night, Mir was shot and injured by unknown gunmen in Malir district’s Kala Board area. “It seems to be targeted,” said the statement, adding that further investigation was under way.
CM Shah took notice of the “murderous attack on senior journalist Imtiaz Mir”, said a statement issued by the CM’s spokesperson, Abdur Rasheed Channa.
Expressing deep regret over the incident, the chief minister sought a report on the incident from Sindh Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon.
Saudabad Station House Officer (SHO) Atiqur Rehman told Dawn.com, “The journalist is admitted at the intensive care unit of [a] private hospital.”
He added that Mir sustained two bullet wounds, including one on the mouth. “He was travelling in a car, which his brother was driving, when armed pillion riders targeted him at Malir’s Kala Board,” SHO Rehman said.
 
 

Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, in a statement earlier today, condemned the attack and ordered the immediate arrest of the perpetrators. He also sought a report from the East district’s deputy IG.
“Protection of journalists and media workers should be ensured at all costs,” Lanjar was quoted as saying.
“Protection of the lives and property of citizens is the top priority of the government. The suspects should be brought to justice,” he asserted.
The police were also directed to reveal the motives behind the attack, the statement added.
 






According to a report published earlier this month by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.
In May, police in Shikarpur claimed to have killed Sheroo Mahar — a notorious dacoit nominated as the prime suspect in the murder case of senior journalist Jan Mohammad Mahar in August last year — in a drone attack in the kutcha area of the district. The journalist, who worked for Sindhi language KTN news network, was shot dead by unknown assailants who had opened fire on his car after he left his office in Sukkur in late evening hours on August 14, 2024.
In April, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) expressed concern over threats issued to journalists by supporters of a religious party.
The same month, Khairpur police claimed to have arrested five suspects allegedly involved in the murder of journalist Allah Dino Shar aka A.D. Shar, who worked for an Urdu news channel. Shar was murdered in Aliabad within the jurisdiction of Thari Mirwah police station, sparking protests by his community at press clubs across Khairpur district.
In November last year, Nadeem Ahmed, a senior reporter at 92 News TV channel, was shot at and wounded in an armed attack in Karachi’s Karsaz area.</p><small>2025-09-22 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625002-zulfi-bukhari-wins-defamation-case-against-his-cousin-over-corruption-allegations' target='_blank'><strong>Zulfi Bukhari wins defamation case against his cousin over corruption allegations</strong></a><br><p>

The bodies of three transgender individuals were recovered from Karachi’s Memon Goth area after midnight on Sunday, according to Edhi Information Centre. It said the bodies were found riddled with bullet holes and that the deceased were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medicolegal formalities.
The complaint was filed at Memon Goth police station on Sunday under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, registered by a transgender person who lived in the same building as the three victims, they told the complainant on Saturday evening that they were headed to Bahria Town on Super Highway.
“I tried calling them, but they did not answer. I kept calling them until 1am,” the complainant stated in the FIR. Ït was not until I opened WhatsApp that I found they were headed back to Karachi from Nagori Society in Hyderabad, when they were attacked in a forested area on the Super Highway.
“An unknown person, or persons, shot and killed them,” the complainant alleged. “I filed this complaint because unknown people killed them for unknown reasons and legal action needs to be taken.”
A research report jointly compiled this year by Blue Veins and the National Commission on Human Rights found that many transgender individuals in Pakistan experience social exclusion, including rejection by families, employment discrimination and violence, pushing them further into vulnerability.
In July, armed motorcyclists killed a transgender person in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand division. The same month, another transgender person was shot dead by unidentified persons in the Tehkal area of Peshawar.
Last year, two transgender persons were stabbed to death in Mardan by assailants, who fled the scene after committing the crime, according to the police.</p><small>2025-09-22 13:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2216540880a44f7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943906/new-polio-case-in-hyderabad-takes-nationwide-tally-to-27' target='_blank'><strong>New polio case in Hyderabad takes nationwide tally to 27</strong></a><br><p>A new polio case has been confirmed in Sindh’s Hyderabad district, taking the nationwide tally to 27 this year and total cases in Sindh to seven, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said on Monday.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
According to a statement from the NIH, “With this detection, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 27 – including 18 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, seven from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.”
NIH added that, “Polio Eradication conducted a Sub-National Polio Vaccination Campaign in September 2025 across 88 districts of the country including Hyderabad.”
The campaign immunised “approximately 21 million children under the age of five,” NIH said.
The next polio immunisation campaign will run from October 13 to 19 and aims to target 45.5m children.
“More than 400,000 dedicated frontline polio workers will go door-to-door to ensure that every child is reached,” NIH said.
The new case comes over a week after two fresh polio virus cases were detected in the south of KP. Out of the two, one of the cases was detected in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil in a 19-month-old infant, while the other case was confirmed in an 11-month-old infant in Lakki Marwat’s Suleman Khel tehsil.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-09-22 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/22170037d14e15e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943856/pm-shehbaz-departs-for-new-york-to-attend-un-general-assembly-session' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz departs for New York to attend UN General Assembly session</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif departed from London on Monday for New York, where he will lead Pakistan’s delegation at a high-level segment of the United Nations General Assembly’s (UNGA) session.
At the UNGA session, PM Shehbaz “will urge the international community to resolve the situations of prolonged occupation and denial of the right to self-determination,” particularly in India-occupied Kashmir and Palestine, an earlier statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said.
“He will also highlight Pakistan’s perspective on the regional security situation, as well as other issues of international concern, including climate change, terrorism, Islamophobia, and sustainable development.”
The FO, in its statement, said PM Shehbaz would attend several “high-level events” on the sidelines of the UNGA session, including a moot of “select” Muslim leaders with US President Donald Trump.
Further, during his visit, he will meet several world leaders and senior UN officials to exchange views on issues of mutual interest.
“He will also underline Pakistan’s resolve to work with all UN member states to uphold the UN Charter, prevent conflict, foster peace and promote global prosperity in Pakistan’s current role as a member of the Security Council,” the FO added.
Today, Pakistan’s High Commissioner in the United Kingdom Dr Muhammad Faisal and other diplomatic staff saw the PM off at Luton Airport in the UK.
 






Earlier, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reached New York and would be accompanying PM Shehbaz at the UNGA  .
“On arrival, FM Dar was received by Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN, Ambassador Rizwan Saeed Shiekh, Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States and senior officials of the Mission,” the FO said on X.
 






“The DPM/FM will have a busy programme in New York. Besides accompanying the PM to his many engagements, the DPM/FM will represent Pakistan in numerous ministerial and high-level meetings and also hold over a dozen bilateral meetings with his counterparts,” the statement added.
As nearly 150 world leaders gather to mark the UN’s 80th anniversary, the global peace forum finds itself surrounded by protests and engulfed in wars.
From its inception, the unresolved question of Palestine has haunted the UN, testing both its credibility and its capacity to deliver peace.
 
 

A high-level international conference for the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution” at the UNGA, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, aims to revive support for a two-state solution.
In a break with convention, the UNGA last week voted to allow Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to address the event by video link, after the US denied him and his delegation visas to attend the meeting.</p><small>2025-09-22 12:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624973-pm-shehbaz-leaves-london-for-new-york-to-attend-key-meetings-80th-unga-session' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz arrives in New York to attend key meetings, 80th UNGA session</strong></a><br><p>

India’s second win over Pakistan at the T20 tournament padded their head-to-head record in the format to 11-3 against the Green Team, with one match tied.
Pakistan still has a lead in the overall record against India across all three formats with 88 wins against India’s 79 victories.
Played against the backdrop of lingering tensions between the two nations in the wake of their military conflict in May, there were no handshakes between the players once again.
“According to me, if two teams play 15-20 matches and if it is 7-7 or 8-7, then that is called a rivalry,” Suryakumar told reporters.
“But 13-0, 10-1. I don’t know what the stats are. But this is not a rivalry anymore.”
Defending champions India dropped four catches during the match, and Suryakumar said they would address the issue ahead of their next Super Four fixture against Bangladesh on Wednesday in Dubai.
The Green Shirts will play their next match against Sri Lanka on Tuesday.
 
 

“The fielding coach has sent an email to the boys, who had butter fingers, to appear before him at his office,” the middle-order batter added.
“But this happens, it is a part of the game. I am okay with it because it happened in the first game itself, and we have more crucial games to go.”
The top two teams of the Super Four stage will move into the final on September 28.</p><small>2025-09-22 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624952-bhc-approves-bail-plea-of-tribal-leader-satakzai-in-degari-honour-killing-case' target='_blank'><strong>BHC approves bail plea of tribal leader Satakzai in Degari honour killing case</strong></a><br><p>

Beijing requires social media companies to moderate content on their platforms, with posts strictly controlled to avoid anything deemed to be too subversive, vulgar, pornographic or generally harmful.
The notice from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) follows announcements of penalties this month against three popular digital platforms, which it said had neglected content management duties.
On Saturday, the CAC said it would carry out “disciplinary and punitive measures” against micro-blogging platform Weibo and short video platform Kuaishou, accusing them of highlighting celebrity news and “undesirable” content.
The announcement followed similar action taken by the CAC on September 11 against the Instagram-like Xiaohongshu, known as Rednote in English.
 
 

Authorities have not specified what punitive actions are being taken against the three platforms.
The two-month campaign — whose start date was not specified in Monday’s statement — aims “to regulate the malicious incitement of conflict and the promotion of violence and vicious currents”, the CAC said.
The statement then listed specific online issues authorities hope to tackle in the crackdown.
They include “exploiting social hot spots to forcibly associate identity, region or gender with other information, stigmatising and hyping them”.
In practice, this could mean a clampdown on posts about discrimination. In July, local officials in eastern Zhejiang province warned comedians against stirring up gender discord through stand-up routines that joked about the battle of the sexes.
Other problems targeted by the campaign include disseminating “rumours” about the economy, finance, social welfare and public policy.
Weibo has previously warned against posting “pessimistic” views about the economy, social media users told AFP in late 2023.
 
 

Monday’s notice also mentioned “maliciously interpreting social phenomena, unilaterally exaggerating negative individual cases and exploiting them to promote negative outlooks on life such as world-weariness”.
That could be seen as a reference to “lying flat” or “letting it rot” culture  widespread phrases used by young Chinese to describe lifestyles that snub gruelling work culture in favour of taking it easy.
The crackdown aims to “foster a more civilised and rational online environment”, the statement said.</p><small>2025-09-22 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/221347497d8007c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943889/islamabad-atc-issues-bailable-arrest-warrant-for-ptis-asad-qaiser-over-2023-judicial-complex-clashes' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC issues bailable arrest warrant for PTI’s Asad Qaiser over 2023 Judicial Complex clashes</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Islamabad on Monday issued a bailable arrest warrant for PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser in a case related to the March 2023 clashes outside the Federal Judicial Complex (FJC).
Hours-long clashes took place between PTI workers and the Islamabad police on March 18, 2023, when former prime minister Imran Khan arrived at the FJC to attend a hearing in the first Toshakhana case, in which he was later arrested in August that year and has been behind bars since then.
The same day, the Punjab police personnel had entered Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore, which had also been the venue of a chaotic stalemate between the cops and the PTI just days before.
ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over today’s hearing. Advocate Sardar Masroof Khan, Amna Ali and others appeared as the legal team for the PTI leaders, while Advocate Sardar Muhammad Razzaq was present as former Punjab chief minister Parvez Elahi’s counsel.
 
 

The judge issued a bailable arrest warrant for Qaiser, ordering that he be produced before the court.
The judge accepted the applications seeking exemption from appearance for Elahi, former finance minister Asad Umar and PTI’s Shibli Faraz, who was recently disqualified from his role as the Senate opposition leader.
Subsequently, the judge adjourned the proceedings till October 6.
The case, registered at the Counter-Terrorism Department police station under Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997, had also named Imran.
A letter had been written to the law ministry about the proceedings against the ex-premier and a response was awaited.
ATA case over Federal Judicial Complex violence
As of March 22, 2023, the Islamabad Police had arrested a total of 316 PTI supporters for allegedly attacking police officers and causing chaos outside the FJC.
 
 

The case had also invoked sections 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc), 395 (punishment for dacoity), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage to amount of one hundred rupees), 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The first information report (FIR) named 18 people involved in causing damage to the FJC, 22 others involved in causing damage in the FJC’s parking area and lighting up fires, and 19 others involved in allegedly injuring police officials. It also mentioned that stones, lighters and bottles filled with petrol were recovered from some of them.</p><small>2025-09-22 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624937-pm-shehbaz-directs-formulation-of-roadmap-to-boost-trade-investment' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz directs formulation of roadmap to boost trade, investment</strong></a><br><p>

There has been a recent uptick in terror attacks in Pakistan over the past year. The CTD regularly carries out operations to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence.
During the three months, 14 terrorists were arrested in Lahore, 14 in Rawalpindi, seven each in Faisalabad and Bahawalpur, six each in Jhang and Sargodha, five in Sahiwal, four from Gujranwala and three each from Bahawalnagar and Gujrat, the statement read.
“Of the arrested terrorists, 55 belong to Fitna al Khawarij, five are from ISIS (Islamic State), and two each are from Al-Qaeda, Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Jeay Sindh,” the statement added.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khawarij to refer to terrorists of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to the CTD, items seized during the raids include 20.2 kilogrammes of explosive material, 85 detonators, 183 feet of safety fuse wire, 717 pamphlets belonging to a banned organisation, magazines, detonating cord, mobile phones and cash.
The CTD added that 87 criminal cases have been registered against the arrested suspects, and investigations are underway.
“The arrested individuals had been planning attacks on important buildings in several cities,” the statement read. “CTD Punjab remains vigilant and committed to the ‘Safe Punjab’ objective. We will spare no effort to bring terrorists and anti-state elements to justice.
“In related security activity during the current week, local police and security agencies carried out 13,521 combing operations, checked 552,692 people, arrested 1,131 suspicious persons, registered 1,061 FIRs (first information reports) and achieved 906 recoveries.
Earlier this week, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CTD neutralised three terrorists, including an Afghan national, during an IBO carried out in Khyber district.
Two of the three militants killed during the IBO were involved in a suicide bombing in Peshawar, which led to the deaths of a sub-inspector and a constable.
A statement issued by the CTD said that the department conducted the operation based on the reported presence of Fazal Noor, a commander of the banned militant group Islamic State Khorasan Province and his group members in the Ali Masjid area of the district.</p><small>2025-09-22 08:24</small></div><hr>
