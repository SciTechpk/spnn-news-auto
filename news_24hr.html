SCIW Superintendent of Police (SP) Syed Saboor Agha told Dawn.com, “Eleven people have been arrested, including a tribal leader who issued directives to shoot the couple, and all of them will appear before a judicial magistrate today.”
The viral video showed a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists said it was an ‘honour’ killing incident. On Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti announced on X that he had directed the Balochistan Police to take immediate action, following which one suspect was apprehended.
According to a first information report (FIR) — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — registered by Station House Officer (SHO) Naveed Akhtar at Quetta’s Hanna-Urak Police Station, he lodged the complaint after receiving the video clip that had gone viral on social media, showing a man and a woman being brutally shot and killed by armed individuals.
SHO Akhtar stated that he, along with his team, reached Balochistan’s Dagari, situated on the outskirts of Quetta and, upon investigation, discovered that the incident occurred three days before Eidul Azha in the area of Sanjidi in Dagari.
“The victims seen in the viral video have been identified as Bano Bibi and Ihsanullah,” the FIR said, naming eight suspects who allegedly shot the couple dead. The FIR also mentioned 15 other unknown suspects involved in the incident.
Speaking to Dawn.com, SHO Naveed Akhtar said, “Owing to the nature of the murder, the case has now been transferred to the Serious Crime Investigation Wing for further investigation.”
Prior to being killed, the victims were allegedly taken to a tribal leader, who declared them guilty of being involved in an ‘immoral relationship’ (locally termed ‘Karo Kari’) and ordered their execution, following which they were taken to the [desert] and shot dead, the FIR said.
“The murder was filmed and uploaded to social media to spread fear and panic among the public,” it added.
According to the FIR, a case was registered against the suspects under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting while armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
One of the main suspects — tribal leader Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai — was presented before an anti-terrorism court today with Judge Muhammad Mubeen presiding over the case. The suspect was handed over to SCIW on a two-day physical remand on the judge’s order upon the police’s request.
Chief Justice Balochistan High Court Justice Rozi Khan Barrech took notice of the case and summoned the additional chief secretary and inspector general of police Balochistan to the court in the matter.
In a press release issued by BHC — seen by Dawn.com — it was notified that Justice Barrech “has taken notice of the news circulating on electronic, print and social media of the murder of a couple for marrying out of choice at Dagari”. The statement added that, “In this matter, the chief justice has summoned the chief secretary and IG Balochistan to court on July 22, 2025”.
The postmortem report on the slain couple has revealed that the woman was shot seven times and the man was shot nine times.
Police surgeon Ayesha Faiz, who conducted the postmortem, told Dawn.com that the graves of the man and woman were exhumed and the postmortem was conducted.
“They were killed on June 4. The woman is around 37 to 38 years old and was shot once in the head and seven times in the chest and stomach.
“The woman’s name was Noor Bano Bibi, written on her arm, and she belongs to the Satakzai tribe — while the man’s name was Ihsanullah, and he is around 35 to 36 years old and was shot nine times in the chest and stomach,” the police surgeon said.
According to Fiaz, the woman’s body was decomposed but recognisable, while the man’s body was in a slightly better condition and also recognisable.
The woman was buried in the Degari Qadir Bakhsh Coal Mines Cemetery, and the man in the Sanjadi Cemetery.
The DNA samples of both bodies have also been obtained and they will be tested if necessary.
The incident was widely condemned by politicians, civil society activists, and the public, who termed it “barbaric” and urged the government to take swift action against the perpetrators.
Separately, PPP MNA Shazia Marria moved an adjournment motion in the National Assembly to instead discuss the incident since it was a “matter of urgent national and human importance”.
“This tragic and barbaric act has shaken the conscience of the nation. Such heinous crimes constitute a grave violation of the teachings of Islam, and are in blatant disregard of the Constitution … which guarantees all citizens the right to life, dignity, due process, and equal protection under the law. Furthermore, such acts are deeply offensive to the cultural and moral values of our society, which emphasise compassion, justice and the sanctity of human life.
“This House must condemn this crime in the strongest possible terms. I urge the federal government to immediately engage with the provincial government of Balochistan, obtain a comprehensive and transparent report, and ensure that those responsible are identified, arrested, and prosecuted without delay.”
Marri also said it was “imperative” that the state be made the complainant in the FIR and subsequent legal proceedings to safeguard the integrity of the investigation, reinforce public confidence in the justice system and avoid any compromise or pressure on the victims’ families.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.
CM vows justice to be ensured
Addressing a press conference to discuss the details of the case, CM Bugti said he stood with the victims and vowed that justice would be served regardless of tribal affiliation.
He said he immediately ordered the arrest of suspects within 24 hours of the video going viral, adding 12 people had been detained so far, including a tribal chief.
Bugti clarified misinformation circulating on social and mainstream media, rejecting claims that the victims were a newly married couple. “The woman and man weren’t married. The woman had five children, and the man, aged around 45 to 50, also had four or five children,” he said, adding that these details did not justify the killing.
“It is a murder, a crime, no matter what anyone has done. No one has the right to kill a person this ruthlessly and make videos,” he said.
 


He added that the Special Branch deputy superintendent of police (DSP) posted in Dagari were suspended for failing to report the incident to the government.
The chief minister also pointed out the spread of misinformation through social media and the lack of investigative journalism.
“People sitting in Karachi and Lahore don’t know what Dagari is. But still, did anyone do any investigation? No. It was the murderer himself who released the video.”
Bugti said that he had received a call from PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and that operations were underway upon his instructions. He said the government would follow constitutional channels, not tribal jirgas, to resolve the case.
Condemnations
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the murder and contacted CM Bugti, ordering a probe into the incident, according to a press release from the PM Office.
The prime minister directed that people involved in the incident should be punished according to law, as no one was above the law and could not be permitted to violate the law of the land.
He also ordered taking all legal measures to bring the culprits to justice.
Bilawal called the suspects “beasts”, saying that they deserved no concessions. “I have faith that the criminals involved in this murder will be brought to justice soon,” he said, according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).  “This murder should be a test case for the Balochistan government, as it is gender terrorism.”
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif shared the video in a post on X, with a message for the people of Balochistan. Referring to the growing militancy in the province, he said: “Those who have taken up arms against the state — start by raising your voice against the unjust system that surrounds you.”
He continued that the ones responsible for this “oppression are your own brothers, not the travellers and labourers from other provinces”, pointing out the recent bus attack in Balochistan’s Kalat district, which left three people dead and other similar incidents in the recent past.
PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman also condemned the murder in a post on X, labelling it an “unforgivable crime”.
“Crushing the right to marry is a violation of fundamental human rights. Killing in the name of tribal decisions is a despicable act. The cycle of brutality in the name of honour must be stopped,” she wrote.
“By mercilessly killing the married couple, not only have law and justice been insulted, but the authority of the provincial government has also been challenged,” Rehman added. “The chapter of oppression and barbarism under the guise of jirgas must be closed.”
The senator emphasised that the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that legislation to end “outdated customs” was indispensable.
Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch decried the shooting as an ‘honour’ killing, appealing to Baloch elders to “respect women’s decisions”.
“As a woman, this chilling incident is deeply painful and heart-wrenching for me,” she wrote on X. “Killing any woman in the name of honour is not only a heinous crime but also the worst humiliation of humanity.
“I appeal to Baloch and Pashtun tribal elders, influential sections of society, and intellectuals to respect women’s decisions. Today’s woman is the same woman who is educated, aware, and fully capable of making decisions about her future.”
She demanded that the killing be investigated transparently and comprehensively so that the suspects would be brought to justice and “no one dares to repeat such a barbaric act in the future”.

The treasury and the joint opposition alliance had agreed on a seat-sharing formula under which six seats would go to the treasury, which has 92 members in the KP Assembly, and five seats to the opposition, which is 53-strong.
On Sunday, it emerged that what initially shaped up to be a three-way contest — among PTI, PTI “dissidents” and opposition lawmakers — turned out to be almost a two-way match after the size of PTI’s “disgruntled” faction was effectively reduced to just one candidate.
PTI’s Murad Saeed, Faisal Javed, Mirza Afridi and Noorul Haq Qadri were elected as senators on general seats, according to the unofficial results.
Murad Saeed received 26 votes, Mirza Afridi and Faisal Javed both bagged 22, and Noor-ul-Haq Qadri 21.
PTI’s Azam Swati was elected on a technocrat seat with 89 votes. Similarly, PTI’s Rubina Naz became a senator on a women’s seat with 89 votes.
Federal Minister for Gilgit Baltistan and Kashmir Affairs and States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam’s son Niaz Ahmed reached the upper house by with 18 votes on a general seat.
PPP’s Talha Mehmood bagged a Senate seat with 18 votes. PPP’s Rubina Khalid was elected as a senator on women’s seat with 52 votes.
JUI-F’s Attaul Haq won on a general seat and the party’s Dilawar Khan on a technocrat seat to become members of the upper house with 18 and 54 votes, respectively.
On Sunday, Twenty-five MPAs-elect of the KP opposition were sworn into office after KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered their oaths.
The oath-taking issue has risen once again after the recent redistribution of reserved seats in the wake of a verdict by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench that effectively took away the seats from the PTI and declared other political parties eligible for them.
Earlier in the month, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) finally announced the schedule for the long-overdue Senate elections in KP, setting July 21 as the polling date.
The much-delayed but suspenseful exercise saw elections on 11 seats — seven general and two each reserved for women, ulema and technocrats.
Currently, the ruling coalition has 54 members in the 96-member Senate — 10 short of the two-thirds majority (64 seats).
A separate election for the seat vacated by Senator Sania Nishtar is scheduled for July 31.
According to an ECP statement, the Senate elections in KP were delayed due to an incomplete electoral college. The schedule was announced two days after 25 reserved seats — originally allocated to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — were redistributed among parties, including PML-N, PPP, JUI-F, PTI-P and ANP.
The elections were earlier postponed in April 2024, exacerbating political uncertainty in the province. Polling for another Senate seat — vacated after the death of Professor Sajid Mir — will also take place on July 21.
Punjab Senate seat by-election won by PML-N’s Hafiz Abdul Kareem
The by-election on a vacant Senate seat in Punjab was won by PML-N’s Hafiz Abdul Kareem with 243 votes, according to official results from the ECP.
The PML-N had nominated the emir of the Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith, as its candidate for the seat, which fell vacant after the demise of Professor Mir.
The total available votes were 368, with 345 polled votes, of which valid votes were 342, while three were rejected.
In a speech after his victory, Kareem thanked God and mentioned that he was grateful to PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif
“I thank Mian Nawaz Sharif, who always remained loyal to Jamiat Ahle Hadith,” Kareem said.
He added that he was also deeply grateful to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, whom he credited for his victory.
“She left work in the flood-affected areas and cast her vote for me,” Kareem said.</p><small>2025-07-21 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2117455965b961e.png?r=204216' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925630/govt-detains-traders-amid-tax-protest-at-pak-china-border-as-karakoram-highway-blocked' target='_blank'><strong>Govt detains traders amid tax protest at Pak-China border as Karakoram highway blocked</strong></a><br><p>The government detained several traders on Monday after they protested at the Pakistan-China border against taxes and announced the closure of the dry port on the call of the Pak-China Trades Action Committee, a traders organisation in Gilgit-Baltistan.
Traders have closed the Karakoram Highway at several places in Hunza and Nagar districts, due to which travellers and a large number of tourists from the two districts have been stranded.
“Traders had blocked the Karakoram Highway by staging a sit-in at two places in the Hunza area, in which the Murtazaabad sit-in ended,” Hunza Deputy Commissioner (DC) Huzaifa Anwar told Dawn.com.
“However, a sit-in is ongoing in the Sost area of the Pak-China border. Talks are being held with the traders there. It is likely that it will be cleared in two to three hours,” DC Anwar added.
He said that three traders were detained at the Sost Dry Port after the announcement of the sit-in, one of whom has been released, but two are in custody.
The DC said that the traders were not arrested and in protective custody. “If they had been arrested, a case would have been registered, but no case has been registered against any trader,” he added.
“At present, the priority is to resolve the issue of the closure of the Karakoram Highway, since there are a large number of tourists in the area who are facing problems in their movement.”
The Silk Route Dry Port was to be closed today and a sit-in was to be held on the Karakoram Highway, according to an announcement from the traders of Gilgit-Baltistan.
However, last night the government cracked down on the active traders. According to the traders, the police took action at night and raided the houses of several traders, including Ali Nazar, Abbas Mir and Farman Tajik, and arrested them.
The traders have pitched tents on the Karakoram Highway at Nagar Rakaposhi and Murtaazabad in Hunza, due to which hundreds of travellers and dozens of nationals and foreigners have been stranded.
Former president of GB Chamber of Commerce and prominent businessman Javed Hussain, while addressing the traders’ sit-in in Nagar, said that the Hunza administration ruined the peaceful protest by arresting traders.
“Now, if the district administration has any power, then keep the traders in custody; otherwise, we will break out our colleagues and show them,” he said, adding that he would not compromise on the interests of GB. “If it means leaving the PML-N for this, I will leave it a thousand times.”
He blamed Hunza’s DC and superintendent of police for the situation. The traders raised strong slogans against the district police chief and the deputy commissioner.
Former president of the Chamber of Commerce, Imran Ali, said that the traders’ demand was against the collection of income and sales tax collected at the Sost Silk Dry Port.
According to him, earlier too, an understanding was reached on some issues regarding the protest of the traders against the aforementioned taxes at the Pak-China border, but the issue arose again because of which the Silk Route Dry Port was closed today. The port was to be locked down and a sit-in was to be held in the border area.
According to DC Anwar, the situation was completely under control. “We are in contact with the traders and negotiations are also taking place,” he said.
Nagar DC Asghar Khan said that the highway was closed for some time due to the Muharram procession in Nagar district, giving the impression that traders had blocked the highway. “However, the highway was not closed anywhere. The Nagar administration has not even arrested any trader,” he said.
In June, local importers and exporters protested against what they called exploitative policies of the Federal Board of Revenue. The protest was led by traders and supported by political parties against the centre’s trade policies.
Local traders involved in Pakistan-China trade via Khunjerab Pass had also launched an indefinite protest sit-in May, blocking the Karakoram Highway at Pissan in Nagar, stranding thousands of local and international travellers on both sides of the route.</p><small>2025-07-21 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21180851b936d33.jpg?r=181009' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925657/pm-shehbaz-launches-digital-system-for-licensing-registering-medical-devices' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz launches digital system for licensing, registering medical devices</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday launched the Digital System for Licensing and Registration of Medical Devices, which will accelerate the registration process, state media Radio Pakistan reported.
The registration of life-saving medical devices and diagnostic products in Pakistan became a critical issue earlier this year.
The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) was under scrutiny over “sluggish” and “highly inefficient” operations for the approval and registration of medical devices. According to the chairman of Healthcare Devices Association of Pakistan, the situation was causing heavy financial losses to importers and disrupting patient care in hospitals.
Speaking at the launch ceremony in Islamabad, he said that the process will be completed in the shortest possible time, stating: “Now, decisions will be made swiftly and transparently.”
The premier hoped that the applications for registration of medical services and equipment would be decided within 20 days in a transparent and merit-based system, according to APP.
He criticised Drap for inordinate delays in the registration process of medical services, saying. “Drag, not Drap, as it was dragging the process not for months but for years. The reasons were known to all.”
While citing issues in the health sector, he recalled an incident during his tenure as the Punjab chief minister, when Drap failed to properly handle certain drugs — meant to treat malaria — to treat heart patients, causing several deaths in the Punjab Institute of Cardiology.
 






He also discussed that the government allocated a huge budget for the provision of free of cost medicines at the government-run hospitals during 2014-15. He was quoted as saying, “The 60 per cent samples of those drugs proved below standards.”
He added that he ensured provision of quality medicines free of cost and set up laboratories across the province to facilitate the poor and deprived people.
The prime minister said that if they decided to bring about revolution in the health sector, it might be a difficult task, but not impossible.
“There may be mountain-like hurdles, but if we decide with determination to negotiate them and move ahead, then nothing can hamper the way towards progress and prosperity. The hard work does not go in vain,” he stated.
Federal Minister for Health Mustafa Kamal also spoke during the ceremony. He said that they had squeezed the time through an online digitisation system spanning over 20 days, contrary to earlier long periods of registration process.
He was quoted as saying, “The system would be free from any human contact as the certificates would be available online without visiting Drap.”
Kamal said that the government was utilising available resources to overcome issues in the health sector, including population growth and waterborne diseases.
“We are further improving the healthcare system with public-private partnership,” he said, adding the primary healthcare system would be strengthened further to reduce the burden at the main healthcare centres.
“The registration and licensing of everything from wheelchairs to MRI machines would be done online. Citizens could submit online applications from home to obtain registration and licensing of medical devices.”</p><small>2025-07-21 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21162932330c05e.png?r=163020' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925645/at-least-19-killed-164-injured-as-bangladesh-air-force-plane-crashes-into-college-campus' target='_blank'><strong>At least 19 killed, 164 injured as Bangladesh air force plane crashes into college campus</strong></a><br><p>At least 19 people were killed and 164 injured as a Bangladesh air force training jet crashed into a college and school campus in the capital Dhaka on Monday after experiencing a technical problem shortly after take-off, a military spokesperson said.
The F-7 BGI jet took off at 1:06pm (0706 GMT) from the Bangladesh Air Force base in Kurmitola, Dhaka, as part of a routine training mission, but encountered a mechanical failure, said the spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Sami Ud Dowla Chowdhury.
“The pilot … made a valiant attempt to divert the aircraft away from densely populated areas. Despite his best efforts, the aircraft … crashed into a two-storey building belonging to Milestone School and College,” he said.
The pilot was among those killed in the incident, the military said, adding that a committee had been formed to investigate its cause.
The F-7 BGI is the final and most advanced variant in China’s Chengdu J-7/F-7 aircraft family, according to Janes Information Group. Bangladesh signed a contract for 16 aircraft in 2011 and deliveries were completed by 2013.
The Chengdu F-7 is the licence-built version of the Soviet MiG-21.
According to the Daily Star, an emergency hotline (01949-043697) was launched at the National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery following the crash.
The Daily Star further reported that three platoons of the Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB) were deployed to Uttara to assist in law enforcement and rescue operations, according to the BGB headquarters.
It added that the government has declared a one-day state mourning day tomorrow following the crash. The national flag will be flown at half-mast at all government, semi-government, autonomous institutions and educational establishments, as well as at Bangladeshi missions abroad.
“Special prayers will be held in all religious places of worship throughout the country for the injured and deceased,” it said.
Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh’s interim government, said that “necessary measures” would be taken to investigate the cause of the accident and “ensure all kinds of assistance”.
“The loss suffered by the air force […] students, parents, teachers and staff, and others in this accident is irreparable,” he said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his regret over the incident and said Pakistan stood in solidarity with Bangladesh.
 






Fire, despair at crash site
Videos of the aftermath of the crash showed a big fire near a lawn emitting a thick plume of smoke into the sky, as crowds watched from a distance.
Firefighters sprayed water on the mangled remains of the plane, which appeared to have rammed into the side of a building, damaging iron grills and creating a gaping hole in the structure, footage filmed by Reuters showed.
 


“A third-grade student was brought in dead, and three others, aged 12, 14 and 40, were admitted to the hospital,” said Bidhan Sarker, head of the burn unit at the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, where some victims were taken.
Images from the scene also showed people screaming and crying as others tried to comfort them.
“When I was picking [up] my kids and went to the gate, I realised something came from behind … I heard an explosion. When I looked back, I only saw fire and smoke,” said Masud Tarik, a teacher at the school.
The incident comes a little over a month after an Air India plane crashed on top of a medical college hostel in India’s Ahmedabad, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 on the ground, marking the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.</p><small>2025-07-21 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21194111f096470.jpg?r=200011' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925661/trumps-renewed-interest-in-pakistan-has-india-recalibrating-china-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s renewed interest in Pakistan has India recalibrating China ties</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s lunch meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir prompted a private diplomatic protest from India in a warning to Washington about risks to their bilateral ties while New Delhi is recalibrating relations with China as a hedge, officials and analysts said.
The meeting and other tensions in the US-India relationship, after decades of flourishing ties, have cast a shadow in trade negotiations, they said, as Trump’s administration weighs tariffs against one of its major partners in the Indo-Pacific.
India blames Pakistan, especially the military establishment, for supporting what it alleges is cross-border terrorism and has told the US it is sending the wrong signals by wooing Field Marshal Munir, three senior Indian government officials directly aware of the matter told Reuters.
It has created a sore spot that will hamper relations going forward, they said.
Pakistan has denied accusations that it supports militants who carried out an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam and that New Delhi has provided no evidence that it is involved.
US-India ties have strengthened in the past two decades despite minor hiccups, at least partly because both countries seek to counter China.
The current problems are different, said Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based senior fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation think tank.
“The frequency and intensity with which the US is engaging with Pakistan, and seemingly not taking Indian concerns into account, especially after India’s recent conflict with Pakistan, has contributed to a bit of a bilateral malaise.
“The concern this time around is that one of the triggers for broader tensions, that being Trump’s unpredictability, is extending into the trade realm with his approach to tariffs,” he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office and India’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The foreign ministry has previously said that it had “taken note” of the Trump-Munir meeting.
A US official said they do not comment on private diplomatic communications and that the US enjoys strong relationships with both India and Pakistan.
“These relationships stand on their own merits, and we do not compare our bilateral relationships with one another,” the US official said.
Lunch at the White House
The US seems to have taken a different tack on Pakistan after a brief conflict broke out between the nuclear-armed rivals in May when India launched strikes on what it called terrorist targets across the border in response to a deadly attack on tourists from the majority Hindu community in India-held Kashmir the previous month.
After four days of aerial dogfights, missile and drone attacks, the two sides agreed to a ceasefire.
India and Pakistan have skirmished regularly and fought three full-scale wars since independence in 1947, two of them over the Kashmir dispute.
A few weeks after the May fighting, Trump hosted Field Marshal Munir for lunch at the White House, a major boost in ties with the country, which had largely languished under Trump’s first term and Joe Biden. It was the first time a US president had hosted the head of Pakistan’s army at the White House unaccompanied by senior Pakistani civilian officials.
 
 

Indian leaders have alleged that COAS Munir’s view of India and Pakistan is steeped in religion. “Tourists were murdered in front of their families after ascertaining their faith,” Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said in May, referring to the Pahalgam attack.
“To understand that, you’ve got to also see … you have a Pakistani leadership, especially their army chief, who is driven by an extreme religious outlook,” he claimed.
Pakistan says it is Modi who is driven by religious extremism, and that his brand of Hindu nationalism has trampled on the rights of India’s large Muslim minority. Modi and the Indian government say they do not discriminate against minorities.
COAS Munir’s meeting in the White House added to India’s chagrin over Trump’s repeated insistence that he averted nuclear war between the two nations by threatening to stop trade negotiations with them. The comment drew a sharp response from Modi, who told Trump that the ceasefire was achieved through talks between army commanders of the two nations, and not US mediation.
In the days following his June 18 meeting with COAS Munir, people from Modi’s office and India’s national security adviser’s office made separate calls to their US counterparts to register a protest, two of the officials said. The protest has not been previously reported.
“We have communicated to the US our position on cross-border terrorism, which is a red line for us,” said a senior Indian official. “These are difficult times … Trump’s inability to understand our concerns does create some wrinkle in ties,” he added, seeking anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
 
 

Trump and COAS Munir discussed continuation of a counterterrorism collaboration, under which the US has previously provided weapons to Pakistan, a non-Nato US ally, and talked about ways to further strengthen ties, a readout of the meeting from the Inter-Services Public Relations said.
That raised concern in New Delhi that any arms Pakistan receives from the US could be turned on India if the neighbours end up in conflict again, two of the officials said.
Harder stance
Despite what used to be public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Modi, India has been taking a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks, while trade discussions have also slowed, the Indian officials and an Indian industry lobbyist said.
Modi declined an invitation from Trump to visit Washington after the G7 meeting in Canada in June.
Earlier this month, New Delhi proposed retaliatory duties against the US at the World Trade Organisation, showing trade talks were not going as smoothly as they were before the India-Pakistan clashes.
India, like other nations, is trying to figure out a way to deal with Trump and is recalibrating ties with China as a hedge, said Harsh Pant, foreign policy head at India’s Observer Research Foundation think tank.
“Certainly there is an outreach to China,” he said. “And I think it is mutual … China is also reaching out”.
Last week, India’s Jaishankar made his first visit to Beijing since a deadly 2020 border clash between Indian and Chinese troops.
 
 

India is also making moves to ease restrictions on investments from China that were imposed following the 2020 clash.
The thaw comes despite India’s prickly relations with China and Beijing’s close ties and military support to Pakistan.
But New Delhi’s concern about Trump’s own engagement with China, which has ranged from conciliatory to confrontational, appears to have contributed to its shift in stance on Beijing.
“With an unpredictable dealmaker in the White House, New Delhi cannot rule out Sino-US rapprochement,” said Christopher Clary, an associate professor of political science at the University at Albany, New York.
“India is troubled by Chinese help to Pakistan and growing Chinese influence elsewhere in India’s near abroad, such as Bangladesh. Yet New Delhi has largely concluded that it should respond to creeping Chinese influence by focusing its pressures on its nearest neighbours and not on China.”</p><small>2025-07-21 15:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21193510d3d6c88.jpg?r=193647' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666/monsoon-rains-in-punjab-to-continue-until-july-25-pdma' target='_blank'><strong>Monsoon rains in Punjab to continue until July 25: PDMA</strong></a><br><p>A spokesperson for the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Monday said that there will be more monsoon rains in the province until July 25, according to a statement.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the Malakand and Hazara divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the southern parts of Punjab and Sindh, eastern Balochistan and parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) were expected to receive rain and thunderstorms with strong winds.
Rain and thunderstorms were forecast for urban centres of Punjab in the south, such as Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan, though overall weather of the province was expected to remain partly cloudy and humid.
According to the PDMA, Punjab will receive a fourth wave of monsoon rains until July 25, which the authority says is “slightly more powerful”.
“Rain has been forecast in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiat, Attock, Chakwal, Mandi Bahauddin, Hafizabad, Gujarat, Jhelum and Gujranwala,” the statement read. “Rain is also expected in Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Sargodha and Mianwali,” its statement read.
“Rain is also predicted in Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar and Multan.”
PDMA Punjab Director General Irfan Ali Kathia announced that due to the heavy rain, there is a high possibility of increased water flow in rivers.
“A flood alert has been issued for rivers and canals in Punjab,” the statement quoted him as saying.
The PDMA warned that there is a possibility of increased flow in the Ravi, Jhelum, Sutlej and Chenab rivers, while stating that water flow in the Indus River was measured at 420,000 cusecs at the Taunsa barrage.
The Flood Forecasting Division showed that by 6pm, water flow at the Taunsa barrage stood at 383,456 cusecs.

“In the Indus River, there is a low-level flood at Tarbela, Kala Bagh and Chashma,” the PDMA said.
The PDMA DG said that on the instructions of the Punjab chief minister, an alert has been issued to all administrations across the province.
“Deputy commissioners have been instructed to remain in the field, while Section 144 should be imposed along the banks of rivers and canals,” Kathia said, instructing police to increase patrols along waterways.
The DG added: “All relevant departments, including Wasa, Rescue 1122 and district administrations, should be on alert. The drainage of standing water from low-lying areas must be ensured, as must the deployment of machinery and staff at choke points.”
Kathia further ordered that disposal stations be kept functional, while urging people in private housing to ensure adequate drainage. He warned that those unable to ensure drainage would face action.
He also urged the public to take precautionary measures amid heavy rain, such as keeping away from electric pylons and appliances during a storm and to avoid houses made from mud or in dilapidated condition.
So far, 123 people have been killed and 462 injured since June 25 as the province received record rainfall, triggering urban flooding which inundated residential areas, the PDMA said last week. Of these, 71 deaths were reported in the past two days alone.</p><small>2025-07-21 14:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615091-inside-unprecedented-clampdown-on-hrcp-pakistans-leading-human-rights-body' target='_blank'><strong>Inside the unprecedented clampdown on HRCP, Pakistan's leading human rights body</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
According to a statement by the CTD spokesperson, “All three suspects, who were killed, were linked to Daesh and were planning future acts of terror.”
Daesh refers to the banned militant Islamic State (IS) group, a globally proscribed terrorist organisation.
The CTD conducted an operation during which a “high-value Daesh suspect”, who was involved in the abduction and murder of a minor, was being taken to identify a suspected hideout in the outskirts of Mastung’s Dasht area, the statement said.
“The suspect had been under CTD custody and was involved in a brutal case of kidnapping for ransom, where the abducted minor was killed in captivity after the ransom was not paid,” it added.
“He was also linked with an operational cell of Daesh, involved in fundraising and terror facilitation across the province.”
The statement further said that armed accomplices present inside the hideout opened fire on the CTD team “in an attempt to secure the release of their associate”.
“CTD officials returned fire in self-defence, resulting in a fierce exchange. A shootout ensued [which] resulted in the killing of held suspect by his group’s fire during the chaos,” it added.
“Two armed terrorists were also neutralised on the spot.”
The statement also read that the group was involved in “targeted killings and extortion networks, using child abductions to fund militant operations”.
The CTD recovered “a cache of weapons, explosive materials, communication devices, and extremist literature from the site”, according to the statement.
A first information report was being registered at the CTD Quetta police station, while more raids were also planned for other areas of Dasht and Spilinji “to nab the remaining members of the group”, it concluded.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
 
 

On Friday, a Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred and two others suffered injuries when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on the National Highway in Mastung.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, especially in KP and Balochistan, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations.
Last week, the CTD Balochistan killed five terrorists during a joint operation conducted with other law enforcement agencies in Duki district.

Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her sentence at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.
On July 12, the IHC expr­essed dissatisfaction over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq threatening to “summon the entire cabinet” if the report is not presented.
Justice Ishaq presided over a hearing for the case today. The judge said in his court order that he had warned the additional attorney general while passing his previous ruling that further inaction on the part of the government would lead to the issuance of a contempt notice.
“The government filed an appeal before the Supreme Court against my earlier decision permitting amendments to the petition for continuation of this case,” the order read. “For whatever reason, the government’s case had not been taken up by the Supreme Court.”
The judge said that since the government had not responded with the reasons despite being directed to do so, it was in contempt, leaving him with no option but to issue a notice of contempt to the federal government.
“Office is directed to initiate a contempt petition accordingly, in which all the members of the federal government will be respondents. The replies of all the ministers, including the prime minister, shall be filed within two weeks from today,” the order said.
At the outset of his order, the judge said: “Ever since the demolition squad was catapulted into this high court after the 26th Constitutional Amendment, we have seen one heresy after another hurled at the edifice of justice, maiming it repeatedly and bringing it almost to its last breaths. This is yet another instance. The heresy I speak of now is besieging the dispensation of justice by a judge of the high court by the device of the ‘weekly roster’ controlled by the office of the chief justice. It is both heart-rending and amusing at the same time, a blend of paradox that this high court has become.”
Criticising the government’s actions during the current case, he said, “The machinations of the executive appeared elsewhere, in the form of controlling the proceedings of this court through its roster.”
The judge noted that he was supposed to be on leave this week, but was informed that the cause list would not be issued without the leave of the chief justice, to which he submitted an application. He added that he was informed on Saturday that the chief justice did not sign it.
“I was informed on Saturday that the application was duly moved but the file remained on the table of the chief justice, who did not find even 30 seconds to sign it. Whether that was by design or oversight, I cannot say for sure, but given the manner in which the roster of judges has been used as a tool for the desired outcome in specific cases, and given the government’s stiff opposition to do what is right and to stand by the daughter of the nation at the critical juncture of the motion before a US court, I may be forgiven for thinking that it was the former. The correct legal position is that the office cannot use the shoulder of the chief justice in the exercise of administrative powers to obstruct judicial proceedings ordered by a judge in an ongoing case.”
Justice Ishaq called it “yet another instance of the reproachable use of the administrative power to shackle the exercise of independent judicial authority”, stating that the government’s response, with reasons as to why it would not sign the [amicus brief][4] in the case, would likely be delayed until his leave ended.
“However, the imperatives of justice shall not be defeated by such petty means. To the extent I can, I will exercise my judicial authority to the end of upholding the dignity of the high court and the justice it dispenses.”
The hearing
Lawyer Imran Shafiq appeared in court on behalf of the petitioner, Dr Fowzia Siddiqui. Former senator Mushtaq Ahmed was also present at the court.
Justice Ishaq echoed his discontent with how the hearing had been scheduled for today, despite his being on leave. “Even if a judge wants to, they cannot work during holidays,” he remarked.
“My holidays were supposed to start today. Once again, administrative power has been used for judicial power.”
The judge added that he still heard the case because of its nature and importance.
“The government has filed an appeal against my decision in the Supreme Court,” the judge said.
Shafiq noted that if the government had to take a stay, “they would have formed a new bench by now”.
“We know how the court functions. Your order is there, the case is being heard today,” he added, addressing the judge.
When asked why Shafiq had not filed his case with the Supreme Court, he replied, “Because Justice Mansoor Ali Shah is there.”
“The case will only be filed when the roster of judges changes,” Shafiq added.
“The court has no other option but to issue contempt notices to the federal government,” Justice Ishaq ruled.
He stated that the next hearing of the case would be held on the first working day after he returned from leave.</p><small>2025-07-21 13:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21181350072fb0f.jpg?r=182750' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925658/air-india-cockpit-recording-suggests-captain-cut-fuel-to-engines-before-crash-source-says' target='_blank'><strong>Air India cockpit recording suggests captain cut fuel to engines before crash, source says</strong></a><br><p>A cockpit recording of dialogue between the two pilots of the Air India flight that crashed last month supports the view that the captain cut the flow of fuel to the plane’s engines, said a source briefed on US officials’ early assessment of evidence.
The first officer was at the controls of the Boeing 787 and asked the captain why he moved the fuel switches into a position that starved the engines of fuel and requested that he restore the fuel flow, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity because the matter remains under investigation.
The US assessment is not contained in a formal document, said the source, who emphasised the cause of the June 12 crash in Ahmedabad, India, that killed 260 people remains under investigation.
There was no cockpit video recording definitively showing which pilot flipped the switches, but the weight of evidence from the conversation points to the captain, according to the early assessment.
 
 

India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), which is leading the investigation into the crash, said in a statement on Thursday that “certain sections of the international media are repeatedly attempting to draw conclusions through selective and unverified reporting”.
It added that the investigation was ongoing and it was too early to draw definitive conclusions.
The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) first reported similar information on Wednesday about the world’s deadliest aviation accident in a decade.
The Federation of Indian Pilots, through its Indian law firm APJ-SLG Law Offices, sent a legal notice to Reuters about a July 17 story published by the news agency, which referenced the WSJ article.
The notice asked Reuters to desist from publication of any content “that speculates on the cause of the crash or attributes fault to any individuals, especially deceased pilots, in the absence of official confirmation and final report”.
Most air crashes are caused by multiple factors, and under international rules, a final report is expected within a year of an accident.
A preliminary report released by the AAIB on Saturday said one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel and “the other pilot responded that he did not do so”.
Investigators did not identify which remarks were made by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and which by First Officer Clive Kunder, who had total flying experience of 15,638 hours and 3,403 hours, respectively.
The AAIB’s preliminary report said the fuel switches had switched from “run” to “cutoff” a second apart just after takeoff, but it did not say how they were moved.
 
 

Almost immediately after the plane lifted off the ground, closed-circuit TV footage showed a backup energy source called a ram air turbine had deployed, indicating a loss of power from the engines.
The London-bound plane began to lose thrust, and after reaching a height of 650 feet, the jet started to sink.
The fuel switches for both engines were turned back to “run”, and the aeroplane automatically tried restarting the engines, the report said.
But the plane was too low and too slow to be able to recover, aviation safety expert John Nance told Reuters.
The plane clipped some trees and a chimney before crashing in a fireball into a building on a nearby medical college campus, the report said, killing 19 people on the ground and 241 of the 242 on board the 787.
No safety recommendations
In an internal memo on Monday, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said the preliminary report found no mechanical or maintenance faults and that all required maintenance had been carried out.
The AAIB’s preliminary report had no safety recommendations for Boeing or engine manufacturer GE.
After the report was released, the US Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing privately issued notifications that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe, a document seen by Reuters showed and four sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has been assisting with the Air India investigation and its Chair, Jennifer Homendy, has been fully briefed on all aspects, a board spokesperson said.
That includes the cockpit voice recording and details from the flight data recorder that the NTSB team assisted the AAIB in reading out, the spokesperson added.
“The safety of international air travel depends on learning as much as we can from these rare events so that industry and regulators can improve aviation safety,” Homendy said in a statement. “And if there are no immediate safety issues discovered, we need to know that as well.”
The circumstantial evidence increasingly indicates that a crew member flipped the engine fuel switches, Nance said, given there was “no other rational explanation” that was consistent with the information released to date.
Nonetheless, investigators “still have to dig into all the factors” and rule out other possible contributing factors, which would take time, he said.
The Air India crash has rekindled debate over adding flight deck cameras, known as cockpit image recorders, on airliners.
Nance said investigators likely would have benefited greatly from having video footage of the cockpit during the Air India flight.</p><small>2025-07-21 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615080-karachi-to-get-three-more-nadra-mega-centres' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to get three more Nadra mega centres</strong></a><br><p>

Rashid has been in prison for almost a year now in connection with multiple cases against her regarding the events of May 9, 2023, when countrywide protests and riots broke out after the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan. Last week, she was moved to a hospital in Lahore after her health deteriorated in Kot Lakhpat Jail. She was hospitalised in May and July of last year as well.
Mudassar, Rashid’s advocate, told Dawn.com that Rashid had a severe infection in her stomach and was also having difficulty breathing.
“Rashid was forcibly discharged from the hospital on Saturday. She underwent various tests, but she was not fully treated in light of the reports.”
He added Rashid was “transferred to jail without informing her family and lawyers” upon being discharged. “Yasmin Rashid has a fundamental right to health and medical facilities,” Mudassar said.
Moeen Riaz Qureshi, deputy opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly, slammed the lack of medical care provided to Rashid, calling it “pathetic” and immoral that the government would deprive “an old lady, a cancer survivor, an ex-health minister” of medical facilities.
“She needs urgent medical attention […] Her sleep is constantly disturbed; she can’t breathe properly. Even when they gave her the [BIPAP] machine, they turned off the electricity at night in the name of load shedding so it couldn’t work,” he said.
He warned against allowing Rashid’s health to deteriorate for the sake of “political stunting”, saying that the government would “regret it”.
The PTI’s US division said Rashid was “being humiliated by the state”. “This isn’t justice. It’s vengeance,” it added.
 






On July 12, an anti-terrorism court reserved its verdict on the bail petitions of former Punjab governor Umar Sarfraz Cheema and Rashid in cases related to the May 9 riots.
The same day, Rashid and four other PTI senior leaders incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat Jail demanded fresh, free and fair general elections in the country in an open letter.</p><small>2025-07-21 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2117173611ff90a.jpg?r=171757' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925647/china-embarks-on-worlds-largest-hydropower-dam-capital-markets-cheer' target='_blank'><strong>China embarks on world’s largest hydropower dam, capital markets cheer</strong></a><br><p>China’s Premier Li Qiang has announced that construction had begun on what would be the world’s largest hydropower dam on the eastern rim of the Tibetan Plateau, the country’s official Xinhua news agency reported — sending stock prices and bond yields higher on Monday.
The commencement of the hydropower project at an estimated cost of at least $170 billion, China’s most ambitious since the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze, was seized by Chinese markets as proof of economic stimulus.
Made up of five cascade hydropower stations with the capacity to produce 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, equal to the amount of electricity consumed by Britain last year, the dam will be located in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo. A section of the river tumbles 2,000 metres in a span of 50km, offering huge hydropower potential.
India and Bangladesh have already raised concerns about its possible impact on the millions of people downstream.
China asserts that the project has undergone rigorous scientific evaluation and will not adversely affect the ecological environment, geological stability, or water resource rights of downstream countries. Beijing has also emphasised that it will not try to benefit at the “expense of its neighbours”, South China Morning Post reported.
The dam has reportedly prompted India to speed up its own hydropower projects on the Brahmaputra in Arunachal Pradesh to assert water resource rights, the Hong Kong-based daily added.
 
 

China’s CSI Construction and Engineering Index jumped as much as 4 per cent to a seven-month high. Power Construction Corporation of China and Arcplus Group surged by their 10pc daily limit.
“From an investment perspective, mature hydropower projects offer bond-like dividends,” Wang Zhuo, partner of Shanghai Zhuozhu Investment Management, said, while cautioning that speculative buying into related stocks would inflate valuations.
The project will drive demand for construction and building materials such as cement and civil explosives, Huatai Securities said in a note to clients.
Shares of Beijing-listed Hunan Wuxin Tunnel Intelligent Equipment Co, which sells tunnel construction equipment, surged 30pc. So did shares of Geokang Technologies Co Ltd, which makes intelligent monitoring terminals.
Cement maker Xizang Tianlu Co Ltd and Tibet GaoZheng Explosive Co, producer of civil explosive materials, both jumped their maximum by 10pc.
Broader impact
The Chinese premier described the dam as a “project of the century” and said special emphasis “must be placed on ecological conservation to prevent environmental damage,” Xinhua said on Saturday.
Government bond yields rose across the board on Monday, with the most-traded 30-year treasury futures CTLU5 falling to five-week lows, as investors interpreted the news as part of China’s economic stimulus.
The project, overseen by the newly formed state-owned China Yajiang Group, marks a major boost in public investment to help bolster economic growth as current drivers show signs of faltering.
“Assuming 10 years of construction, the investment/GDP boost could reach 120 billion yuan ($16.7 billion) for a single year,” said Citi in a note. “The actual economic benefits could go beyond that.”
China has not given an estimate on the number of jobs the project could create.
The Three Gorges, which took almost two decades to complete, generated nearly a million jobs, state media reported, though it displaced at least a similar number of people.
 
 

Authorities have not indicated how many people would be displaced by the Yarlung Zangbo project.
The Yarlung Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra River as it leaves Tibet and flows south into India and finally into Bangladesh. NGOs claim that the dam will irreversibly harm the Tibetan Plateau and hit millions of people downstream.
The chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Pema Khandu, said earlier this year that such a colossal dam barely 50km from the border could dry out 80pc of the river passing through the Indian state while potentially inundating downstream areas in Arunachal and neighbouring Assam state.
Some experts also express concerns for a project in a seismically active zone.</p><small>2025-07-21 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615071-court-orders-arresting-cm-gandapur-in-weapons-liquor-recovery-case' target='_blank'><strong>Court orders arresting CM Gandapur in weapons, liquor recovery case</strong></a><br><p>

“The Pakistan Sports Board has declared age fraud a violation under the Pakistan Code of Ethics and Governance in Sports and any such act is liable to sanctions,” read  a notification issued by the PSB, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
“Globally, age fraud in sports, especially in junior categories, poses a serious threat to fair competition, athlete safety, and the integrity of sporting structures,” the notification added.
The PSB said that youth sports worldwide are classified on the basis of chronological age to ensure equal opportunity and fair play, adding, “It is suspected that athletes are participating in age-restricted competitions with falsified or inaccurate age documentation.”
The PSB continued that all athletes under the age of 21 participating in junior events must now submit either a national identity card (CNIC) or a B-Form, along with names of the selection committee members, dental examinations, and radiological tests.
In addition, medical reports verified by the president and secretary general of the respective sports federation, along with all supporting documents, must be submitted to the PSB for verification.
The notification stated that any athlete found submitting fake or suspicious documents will be declared ineligible for participation in training camps, financial assistance, or cash awards. Further disciplinary action might also be taken.
The notification pointed out that some athletes allegedly participate in age-specific categories using forged documents, depriving genuine athletes of opportunities and increasing the risk of injuries due to physical mismatches.
The PSB further noted that the International Olympics Committee (IOC) and other global sports bodies have repeatedly stressed the need for transparency and integrity in sports, calling for a zero-tolerance approach to age falsification.
“Only athletes who submit verified and accurate documentation will now be eligible to participate in PSB training camps and receive financial support or cash awards,” the notification concluded.
Earlier this month, the PSB took serious notice of officials in various sports federations holding positions beyond the permissible two terms, in violation of the National Sports Policy 2005.
The PSB issued warning letters to nine office-bearers from different federations who have exceeded the allowed tenure limits, according to a press release issued by the Board.
In May, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah announced that Karachi would host the 35th National Games from December 6 to 13 after it was postponed from its initial dates in May.

Haider said that during the shooting, two children who were passing by were also injured.  “The children were identified as residents of Shekhanu Kaly, Lower Dir,” he said.
A press release by the district police said that the two suspects had been taken into custody, and a case had been registered against them for further investigation.
“An investigation is underway so that all aspects of the incident can be fully exposed.”
Haider said that the injured were moved to the Mayar Hospital for medical assistance and a first information report (FIR) was registered at the police station.
“The Lower Dir DPO (district police officer) appreciated the timely and successful action of the police team and made it clear that the Lower Dir police is always on alert to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the citizens,” the press release added.
Domestic disputes are common in Pakistan, often triggered by financial issues, inheritance, or family interference. In some cases, these escalate due to a lack of conflict resolution mechanisms, weak legal enforcement, and deeply rooted patriarchal norms.
Earlier this month, four members of a woman’s family were shot dead in the Tatara area of KP’s Nowshera district, allegedly by her husband and in-laws over a domestic dispute, according to police.
Also this month, a man allegedly killed his son and daughter-in-law following an argument in the Tangi area of Charsadda district.</p><small>2025-07-21 10:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2114300397b5441.jpg?r=143157' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925632/iran-accuses-europeans-of-not-respecting-2015-nuclear-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Iran accuses Europeans of not respecting 2015 nuclear deal</strong></a><br><p>Tehran on Monday accused Britain, France and Germany of failing to respect the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, after they threatened to reimpose sanctions over its atomic programme.
The 2015 deal, reached between Iran and the UN Security Council’s permanent members — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — plus Germany imposed curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
But it unravelled when the United States in 2018, during Donald Trump’s first term as president, unilaterally withdrew from the accord and reimposed sweeping sanctions.
The Europeans had pledged continued support for the deal, but the mechanism intended to offset US sanctions never materialised effectively, and many Western firms were forced to exit Iran, which has since faced a deepening economic crisis.
“The European parties have been at fault and negligent in implementing” the nuclear agreement, said Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei.
The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed country currently enriching uranium to 60 per cent — far beyond the 3.67pc cap set by the 2015 accord.
That is a short step from the 90pc required for a nuclear weapon.
In recent weeks, France, Britain, and Germany have threatened to trigger the UN snapback mechanism to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, accusing Iran of breaching its nuclear commitments.
Using this clause “is meaningless, unjustifiable and immoral”, Baqaei told a news conference, arguing that Iran only began distancing itself from the agreement in response to Western non-compliance.
“Iran’s reduction of its commitments was carried out in accordance with the provisions outlined in the agreement,” the foreign ministry spokesman added.</p><small>2025-07-21 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/21123139d547928.png?r=134052' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925622/fm-dar-in-new-york-to-attend-high-level-unsc-events-including-conference-on-palestine-fo' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar in New York to attend high-level UNSC events, including conference on Palestine: FO</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has arrived in New York to attend high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency, including a conference on Palestine, according to the Foreign Office.
Pakistan assumed the UNSC Presidency for the month of July 2025, making it the country’s eighth term on the Security Council as a non-permanent member. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026. The presidency involves a focus on multilateralism, peaceful dispute resolution, and regional cooperation.
“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar,
arrived in New York for an official visit from 21 to 28 July 2025,” the FO announced in a post on X.
“During the visit, he will lead high-level signature events under Pakistan’s Presidency of the UN Security Council, hold bilateral and multilateral meetings in New York and Washington, DC, and represent Pakistan at the International Conference on the two-state solution, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France.”
 






It added that upon his arrival, FM Dar was received by Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar, and the Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh.
According to a July 19 statement issued by the FO, Dar will attend a high-level conference on the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution”, to express Pakistan’s strong commitment and unwavering support for the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.
The conference was originally planned for June but was postponed due to the Iran-Israel war, which also led to the rescheduling of Dar’s visit. According to The Guardian, the moot will now be held on July 28 and 29.
Since October 8, Israeli strikes have killed more than 58,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Earlier this month, Pakistan urged the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Aside from the Palestine conference, Dar is also set to chair a high-level briefing of the UNSC, focused on enhancing cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
“The meeting is being held as part of Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen collaboration between the OIC and the UN for maintenance of international peace and security,” the FO statement said.
Dar is expected to have several other bilateral engagements with his counterparts, as well as senior UN officials, during his stay. He will also meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on July 25.</p><small>2025-07-21 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/211314098c87a06.jpg?r=131452' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925627/evidence-shows-jeju-air-pilots-shut-off-less-damaged-engine-before-crash-source-says' target='_blank'><strong>Evidence shows Jeju Air pilots shut off less-damaged engine before crash, source says</strong></a><br><p>The South Korea-led investigation into Jeju Air’s fatal plane crash in December has “clear evidence” that pilots shut off the less-damaged engine after a bird strike, a source with knowledge of the probe said on Monday.
The source said the evidence, including the cockpit voice recorder, computer data and a physical engine switch found in the wreckage showed pilots shut off the left engine instead of the right engine when taking emergency steps after a bird strike just before it was scheduled to land.
“The investigation team has clear evidence and backup data, so its finding will not change,” the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity because investigators have not released an official report including this evidence.
A government source said examinations of the plane’s recovered engines found that no defects had been present before the bird strike and crash.
The December 29 crash of the Boeing 737-800 jet at Muan Airport killed all but two of the 181 passengers and crew members on board and was the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil.
Investigators told victims’ family members at a briefing on Saturday that the right engine had been more severely damaged by a bird strike than the left, and there was circumstantial evidence that pilots had turned off the less-damaged left engine, according to a third source who was at the briefing.
South Korean media outlets including MBN and Yonhap reported that information on Saturday and Sunday.
South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB), which is leading the investigation, did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Boeing referred questions about the crash to ARAIB. Engine maker CFM International, a joint venture between GE GE.N and France’s Safran, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Jeju Air said it was actively cooperating with the ARAIB’s investigation and awaiting the official announcement of the results.
Most air crashes are caused by multiple factors, and under international rules, a final report is expected within a year of an accident.
A preliminary report released in January said duck remains were found in both engines of the Jeju Air plane after the flight from Bangkok crashed at Muan Airport, but did not give details about the extent of remains or damage found in each engine.
Objections from victims’ families
South Korea’s investigation body on Saturday cancelled a planned release to media of an update on what is known so far about the engines.
Families of the crash victims were briefed on the report ahead of its planned release, but objected to its publication, saying that it appeared to apportion blame to the pilots without exploring other contributing factors, lawyers representing the families said.
The Jeju Air flight overshot Muan Airport’s runway as it made an emergency belly landing and crashed into an embankment containing navigation equipment, leading to a fire and partial explosion.
Representatives of victims’ families and the Jeju Air pilots’ union said over the weekend that the investigation needs to also focus on the embankment, which aviation experts have said likely contributed to the high death toll.
 
 

The Jeju Air pilots’ union said the ARAIB was “misleading the public” by suggesting there was no problem with the left engine given traces of bird remains were found in both engines.
The union accused the ARAIB of trying to make pilots “scapegoats” by failing to provide scientific and technological grounds that the plane could have landed safely with only the left engine turned on.
Air accidents are complex incidents that occur due to a number of contributing factors, and investigators have not produced evidence so far to support the implication that the accident was a result of pilot error, the union said.
Investigators are so far “silent about organisational responsibility”, the union said.
A body representing bereaved families said in a statement there were some phrases related to the cause of the accident in the planned press release that could be interpreted as if a final conclusion had been reached, and all facts surrounding the incident must be clarified.</p><small>2025-07-21 10:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615050-us-renewed-interest-in-pakistan-has-india-recalibrating-china-ties' target='_blank'><strong>US renewed interest in Pakistan has India recalibrating China ties</strong></a><br><p>

Most were forced into exile when the Taliban regained power in 2021 and then effectively outlawed women from playing sport.
Many fled to Australia and held a match — without their official crest — in Melbourne earlier this year.
The ICC’s annual conference in Singapore at the weekend heard that progress had been made on the governing body’s Afghanistan women’s cricket initiative.
“The programme aims to deliver structured support,” the ICC said in a statement late Sunday.
It includes “domestic playing opportunities, and engagement at key ICC global events, including the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 in India and the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2026 in England,” the statement continued, without giving details.
But reports said it will enable Afghanistan players the chance to speak to fellow international cricketers and attend workshops conducted by coaches at the global showpieces.

Erwin Labitad Segovia, 63, a broadcaster for Radio WOW FM and host of a programme that focused on social issues and local governance, was shot dead by a still-unidentified gunman while on his way home shortly after completing his morning broadcast.
According to the police, Segovia was followed by two suspects on a motorcycle.
The Philippines ranked ninth on the 2024 Committee to Protect Journalists’ Global Impunity Index, which tracks countries where journalist murders remain unsolved.
Authorities have launched an investigation and have activated a special investigation task group to handle the case, Jose Torres Jr, executive director of the presidential task force on media security, said in a statement.
“The safety of journalists remains a priority for the government, and justice for victims of media-related violence continues to be a national concern,” Torres said.
Segovia’s murder highlights the continuing risks faced by journalists in the Philippines, especially in provinces where local power dynamics often go unchecked.
More than 200 journalists have been killed in the country since democracy was restored in 1986, according to the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, including 32 in a single incident in 2009 in the south of the country.</p><small>2025-07-21 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615023-ihc-issues-contempt-notice-to-federal-cabinet-in-dr-aafia-siddiqui-case' target='_blank'><strong>IHC issues contempt notice to PM, federal cabinet members in Dr Aafia Siddiqui case</strong></a><br><p>

The accused reportedly suspected the couple of having illicit relations, which he claimed brought disgrace to the family.
A minor daughter of the couple was also injured in the firing.
Upon receiving information, police reached the scene and shifted the bodies to the hospital for medico-legal formalities.
 
 

SHO Mayar police station confirmed the incident and said efforts were underway to arrest the suspect, who fled the scene after the crime.
He said a case had been registered and further investigation was in progress.
The gruesome incident has sparked fear and concern among the local community, as such honour-related crimes continue to plague the region.

Hyderabad received a second brief spell of monsoon rains in early hours of Sunday causing flooding of most major arteries. The rain started at around 6:15am and continued till 6:40am.
According to meteorological office, 18.6mm and 21.8mm of rainfall was recorded at its airport and city observatories, respectively.
The busy areas like Cloth Market, Fatima Jinnah Road, Makki Shah, Railway Station, low-lying lanes of Qasimabad, Wahdat Colony, Hussainabad and Latifabad were inundated. Most areas within the Hyderabad city were hit by drainage issue because of choked storm water drains that have not been de-silted for long. As many as 55 feeders of the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) tripped amid the rain on Sunday, a spokesman for the utility said. These feeders were gradually re-energised, he added.

Two women, teenage boy electrocuted; seven-year-old drowns in pond

Most parts of Larkana and Qambar-Shahdadkot districts received several heavy and light spells of rain on Saturday night and Sunday.
Officials at the local Met office told Dawn that Larkana received 93.5mm and Mohenjo Daro 86mm of rain.
Two women, Razia Mugheri, 40, a resident of Yar Mohammed Colony, and Kaveeta Chachar, 22, a resident of Islam Chachar village, were electrocuted during rainfall.
They received fatal electrical shock while trying to switch on the water motor at their respective homes.
Sukkur, Jacobabad, Kandhkot-Kashmore, and Khairpur districts of upper Sindh also received several spells of moderate rain that had started on late Saturday and continued till Sunday evening.
A 13-year-old boy, Imdad Ali Sarki, was electrocuted when he touched an electricity pole outside his home in the Garhi Sabayo area of Jacobabad. The area falls within the limits of the Saddar police station.
His family members rushed him to the Jacobabad Civil Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.
Two young brothers, Rashid Ali and Abu Bakar, belonging to the Khoso tribe, drowned while bathing in a canal along Khuda Bakhsh Noorani village in Thull taluka of Jacobabad district.
A hectic search was mounted by their family after they went missing. Finally, their bodies were seen floating in the canal.
Separately, a seven-year-old boy, Misbah, drowned in a pond of rainwater while playing outside his home in the city.
Strong winds sweeping the entire upper Sindh region before and during the rainfall caused hours-long power outages and badly disrupted telecommunication network across the region.
The rains also caused flooding in urban and rural areas creating deep ponds of rainwater and sewage blocking people’s access to their homes as well as vital installations such as railway stations, bust stands, hospitals and workplaces. Drainage system in all cities and towns turned dysfunctional.
The roof of a vegetable shop owned by the Khairpur municipality and allotted to a tenant collapsed during the rainfall. No one was injured in the incident.
Jacobabad received a brief spell of downpour at about 3pm on Sunday.
Mirpurkhas district and its outskirts received intermittent showers leading to inundation of highway, main roads, streets and low-lying areas on Sunday.
Rainwater remained accumulated as the municipality failed to make any arrangement for draining it out.
In some low-lying areas, knee-deep water mixed with sewage was witnessed. The areas worst-hit by flooding and foul smell included Lalchandabad, Toorabad, Dholanabad, M.A. Jinnah Road, Station Road, Hameed Pura Colony, Hirabad, Nai Para, Bhansinghabad, Ismail Shah graveyard and colony, Panhwer Colony, Rajar Colony and Pak Colony.
Most areas of Mirpurkhas district also experienced prolonged power outages during the rainfall.

Passengers jumped overboard with lifejackets after the fire broke out on Sunday at the stern of the KM Barcelona 5, as it sailed to Manado, according to the Indonesian coast guard.
A video released by the Manado rescue agency showed a coast guard vessel spraying water on the ferry, which was emitting black smoke.
Indonesian authorities previously reported five people died in the accident, but later revised the death toll to three.
“Until now, the joint rescue team is still conducting the search and rescue operation because the data is still developing,” Manado rescue agency head George Leo Mercy Randang told AFP on Monday.
“Our post is still open 24 hours a day, in case families want to report about their missing relative.” At least 568 people were rescued from the ferry and water while three others were found dead, the national search and rescue agency said in a statement Monday.
 
 

The ferry’s log had only registered 280 passengers and 15 crew on board.
Local media reported that the ship had a capacity for 600 people.
Marine accidents are a regular occurrence in the Southeast Asian archipelago of around 17,000 islands, in part due to lax safety standards or bad weather.
Sunday’s fire came just weeks after another ferry sank off the popular resort island of Bali due to bad weather, killing at least 19 people.
In March, a boat carrying 16 people capsized in rough waters off Bali, killing an Australian woman and injuring at least one other person.
And in 2018, more than 150 people drowned when a ferry sank in one of the world’s deepest lakes on Sumatra Island.</p><small>2025-07-21 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/211007267323854.png?r=100801' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925607/alaska-airlines-requests-grounding-of-fleet-citing-it-outage' target='_blank'><strong>Alaska Airlines requests grounding of fleet citing ‘IT outage’</strong></a><br><p>Alaska Airlines has requested a ground stop for all its mainline aircraft according to an advisory notice by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with the company citing an “IT outage.”
The airline told AFP that on Sunday it “experienced an IT outage that’s impacting our operations” and that it “requested a temporary, system-wide ground stop for Alaska and Horizon Air flights until the issue is resolved.”
The FAA status page showed all destinations being impacted by the ground stop of Alaska’s mainline aircraft.
It did not immediately respond to AFP’s requests for comment.
The incident comes more than a year after a door plug section of a newly delivered Boeing 737 Max 9 blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight between Portland, Oregon and Ontario, California in January last year.
The 171 passengers and six crew members survived the rapid decompression, but the incident focused minds at the FAA, which grounded many Boeing 737-9 aircraft operated by US airlines.
Last month, US investigators said Boeing’s failure to provide adequate training to manufacturing staff was a driving factor in the near-catastrophic Alaska Airlines mid-flight blowout.</p><small>2025-07-21 05:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614996-all-set-for-senate-polls-in-kp-as-four-pti-dissenters-pull-out-of-race' target='_blank'><strong>PTI's KP govt secures six out of 11 Senate seats up for grabs</strong></a><br><p>

As of Sunday night, six PTI nominees and five opposition picks were in the running in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for the upper house of parliament. Late-night reports suggested that two more ‘disgruntled’ PTI candidates pulled out of the race hours after the exit of Mohammad Waqas Orak­zai and Syed Irshad Hus­sain. Khurram Zee­shan was the only disgruntled PTI member, till the filing of this report in the wee hours of Monday morning, vying for a general seat.
Proportional representation
Unlike the general elections, the ‘first past the post’ system (where the person receiving the highest number of votes is declared the winner) is not employed here.
Instead, the ‘single transferable vote’ system of proportional representation is used.
Under this system, voters cast a single ballot, which mentions all the candidates they would like to see elected, in order of their personal priority or preference (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on).
 
 

Each of these votes has a value. A quota calculated by the ECP determines how many votes each candidate needs to be considered elected.
The votes received by each candidate are tallied in each count. When a candidate receives enough votes to cross the quota, the extra value of his or her votes is transferred down to lower priority candidates (in the order mentioned by the voters).
The candidates who receive the fewest votes are eliminated and their votes are transferred to other candidates in the order of preference.
The process of transferring votes from successful and eliminated candidates continues until all vacant seats are filled.
How many votes needed?
Theoretically, for the KP Assembly — which has a total of 145 seats — a candidate for one of seven general seats requires at least 21 votes to succeed (calculated by dividing the total number of seats in the KP Assembly by the number of vacant seats being contested).
For each of the women’s and technocrat seats, this number is 72.

• Medium to high-level flow expected in rivers from tomorrow
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Authorities are bracing for another spell of rain and thunderstorms, which are expected to hit many parts of the country from today (Monday).
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the Malakand and Hazara divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the southern parts of Punjab and Sindh, eastern Balochistan and parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) are likely to receive rain and thunderstorms with strong winds.
According to the PMD’s detailed national forecast, Islamabad may receive rain and thunderstorms at night.
In KP, while most districts will stay hot and humid, scattered rain with thunderstorms and gusty winds are expected in Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Kurram, and Waziristan.
Rain and thunderstorms are forecast for urban centres of Punjab in the south, such as Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan, though overall weather of the province will remain partly cloudy and humid.
Later at night, the rain spell is expected to reach Rawal­pindi, Murree, Gali­yat, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Narowal and Lahore.
In Sindh, where the moderate to heavy rain has alre­ady been reported from some parts, several areas are bracing for more precipitation.
The PMD said Mir­purkhas, Mithi, Tharparkar, Badin, Sujawal, Umerkot, Chhachhro, Padidan, Khair­pur, Karachi, Thatta, Ghotki, Chhor, Sukkur, Kashmore, Shikar­pur, Jacobabad, Larkana, Naushahro Feroze, Sanghar, Dadu, Hyderabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Matiari, and Shaheed Benazirabad are all expected to receive rain and thunderstorms, with heavy downpours likely in some areas.
 
 

In Balochistan, while most regions will remain hot and humid, the forecast includes rain and thunderstorms for Barkhan, Sibi, Kohlu, Musakhel, Killa Saifullah, Loralai, Dera Bugti, Nasirabad, Zhob, Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, and Lasbela.
For Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, partly cloudy weather with rain and thunderstorms is expected, and heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places in Kashmir.
Rivers in high flood
A separate alert from the country’s  Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) echoed the warning, saying that  “moderate to strong monsoon activity is likely to start” over the upper catchments of those same rivers after 36 hours.
The division specifically predicted a medium to high-level flow in the Chenab and  Jhelum rivers, along with their associated nullahs and those of the Ravi river, from July 22 to 24.
The Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Sunday released grim statistics, confirming 135 fatalities and 478 injuries across the province from monsoon-related incidents this year.
The casualties included 99 deaths from building collapses, 19 from drowning, 12 from electrocution and five from lightning strikes.
In response to the dire forecast, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed all district administrations to remain on high alert for what he termed a “dual threat.”
“We are facing dual threats of urban flooding in cities and flash floods in riverine areas,” Mr Kathia said, warning that heavy precipitation in upper catchment areas could cause dangerous water level rises in the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, Jhelum, and Indus rivers between July 22 to 24.
The Punjab government has also activated its compensation policy, providing financial assistance ranging from Rs 1m to Rs 5m to the families of those who lost loved ones.

Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court had been upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in 2023.
In May, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302B (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). After the ruling by the apex court, a presidential pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution could possibly provide Zahir pardon, or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.
According to the letters, which are addressed to the hospital director at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) from the superintendent at Adiala Jail, Zahir requires an opinion from a medical or psychiatric board before submitting a presidential mercy petition.
“The appeal of above mentioned Confirmed Condemned Prisoner (Zahir) was pending at [the] Supreme Court of Pakistan and the same has been dismissed,” the letter, dated July 8, read.
“Now the mercy petition of [the] subject cited Confirmed Condemned Prisoner has to be submitted before the Honourable President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. For that, the medical board and psychiatric board opinion is mandatory.”
The letter requested that a time and date be chosen for the medical and psychiatric boards to come to Adiala and examine Zahir.
The superintendent made the same request in another letter dated July 14.
 
 

In response to the first letter, Pims stated in a document seen by Dawn.com that Dr Shafqat Nawaz from the psychiatry department and Dr Amir Naveed from the neurology department will comprise the medical board.
Zahir was not only convicted of the murder, but was also sentenced to 25 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs200,000 under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the PPC.
In October last year, Noor’s father had urged the apex court to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years.</p><small>2025-07-20 19:11</small></div><hr>
