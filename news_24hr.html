Launched in 2019 at the Islamabad airport and later extended to Karachi, the Road to Makkah initiative offers an exemption to Haj pilgrims from the immigration process at Saudi airports by clearing them at their respective airports in Pakistan by Saudi immigration officials before boarding their flights.
Marking the second phase of the initiative, the passengers were received at the airport by Minister of Religious Affairs & Interfaith Harmony Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah Khalid Majid, DG Hajj Abdul Wahab Soomro and the senior officers of the Consulate General of Pakistan. The pilgrims were presented bouqets by the receiving party.
This year, an estimated 50,500 Haj pilgrims will travel to Saudi Arabia under the initiative, with 28,000 departing from Islamabad and 22,500 from Karachi throughout 180 flights, out of which 100 will depart from Islamabad and 80 from Karachi.
Housing and other essential facilities have been arranged for all the pilgrims, including service personnel such as medical staff and officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, to facilitate the Haj pilgrims.
In April, a Saudi immigration team arrived in the country to process Pakistani Haj pilgrims at Jinnah International Airport and Islamabad International Airport.
In 2025, Pakistan’s Haj quota was set at 179,210, with half of the quota meant to be managed by private Haj operators. However, only 23,000 people were able to go under private operators.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-05-15 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/151352505a50cf7.jpg?r=135314' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911193/trump-says-us-close-to-a-nuclear-deal-with-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says US close to a nuclear deal with Iran</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms.
“We’re in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace,” Trump said on a tour of the Gulf, according to a shared pool report by AFP.
“We’re getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this … there [are] two steps to doing this, there is a very, very nice step and there is the violent step, but I don’t want to do it the second way,” he said.
An Iranian source familiar with the negotiations said there were still gaps to bridge in the talks with the United States.
Fresh talks between Iranian and US negotiators to resolve disputes over Tehran’s nuclear programme ended in Oman on Sunday with further negotiations planned, officials said, as Tehran publicly insisted on continuing its uranium enrichment.
Though Tehran and Washington have both said they prefer diplomacy to resolve the decades-long nuclear dispute, they remain divided on several red lines that negotiators will have to circumvent to reach a new deal and avert future military action.
Iran’s president reacted to Trump’s comments on Tuesday, calling Tehran the “most destructive force” in the Middle East.
“Trump thinks he can sanction and threaten us and then talk of human rights. All the crimes and regional instability are caused by them (the United States),” Masoud Pezeshkian said.
“He wants to create instability inside Iran.”
US officials have publicly stated that Iran should halt uranium enrichment, a stance Iranian officials have called a “red line” asserting they will not give up what they view as their right to enrich uranium on Iranian soil.
However, they have indicated a willingness to reduce the level of enrichment.
Iranian officials have also expressed readiness to reduce the amount of highly enriched uranium in storage — uranium enriched beyond the levels typically needed for civilian purposes, such as nuclear power generation.
However, they have said it would not accept lower stockpiles than the amount agreed in a deal with world powers in 2015 — the deal Trump quit.
The Iranian source said that while Iran is prepared to offer what it considers concessions, the “issue is that America is not willing to lift major sanctions in exchange”.
 
 

Western sanctions have severely impacted the Iranian economy.
Regarding the reduction of enriched uranium in storage, the source noted: “Tehran also wants it removed in several stages, which America doesn’t agree with either.”
There is also disagreement over the destination to which the highly enriched uranium would be sent, the source added.</p><small>2025-05-15 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604564-pakistan-india-dgmos-hold-third-hotline-contact-after-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India DGMOs 'hold third hotline contact' after ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>

• Petroleum division mulls GST on oil products
ISLAMABAD: For a third time in two months, the government is considering imposing additional costs — this time at the rate of Rs4.12 per litre — on the prices of petroleum products, a move that may deprive consumers of potential relief in prices due to be announced for the next fortnight today (Thursday).
This has been proposed by the petroleum division to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet. The impact of Rs4.12 per unit works out to be around Rs75 billion on an annual basis to be paid to oil marketing companies (OMCs), refineries and retail dealers to meet their demands.
On top of this, the petroleum division has also recommended imposition of general sales tax on petroleum products at the rate of Rs3-5 per litre from July 1, through the finance bill 2025-26.
Without these proposed measures, the prices of petrol and diesel were estimated to decline by about Rs3.5 and Rs7 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight starting May 15, owing to decline in the international market and a slight ease in import premium on petrol. Over the last two months, the government has disallowed about Rs18 per litre potential reduction in petroleum prices to discourage rise in petroleum consumption.
 
 

This was done through increase in petroleum levy, including through a special presidential ordinance, to divert funds for higher subsidy on electricity rates and construction of highways and motorways in Balochistan and Sindh.
According to a summary sent to the ECC, the petroleum division has proposed a Rs1.87 per litre allowance through changes in the pool of inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) to satisfy OMCs and refineries with an estimated financial impact of Rs34bn. In addition, the division has proposed an increase in sale margins to the OMCs at the rate of Rs1.13 and Rs1.12 per litre for petroleum dealers from their existing rates of about Rs8 and Rs8.64 per litre.
On the annual basis, the additional financial impact of the increase in margins is estimated to be more than Rs40bn depending on sales volume.
The division argued that petroleum products (petrol, high speed diesel, kerosene and light diesel oil) had been classified as “exempted” under Finance Act 2024-25. Resultantly, the input sales tax became cost of refineries and OMCs (Rs34bn for FY2024-25) which could not be recovered through the product prices as the petroleum products rates were regulated by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
Strangely, the division claimed that petroleum prices were “being fixed by Ogra under GoP Policy”. It is, however, a matter of record that actually calculations made by Ogra are forwarded by the division to the ministry of finance which itself moves a summary to the prime minister for approval every fortnight.
The major price cuts are then anno­unced by the prime minister himself or his office, otherwise price revisions are announced by the ministry of finance.
 
 

The petroleum division also said a draft proposal to levy 3-5pc sales tax on petrol and HSD was developed in consultation with the oil industry, finance ministry and Federal Board of Revenue which could “not be implemented due to non-agreement with IMF to allow these products be taxed at reduced rates of GST”.
On the other hand, the petrol and diesel price increase due to standard rate of 18pc GST would be around Rs45 per litre, which was not desirable. Any amendment to the sales tax rate will require consultation with IMF and parliament’s approval.
Supply chain
Besides the sales tax issue, OMCs and dealers have requested for enhancement of their margins on petrol and HSD. Ogra has recommended an increase of OMCs and petroleum dealers’ margin by Rs1.13 and Rs1.40/litre, respectively, to ensure sustainability of the supply chain.
However, with partial amendment the summary proposed Rs1.13 per litre additional benefit to OMCs and Rs1.12 per litre to dealers. It said that since petroleum products were exempted from sales tax during current financial year, the refineries and OMCs’ unadjusted sales tax during July 2024-June 2025 on these products may be compensated through IFEM (estimated at Rs34bn).
“For FY2025-26, 3-5pc sales tax on these products may be imposed through Finance Act. However, in case the products remain exempted from sales tax in the FY 2025-26, the unadjusted sales tax may continue to be compensated through IFEM as a fallback option to keep the oil supply chain sustainable,” the petroleum division insisted.

HRW said that “scores of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia die in gruesome yet avoidable workplace-related accidents, including falling from buildings, electrocution, and even decapitation”.
The NGO, which has studied nearly 50 cases of deaths in Saudi Arabia, said Saudi authorities had  “failed to adequately protect workers from preventable deaths, investigate workplace safety incidents, and ensure timely and adequate compensation for families” including through life insurance policies and benefits to survivors.
“The risks of occupational deaths and injuries are further increasing as the Saudi government ramps up construction work for the 2034 World Cup as well as other ‘giga-projects’,” HRW added.
 
 

The Gulf kingdom was handed the right to host the 2034 World Cup at a FIFA Congress last December despite concerns about its human rights record, the risks to migrant labourers and criminalisation of same-sex relationships. It was the only candidate.
The NGO called on FIFA to ensure all work-related deaths in Saudi Arabia are properly investigated and that bereaved families receive compensation.
FIFA has committed to establishing a workers’ welfare system, which it says includes  “dedicated mandatory standards and enforcement mechanisms applicable to all companies and workers involved in… World Cup-related construction and service delivery” in Saudi Arabia.
But HRW said football’s world governing body did not provide  “details on concrete measures to prevent, investigate, and compensate migrant worker deaths such as risk-based heat protection measures or life insurance”.
The NGO claimed  “FIFA is knowingly risking yet another tournament that will unnecessarily come at a grave human cost”, referencing the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
Similar concerns over workers’ welfare dogged Qatar ahead of its hosting of international football’s showpiece tournament.
Amnesty International and other rights groups claimed thousands of migrant workers died in the lead-up to the 2022 tournament, though Doha has said only 37 workers on World Cup projects perished — and only three in work-related accidents.
HRW stated in its report that the majority of migrant worker deaths in Saudi Arabia are attributed to  “natural causes” and are therefore neither investigated nor compensated.
According to figures provided by the NGO, for example, 74 percent of 1,420 Indian migrant worker deaths recorded at the Indian embassy in Riyadh in 2023 were attributed to natural causes.
HRW added  “even work-related death cases categorised as such in a migrant worker’s death certificate are sometimes not compensated as they should be according to Saudi law and international labour standards”.
“In migrant death cases that are compensated, the process is long and burdensome,” the report said, providing an example of one such compensation process that took a decade to be completed.
“My sons are 11 and 13 years old. When my husband died, they were 11 months and two years old. If we had received compensation right after his death, it would have provided so much relief,” the wife of a deceased worker, who was not named, told HRW.
In response to the report, FIFA shared with AFP a letter it sent last month to HRW from its secretary general Mattias Grafstrom.
The letter says Saudi Arabia has  “in the past years been investing heavily in the development of its society and economy”, using international companies.
Grafstrom notes that Saudi Arabia  “has taken significant steps to reform its labour laws since 2018”, including the abolition of parts of the kafala system which ties workers to their employers, and introducing standardised contracts for workers.
The Saudi government, he says, has also committed to working with the United Nations’ International Labour Organization (ILO)  “on the further expansion and effective implementation of these reforms”.
“In line with its human rights commitments, FIFA seeks to play its part in ensuring strong protections for workers employed by third parties in the construction of FIFA World Cup sites,” Grafstrom adds.
AFP has also contacted the Saudi government for comment.

This information was placed before the National Assembly by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday in a written reply to a question asked by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA Sehar Kamran.
The official data provided by the minister shows that a total of 5,402 Pakistanis have been deported from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since January 2024. As many as 4,850 Pakistani nationals faced deportation from these countries in the year 2024 whereas 552 have returned to Pakistan this year.
The questioner has sought data of the last three years, but the minister provided details of the period starting from January 2024.

Another 369 individuals caught begging in five other countries; nearly 52pc deportees belong to Sindh; Pakistan has expelled over one million illegal Afghans

 
 

Interestingly, the province-wise break-up of the data shows that most of those deported from these countries belong to Sindh province. A total of 2,795 people from the province are among those deported from these countries on begging charges whereas the number of such people belonging to Punjab stands at 1,437.
According to statistics, as many as 1,002 people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 125 from Balochistan, 33 from Azad Kashmir and 10 from Islamabad are among those deported from the six countries.
After Saudi Arabia, the highest number of 247 Pakistanis has been repatriated from Iraq. The UAE, which raised the issue with the Pakistan government more vigorously and imposed strict restrictions on visas for the Pakistani nationals, has so far deported 58 such individuals during this period.
Afghan Refugees
In response to another question asked by Anjum Aqeel Khan of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the interior minister informed the National Assembly that over one million “illegal Afghans”, including those possessing Afghan Citizen Card (ACC), had been repatriated since November 2023 under the Illegal Foreigner’s Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
“The IFRP has been approved by the federal government. Every sovereign state retains the right to deport illegal foreigners in order to safeguard its borders and national security.
Furthermore, there are no international legal implications for Pakistan, as it is not a signatory to the 1951 UNHCR Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol with respect to Afghan repatriation,“ says the minister in his written reply. He said Pakistan did not intend to extend the duration of ACC holders for further period.
He further said that 1.377 million Afghan refugees, holding POR (Proof of Registration) had been repatriated to Afghanistan through the UNHCR repatriation programme since 2007.
He said there were 813,146 Afghans with ACC and 1.304m POR holders in Pakistan at present.

However, the current PMDC management has distanced itself from the allegations, asserting that any wrongdoing occurred in the past and that new checks and balances have now been introduced.
“It is learnt that there is an organised system of corruption prevalent in PMDC primarily due to excessive discretionary powers and a lack of transparency,” the report stated. “A perception persists that heavy bribe is a norm for recognition of private medical and dental colleges as well as their affiliated teaching hospitals and for their inspections.”
The report further alleged, “Repor­tedly, private medical colleges pay approximately Rs10 million per seat for the allocation of additional student seats. Another avenue for corruption is the recognition of medical journals.”
 
 

The document claimed a probe revealed the “incapacity and inefficiency” of the now-defunct Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) during Bahawalpur Medical College’s (BMC) recognition process and its subsequent withdrawal.
“The recognition of BMC, followed by its abrupt withdrawal, highlights severe lapses in PMC’s regulatory framework. BMC was initially granted recognition based on incomplete documentation and without the mandatory inspection, reportedly in exchange for a bribe,” the report stated.
According to the IB, “Usually, eight-member inspection teams are formed to inspect medical colleges. However, in the case of BMC, only a two-member team was constituted, which actually did not visit the college premises and only signed the pre-drafted inspection report, which led to BMC’s recognition without meeting the required criteria.”
The report added, “Pertinent to mention that multiple investors were initially involved in establishing BMC. However, some of them left after developing differences due to delays in its recognition and operation. Reportedly, one of them filed a complaint against recognition of BMC, which led to the suspension/withdrawal of recognition by PMC.”
“In this regard, overall management of a defunct PMC was responsible for mishandling the issue,” the report alleged. The BMC is no longer functional, as its registration was withdrawn by the federal government last year, and its students were distributed among other medical colleges.

ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill granted the permission to the prosecution accepting its written application, which was opposed by the lawyer of the former prime minister.
The judge has ordered completion of the tests within 12 days, saying the prosecution may meet the PTI founding chairman in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, during that period.
Earlier, the judge heard the concluding arguments of PTI founder’s lawyer, Barrister Salman Safdar, and the prosecution before reserving the verdict.
Barrister Safdar opposed the prosecution request, questioning the police decision to conduct the polygraph and photogrammetric tests 727 days after the May 9 incidents.
The lawyer argued that bail had already been granted to the former prime minister in 21 cases and the statements on the basis of which the police were seeking these tests had already been declared lawful by the Lahore High Court.
He urged the court to dismiss the petition of the prosecution.
Special Prosecutor Rana Aazar stated that the Supreme Court allowed such tests to fulfill investigative requirements. However, he said, the PTI founding chairman refused to undergo these tests in jail without the presence of his lawyer.
He further stated that conducting the voice match test of the accused was a legal requirement.
He asked the court to grant permission to conduct the polygraph, photogrammetric, and voice match tests.
After hearing both sides, the judge reserved his decision on the plea.
In the application, the police sought permission to conduct photogrammetric and polygraph tests of Imran inside Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, where he is currently imprisoned.
The tests are to be carried out in 12 cases, including those pertaining to Jinnah House and Askari Tower attacks.
 
 

Other cases include attacks on Shadman police station and party offices of the PML-N.
MAY 9 TRIALS: The Lahore High Court registrar has issued an amended schedule of the trials of the May 9 cases being conducted at Kot Lakhpat Jail to meet the timeline of four months set by the Supreme Court to conclude these trials.
Last month, a three-judge bench of the SC headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi directed the anti-terrorism courts (ATCs) to conclude May 9 violence trials within four months.
The hearing of May 9 cases would now be heard in jail four days a week — Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The jail trials were earlier being held three days a week but have been extended to expedite their disposal.
The ATCs in Lahore are hearing the jail trials of 14 cases including attack on the Jinnah House, which also serves as residence of corps commander.
Several PTI leaders including former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former provincial ministers Dr Yasmin Rashid and Mian Mehmoodur Rashid are facing trials at the Kot Lakhpat jail.

Officials said that the mayor took a serious notice of the growing complaints of people regarding overcharging by private water tanker operators. He also ordered the constitution of a committee to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter.
They said that the three-member committee was directed to investigate and ascertain the identity of the tanker operators and hydrants involved in the unauthorised increase in the rates of water tankers and submit its report within 10 days.
 
 

The water crisis has been making people’s life miserable lately as the city has been receiving nearly half of its routine supply since several main supply lines burst in the past three months, leaving major areas without water supply.

Wahab says any hydrant or tanker found guilty of fleecing citizens will face legal action

The city that requires over 1,200 million gallons of water daily (MGD) gets 400 MGD water or around 40 per cent out of regular supply of 650MGD due to repair work of the ruptured main lines.
Though the water utility always claims that the repair work would be completed in up to 96 hours, but it is never completed in the designated time, piling miseries on people.
 
 

Residents said that the water tanker mafia fleeced people by overcharging whenever there was short supply of water in the city.
A resident of Gulshan-i-Iqbal said that the water tanker operators charged twice of the officially notified rates, taking advantage of the water crisis in the city, leaving people with no option but to pay excessive price for water.
“What will you do when you don’t have any other means to get water for daily use?”, he wondered saying that the people were compelled to pay whatever the price they [tanker operators] demanded.
According to the order issued by the KWSC chief executive officer, the committee will submit detailed information, including the identity of the tanker registration numbers and the names of the drivers involved in the activity.
The order said: “It has come to the attention of the competent authority that tanker operators have unilaterally increased their rates without any prior notice to or approval from the KWSC in clear violation of the terms of their contract. This act is deemed an offence and is entirely unacceptable.”
 
 

It said that a committee to investigate the matter was constituted to investigate the matter and it would submit its final report within 10 working days from the date of issuance of the order.
The sources said that the mayor also instructed the authorities concerned to obtain detailed records and operational data from all tanker operators involved in water distribution.
In a statement, the mayor said that the objective to initiate investigation into overcharging by tanker operators was to ensure transparency and identify those responsible for exploiting citizens.
“The concerns of Karachi’s residents are valid and cannot be ignored. Any operator found guilty of overcharging will face strict legal action,” he added.
The KWSC chairman further said that the city administration would not tolerate any form of exploitation, especially in essential services like water supply. “The inquiry aims to restore public confidence and ensure fair practices in water distribution,” he added.
The mayor reaffirmed his commitment to transparency, public service, and accountability across all sectors of municipal governance.
In another development two days ago, the water utility had replaced the in-charge of Hydrant Services Tanker Operation.
On Wednesday, the chief engineer of the bulk main water supply lines, Zafar Palejo, was also replaced with Superintendent Engineer Syed Muhammad Ijaz.

They said that the body of the 13-year-old Mujeebur Rehman was found inside the seminary in Jameel Colony within the remit of the Gadap City police station.
The corpse was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for a post-mortem examination.
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the body bore multiple marks of injuries. “Findings [of the post-mortem examination] are suggestive of sexual violence,” she said.
DIG-East Usman Ghani told Dawn that the victim boy was a seminary student.

Police arrest madressah teacher after family lodges FIR

Malir SSP Kashif Abbasi said that the police launched an investigation into the incident In a statement, he said that the seminary administration, teachers and students are being questioned about the incident.
 
 

The crime scene unit of the police collected evidence from the spot.
The victim was an orphan, who originally hailed from Pano Aqil.
Later in the evening, the Gadap City police registered an FIR against a seminary teacher on the complaint of a brother of the victim under Sections 302 (premeditated murder), 377-B (rape) and 94 (act to which a person is compelled by threats) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The police said that the teacher was formally arrested and he would be produced before a court for remand on Thursday (today).
According to the FIR, the complainant said that his younger brother had been studying at the seminary for the last three years.
The administrator of the seminary phoned him at around 5:30am, asking him to send the location of his house. Despite his insistence, the administrator did not inform him about the reason. At around 6am, the administrator, along with two other persons, came to his house and informed him that his brother died due to a stomach ache.
The complainant said that he and his other relatives met with the teacher, who claimed that he woke up at 3am and took a round of the seminary when he spotted the body of Mujeeb.
He told the family that he brought the body inside the room and found that it bore torture marks and it appeared that he was also subjected to a criminal assault and strangled.
The complainant expressed apprehension over the teacher’s role and nominated him in the FIR.
Suspect killed by firing of accomplice in Quaidabad
A suspected house robber was killed by his own accomplice when he opened indiscriminate  fire that resulted in bullet injuries to a woman passer-by in Sherpao  Colony late on Tuesday night, police said.
Quaidabad SHO Rana  Khushi Mohammed said that two armed men barged into a house for robbery.  They held the family at gunpoint and snatched their cell phones and other valuables.
However, a neighbour raised alarm and when the  robbers came out of the house several residents, who gathered there,  tried to overpower them.
One of the robbers resorted to firing and  fled. However, the bullets hit his accomplice, who died on the spot,  and a passer-by, later identified as Anjum Sardar.
The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.
The  deceased was identified as Nawab Khan. He was declared an absconder by a  court in a robbery case in 2014. He recently returned from Dubai after  spending around 12 years.

The observation came when senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, representing five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges, argued that the real reason behind the transfer of three judges to the IHC was the allegation levelled against intelligence agencies by six IHC judges.
In a joint letter sent to the Supreme Judicial Council on March 25, 2024, the six judges had blamed intelligence agencies for meddling in judicial affairs.
In response to the argument by the senior lawyer, Justice Afghan asked if the allegations were attributed to the intelligence ag­­e­­ncies, why the three high offices were being dragged into the controversy to build a gro­und of malice. He also wondered if the intelligence agencies had demolished the en­­tire appointment procedure when they had no constitutional role in judges’ appointment.

Counsel alleges judges transferred to IHC for ‘extraneous collateral reasons’

Headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, the five-judge constitutional bench was hearing a joint petition filed by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.
 
 

The counsel said the letter to the SJC triggered a reaction, as a bitter social media campaign against the judges ensued, whereby the degree of a signatory of the letter and the loyalty of another judge were questioned and cameras were allegedly installed in the bedroom of another judge.
He further alleged that this was a conspiracy contrived at the offices of the PM and law ministry to take over the control of IHC and if the president had also applied his mind to this effect, then the entire exercise fell within the category of malice in law.
Since direct proof of malice was always virtually impossible, malice was always drawn by inferences, he said.
At this, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan interjected to make a statement that during his 13-year career as a judge, he was never approached by any intelligence agencies. He also reminded the counsel that soon after the letter by IHC judges, full-court meetings were conducted in all high courts wherein it was resolved that no such interference by intelligence agencies had ever occurred and the problem confined to the IHC only.
Justice Hassan also noted that the allegations of malice against the office of the president and the members of the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan — a body that appoints judges — were very serious in nature.
In response, the counsel cited the example of Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui who was removed as IHC judge and later vindicated by the SJC and also cited interviews of certain government functionaries in the media.
At this, Justice Salahuddin Panwhar questioned if the constitutional bench was bound by the interviews or newspaper clippings.
 
 

The counsel recalled how JCP, while appointing two additional judges in IHC, deliberately left vacant three permanent offices of the judges in the high court. Since the JCP left three seats vacant, the president took it upon himself to fill these seats by invoking Article 200 when the authority to appoint permanent judges rests only with JCP.
According to the counsel, the Constitution does not contemplate filling of vacant seats by invoking Article 200, rather the article should be exercised only for a temporary basis.
Justice Mazhar asked both the counsel and Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan to come up with reasons on the part of the JCP to leave the three offices of the judges vacant while appointing two additional judges.
The counsel said, “A judge on the 16th position in seniority was imported from the Lahore High Court and put in place at the senior-most position in IHC”, adding that after the transfer of the three judges, the administrative and promotion committees of the IHC were also changed.
The transfer of the three judges to the IHC was not in the public interest, but done for extraneous collateral reasons, he alleged.

“This is appropriate for Europe’s most populous and economically powerful country,” Merz told parliament. “Our friends and partners also expect this from us. Indeed, they practically demand it.”
In his first major address to the Bundestag since his government was inaugurated last week, Merz vowed to “provide all financial means necessary” for the long-underfunded defence forces.
Germany, with its dark World War II history, has long been reluctant to spend big on its military and funding dropped off sharply after the Cold War as European countries relied on Nato heavyweight the United States for security.

Chancellor Merz vows to ‘provide all financial means necessary’ for underfunded defence

US President Donald Trump has demanded that Germany and other allies spend more on common defence and thrown into doubt Washington’s future commitment to the transatlantic military alliance.
Merz has pledged a greater diplomatic and security role for Berlin in Europe at a time of high geopolitical tensions. He warned on Wednesday that “anyone who seriously believes that Russia would be satisfied with a victory over Ukraine or with the annexation of parts of the country is mistaken”.
His government has already cleared the way for a spending “bazooka” worth hundreds of billions of euros in extra funding for defence and infrastructure by getting a fiscal plan passed by the previous parliament. “Strengthening the Bundeswehr (armed forces) is our top priority,” Merz said.
“The German government will provide all the financial resources the Bundeswehr needs to become Europe’s strongest conventional army.” “Strength deters aggressors, while weakness invites aggression,” he added.
He also emphasised continued support for Ukraine but also said that “we are not a party to war, and we don’t want to become one”.
‘Strong together’
“Our goal is a Germany and a Europe that are so strong together that we never have to use our weapons,” Merz said. “To achieve this, we will have to assume more responsibility within NATO and the EU.”
For now, the challenges are huge. In recent years, Germany’s Bundeswehr has been mocked for equipment failures, including helicopters that cannot fly and rifles that do not shoot straight.
Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine over three years ago jolted the centre-left former chancellor Olaf Scholz into action. He announced 100 billion euros ($112 billion) in extra defence spending, which has allowed Germany to meet the Nato target of 2pc of GDP.

Headed by Justice Amin­uddin Khan, the CB had taken up an appeal against the Oct 31, 2024 Peshawar High Court judgement on the appeal moved by the Pakistan Ghee Mills Association and Pakistan Steel Mills Association represented by counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar.
The CB issued not­ices to the respondents and orde­red the consolidation of all connected petitions while granting the status quo, thereby restoring and mai­n­taining the amendment made by parliament.
The counsel asserted that parliament has complete constitutional competence to legislate and amend the ST Act  and that Entry No. 151, inserted through the Finance Act, 2024, was a legitimate exercise of legislative authority. 
The counsel criticised the PHC decision which had struck down the provision and had also substituted the statutory term ‘pay order’ with ‘post-dated cheque.’ He  contended that the court decision amou­nted to judicial legislation, observing that PHC cannot substitute the expr­ess words of a statute, nor can it assume the legislative function that exclusively belo­ngs to parliament.

Trump then flew to Qatar, where he oversaw the signing of a deal for the Gulf Arab country to buy jets from US manufacturer Boeing.
He did not mention a controversial separate offer by Qatar to donate a Boeing jet to serve as the US president’s official airplane. That would be one of the most valuable gifts ever given to the US and it has triggered alarm in Washington over its security and ethics implications.

US president oversees Boeing jets deal during visit to Qatar

After Trump’s declaration that he would lift sanctions on Syria, he met interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who swept to power at the head of a group that Washington has called a terrorist organisation and once pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda.
According to the White House, Trump urged Sharaa to join the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco, which normalised relations with Israel under the US-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020. “I told him, ‘I hope you’re going to join when its straightened out. He said, Yes. But they have a lot of work to do,” Trump said, according to a White House pool report.
Photos posted on Saudi state television showed the two men shaking hands in the presence of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump said the meeting with Sharaa, who he described as a young, attractive guy with a very strong past, was  “great”.
 


“He’s got a real shot at holding it together,” said Trump. Trump’s four-day visit highlights the United States’ growing ties to the oil-rich region, where his real-estate company is also developing several projects.
Trump’s Middle East trip — which does not include a visit to Jerusalem — has fuelled doubts in Israel about where the country stands in Washington’s priorities.
Israel opposes lifting sanctions on Syria, which would clear the way for greater engagement by humanitarian organisations and boost foreign investment. But Trump told reporters the fact he has relationships with countries in the Middle East is  “very good for Israel”.

• Italy’s premier warns humanitarian situation in Gaza Strip ‘ever more dramatic and unjustifiable’
GAZA CITY: Gaza rescuers said at least 80 people were killed in Israeli bombardment across the Palestinian territory on Wednesday, as the IDF intensified their massive invasion of the conflict-stricken Palestinian territories.
Civil defence official Mohammed al-Mughayyir said 80 people had been killed by Israeli bombardment since dawn, including 59 in the north.
Footage from the aftermath of a strike in Jabalia, northern Gaza, showed mounds of rubble and twisted metal from collapsed buildings. Palestinians, including young children, picked through the debris in search of belongings.
Footage of mourners in northern Gaza showed women in tears as they kneeled next to bodies wrapped in bloodstained white shrouds. “It’s a nine-month-old baby. What did he do?” one of them cried out.
 


Hasan Moqbel, a Palestinian who lost relatives, said: “There are no homes fit for living. I have no shelter, no food, no water. Those who don’t die from air strikes die from hunger, and those who don’t die from hunger die from lack of medicine.”
Israel’s military on Wednesday warned residents in part of a Gaza City neighbourhood to evacuate, asserting that its forces would “attack the area with intense force”.
Prisoners situation
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday spoke to US envoy Steve Witkoff about the release of prisoner held in Gaza.
Negotiations for the release of the captives held in Gaza have been ongoing, with the latest talks taking place in the Qatari capital Doha, where US President Donald Trump was visiting on Wednesday.
Netanyahu’s office said the premier had discussed with Witkoff and his negotiating team the issue of the prisoners and the missing.
Witkoff later said Trump had “a really productive conversation” with the Qatari emir about a Gaza deal, adding that “we are moving along and we have a good plan together”.
 


‘Unjustifiable’
From the occupied West Bank, Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said on Wednesday he favoured a “ceasefire at any price” in Gaza, accusing Netanyahu of wanting to continue the war “for his own reasons”.
Mohammad Awad, an emergency doctor in northern Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital, said that supply shortages meant his department could not properly handle the flow of wounded from the Jabalia strike. “There are not enough beds, no medicine, and no means for surgical or medical treatment, which leaves doctors unable to save many of the injured who are dying due to lack of care”, he said.
Awad added that “the bodies of the martyrs are lying on the ground in the hospital corridors after the morgue reached full capacity. The situation is catastrophic in every sense of the word.”
Israel imposed an aid blockade on the Gaza Strip on March 2 after talks to prolong a January 19 ceasefire broke down.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday called for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners, unimpeded humanitarian access and an immediate cessation of hostilities in Gaza.
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was “ever more dramatic and unjustifiable”.  A US-led initiative for aid distribution under Israeli military security drew international criticism as it appears to sideline the United Nations and existing aid organisations, and would overhaul current humanitarian structures in Gaza.
Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said the plan would make “aid conditional on forced displacement” and vetting of the population. It added in a statement that Israel was creating “conditions for the eradication of Palestinian lives in Gaza”.

Turkiye and Azerbaijan, popular budget holiday destinations for Indians, issued statements backing Islamabad after India’s air strikes last week. “Bookings for Azerbaijan and Turkiye decreasing by 60 per cent (over the last week) while cancellations have surged by 250pc during the same period,” a spokesperson for MakeMyTrip said.
EaseMyTrip’s Chief Executive Officer, Rikant Pittie, said the platform had seen a 22pc rise in cancellations for Turkiye and 30pc for Azerbaijan “due to recent geopolitical tensions”.
Travellers had switched to Georgia, Serbia, Greece, Thailand and Vietnam, he added. Another ticketing platform, ixigo, earlier said in a post on X that it would be suspending flight and hotel bookings for Turkiye, Azerbaijan and China.
EaseMyTrip’s founder and chairman Nishant Pitti said in a post on X that 287,000 Indians visited Turkiye last year and 243,000 visited Azer­baijan. “When these nations openly support Pakistan, should we fuel their tourism and their economies?” Pitti said.

Ten persons were injur­ed.
The PPP rally led by its former Balochistan chapter president Ali Madad Jattak and MPA Obai­dullah Gorgag was on its way to Railway Hockey Stad­ium to attend a public meeting to celebrate Paki­s­tan’s victory against the recent Indian aggression when it was attacked, officials said.
Eyewitnesses said arm­ed men before hurling hand grenades fired into the air as the rally was passing through Munir Mengal Road in the Sariab area.
Ali Madad Jattak and Obaid Gorgag, who were leading the rally, rema­ined unhurt as their personal guards covered them before shifting them away, they said.
Police official Asif Ghafoor said, “The grenade exploded near the rally, injuring 11 party workers.” He said the injured were rushed to the Trauma Centre of the Civil Hospital, Quetta. “A PPP worker, Mehboob Ali Kurd, who received multiple injuries, lost his life during treatment at the hospital,” said Dr Wasim Baig.
While the law enforcement agencies immediately cordoned off the blast site and launched a search operation to trace out the attackers, most participants in the rally continued their journey towards the stadium where they later attended the public meeting.
 
 

Hospital sources said nine of the 10 injured were identified as Qurban Ali, Abdul Razaaq, Muhammad Asim, Muhammad Umar, Abdul Manan, Syed Naqibullah, Imran Khan, Mohammad Sadiq and Maharullah.
Another man passing through the area in a rickshaw also died during treatment, hospital sources said. His identity, however, could not be ascertained till the filing of this report in the late hours of Wednesday night.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti has strangely condemned the grenade attack at the political rally and said the elements involved in the terrorist attack would be brought to justice.
He expressed grief over the casualties and visited the hospital to inquire after the injured. He directed the health authorities to provide the best available treatment to them.

The meeting, originally slated for April 18, was rescheduled for May 2  and then again fixed for May 19, and was expected to finalise nominations for permanent appointments to the IHC, the Sindh High Court (SHC), the Pesh­awar High Court (PHC), and the Balochistan High Court (BHC).
However, the JCP headed by Chief Justice of Paki­stan Yahya Afridi issued a notification stating that the meeting was deferred. The notification did not mention a new date or any reason for the postponement, even though the four high courts are being led by acting chief justices after the respective judges were elevated to the Supreme Court.
 
 

The delay comes amid an ongoing constitutional challenge before the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench regarding the transfer of three judges from other high courts to the IHC — Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar from the LHC, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the SHC, and Justice Muham­mad Asif from the BHC. The Minis­try of Law issued the transfer notifications on February 1, following which the IHC revised its seniority list on February 3, ranking Justice Dogar as the senior puisne judge.
This revision triggered opposition from five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Babar Sattar, and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — who challenged Justice Dogar’s seniority and his subsequent appointment as acting chief justice on February 12.
The Supreme Court is currently hearing multiple petitions, including those filed by the IHC judges, former prime minister Imran Khan, and four bar associations, challenging the legality of the judge transfers, the seniority list, and the February 8 decision on judges’ representation.
 
 

Then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq had rejected the objections raised by judges regarding the transfer. In his ruling, Justice Farooq cited Article 200 of the Constitution, which allows the president of Pakistan to transfer judges between high courts with their consent and following consultations with the chief justice of Pakistan and the relevant high court chiefs.
In its response, the Supreme Court registrar has defended the transfers, citing Article 200(1) of the Constitution, which allows the president to transfer judges with their consent and after consultation with the chief justice of Pakistan and relevant high court chief justices.
The law ministry maintained that proper consultation occurred on February 1, the day of the notification. The judicial commission, in its written reply to the Supreme Court, emphasised that it operated under Article 175-A of the Constitution and remained committed to upholding the Constitution.

• Westerly system to hit north on May 19
RAWALPINDI / LAHORE: The country is bracing for its first heatwave of the season, with the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warning that temperatures across much of the country will soar well above seasonal norms from Thursday (today) and persist for three to four days.
According to a PMD advisory, a high-pressure system is likely to grip most parts of the country from May 15 to 20. As a result, daytime temperatures are forecast to remain 4 to 6 degrees Celsius above normal in the southern regions — including Sindh, southern Punjab and Balochistan — throughout the period.
Meanwhile, central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber Pakht­unkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan are likely to experience temperatures 5°C to 7°C above normal from May 15 to 19.
A westerly weather system is also expected to enter the upper parts of the country on the evening or night of May 19. Under its influence, rain, wind and thunderstorms with isolated heavy falls and hailstorms are anticipated in Azad Kashmir, Islamabad, the Pothohar region, northeast Punjab, upper KP and Gilgit-Baltistan on May 19 and 20.
 
 

The PMD has urged the public, especially children, elderly citizens and women, to take precautionary measures during the heatwave, including avoiding direct sun exposure and staying well-hydrated.
Farmers have also been advised to adjust their agricultural activities and take steps to protect livestock. The high temperatures in northern areas may accelerate snowmelt, potentially increasing water flow in rivers. Authorities have been requested to remain alert and take preventive action to avert any emergencies caused by the extreme heat.
Emergency instructions
In Punjab, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has also issued a heatwave alert, instructing commissioners and deputy commissioners across the province to remain vigilant.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed departments including school education, health, transport, local government and Rescue 1122 to initiate precautionary steps. These include the provision of clean drinking water in public areas and first-aid readiness in hospitals and mobile units.
It advised citizens to take care of children, the elderly and outdoor workers, avoid unnecessary travel during peak afternoon hours, wear light-coloured clothing, and cover the head when outdoors.
The PDMA also stressed judicious water use across sectors and urged citizens to stay informed about further updates.
 
 

The National Institute of Health (NIH) had already issued a heatstroke advisory last month, urging both public and private hospitals to prepare for an increase in heat-related illnesses. The advisory noted that climate change and global warming are intensifying the frequency of extreme heat events in Pakistan, leading to a rise in morbidity and mortality.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has highlighted the impact of climate change on human health, including increased frequency and severity of heatwaves. Pakistan has experienced severe heatwaves in recent years, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.
The country’s healthcare system faces challenges in responding to these events, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Heat-related illnesses can have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, including the elderly, children and those with pre-existing medical conditions.
The NIH said the objective of its advisory is to sensitise health care authorities to take timely, appropriate actions for preparedness and prevention of heatstroke. Infants, elderly persons, individuals with certain comorbidities, athletes, pregnant females and outdoor workers are at high risk for heatstroke.
 
 

If a person shows signs of possible heatstroke, professional medical treatment should be obtained immediately. The most critical step is lowering the temperature of the patients. The patients should be moved to a shady area, unnecessary clothing should be removed, and cool, tepid water should be applied to the skin while soaking remaining clothes with water.
If the patient can drink liquids, they should be given plenty of cool water or other cool beverages that do not contain alcohol or caffeine. Intravenous fluids should be maintained and the patient should be hospitalised if required.

• GDP growth projected at 3.6pc, inflation at 7.7pc
• Revenue collection forecast to increase by Rs1.4tr
• Fiscal deficit targeted at 5.1pc of GDP
ISLAMABAD: As virtual technical-level discussions on the upcoming federal budget begin, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Pakistan’s total revenue to grow to nearly Rs20 trillion in the next fiscal year, up from the current estimate of less than Rs17.8tr, with an emphasis on tight expenditure controls to ensure sustainable debt servicing.
After three days of technical discussions through video link, formal policy-level negotiations on budget finalisation are set to begin on Monday (May 19) and continue until Friday (May 23). The agreement between the IMF staff mission and the authorities on next year’s budgetary measures and macroeconomic framework would lead to the announcement of the federal budget on June 2.
The IMF has already put on the table its projections for major economic indicators, including fiscal and monetary policies, envisaging an economic growth rate of 3.6 per cent and average inflation of 7.7pc. This means the inflation rate would be significantly higher than the current year’s average of 5.1pc. The combination of economic growth and inflation is expected to jack up revenue collection by more than Rs1.4tr from the current year’s estimated collection of about Rs12.4tr.
 
 

However, besides the FBR’s revenue collection, a major push for expansion in revenue base is being envisaged to come from provincial governments and agriculture income tax would be a key area for additional efforts.
Overall revenues for the next year are targeted to cross Rs19.9tr or 15.2pc of GDP compared to Rs17.8bn of budget estimates for the current year or 15.9pc of GDP.
The Fund expects Pakistani authorities to continue to focus on expenditure control, trimming it from 21.6pc of GDP in the current year to Rs20.3pc next year.
But even then the expenditures would get close to Rs26.57tr next year compared to budget estimates of about Rs18.9tr. The two sides have yet to work out the final numbers on revenue collection and revised expenditures, particularly those that have arisen recently due to the security situation.
The IMF expects Pakistan to reduce its fiscal deficit from 5.6pc of GDP during the current year to 5.1pc next year, or about Rs6.67tr. The government is also being asked to maintain a primary surplus — revenues minus non-interest expenditures — of around Rs2.1tr, a key condition for improving debt sustainability. Achieving this target is anticipated to bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio from the current 77.6pc to 75.6pc in FY26.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Finance has asked all the ministries and divisions to submit an additional pro forma (Form-III-C) to capture the climate-related component of subsidies to enhance and expand reporting on climate considerations in all allocations of the annual budget.
 
 

“Climate tagging of subsidies is one of the requirements under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreed with IMF,” read a circular issued to all government entities and ministries.
The federal budget is required to map climate relevance in three categories of adaptation, mitigation, and transition.
The public expenditure under the running of civil government and public sector development programme is being tagged and the process is now being extended to other expenditures like grants and subsidies to identify the overall climate-related public expenditure.

• Shares with UN chief concerns about inflammatory remarks by Delhi
• Pakistan returns Indian border guard
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday invited India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution, between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The prime minister floated this offer during his visit to the frontline area of Pasrur Cantonment in Sialkot, where he lauded the armed forces for giving an exemplary response to India under the ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ conducted in response to Indian strikes inside Pakistan following the Pahalgam incident. Pakistan had struck 26 Indian military facilities, including its airbases, using jets and missiles.
He said Pakistan’s response to the Indian attack on May 6-7 caused huge losses to the neighbouring country, in which the Pakistan Air Force downed multiple Indian Rafale aircraft. In reference to the Pakistani strikes on 26 military targets, the PM said Pakistan had “avenged” the 1971 war.
 


“You have taken revenge for the 1971 war…and now the whole nation is standing with you,” PM Shehbaz told troops during his address. He warned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi against future aggression.
“If you again attack us, you will lose everything…,” the PM said in a warning to his Indian counterpart. “We are ready for war and dialogue. Now the choice is yours,” he said.
With reference to PM Modi’s recent address to the nation, PM Shehbaz said: “Do not dictate us. Water is our red line; don’t even think about diverting our water. Yes, water and blood do not flow together. You have also hit our Neelum-Jhelum water project. If the damage was severe, we could have destroyed your major dams, including Baglihar Dam.”
PM Shehbaz again asked PM Modi to shun differences and sit for a dialogue. “Let us extinguish this fire. Let us sit together to talk on Kashmir and water,” he added.
 
 

After the Pahalgam attack, India put the water treaty with Pakistan in abeyance, prompting a strong response from Pakistan. In an interview with an Indian media outlet last week, World Bank President Ajay Banga said there was no suspension clause in the Indus Waters Treaty.
“There is no provision in the treaty to allow for suspension the way it was drawn up. It either needs to be gone, or replaced by another one, and that requires the two countries to want to agree,” he said. He also said that the bank played no decision-making role and acted solely as a facilitator.
PM Shehbaz said the blatant aggression against innocent civilians resulting in the martyrdom of children, women and the elderly and calling them terrorists was utterly shameful and against all international laws, norms and morality.
According to the PM, despite Pakistan’s offer for a neutral probe, India deliberately evaded this path, as it had nothing to prove, and India launched the offensive based on a false pretext and bloated arrogance and ego, “for which it has got a very befitting response”.
 






During the visit, the prime minister received a comprehensive briefing on the conduct of the battle and the current operational preparedness of the troops. He met the officers and soldiers actively participating in the military operation, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said.
In a show of continued support for all branches of the military, the prime minister is scheduled to visit various air bases and naval bases in coming days to meet troops of the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy.
The PM noted that Pakistan had agreed to the ceasefire understanding in the larger interest of peace in the region. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong resolve to promote peace in South Asia, while defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.
Concerns shared with UN chief
In his afternoon telephone call with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the premier expressed his deep appreciation for the UN secretary general’s leadership and diplomatic efforts to defuse the situation in South Asia.
He stated that the UN chief’s continued engagement and preventive diplomacy demonstrated his enduring commitment to the protection of the UN Charter’s principles and purposes, as well as to fostering peace in South Asia.
This was the third phone call between the two leaders in the last two weeks.
 






He also expressed concern over the continued provocative and inflammatory remarks made by the Indian leadership, which were a threat to the fragile regional peace. He emphasised that the just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, was imperative to ensuring durable peace in South Asia.
The UN secretary general welcomed the ceasefire, while expressing condolences over the loss of civilian lives. He expressed his commitment to continued engagement with both sides to advance regional peace and stability.
Speaks to UAE president
PM Shehbaz held a telephone conversation with Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates.
According to a statement, the PM conveyed profound gratitude for the UAE’s diplomatic efforts and constructive role during the recent crisis. He added that the UAE had stood by Pakistan through thick and thin.
 






PM Shehbaz also met Khazar Farhadov, Ambassador of Azerbaijan to Pakistan, in Islamabad and expressed profound gratitude to President Ilham Aliyev for the unwavering solidarity and support during the recent tensions with India.
 






Indian guard repatriated
Pakistan returned a captured border guard to India on Wednesday, reported AFP. The guard was captured a day after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, which killed 26 people and sparked tit-for-tat missile, drone and fighter jet attacks.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but India blamed Pakistan. Islamabad rejects the accusations and has called for an independent probe.
“Purnam Kumar Shaw, who had been in the custody of Pakistan Rangers since April 23, was handed over to India,” India’s Border Security Force said in a statement.

According to a press release issued on Tuesday, the award ceremony was held in Rabat, the capital of Morocco.
Anushe Engineer was chosen as the winner from three finalists in her category, surpassing France’s Louis Boulay and the United Kingdom’s Issy Ronald, for her feature,  ‘It’s all or nothing for Arshad Nadeem in Paris’.  The finalists were shortlisted from 37 entries initially selected from the total submissions.
 
 

The award comes with an AIPS Scholarship at a top sporting event.
In the quiet, unobtrusive manner that has become his trademark in the elite men’s javelin, Nadeem stormed the Stade de France field to take a terrific, historic gold at August’s finals at the Paris Olympics with a mammoth 92.97 metres off his second throw.
It was an Olympic record, erasing the existing one of 90.57m, set by Andreas Thorkildsen at Beijing 2008. For the underpowered Pakistan contingent in Paris, this was arguably the country’s greatest moment in decades. His gold is Pakistan’s only gold medal outside of hockey. It is also Pakistan’s first medal of any colour since 1992.
Engineer’s feature focused on the trials and tribulations faced by the athlete in his career leading up to the historic Olympic gold.
The award was presented by jury members Andreas Schirmer and Vincent Amalvy, head of sports at Agence France-Presse, with the latter describing the finalist feature as a “great story”.
Lost for words, Engineer said she did not have an idea of what she was getting involved in upon deciding on the story in 2023.
“I really had no idea what was going on when I set out to do this story and I just went and did it,” she said of the achievement.

Last month, Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjum­and  approved two petitions filed on behalf of Imran related to the requests. The court had sought a response from Adiala authorities to provide the facilities.
Today, the judge heard a request by the prison authorities against the court order and dismissed it
A report to the judge from the jail superintendent on Monday had called for the court’s orders on January 10 and February 3 to be reviewed and set aside due to “being inconsistent and contrary to the basic rights and principle of recognition of the inherent dignity and equal inalienable rights of inmates”, arguing that extending the two facilities to Imran would be against the spirit of the Constitution, as well as Pakistan Prison Rules.
A court order issued today, available with Dawn.com, said the judgements passed on Jan 10 and 28 and Feb 3 were passed after taking into account all relevant factors and could not be received without any solid reason and thus, the jail superintendent’s request was turned down.
The order instructed the superintendent to “strictly follow” the three orders in “letter and spirit”. The hearing was adjourned to next Wednesday.
A day prior, Imran’s sons — Suleman Khan (28) and Qasim Khan (26) — had called attention to their father’s incarceration. The two, in a rare public appearance, had appealed for his release, claiming that their phone calls were set up with their father at odd times with limited duration, adding that the failure to miss the calls “meant going a long time before they could talk to him again.”
They had further claimed they spoke to Imran only once every two or three months.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.</p><small>2025-05-14 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604477-bomb-exploded-at-mubarak-zeb-residence-in-bajaur-district' target='_blank'><strong>Special assistant to PM's residence targeted in bomb attack</strong></a><br><p>

The amount will be reflected in its foreign exchange reserves for the week ending on May 16, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in a post on X. It would raise the reserves to $11.355bn.
 






Last week, the IMF had approved the immediate disbursement of about $1bn to Pakistan under the ongoing EFF and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
In a statement issued last Friday, the IMF had said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform programme supported by the EFF arrangement.
“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52bn). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1bn),” it said.
 


It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.
“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP.
“Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”
Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had said PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the approval and “the failure of India’s high-handed tactics” against Pakistan.
“The country’s economic situation has improved and the country is moving towards development. India is plotting a conspiracy to divert attention from our country’s development through unilateral aggression.
“International institutions have responsibly rejected India’s false propaganda. Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,” it quoted the prime minister as saying.</p><small>2025-05-14 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604461-two-more-soldiers-injured-in-indian-strikes-martyred-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Indian strikes: Security forces' death toll rises to 13 as 2 more martyred</strong></a><br><p>
