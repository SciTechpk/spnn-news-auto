The debate — fuelled by Islamabad’s chronic fiscal stress — is sustained by the belief that reducing revenue transfers to the provinces would provide an easy, if contentious, fix to the federal government’s fiscal woes. It is argued that the centre has to bear major expenses such as debt payments, defence needs, large infrastructure development, subsidies, social protection, etc, while the provinces get the majority share from the federal divisible pool.
Many also say that the enhanced NFC transfers have lulled the provinces into a state of fiscal complacency, leading to weak revenue-generation efforts. There has also been criticism that the provinces spend the funds to gain political mileage for the ruling parties, instead of investing in the social sector or public service delivery.
It is against this background that PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has demanded a new NFC award — in accordance with the 18th Amendment, which devolved several ministries, departments and functions from the centre to the provinces.
 
 

He said the previous award preceded the amendment, and that since devolution had increased the responsibilities of the provinces, they should have more resources. This implies a demand for further raising the provincial share from the divisible pool from the present 57.5pc. He also spoke about the deteriorating security situation in Balochistan to reinforce his case for a bigger provincial share from federal revenue transfers, and blamed the FBR’s incompetence for not collecting enough taxes to address federal fiscal woes, saying this burden could not be shared by the provinces.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s demand is consistent with his party’s politics: the PPP played a dominant role in both the 2009 NFC award and passage of the 18th Amendment, and deserves credit for resisting repeated attempts to reverse fiscal devolution and alter the existing revenue-sharing framework.
However, whatever differences of opinion there may be, there is no doubt that the NFC award does require an overhaul — not to shrink the provincial pie but to make the framework operate effectively and efficiently for citizens.
For this to happen, the centre and provinces must engage in meaningful discussions to devolve powers and transfer fiscal resources further down to the third tier of governance — the local governments. Equally important are changes in the formula for resource distribution among the provinces.
The disproportionate emphasis on population should be reduced in favour of indicators such as poverty, regional backwardness and disparities, and, more importantly, provincial revenue generation efforts to ensure quality public service delivery and promote more equitable and sustainable economic development.

Mufti Munir Shakir, founder of the banned Lashkar-i-Islam, was killed in a blast outside his seminary in Urmar area on the outskirts of the provincial capital on March 15 this year.
They said the department identified the gang involved in this heinous act while efforts were under way to apprehend the culprits in the near future.
The CTD officials, while briefing media-persons said that it busted a group of militants responsible for no fewer than 18 terrorist incidents in the settled areas of the provincial capital, adding that those attacks include the martyrdom of deputy superintendent of police Sardar Hussain Khan and 14 other police officials of various ranks.

Officials reveal terrorists using digital currency for extortion; propose seminary registration should be subject to CTD’s consent

They said that following interrogation from arrested terrorists involved in several terrorist activities, CTD recovered a substantial cache of arms, ammunition, and explosive material, including IEDs, adding that the timely action also led to securing of at least six sensitive installations that had already been subjected to reconnaissance by militants and were in the final stages of planning an attack.
 
 

“CTD has identified the gang responsible for the targeted killing of religious scholars, enabling focused follow-up operations to apprehend the culprits,” they said.
Also, the CTD officials, who didn’t want to be named, claimed to have busted the Daesh Khorasan network directly responsible for the suicide attack in Peshawar city on 11 May, 2025, some four kilometres from a JUI-F gathering being addressed by Maulana Fazlur Rehman at Mufti Mehmood Markaz on Ring Road, on outskirts of the provincial capital.
While briefing journalists, CTD revealed that apart from currency notes and bank transactions, terrorist organisations received extortion money through digital currency as well.
The CTD officials told reporters here that apart from Afghanistan, people also received extortion calls from Saudi mobile numbers.
“They [militants] now seek extortion money in digital currency — Bitcoin,” a senior CTD official said, adding that the terrorist organisations generated finances not only from extortion but from drug smuggling as well.
Also, the CTD officials said that the terrorists were involved in online propaganda on several social media platforms and the department had established contact directly with the organisations owning the Apps, adding that the department had proposed to the government to establish counter cyber terrorism police stations.
“CTD also wants empowerment under Prevention of Electronic Crime Act,” they said, adding that the counter violent extremism policy was in the final stage. The CTD officials said that the religious seminaries and their registration should be subject to the approval of the CTD, adding that they had proposed empowering the deputy commissioners to registrar the religious seminaries under Societies Registration Act 1860.
They also said that they had been facing issues while arresting the accused persons in the merged districts, as it took years to arrest one person, adding that the department wanted powers under a mix of Frontier Crimes Regulations 1901 and Police Act 2017.
“We have 44 special weapon and tactics (SWAT) teams for each district. All these teams are equipped with modern gadgets,” they said, adding that capacity building of the department was under way with an explosives handling and analysis laboratory.
They said the prosecution department had developed enough expertise and the bail refusal ratio, which was 6 per cent in 2022, had gone up to 34pc in 2025, adding that 25pc was the conviction rate in 2025 as compared to 23pc in 2022.
They informed reporters that ratio of logically concluding cases was 13pc in 2022, which had gone up to 34pc in 2025, adding that 11 scientists were recruited for forensic laboratory with latest technology to be adopted in the near future.

In Gulmit, Gojal, Hunza, a powerful torrent surged through the Juchar nullah on Tuesday evening, triggered by accelerated glacier melt.
The floodwaters destroyed a women-owned restaurant, a government tourist facilitation centre, orchards, farmland, and critical infrastructure including electricity and internet poles, according to Rescue 1122 officials.
A bridge and sections of the KKH were swept away, leaving no alternative route for locals and tourists travelling to and from China via the Khunjerab Pass. 



 
“Never experienced such intensity of floods in the nullah,” Saeed Jan, a local resident, told Dawn.
The destruction of a fibre optic line has left the area without mobile and internet services, while rising water in the Khunjerab River damaged a power transmission line near Sost, plunging communities into darkness.
Efforts to reopen the highway have been repeatedly hampered by rising water levels and mudflows, with even foot crossings for patients and travellers now deemed impossible.
In Hunza’s Hassanabad, erosion linked to outburst flooding from the Shishper glacier continued on Wednesday, dismantling two more houses and putting others at risk.
Power to Roshanabad Mohallah was cut after an electricity pole collapsed. With a section of the KKH already washed away, traffic is being diverted through the Sas valley in Nagar. 



 
Flash floods also struck Shigar district, damaging homes and property in Dogoro village of Basha, while a glof in the Horchas nullah damaged crops and blocked the road leading to K2, according to local officials.



 
Faizullah Faraq, spokesperson for the Gilgit-Baltistan government, said rehabilitation work is underway across affected areas, but warned that climate change-induced disasters “have changed the map of Gilgit-Baltistan”, with high river flows, erosion, and landslides complicating repairs.
“Passengers and vehicles are waiting for the road to be restored on both sides of the KKH,” he said, adding that the chief minister has ordered efforts to be expedited in Shigar, Ghizer, Hunza, Gilgit, Astore, Diamer, and other districts.
Evacuations in Kasur
Meanwhile, in Punjab, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has ordered the immediate evacuation of people living along the banks of the Sutlej River in Kasur district, warning of significant flooding as a powerful monsoon spell approaches.
The flow of the Sutlej is expected to increase next week, coinciding with the seventh and strongest spell of monsoon rains this season, which has already been linked to 164 deaths across Punjab.
“There is a possibility of further increase in the flow of the Sutlej River next week, and citizens are requested to immediately move to safer places,” PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said, during his emergency visit to Kasur.
The PDMA director convened a high-level meeting at the deputy commissioner’s office in Kasur to address the potential flood situation.
Officials are racing to clear storm drains and reinforce embankments, with the upcoming monsoon forecast to bring intense rainfall from August 13-17 in upper Punjab, followed by extended downpours in other areas from August 18-21.
Major urban centres including Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Sialkot face threats of urban flooding, while the PDMA has also warned of landslides in Murree and Galliyat. 



 
The monsoon season has so far killed at least 164 people, 582 rain-related injuries, damaged 216 homes, and resulted in the loss of 121 livestock, according to recent data.
River monitoring stations show low-level flooding on the Indus River at Kalabagh, Tarbela, and Chashma, with Tarbela Dam currently at 96 per cent capacity.
Kasur Deputy Commissioner Imran Ali said comprehensive preparations have been made to handle a potential flood, with de-silting of drains underway, machinery available, and staff deployed. “Adequate arrangements have been completed to deal with the flood situation at all sensitive places,” he said.

All major bazaars and business centres in Khar, Inayat Kalley, Sadiqabad, Raghagan, Pashat, Haji Lawang, Yousafabad, Nawagai, Lowi Sam, Umary and Qazafi reopened in the morning after the district administration notified an end to the 48-hour curfew late on Tuesday.
“The general public is hereby informed that major roads in the district, including Khar- Munda road, Khar-Nawagai road and Khar-Sadiqabad-Inayat Kallay roads will reopen from tomorrow [Wednesday], allowing citizens to resume their daily activities , while bazaars and trade centres along these routes will also function normally from Wednesday,” read the notification shared on the Facebook page of the deputy commissioner.
The notification came an hour after heads of trade bodies, including those from Khar and Inayat Kalley, announced on social media that they would reopen their business centres on Wednesday regardless of curbs, as they could no longer “tolerate the baseless restrictions.”

Residents protest civilian killings in mortar shelling

The lifting of the curfew restored business activities and transport services on both inter- and intra-district routes but also led to the reopening of educational institutions, which had been closed for the last two days.
 
 

However, curfew will remain in place in around 27 selective areas of both Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils until August 14 due to the ongoing ‘targeted’ military offensive Operation Sarbakaf against terrorists, which entered its third consecutive day on Wednesday.
According to residents, security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery targeted terrorist hideouts in the areas on Wednesday.
However, loss of life on the terrorists’ side in the ongoing operation was not reported by officials on Wednesday evening. Provincial Inspector General of Police Zulfqar Hameed said it was an intelligence-based operation aimed at “eliminating terrorist threats to peace” in the region.
Meanwhile, scores of people from Lowi Mamund tehsil staged a demonstration on Wednesday against the killing of three members of a family after a mortar shell allegedly hit a house in the Erab area on Tuesday evening.
The demonstration held in the Bad-i-Siah area began after the funeral prayers of the deceased were performed. People from all walks of life, mostly youth, showed up defying the curfew.
Participants expressed grave concern over deaths in the mortar shelling, which, they said, killed a woman and two children and wounded two family members.
Bajaur Aman Jirga chief and JI local chapter emir Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, PTI local MPA Dr Hamidur Rehman, former MNA Gul Zafar Khan, Malik Khalid Khan, Najibullah Khan Mamund and JI youth wing leader Irfan Janbaz addressed the gathering and such incidents were unacceptable.
They said authorities promised to avoid the targeting of civilian population in the ongoing operation.
“We were told by authorities that it would be an operation targeting terrorists who posed a threat to peace in the region and its residents,” said a speaker.
The speakers demanded avoiding civilian casualties in the operation, lifting of the curfew and restoration of mobile phone and internet services in the region without delay.
They said that they would launch a massive protest demonstration if their demands were not met immediately.
The demonstration, which continued for a couple of hours, was also addressed by Ibrahim, the head of the affected family, who shared details of the mortar shelling.
Earlier, members of Bajaur Aman Jirga met at Bajaur Press Club Khar and condemned the killing of three people in the incident.
The participants, who also included political, religious and youth leaders, discussed the prevailing law and order situation in the district amid the ongoing operation against terrorists in several areas of Lower and Upper Mamund tehsils.
The meeting chaired by head of the jirga Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, was addressed by ANP MPA Mohammad Nisar Khan, PTI MPA Dr Hamidur Rehaman, former MNA Gul Zafar Khan, ANP president Gul Afzal Khan, religious scholar Maulana Ihsanul Haq, ANP senior leader Sheikh Janzada, PPP president Haji Sher Bahadur and PML-N president Malik Gul Kareem Khan.
The meeting was later joined by ANP provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain and a delegation of his party, who said the killing of civilians not only violated the authorities’ promise but also sparked unrest among residents.
They said that they were not against the action against terrorists as it was vital to clear the area of anti-peace elements but they were opposed to the killing of civilians.
The participants called for an investigation into the incident and said civilians should not be targeted in the future.
ANP leader Iftikhar Hussain expressed his party’s solidarity with the people of Bajaur and called for immediate halt to military action in the district and other parts of the province.
Accompanied by party provincial general secretary Hussain Shah Yousafzai, joint secretary Hamid Toofan and other leaders, Mian Iftikhar said the ANP was deeply concerned about the prevailing poor law and order situation across the province and that the peace march scheduled in Islamabad on August 23 would determine the party’s plan of action to address issues.
Later, the ANP provincial president, along with other leaders and activists, visited relief camps set up for displaced persons, including those on the Bajaur Sports Complex in Khar, and learned from inhabitants about their issues.
Senior officials of the district administration, PDMA and health department briefed visitors about the facilities being provided to displaced persons in camps.

CAIRO: Over 120 people were killed as Israel’s military pounded Gaza City on Wednesday prior to a planned takeover, while Hamas held further talks with Egyptian mediators.
The death toll was the worst in a week and added to the massive fatalities from the nearly two-year conflict that has shattered the enclave housing more than two million Palestinians.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated an idea — also enthusiastically floated by US President Donald Trump — that Palestinians should simply leave.
“They’re not being pushed out, they’ll be allowed to exit,” he told Israeli television channel i24NEWS. “All those who are concerned for the Palestinians and say they want to help the Palestinians should open their gates and stop lecturing us.”

Netanyahu restates idea that Palestinians should leave enclave

Arabs and many world leaders are aghast at the idea of displacing the Gaza population, which Palestinians say would be like another “Nakba” (catastrophe) when hundreds of thousands fled or were forced out in 1948.
Israel’s planned re-seizure of Gaza City, which it took in October 2023 before withdrawing weeks later, is probably weeks away, officials say. That means a ceasefire is still possible, though talks have been floundering and conflict still rages.
 
 

Israeli planes and tanks bombed eastern areas of Gaza City heavily, with many homes destroyed in the Zeitoun and Shejaia neighbourhoods. Al Ahli hospital said 12 people were killed in an air strike on a home in Zeitoun.
Tanks also destroyed several houses in the east of Khan Yunis in south Gaza too.
Starvation and malnutrition
Eight more people, including three children, died of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza over the past two days, the territory’s health ministry said. That took the total to 235, including 106 children, since the conflict began.
Israel disputes those malnutrition and hunger figures reported by the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave.
Hamas chief negotiator Khalil Al Hayya’s meetings with Egyptian officials in Cairo on Wednesday were to focus on stopping the bombardment, delivering aid and “ending the suffering of our people in Gaza”, Hamas official Taher al Nono said in a statement.
 
 

Egyptian security sources said the talks would also discuss the possibility of a comprehensive ceasefire that would see Hamas relinquish governance in Gaza and submit its weapons.
A Hamas official said the group was open to all ideas if Israel ends the bombing and pulls out. However, “laying down arms before the occupation is dismissed is impossible”, the official said.
Global outcry
The Israeli prime minister’s plan to expand military control over Gaza, which Israeli sources said could be launched in October, has heightened global outcry over the widespread devastation, displacement and hunger in the enclave.
Twenty-four nations this week decried the “unimaginable levels” of suffering and urged Israel to allow unrestricted aid.
The Israeli military said nearly 320 trucks entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings on Wednesday and that a further 320 trucks were collected and distributed by the UN and international organisations along with three tankers of fuel and 97 pallets of air-dropped aid.
But the UN and Palestinians say aid remains far from sufficient.
Arab states and much of the international community want Gaza to be governed by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited governance in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The authority’s foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian Shahin, told reporters it was ready to assume full responsibility in Gaza. Hamas would have no role and be required to hand over arms, she added, calling for an international peacekeeping force and withdrawal by Israel.
Israel says it does not trust the PA to rule Gaza.

According to a notification, the committee has been mandated to discuss the water and power issues and submit its report immediately after the meeting for the prime minister’s consideration and decision.
It has been tasked with proposing an immediate solution, implementable within four to five days, for uninterrupted water supply to Gwadar city from both the 7.5MGD water supply scheme and 1.2 MGD seawater desalination plant, as well as a mid-term solution, to be implemented within four to five months, for uninterrupted power and water supply to Gwadar district.
 
 

Both plans must clearly assign responsibilities to ministers and executing agencies with fixed timelines.
The committee comprises Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, the federal ministers for maritime affairs and energy, federal secretaries of planning and development, maritime affairs and energy (power division), Balochistan chief secretary, chairmen of the Gwadar Port Authority and Gwadar Development Authority, Quetta Electric Supply Company chief executive officer, Umar Cheema and former CEO of Sky Electric Amin Sukhera.

“Once we have enough countries agreeing to this, the [UN Environment Programme] secretariat will be forced to put it on the agenda,” said the climate minister.
Going through the treaty’s text with a fine-tooth comb, he found it confounding that there was no mechanism to show how the polluters would pay to countries that were getting polluted, he said, giving the example of small island nations which generate less plastic waste, but get ashore anyway from the rest of the world. He also asked developed nations to stop exporting their plastic waste to “countries like Pakistan” and using them as “junkyards”.
 
 

Interestingly, in his address at the informal ministerial dialogue on investment opportunities for a plastic circular economy, he said, “When I look at the green financing, I find that the same countries that are consuming plastics are the countries that are getting green financing,”, putting the blame squarely on countries with a bigger plastic footprint.

Musadik Malik says he is ‘extremely disappointed’ at UN system, as plastic talks remain stalled

Talking to a packed hall, he warned, “Injustice is unsustainable and if we do injustice to nature; it is not going to care… it will retaliate, and we shall all suffer.”
Giving the example of coal, he added, “We are all interwoven as one global village, or so I believed, up until the geopolitical tectonic plates moved. And when they moved and some countries started to use coal once again, other countries were forbidden from using it. I find that perplexing… how can coal in one country be black and another country be orange with yellow polka dots. So sometimes, naive as I am, I don’t get the geopolitics of the world. The plastics [pollution] is, frankly, no different.”
“I told them to listen to us; we’re not voiceless and don’t ramrod us,” he told Dawn over the phone from Geneva.
‘Race to the bottom’
Billed as the most important environmental deal since the 2015 Paris climate accord, the 10-day summit with delegates from 184 countries has yet to agree on a definition of “plastic pollution” itself.
“They’re just squabbling over where the semi-colon is going to be placed; the number of brackets in the text continues to grow; no wonder nothing gets done,” said Dr Malik.
He was not the only one. European Union environment chief Jessika Roswall found there to be “more square brackets in the text than plastic in the sea”.
Dr Malik said he was extremely disappointed with the way the UN system works. “Is this how you deal with matters that affect the lives and livelihood of people?”
From Geneva, Rachel Radvany, environmental health campaigner at the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL), told Dawn: “What was meant to be a global effort to solve the plastics crisis has stalled.”
She further said, “As in the climate space, it’s the countries least responsible for the problem that are fighting the hardest for an ambitious treaty… while producers are in a race to the bottom, with some even questioning whether the treaty is about plastic.”
“The written jargon-infested statements were benign to say the least; everyone agreeing and endorsing each other that the world needs to do something about the plastic waste, yet offering not a single solution,” said Dr Malik, adding that it had been exhausting.

A special ceremony was held in Islamabad’s Jinnah Sports Stadium with senior civil and military leadership in attendance. Among the senior dignitaries present at the event were President Asif Ali Zardari, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, Inter-Services Public Relations Director-General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, federal and state ministers, and foreign officials.
Addressing the event, PM Shehbaz said: “The time has come for us to move beyond political division, personal interest and empty slogans to adopt collective thinking for Pakistan. On this great day today, I once again, with an open heart, invite all political parties, stakeholders and civil society to become part of Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan.”
He said this was not a plan to revive the ‘Charter of Economy’ but in the greater national interest so the whole world could see that “differences have their own place but we are all one for the sake of our beloved Pakistan”.
The prime minister said the country would not give space to another ‘fitna’ after the many sacrifices in the fight against terrorism, adding that everyone had the right to protest, to criticise and to conduct politics, but not to riot and vandalise, to defame and curse and to rebel against the state.
The premier paid tribute to the nation’s founders and ideologues whose “leadership and efforts changed history and geography” and to the country’s armed forces for their performance in May’s military conflict against India, saying that country was dealt a “historic lesson” that its future generations would remember “for eternity”.
PM Shehbaz also thanked Pakistan’s allies for their support and solidarity on the international arena amid the tensions with India.
“I am also grateful to US President Donald Trump and his team for playing a strong role in the ceasefire. I am hopeful that for regional peace, Trump will play his role in peacefully resolving the Kashmir issue in accordance with UN resolutions.”
The prime minister said that while celebrating independence and Marka-i-Haq, Pakistanis must think about those still struggling for their freedom, whether it was in “Gaza’s blood-soaked streets or in occupied Kashmir, where the blood of innocent Kashmiris runs and turns the rivers red”.
He added, “Pakistan clearly states that it will stand with its oppressed brothers and sisters. What is happening to the Palestinians is a test of our humanity. Pakistan will fight … until our Palestinian and Kashmiri brethren get their rights.”
The prime minister subsequently unveiled a digital model of the Marka-i-Haq Monument.

The countdown to midnight and Aug 14 culminated in a spectacular fireworks display in the capital’s sky while the national anthem was played.
Different branches of the armed forces paraded before the attendees. Military personnel from Turkiye and Azerbaijan also participated in the parade.

Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal had said last month that this year’s Independence Day would be celebrated under the banner of “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth) to demonstrate the nation’s resilience, progress and pride.
The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India since the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as “Marka-i-Haq” in May.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took a US-brokered ceasefire for both sides to finally agree to cessation of hostilities.</p><small>2025-08-13 20:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618708-bhc-admits-petition-challenging-cellular-internet-shutdown-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>BHC admits petition challenging cellular, internet shutdown in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

“If the first one goes okay, we’ll have a quick second one,” Trump told reporters. “I would like to do it almost immediately, and we’ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelensky and myself, if they’d like to have me there.”
Trump did not provide a timeframe for a second meeting. He is to meet Putin in Anchorage, Alaska on Friday.
Trump also said Russia would face consequences if Putin did not agree to stop the war.
“Yes, they will,” he said.
He did not spell out the consequences, but he has warned of stiff economic sanctions if no breakthrough can be achieved.
Trump spoke after holding talks via telephone with European leaders and Zelenskiy about his meeting with Putin.
“We had a very good call. He was on the call. President Zelensky was on the call. I would rate it a 10, very friendly,” he said.
Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron said that Trump said that Ukraine must be involved in talks about territory in any ceasefire deal with Russia.
The comments were the first indication of what came out of talks between Trump, European leaders and Zelensky, intended to shape Trump’s meeting with Putin in Alaska on Friday.

Trump’s insistence on involving Ukraine, if confirmed, could bring a measure of relief to Kyiv and its allies, who have feared that Trump and Putin could reach a deal that sells out Europe’s and Ukraine’s security interests and proposes to carve up Ukraine’s territory.
Trump and Putin are due to meet in Alaska on Friday for talks on how to end the three-and-a-half-year-old conflict, the biggest in Europe since World War Two. Trump has said both sides will have to swap land to end the fighting that has cost tens of thousands of lives and displaced millions.
On a day of intense diplomacy, Zelensky flew into Berlin for German-hosted virtual meetings with European leaders and then with Trump. The Europeans worry that a land swap could leave Russia with almost a fifth of Ukraine and embolden Putin to expand further west into the future.
Putin is bluffing: Zelensky
Zelensky said that he warned Trump ahead of his talks with Putin that the Russian leader was “bluffing” about his desire to end the war.
“I told the US president and all our European colleagues that Putin is bluffing,” he said at a joint briefing in Berlin with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. “He is trying to apply pressure before the meeting in Alaska along all parts of the Ukrainian front. Russia is trying to show that it can occupy all of Ukraine.”

Zelensky’s comments, made after a virtual call with Trump and European leaders, come as Russian forces step up pressure on the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, aiming to force Kyiv to give up land.
Zelensky, who said he hoped the main topic of the talks in Alaska would be an immediate ceasefire, added that any discussions regarding territory should be covered during a three-leader meeting.
“Regarding our principles and territorial integrity, in the end, this is all decided at the level of leaders,” he said. “Without Ukraine, it is impossible to decide this. And, by the way, everyone also supports this.”
Zelensky said Trump told him he would debrief him about his talks with Putin.</p><small>2025-08-13 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13173032fd5626c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930667/na-passes-ata-amendments-allowing-3-month-preventive-detention-of-terror-suspects' target='_blank'><strong>NA passes ATA amendments allowing 3-month ‘preventive detention’ of terror suspects</strong></a><br><p>The National Assembly on Wednesday passed an amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997, which reinserted powers granted to law enforcement authorities and the armed forces to detain “suspicious” individuals for up to three months.
Section 11EEEE (preventive detention for inquiry) of the ATA was amended in 2014, providing the government and authorised armed forces and civil armed forces with the authority to conduct preventive detention of individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities. However, this amendment was subject to a sunset clause, limiting its validity to two years, which expired in 2016.
In November 2024, the government quietly introduced the bill in the NA, seeking to grant military and civil armed forces the authority to keep individuals facing terrorism charges in ‘preventive’ detention for up to three months.
The bill to amend the act was moved in parliament by Minister of State for Interior and Narcotics Control Tallal Chaudhry.
 






In its statement of objectives and reasons, the bill read that Section 11EEEE was amended in 2014, and was designed to empower law enforcement agencies to pre-emptively address security threats by detaining suspects for a period not exceeding three months to conduct thorough inquiries
“However, this amendment was subject to a sunset clause, limiting its validity to a period of two years, which expired in 2016,” the bill read.
“Further, the current security situation requires a robust response that goes beyond the existing legal framework. The erstwhile amendment of Section 11EEEE of the act, ibid, are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, armed forces, and civil armed forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security,” it added.
“This provision would allow for the preventive detention of suspects based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, thereby disrupting terrorist plots before they can be executed. This will also provide law enforcement agencies with the legal backing to conduct more effective operations against terrorism,” the bill read. “It would facilitate the use of Joint Interrogation Teams (JITs), composed of members from various law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to conduct comprehensive inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.”
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, the House passed the bill through a clause-by-clause read. Earlier, the House adopted a motion to consider the bill with 125 votes in its favour and 59 against it.
A copy of the bill available with Dawn.com stated that in sub-section (1), the detention of a person arrested under Section 11EEEE, including detention exceeding three months, would be subject to the provisions of Article 10 (safeguards as to arrest and detention) of the Constitution.
The bill outlined an amendment to sub-section (1) of Clause 2 of Section 11EEEE, which reads as follows:
“The Government or, where the provisions of section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case may be subject to the specific or general order of the Government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventive detention of any person who has been concerned in any offence under this act relating to the security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, or public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta, or the maintenance of supplies or services, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry.”
Meanwhile, in sub-section 2, the following amendments were proposed:
“In sub-section (2), for the proviso, the following shall be substituted, namely:
provided that where the detention order has been issued by the armed forces or civil armed forces under sub-section (1), the inquiry shall be conducted by the JIT comprising of a police officer not below the rank of superintendent of police, intelligence agencies, civil armed forces, armed forces, and other law enforcing agencies and for sub-section (2A), the following shall be substituted, namely: (2A) The provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) shall remain in force for a period of three years from the commencement of the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Act, 2025.”
The bill also incorporated an amendment to sub-section 2 Section 11EEEE (preventive detention for inquiry) of the ATA — which is available with Dawn.com — which would grant the armed forces or civil armed forces the power to arrest a “suspicious person” for three months. The amendment was moved by PPP MNA Naveed Qamar.
“In clause 2, in paragraph (a), in section 11EEEE, in proposed sub-section (1), for the expression ‘a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists’, the expression ‘sufficient grounds exist’ shall be substituted,” Qamar’s amendment read.
 






Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said in the House that this law would only be used in specific situations.
“A clause is being added to the bill stating that there are solid reasons for arrest,” Tarar stated. “The arrested person will have to be presented before a magistrate within 24 hours [and] a clause has also been included to be enforceable for a specific period.”
Reacting to the passage of the motion to amend the ATA, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan noted that a similar law was brought previously and branded it a violation of “fundamental human rights”.
“The Supreme Court said these laws were contrary to fundamental rights,” Gohar said. “You cannot touch a single person in the world without a solid reason.”
PTI senior leader and former NA speaker Asad Qaiser assailed the bill and rejected it in his address.
“A new legislation has been passed, where you can be kept in prison for months without permission,” he stated. “These laws can be misused and will target political opponents.”
Qaiser stated that he only wanted peace and commerce in the country, warning that the Constitution was being “destroyed”.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman lamented that Pakistan’s anti-terrorism legislation against corruption and mismanagement made every citizen “inherently criminals”.
“A person is first arrested and then later proven guilty. There is no room for such legislation in the world,” he said.
“Terrorism has not stopped. I cannot even return to my village now,” he added.
“A guest in our area was told that extremists are in control outside. Legislation has made no difference, as this parliament has no importance. They create laws based on signals.”
Addressing NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Fazl told him that “parliament should not be taken hostage” in his presence.
He also called the National Action Plan a piece of “discriminatory legislation”, stating that he rejected it in the past and continued to do so.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also expressed concern over the passage.
“Preventive detention without charge or trial — based on vague criteria — risks undermining due-process guarantees under Articles 10 and 10A of the Constitution and opens the door to abuse. HRCP urges legislators to reconsider this measure and ensure that counterterrorism efforts comply with Pakistan’s constitutional human rights obligations.”
 






Aseefa slams Utility Stores Corporation closure
Separately, First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari assailed the countrywide closure of the Utility Stores Corporation (USC) despite the government’s assurance last year that it would not be.
Established in 1971, USC was a state-owned enterprise (SOE) tasked with supplying essential commodities at subsidised rates, primarily targeting low-income households. It operated over 4,000 retail outlets nationwide. The closure last month of the SOE not only left thousands of employees in a state of shock, but has also triggered deep concern among low-income consumers who depended on the network for essential goods at subsidised rates.
Aseefa recalled the PPP submitting a calling-to-attention notice on the issue of USC outlets’ closure.
“Despite the assurances from the honourable minister sitting here today, we have unfortunately found out that utility stores are being closed and hundreds of thousands of people are now unemployed,” she said.
“As a result, their families are facing severe hardship. This is a clear injustice and we demand a clear answer from the government. I request the government to give attention to this again.”
Minister for Food Security Rana Tanveer acknowledged that he said on the NA floor that utility stores would not be shut down. “This was done in a phased manner; loss-making stores were closed first, and some people on daily wages were fired,” he outlined.
“But there was a separate formula for those on contract and regular [employment] — a package for their future safety was made in not less than Rs20 billion, which we will give them.
“Although I have no involvement in this process, from my understanding, the permanent employees will be adjusted and for those willing to take the package, monetary compensation will be given to them.”
Recalling this year’s Rs20bn Ramazan Package, Tanveer quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that it was better to distribute cash rather than have leakages in the utility stores and have people lining up in the summer.
“Cash payments were transferred directly through a digital wallet, which was of benefit to the recipients as there were no deductions by banks,” he stated.
“I think that this time as well, the recipients of utility stores who used to take items from there will be given cash based on the same formula.
“There is no doubt that utility stores have been closed and people have been protesting,” Tanveer noted, adding that a team comprising Special Assistant to PM Haroon Akhtar, Adviser to the PM on Inter-Provincial Coordination Rana Sanaullah and other officials held talks and resolved the issue.
Responding to the minister, Aseefa said, “I would urge the minister that he had promised his coalition partners in this House that he was not going to close these utility stores.”
She added that the issue had been taken up by the Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue as well, which was told the same.
“I urge the cabinet, I urge the government at this time to please reconsider and please revisit this. And to the downsizing committee: we need to be strengthening our utility stores, not downsizing them and not closing them down.”
NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq then asked Tanveer to arrange a meeting, to which the minister agreed and asked the finance committee to nominate their representative for it.

Karrar Haidri, Vice President of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, said in a statement that the Chinese mountaineer died on Tuesday night after being hit by falling rocks while climbing down from the peak.
“The incident occurred on the Abruzzi Spur route between Camp I and Advanced Base Camp — a section notorious for frequent rockfalls,” the statement read. “Guan had reached the summit on Monday with a group of climbers before beginning her descent.”
According to the statement, recovery efforts for her body are ongoing, while other climbers who also summited K2 that day are now returning safely to base camp. In total, 32 climbers summited the peak on Monday.
Teams with elite Exped, Imagine Nepal, Seven Summit Treks and Alpinist Climber Expedition successfully summited K2 on Monday morning, according to Haidri.
“The strong teams stood on the summit of the world’s second-highest peak and the highest point on Earth, equipped with sensors, marking yet another chapter of human endurance and teamwork,” the statement read.
“The joint team which reached the summit of K2 includes Tao Hu from China, Eduard Kubatov from the Kyrgyz Republic, Gulnur Tumbat from the United States, Zhang Qingliang and Li Na from China and Pasang Tenje Sherpa, Mingma Jangbu Sherpa, Pasang Sherpa, Sona Sherpa and Pasang Nurbu Sherpa from Nepal.”
On behalf of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, Major General Irfan Arshad congratulated all climbers and wished them a safe descent.
Meanwhile, 15 climbers from Imagine Nepal reached the summit of K2, achieving a 100 per cent success rate this season.
“Summiting in August is rare, as the optimal climbing window is generally in July,” Imagine Nepal said in a statement. “The 2025 season faced significant challenges from the jet stream, with high winds limiting opportunities and forcing prolonged waits at base camp.”
According to Imagine Nepal, the expedition was led by Mingma G — who completed his sixth successful summit of K2 — and departed base camp on August 5 and reached the summit on Monday.
The summiters include Mingma G from Nepal; Jangbu Sherpa from the US; Pema Chhiri Sherpa, Aangdu Sherpa, Kami Sherpa, Lakpa Sherpa, Lakpa Tamang Sherpa and Lhakpa Nuru Sherpa from Nepal; Sohail Sakhi from Pakistan; Liu Mihe, Dilixiati Ailikuti, Li Jiang, Guan Jing and Hu Yinghong from China; and Maria Alexandra Danila from Romania.
Imagine Nepal’s statement added that Danila became the first Romanian to summit K2, while Dilixiati Ailikuti from China became the youngest climber to summit the peak. Jangbu Sherpa and Sohail Sakhi completed the ascent without supplemental oxygen.
In a statement, Elite Exped said this year’s K2 expedition tested every ounce of patience, resilience, and teamwork.
“Harsh weather challenged every climber, and many teams turned back. But in the mountains, it’s all about the waiting game — knowing when to hold back, and when to push for the summit,” their statement read.
“Under the leadership of Mingma G, and in collaboration with the teams from Imagine Nepal, Prakash Sherpa’s team from Alpinist climber, SST and Vinayak, our lead IFMGA guide from Elite Exped, the climbers regrouped and committed to rope fixing above Camp 4.”
Elite Exped added that snow was heavy, but through effort, ropes were fixed and a path was opened, leading to a successful summit at 3:32pm PKT on August 11.</p><small>2025-08-13 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1319363638db6e2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930676/at-least-20-dead-in-shipwreck-off-italys-lampedusa' target='_blank'><strong>At least 20 dead in shipwreck off Italy’s Lampedusa</strong></a><br><p>At least 20 migrants died after a boat overturned in the Mediterranean on Wednesday, with many more still missing, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) said.
“Deep anguish for the umpteenth shipwreck off the coast of Lampedusa, where UNHCR is now assisting the survivors. It looks to be 20 bodies found and as many missing,” wrote the agency’s spokesman, Filippo Ungaro, on social media.
 






Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi confirmed the disaster, saying the shipwreck had occurred 14 nautical miles from Lampedusa.
The boat had been carrying 97 people when it turned over, Radio Radicale reported.
Details remained limited but Save the Children Italy said that a baby girl, aged one-and-a-half, appeared to be lost in the shipwreck.
 






RaiRadio1 reported between 12 and 17 migrants missing, and said that 60 survivors had been transported to safety on the island.
The boat, which had already overturned, was spotted from the air by a plane from Italy’s financial police, it said.
Migrants heading to Italy from North Africa often cross in leaky or overcrowded boats via the central Mediterranean route, one of the world’s deadliest, and arrive in Lampedusa.
The UNHCR said on Wednesday that there have been 675 migrant deaths on the central Mediterranean route so far this year.
As of Wednesday, 38,263 migrants have arrived on Italy’s shores this year, according to the interior ministry.
Piantedosi wrote on social media that the episode underscored “the urgency of preventing, from the countries of departure, the dangerous sea journeys and of relentlessly combating the ruthless trafficking business that fuels this phenomenon”.
 






The hard-right government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has cut deals with North African countries from which migrants embark, providing funding and training in exchange for help in stemming departures.</p><small>2025-08-13 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13173329765bdb1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930669/bhc-orders-federal-balochistan-govts-to-file-replies-on-provincial-internet-shutdown' target='_blank'><strong>BHC orders federal, Balochistan govts to file replies on provincial internet shutdown</strong></a><br><p>The Balochistan High Court (BHC) on Wednesday ordered Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan and Balochistan Advocate General (AG) Adnan Basharat to file their replies on the shutdown of internet services in the province.
Last week, mobile data services in the province were announced to be suspended until August 31 over “security reasons”. At the same time, a shutdown of internet services was also reported as former Balochistan chief minister Dr Abdul Malik on Saturday expressed concern over the law and order situation, adding that internet services had not been available in the province for more than a month.
A notification issued by the Balochistan Home Department on August 6 cited the “peculiar law and order situation” in the province as a cause for the suspension.
A constitutional petition was filed against the internet shutdown by Khair Muhammad Shaheen, chairman of Balochistan’s Consumer Civil Society, against the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). A two-member bench comprising BHC Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Sardar Ahmad Haleemi conducted a hearing over the matter today.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the chairman contended that the cell phone was a basic mode of communication for businessmen, students, educational institutions and  others but the government had suspended mobile network and internet services throughout the province “without any plausible justification”, which was negatively impacting children’s education and business activities.
Shaheen said the indefinite suspension constituted a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 9 (security of person), 15 (freedom of movement etc), 18 (freedom of trade, business and profession), 19-A (right to information) and 25 (equality of citizens) of the Constitution.
The petition also added that inter-district and inter-provincial bus services were suspended, due to which the public was “suffering”.
“The contentions so raised require consideration,” the order said. The bench ordered that notices be issued to the respondents, AGP Awan and AG Basharat to file their responses before the next hearing on Friday.
It added that in case of a failure to do so, the secretaries of the interior and information technology ministries were to appear in person on that date.
In November last year, the PTA had announced the government’s decision to suspend internet and mobile services with immediate effect in many districts of Balochistan to ensure public safety, in the wake of terrorist attacks in the province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2025-08-13 14:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618681-chinese-mountaineer-dies-while-descending-k2' target='_blank'><strong>Chinese mountaineer dies while descending K2</strong></a><br><p>

Moody’s Ratings is a credit rating system that evaluates the creditworthiness of borrowers, such as governments, corporations, or financial instruments. According to its website, the agency uses letter grades (Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, etc) to indicate the likelihood of timely repayment, with Aaa being the highest quality and C the lowest. These ratings help investors assess risk before lending or investing.
Within this scale, Caa1, Caa2, and Caa3 all fall into the “Caa” category, signalling very high credit risk and poor standing. Caa1 is the highest within this group (slightly less risky), Caa2 is one notch lower, and Caa3 is the last, meaning the greatest vulnerability to default among the three.
“Moody’s Ratings (Moody’s) has today upgraded the Government of Pakistan’s local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa1 from Caa2,” the international rating agency — one of the top three global rating firms — said in its statement today.
It cited Islamabad’s improving external position and changed the outlook to Pakistan’s rating to “stable” from positive.
Moody’s rating outlooks fall into four categories: positive, negative, stable and developing. A stable outlook indicates a low likelihood of a rating change over the medium term, while the other three categories indicate a “higher likelihood” of a rating change.
“We have also upgraded the rating for the senior unsecured [medium-term note] programme to (P)Caa1 from (P)Caa2,” it said.
 

This table shows the rankings from highest to lowest of Moody’s long-term and short-term categories. — Moody’s

“The upgrade to Caa1 reflects Pakistan’s improving external position, supported by its progress in reform implementation under the [International Monetary Fund’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme,” Moody’s highlighted.
“The Caa1 rating also incorporates the country’s weak governance and high political uncertainty,” the agency noted.
“Foreign exchange reserves are likely to continue to improve, although Pakistan will remain dependent on timely financing from official partners,” it forecasted.
Moody’s went on to highlight that the “sovereign’s fiscal position is also strengthening from very weak levels, supported by an expanding tax base”. “Its debt affordability has improved, but remains one of the weakest among rated sovereigns,” it noted.
Expanding upon the “stable” outlook, the agency said it reflected “balanced risks to Pakistan’s credit profile”.
“On the upside, improvements in the debt service burden and external profile could be more rapid than we currently expect. On the downside, there remains risks of delays in reform implementation required to secure timely official financing, which would in turn weaken Pakistan’s external position again,” it noted.
“The upgrade to Caa1 from Caa2 rating also applies to the backed foreign currency senior unsecured ratings for the Pakistan Global Sukuk Programme Co Ltd,” Moody’s said, adding that it also changed the outlook for the Sukuk programme to stable from positive.
“We have also raised Pakistan’s local and foreign currency country ceilings to B2 and Caa1 from B3 and Caa2, respectively,” the agency added.
It noted that the two-notch gap between the local currency ceiling and sovereign rating was “driven by the government’s relatively large footprint in the economy, weak institutions, and high political and external vulnerability risk”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the rating upgrade and appreciated his economic team’s efforts, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The premier also welcomed the Moody’s “upgraded rating about improvement in the economic outlook for Pakistan from positive to stable”, the report quoted a press release from the PM Office as saying.
PM Shehbaz reiterated that the government was committed to further improving the rating as it was reflective of the economic policies in the right direction.
Hailing the development, Adviser to Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad noted: “While challenges remain, this recognition reaffirms that Pakistan is on a clear path toward greater macroeconomic stability and resilience.
“With Moody’s upgrade, all the three top global rating agencies have now upgraded Pakistan’s ratings with stable outlook,” he pointed out, referring to Fitch and S&P Global Ratings.
 






External position continues to strengthen, although still fragile
“Pakistan’s external position has continued to strengthen over the past year,” Moody’s said, adding it expected further gradual improvements as progress in reform implementation under the IMF programme supports financing from bilateral and multilateral partners.
“In turn, this contributes to continued increases in the sovereign’s foreign exchange reserves, albeit from still fragile levels,” it noted.
“We expect Pakistan to fully meet its external debt obligations for the next few years, contingent on steady progress on reform implementation and timely completion of IMF reviews.”
 
 

“Nonetheless, Pakistan’s external position remains fragile,” Moody’s cautioned.
“Its foreign exchange reserves remain well below what is required to meet its external debt obligations, underscoring the importance of steady progress with the IMF programme to continually unlock financing,” it explained, estimating that Pakistan’s external financing needs were about $24-25bn in FY2026, and similar amounts again in FY2027.
Detailing its rationale for the rating upgrade, Moody’s noted that Pakistan fully met its external debt obligations and added to its foreign exchange reserves in FY2025.
“Reserves rose to $14.3 billion as of 25 July 2025, equivalent to about ten weeks of imports,” it said, comparing them to $9.4bn at the time of the last rating update in August 2024.
The agency also pointed out Pakistan’s successful completion of the IMF programme’s first review, unlocking a $1bn disbursement in May 2025, and a $1bn commercial loan in June 2025 by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
Outlining its rationale for the stable outlook rank, Moody’s observed that it reflected “balanced risks to Pakistan’s credit profile”.
On the upside, it said, a building track record of reforms and revenue-raising measures could unlock more financing, which in turn would further boost foreign exchange reserves and the external position.
 
 

“On the downside, there remains risks of slippage in reform implementation or results, leading to delays in or withdrawing of financing support from official partners,” it warned, saying it could lead to renewed material deterioration in the sovereign’s external position.
“The current government formed after the February 2024 elections faces a significant challenge to continually implement revenue-raising measures without triggering social tensions,” the agency underscored.
Fiscal position improving, but debt affordability remains weak
Pakistan’s fiscal position has improved from very weak levels, reflecting progress in implementing revenue-raising measures, Moody’s observed.
Citing narrowing budget deficits and widening primary surpluses, the rating agency said the government debt affordability was “also improving, although it remains one of the weakest among our rated sovereigns”.
Noting strengthened revenue collection, it said: “We expect the government to continue enhancing revenue administration and compliance, alongside the introduction of new tax measures.”
Noting new taxes introduced on solar panels and e-commerce businesses in the recent budget, Moody’s estimated tax revenues to pick up by another 0.5 percentage points of GDP in FY2026. “However, a decline in SBP dividends will lead to an overall narrowing of government revenue to about 15-15.5 per cent of GDP,” it added.
 
 

“We expect government expenditure to remain contained, even as budgeted defence spending has increased,” the agency stated, noting reduced subsidies to the power sector and debt servicing costs.
“Overall, we expect the fiscal deficit to narrow further to 4.5-5pc of GDP in FY2026 (FY2025: 5.4pc),” the statement added.
Environmental, social and governance scores’ impact on rating
Moody’s also provided its assessment of Pakistan’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) credit impact scores (CISs), which communicate the impact of ESG considerations on the rating of an issuer or transaction.
Pakistan has a ‘CIS-5’ credit impact score, which means ESG considerations have a “pronounced impact on the current rating, which is lower than it would have been if ESG risks did not exist”.
Pakistan’s CIS-5 score “reflects its very high exposure to social and environmental risks, as well as its weak governance profile”, Moody’s statement said.

It then stated the country’s issuer profile scores (IPS) for the ESG categories, which are expressed on a scale of 1-5 points.
“Pakistan’s E-5 issuer profile score for environmental risk reflects the country’s vulnerability to climate change and the limited supply of clean, fresh and safe water,” the agency pointed out.
“Pakistan has an S-5 issuer profile score for social risk. Very low incomes as well as limited access to quality healthcare, basic services, housing and education, especially in rural areas, together with safety concerns, are important social issues,” it added.
“Pakistan has a G-4 issuer profile score for governance risk. International surveys of various indicators of governance, while showing some early signs of improvement, continue to point to weak rule of law and control of corruption, as well as limited government effectiveness.”

Previous ratings
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb already urged Moody’s in July to improve Pakistan’s current Caa2 credit rating during a virtual engagement in July.
Speaking at an event in Islamabad earlier today, Aurangzeb pointed out that Fitch and S&P Global Ratings had already upgraded the country’s credit ratings this year and said he was hopeful of “the third agency” — an apparent reference to Moody’s — doing the same soon.
 
 

Pakistan has been postponing the launch of international bonds since July 2021 due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and resultant poor credit rating, and relying mostly on time deposits from friendly nations to meet external liabilities and stay afloat.
The agency had last upgraded Pakistan’s local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa2 from Caa3 on Aug 28, 2024. It had also changed its outlook to positive from stable for improving macroeconomic conditions.
In late February 2024 — shortly after the general elections — Moody’s had retained Pakistan’s long-term credit rating at Caa3, noting that “political risks are high, following a highly controversial general election”.</p><small>2025-08-13 13:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13172047d669c6b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930670/bilawal-hits-out-at-pm-shehbaz-over-delay-in-k4-project' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal hits out at PM Shehbaz over delay in K4 project</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday criticised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif over the inordinate delay in the K-IV water project, saying he had expected the premier to demonstrate the same speed and efficiency in Karachi as he does in Lahore.
Launched in the early 2000s to ease Karachi’s water woes, the K-IV project has faced repeated delays and cost hikes. With just Rs3.2 billion allocated against the Rs40bn needed, officials fear completion could be pushed back another decade.
Addressing an inauguration ceremony of a new canal for Karachi from Hub Dam, Bilawal said: “The K4 project, we had hoped for Shehbaz speed, but Karachi got Shehbaz slow. This cannot happen that Lahore gets Shehbaz speed and Karachi gets Shehbaz slow, so I will especially request the prime minister to complete the promises as quickly as possible regarding the K4 and this city.”
Bilawal was referring to the famed ‘Punjab speed’, a term coined to describe PM Shehbaz’s swift and efficient governance as chief minister of Punjab.
 


Islamabad’s budget allocation had triggered a kind of rift between the PML-N and the PPP — allies in the ruling coalition.
The Sindh government had expressed strong reservations over the “inadequate allocation” in the federal budget, saying it was taking the matter very seriously and in the process of reviewing the entire budget.
“We have serious concerns not only about this project but also the K-4 initiative,” Sindh Information and Transport Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon had said. “The funds allocated are highly inadequate. The Pakistan Peoples Party is taking these issues seriously and will thoroughly review the budget.”
He had stressed the need for fiscal discipline and smarter resource management at the federal level.
“We’ve submitted formal proposals to the prime minister and urged the federal government to cut down on unnecessary expenditures,” he said. “If revenue is not increasing, it becomes essential to control expenditures. All spending must be managed wisely; otherwise, we’re putting our entire fiscal policy at risk.”
Meanwhile, the new Hub Canal, a significant initiative of the provincial government aimed at addressing the water woes of the city, will add 100 million gallons of water per day (MGD) to the supply.
The Hub Canal project, approved in 2022, included the construction of a new canal and the rehabilitation of the old Hub Canal to further increase water supply in the two districts. The project included upgrading the Hub pumping station, rising main, and Hub Filter Plant from 80 MGD to 100 MGD.
Bilawal said the water from the new canal would be supplied to the Central, East and Keamari districts, hoping that it would be supplied to Lyari and the islands in the future as well.
He said restoration of the old canal was also underway and added that the party would try to secure increased water allocation of 200 MGD for Karachi from the chief minister.</p><small>2025-08-13 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/131800068f32b9b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930668/uk-police-can-disclose-ethnicity-of-suspects-to-curb-misinformation' target='_blank'><strong>UK police can disclose ethnicity of suspects to curb misinformation</strong></a><br><p>British police have been told they can release details of a suspect’s ethnicity and nationality in high-profile and sensitive cases to prevent false information being spread on social media.
Last year, Britain was rocked by days of rioting after the murder of three young girls in Southport after misinformation spread online that the teenage suspect was a migrant.
The issue has remained highly contentious since, with the populist Reform UK party, which is leading in opinion polls, last week accusing police of covering up the immigration status of suspects involved in the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in central England.
That incident had led to anti-immigration protests after the Reform leader of the local council said the suspects were asylum seekers, while police said they could not give out such information because of existing guidance which limited details that could be shared to ensure people received a fair trial.
Under new guidelines from the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing, police forces will now be encouraged to disclose details “to reduce the risk to public safety” and where misinformation was being spread.
 
 

“We have to make sure our processes are fit for purpose in an age of social media speculation and where information can travel incredibly quickly across a wide range of channels,” said Deputy Chief Constable Sam de Reya.
“Disinformation and incorrect narratives can take hold in a vacuum. It is good police work for us to fill this vacuum with the facts about issues of wider public interest.”
A Home Office (interior ministry) spokesperson said they supported the change and would authorise the release of any relevant immigration information in future cases where it was appropriate.</p><small>2025-08-13 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618665-na-passes-anti-terrorism-act-amendment-bill-with-majority-vote' target='_blank'><strong>NA passes ATA amendment, restores 90-day detention powers</strong></a><br><p>

The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge and melting glaciers have become more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since late June. Thousands of people were stranded after rain-induced floods had blocked roads late last month.
On Sunday, a glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) from the Shishper Glacier tore through Hassanabad Nullah, swee­ping away part of KKH and destroying infrastructure.
A statement by Rescue 1122 said today: “The restoration work on KKH has stopped as fresh waves of a flash flood hit Juchar Nullah in Gulmit Gojal in Hunza.”
In a statement earlier today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that rehabilitation work was underway in flood-affected areas across GB.
“Rehabilitation work on KKH is in full swing at Gulmit Gujal. Passengers and vehicles are waiting for the road to be restored on both sides of KKH,” he said, adding that the stranded people were being evacuated through an alternative route of a wooden bridge.
He said that the GB chief minister has directed to speed up the rehabilitation work in Shigar, Ghizer, Hunza, Gilgit, Astore, Diamer, and other areas.
The spokesperson highlighted the impact of climate change-induced disasters on the region, stating, “The rehabilitation work is facing difficulties due to increasing water flow, river erosion and landslides.”
According to the local administration of Hunza’s Gojal area, thousands of passengers, including local and foreign tourists, travelling through this area and China through Khunjerab, remained stranded on both sides as there is no alternative route.
The flood also damaged the optical fibre of mobile and internet services in the area, the administration said, adding, “The increasing water level in the Khunjerab River damaged the electricity transmission near Sost town which caused electricity disruption in areas.”
It also said that heavy machinery was mobilised to restore traffic at KKH.
Separately, a massive flash flood occurred in Juchar Nullah in Hunza’s Gulmit Gojal area after heavy glacial melting on Tuesday evening, according to a statement by Rescue 1122.
The statement said, “The flash flood intensity was high. The flood damaged a bridge and washed away a portion of KKH.”
It said that the flood also swept away thousands of kanals land, trees, irrigation channels, and private and public infrastructure in the Gulmit area.
The statement added that a famous restaurant near KKH, a government-owned tourist facilitation centre and other infrastructures were washed away in the flood.
“The flood destroyed thousands of kanals of forest and fruit trees, orchards, three link roads, three wooden bridges, five irrigation channels, electricity and internet poles,” it added.
Rescue 1122 further said that over 50 locals, who were working on the restoration of water channels, narrowly escaped the flood. “Around 60–70 people repairing water channels narrowly escaped after a last-minute warning from someone who spotted dust clouds racing ahead of the torrent,” it said.
A local named Saeed Jan told Dawn.com that the floods were “unprecedented” as locals never experienced such intense flooding in the nullah. He said, “Floods occurred 20 times in the nullah today with heavy boulders, mud and debris sweeping away everything downstream.”
Earlier this month, cloudburst-induced floods hit Ghizer and Hunza districts, causing widespread destruction to forests, agricultural land, irrigation channels and private properties.
On July 21, heavy rain prompted deadly floods across the Babusar area, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, 10 deaths have been confirmed across the region, with a dozen tourists missing.</p><small>2025-08-13 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1312053427eb236.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930636/finance-minister-notes-room-for-lowering-interest-rate-by-year-end' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister notes ‘room’ for lowering interest rate by year end</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Wednesday that there was room for lowering the monetary policy rate by the end of this year.
After slashing the interest rate by 1,000bps from 22 per cent since June 2024 in seven intervals, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has maintained it at 11pc since May. However, the business community has expressed its intense disappointment over the decision.
Addressing an event in Islamabad today, Aurangzeb said: “The monetary policy rate and the market-based exchange rate are very much the purview of the State Bank of Pakistan and the Monetary Policy Committee.
“Having said that, in my personal opinion, I do think there is room to do more in terms of policy rate, and I am very hopeful that during the course of this calendar year, we will see movement on the policy rate going south,” the minister added.
 


He noted that “whether it was average inflation or core inflation”, there was space for the SBP to lower the rate.
“National security and economic stability are correlated,” Aurangzeb further said.
“In the past 1.5 years, we have made strong progress on the economic front,”  he noted, listing: “Increase in the country’s economy and per capita income, stability in the economic sector, record decrease in financial deficit and inflation, improvement in current account surplus and external account, record increase in foreign exchange reserves and remittances.”
He summed up the country’s current economic status: “On the financing costs, we have moved in the right direction. On the energy side, we are beginning to move in the right direction.
“On the taxation side, the fiscal space we had and whatever we could do in this budget, I am very clear in terms of the direction of travel. We need to bring taxation to a regional competitive level,” he added, stressing that expanding the tax nets and closing the loopholes were necessary for that.
Pointing out that international financial institutions had hailed Pakistan’s economic reforms, and that Fitch and S&P Global Ratings had upgraded the country’s credit ratings this year, Aurangzeb said he was hopeful of “the third agency” — an apparent reference to Moody’s — doing the same soon.
 
 

Aurangzeb already urged Moody’s in July to improve Pakistan’s current Caa2  credit rating during a virtual engagement in July.
Speaking on the recent trade deal secured with the United States, wherein the tariffs were reduced from 29pc to 19pc, the finance czar hailed the “regionally competitive tariff”.
He recalled Commerce Minister Jam Kamal’s meeting yesterday with leading exporters from various segments and termed it a “fantastic opportunity”.
“What I used to say as part of the private sector, it is necessary to implement that when we are public servants now,” Aurangzeb said.
Noting that he previously gave the example of how “Mumbai does not go to Delhi but Delhi goes to Mumbai” at the time of India’s budget, the minister stressed that the government needs to visit the business community itself for consultations.
Economic sectors
During the media briefing, Aurangzeb also highlighted a “double-digit increase” in exports in the textile, IT and pharmaceutical sectors.
Observing an improved “local business environment”, he added: “SME (small and medium enterprises) loans have increased by 41pc. Should it be even higher? The answer is yes. But 41pc is not a small or insignificant number.
“Loans in the agricultural sector have crossed the Rs2.5 trillion figure. Private sector loans have increased by 38pc,” he added.
The finance czar explained that once fiscal discipline is achieved, the government’s borrowing requirement will decrease, and bank and other economic institutions will reach out to the private sector. The government has significantly increased its borrowing from commercial banks, reaching Rs2.7tr by early May.
 
 

He added that the government had reduced its debt servicing by Rs1tr in the past year. “God-willing, our debt servicing will go down by more than 1tr this year as well.”
Recalling his recent meetings with the SBP governor, Aurangzeb emphasised: “We are getting our house in order, which is the federal government. And therefore, it is important that you also take whatever efforts you are making towards the private sector.”
The finance minister also pointed out the record-setting spree at the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which crossed 147,000 points yesterday. He noted a 60pc growth in it, without specifying the timeline.
Aurangzeb highlighted there had been a “record increase” of 65,000 new investors who have come into the PSX over the last year. Company registrations’ annual levels had also gone above 250,000, the minister said, terming both developments as a “big structural change”.
‘Rightsizing of 43 ministries underway’
Speaking about the structural reforms, the minister pointed out the ongoing tariff reforms, which he said were taking place for the first time in Pakistan’s history.
 
 

He highlighted that the reforms aim to explore how to reduce the costs of raw materials and intermediate products so that Pakistan could become an export-led economy.
On the government’s rightsizing plan, the finance czar noted that the process for 43 ministries and over 400 departments was underway. He also reaffirmed that the privatisation of state-owned institutions will speed up this year.
The government had moved well past its original June 30 deadline for completing the rightsizing and has written to various ministries to seek their details.
Aurangzeb also pledged further reduction in energy costs due to the savings from the revised agreements with 27 independent power producers earlier this year.</p><small>2025-08-13 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1315342205a2523.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930645/field-marshal-asim-munir-honoured-with-azerbaijans-prestigious-war-medal' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Asim Munir honoured with Azerbaijan’s prestigious war medal</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir has been honoured with a prestigious war medal by Azerbaijan’s defence minister, the military’s media wing said on Wednesday.
According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Azerbaijan’s Colonel General Karim Valiyev called on COAS Munir at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today.
“On the occasion, Colonel General Karim Valiyev conferred upon Field Marshal Asim Munir, Azerbaijan’s prestigious Patriotic War Medal for ‘Services in the Field of Military Cooperation’, on behalf of President Illham Aliyev, in recognition of his exceptional contributions in Azerbaijan-Pakistan bilateral military cooperation,” the statement said.
Established on May 17, 2002, the medal is a state award of Azerbaijan, awarded to servicemen of the country and foreign states, and other persons for merits in strengthening military cooperation with the Azerbaijani Armed Forces.
Per the statement, Gen Valiyev commended Pakistan’s unwavering efforts in combating terrorism and reaffirmed Azerbaijan’s determination to enhance collaboration in defence and security.
The Azerbaijani leader was presented with the guard of honour by the army upon his arrival, the statement said.
 






ISPR said that both leaders held a meeting to discuss “matters of mutual interest, with particular focus on the prevailing global and regional security landscape”.
“COAS reaffirmed Pakistan’s deep fraternal bonds with Azerbaijan and reiterated the resolve to further consolidate bilateral relations. The COAS also congratulated the visiting dignitary on the successful conclusion of the peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia,” it added.
Azerbaijan’s Valiyev praised the armed forces for their “professionalism and success” in Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, the statement said, adding that the delegation extended best wishes for the upcoming Independence Day and Victory celebrations.
It continued, “COAS thanked Azerbaijan’s leadership and people for standing together with the people of Pakistan during Marka-i-Haq and also for sending the Azeri Contingent for participating in the Independence Day ceremony.”
“Both military leaders expressed a shared commitment to advancing defence cooperation and promoting joint efforts for regional peace and stability,” the statement added.
Islamabad and Baku maintain robust military cooperation. In 2023, COAS Munir visited Azerbaijan, aiming to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and defence collaboration between the two nations.
Last year, Azer­bai­jan signed a massive $1.6 billion deal with Pakistan to acquire JF-17 Block III fighter jets, developed by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group.</p><small>2025-08-13 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13150531cd6b9cc.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930648/incarcerated-pti-leader-ejaz-chaudhry-admitted-to-hospital-as-kidney-infection-deteriorates-health' target='_blank'><strong>Incarcerated PTI leader Ejaz Chaudhry admitted to hospital as kidney infection deteriorates health</strong></a><br><p>Incarcerated PTI leader Ejaz Chaudhry was admitted to a hospital in Lahore on Wednesday as his health deteriorated due to a kidney infection, his lawyer said.
On Monday, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore sentenced Chuadhry and other PTI leaders to 10 years in prison in cases related to the May 9 riots. A day later, the court ordered the confiscation of properties owned by them.
On Saturday, Chaudhry was among other PTI leaders who filed appeals in the Lahore High Court against their convictions by ATCs. He pleaded the court to suspend his sentence and conviction, along with ordering his release on bail. In his second petition, he further requested the court to set aside his conviction and acquit him in the case in the “interest of justice”.
Speaking to Dawn.com today, Chaudhry’s lawyer Rana Mudassar confirmed that various tests were being conducted on the PTI leader, who was shifted to the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute in Lahore on Wednesday morning.
“He is suffering a severe kidney infection and has seven gallstones,” Mudassar said.
The lawyer added that Chaudhry was treated at Kot Lakhpat jail, where he is currently incarcerated, but his health did not improve. “He has lost 22 kgs.”
Last month, a Lahore ATC had sentenced Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema, Rashid and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.
Senator Chaudhry, who has been under medical care for a heart condition, was reportedly admitted to the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) after suffering heart pain on Feb 20.
In March, a Senate committee issued a stern warning over the failure to implement the production order of Chaudhry, emphasising potential consequences for non-compliance.</p><small>2025-08-13 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618652-azerbaijan-top-commander-confers-prestigious-war-medal-on-field-marshal' target='_blank'><strong>Azerbaijan top commander confers prestigious war medal on Field Marshal</strong></a><br><p>

Lakki Marwat police spokesperson Aamir Khan told Dawn.com that the terrorists detonated explosives planted on the pipeline within the limits of the Bhana Manjiwala area of the district.
“Officials have initiated a search operation in the area to locate the culprits,” he said.
He added that the explosion resulted in a large crater at the site, leading to a complete halt of gas supply from the district to Punjab’s Mianwali region.
Following the explosion, a large contingent of police and a bomb disposal squad arrived at the scene and began a search operation in the surrounding area.
Police officials noted that the location had previously experienced three similar attacks on the main transmission gas pipeline.
In July, a gas pipeline leading to Punjab was also blown up near the Wanda Amir area of Lakki Marwat, causing a similar suspension of supply. Later in the month, a gas pipeline was blown up with explosives for the fourth time in a month in the Torwah area, causing significant damage to the pipeline.
Two similar incidents had occurred previously in June. Early in the month, alleged terrorists targeted a key gas pipeline from the Bettani Gas Field to Punjab. Subsequently, a pipeline was blown up again with an improvised explosive device near the Jabbarkhel area, within 10 days of the previous incident.
Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. While security operations brought a period of relative calm, militant activity has resurged in recent years, straining local peace efforts and heightening fears of renewed instability.</p><small>2025-08-13 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1307572126beade.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930557/seales-leads-wi-to-odi-series-victory-over-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Seales leads WI to ODI series victory over Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>TAROUBA: An inspired Jayden Seales led the West Indies to a crushing 202-run victory over Pakistan in the third and deciding one-day international in Trinidad on Tuesday.
The fast bowler blew away the Pakistan top order en route to figures of 6-18 as the tourists were bundled out for just 92 in a chase of 295 to win.
The Windies had reached 294-6 in their 50 overs batting first, powered by captain Shai Hope’s brilliant unbeaten hundred.
 






The Caribbean side sealed a much-needed first ODI series win against Pakistan since 1991, after being swept aside 3-0 and 5-0 in Test and T20 series, respectively, by Australia earlier in the summer.
Pakistan’s reply got off to a horrendous start as Seales removed Saim Ayub, Abdullah Shafique and Mohammad Rizwan inside the first three overs to reduce them to 8-3.
Seales then trapped Babar Azam lbw for just nine to leave Pakistan’s hopes of a 2-1 series win in tatters.
Left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie took two wickets through the middle overs, before Seales returned to remove tailenders Hasan Ali and Naseem Shah and complete a six-wicket haul.
Pakistan had started strongly with the ball after winning the toss and electing to field, as the West Indies struggled to find the boundary.
The home side were 68-3 when Keacy Carty was dismissed lbw by Abrar for a 45-ball 17.
The usually big-hitting Sherfane Rutherford also never got going and crawled to 15 from 40 deliveries.
But Chase helped revive the innings with a quickfire 36, before being bowled by Naseem. Motie was caught and bowled by Mohammad Nawaz as the West Indies batting effort threatened to peter out.
But Hope and Justin Greaves plundered 110 runs from the final 8.1 overs in a blistering assault to get their team close to 300. Hope finished on 120 not out.

Duplantis had looked a little off his best form, missing his first attempt at 6.11 and, after Greece’s Emmanouil Karalis retired having failed twice at the same height, the Swede had the bar raised to make his usual world record attempt.
 






The 25-year-old twice world champion was unsuccessful on his first try and while he rattled the bar slightly on his second effort, Duplantis looked up almost in disbelief to see he had again reached a new height in the discipline he dominates.
“I love Hungary very much. The track is very good, I love the crowd, I would like to return, thank you,” Duplantis said.
Duplantis, who won his second world title in the same stadium in 2023, ran straight to the crowd to celebrate with his partner Desire Inglander and his family.
On Monday, Duplantis missed most of the press conference ahead of the Budapest meeting, apologising when he turned up late, saying he had a lot of work to do on his time management.
“I think I’ll have to make up for it tomorrow with a big leap,” Duplantis said.
He duly stayed true to his word to the delight of the Budapest crowd, and has now soared 15 centimetres higher than Sergey Bubka, who Duplantis once described as ‘mythological’.
The American-born Duplantis first broke the world record in 2020 in Poland, with his leap of 6.17 surpassing by one centimetre the previous record set by Frenchman Renaud Lavillenie six years earlier.
Lavillenie had beaten Bubka’s best jump of 6.14, which had stood for almost 20 years, but Duplantis has taken the sport to another level and on Saturday competes at the Silesia Diamond League, where he also broke the world record last year.</p><small>2025-08-13 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618625-details-of-bureaucrats-having-properties-in-portugal-sought-after-asifs-remarks' target='_blank'><strong>Details of bureaucrats having properties in Portugal sought after Asif's remarks</strong></a><br><p>

India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An Indian official familiar with the matter said a decision has not yet been taken, and that countries usually reserve slots for the General Debate at the assembly, which is why India’s “head of government” features in a provisional list of speakers on September 26.
“The list will go through revisions,” the official said, adding that it had not yet been decided if Modi would be going to the assembly. The General Assembly kicks off on September 9, but the debate, the annual meeting of heads of state and government, will be held from September 23-29.
Although the reason for the potential visit will be to attend the UN meeting in New York, a key objective will be to hold talks with Trump and iron out trade and tariff issues that have led to some souring of ties between the two countries, the newspaper reported.
News of a possible Modi trip to the US comes days after Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods to penalise New Delhi for continuing to buy Russian oil.
The penalty took the total levy on Indian goods exported to the US to 50pc, among the highest levied on any US trading partner.
Trade talks between New Delhi and Washington collapsed after five rounds of negotiations over disagreement on opening India’s vast farm and dairy sectors and stopping Russian oil purchases.
On Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said several large trade agreements were still waiting to be completed, including with Switzerland and India, but New Delhi had been “a bit recalcitrant” in talks with Washington.
Bessent told Fox Business Network’s Kudlow he hoped the Trump administration could wrap up its trade negotiations by the end of October.
“That’s aspirational, but I think we are in a good position,” he said, adding, “I think we can be, we will have agreed on substantial terms with all the substantial countries.”</p><small>2025-08-13 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13104917d5c2275.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930567/new-us-trade-deal-to-help-exporters-expand-footprint' target='_blank'><strong>New US trade deal to help exporters expand footprint</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s exporters are poised to gain a significant competitive advantage in the US market after the government successfully negotiated a reduction in reciprocal tariffs — from 29pc to 19pc — the lowest rate in the region.
An official statement issued by the Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday noted that the reduced tariff will create new opportunities for Pakistani exporters to expand their footprint in the US. The development was discussed during a high-level meeting on US reciprocal tariffs, chaired by Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan.
The meeting was attended by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce Rana Ihsaan Afzal, Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul, senior officials from the Commerce and Industries Divisions, and more than 30 leading exporters and SMEs from key sectors including apparel, textiles, rice, salt, surgical instruments, sports goods, electronics, food and agriculture, and leather.
Commerce Minister Jam Kamal said the revised tariff structure presents a timely opportunity to boost exports and appreciated the coordinated efforts of the government’s economic team, along with private sector support, in achieving this milestone.

Islamabad secures the lowest tariffs among regional competitors

Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar highlighted Pakistan’s comparative advantage in the region and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to supporting industry stakeholders in unlocking business potential under evolving global conditions.
 
 

Industry representatives called for consistent and industry-friendly policies to optimise manufacturing costs and secure access to critical inputs. They urged the government to adopt a predictable policy environment that facilitates long-term planning and growth.
Commerce Minister Jam reiterated the government’s focus on export-led growth, stressing both immediate and long-term strategic measures. He assured exporters that their recommendations would be compiled and presented to the Prime Minister for further action.
It was decided to actively pursue the expansion of Pakistan’s export footprint in the US, turning the current tariff reduction into a sustained national advantage for broader socio-economic development.
Separately, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce Rana Ihsaan Afzal held a meeting with representatives of Octans Digital Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of Interloop Holdings, to discuss sustainability and waste management in Pakistan’s textile industry.

According to police, suspect Mohsin Yasin, a refrigerator mechanic, residing in Kot Khan Muhammad locality, would rape minor boys and girls, record their pornographic videos and blackmail them. He was arrested on Monday.
The police claimed that the suspect escaped from their custody. The CCD teams chased the suspect, who entered a house located on Satiana Road, from where he and his accomplices opened fire on the policemen.
A crossfire took place between the criminals and the CCD teams, following which Mohsin was found lying injured in the house, allegedly in the firing by his accomplices, who fled.
The police said the suspect was shifted to the Allied Hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries.
Meanwhile, as per the police, a suspected cattle thief was allegedly killed in an encounter with a CCD team near Khushal Chowk, Jhang.
The police claimed that the suspect, Mohsin Iqbal Cheema, a resident of Sarwar Colony, died after being hit by bullets fired by his accomplices.
They said Cheema was allegedly involved in dozens of cattle thefts and snatchings. Cheema and his accomplices would sell the stolen cattle heads in the market of Chiniot and Gojra.
RAID: A Kasur CCD police team conducted an unsuccessful raid in Faisalabad on Tuesday to arrest a former SHO of the Railway Road police station, Qalab Abbas Niazi, a co-accused in the kidnap and murder case of a resident of Kasur.
Civil Lines police SHO Zeeshan Khalid Randhawa, another accused in the case of the kidnapping and murder of Ghulam Rasool of Kasur, has already been arrested.
Ghulam Rasool was allegedly kidnapped by the suspects from Kasur and was found murdered near Samundri, Faisalabad, in January 2025.
Sources said that Niazi was presently posted in police lines, but had been absent from duty since August 7.
The police claimed he was not present at the place where the raid was conducted.
