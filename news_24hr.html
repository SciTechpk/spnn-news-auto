The government has confirmed 607 deaths, with another 214 people missing and feared dead, in what President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has called the country’s most challenging natural disaster.
More than two million people — nearly 10 per cent of the population — have been affected.
Survivors will be offered up to 10 million rupees ($33,000) to buy land in a safer location and build a new house, the finance ministry said in a statement late on Friday.
The government is also offering one million rupees as compensation for each person killed or permanently disabled.

 

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said more than 71,000 homes were damaged, including nearly 5,000 that were completely destroyed by last week’s floods and landslides.
Around 150,000 people remain in state-run shelters, down from a peak of 225,000.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it was considering Sri Lanka’s request for an additional $200 million, on top of the $347 million tranche the country was already due to receive this month.
“The IMF remains closely engaged with the Sri Lankan authorities during this challenging period, and is committed to supporting the country as it undertakes urgent efforts to recover, rebuild and promote resilience for the future,” the Washington-based lender said late on Friday.
Cyclone Ditwah devastated swathes of Sri Lanka as it was emerging from its worst economic crisis in 2022, following a four-year, $2.9 billion bailout loan from the IMF agreed in early 2023.
Dissanayake told parliament on Friday that Sri Lanka’s economy had made a significant recovery, but was not strong enough to withstand the latest shock alone.
Meanwhile, the DMC said more rain was expected in many parts of the country, including the worst-affected central region, triggering fears of more landslides.
That has hampered clean-up operations.
However, residents evacuated from the landslide-prone central hills have been told not to return immediately to their homes, even if they were unaffected by the slips.
A fresh landslide alert was issued on Friday for areas not covered by previous warnings.</p><small>2025-12-06 06:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/061047390d3d7f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959533/us-vaccine-panel-upends-hepatitis-b-advice-in-latest-trump-era-shift' target='_blank'><strong>US vaccine panel upends hepatitis B advice in latest Trump-era shift</strong></a><br><p>An advisory panel appointed by President Donald Trump’s vaccine-sceptic health secretary voted on Friday to stop recommending that all newborns in the United States receive a hepatitis B vaccine.
The move to end the decades-old recommendation is the panel’s latest contentious about-face on vaccine policy since its overhaul by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this year.
US health authorities previously recommended that all babies, not just those born to mothers believed to have hepatitis B, receive the first of three vaccine doses just after birth.
The approach aimed, in part, to prevent transfers from mothers who unknowingly had hepatitis B or had falsely tested negative, and had virtually eradicated infections of the potentially deadly liver disease among young people in the country.
After delaying the vote by a day, the panel on Friday passed its new recommendation for “individual-based decision-making,” in consultation with a health care provider, when children are born to mothers testing negatively for the disease.
The decision to vaccinate at birth should “consider vaccine benefits, vaccine risks, and infection risks”.
Trump hailed the move as “a very good decision” on his Truth Social platform.







But the new recommendation was immediately condemned by several medical groups, who noted widespread shortcomings in US maternal health screening as well as the possibility of infections from others.
“This irresponsible and purposely misleading guidance will lead to more hepatitis B infections in infants and children,” American Academy of Pediatrics President Susan J. Kressly said in a statement.
The vote was 8–3.
Trump-appointed officials at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are expected to formally adopt the recommendations at a later date.
The panel also voted to recommend that babies who are not vaccinated at birth wait at least two months to get the initial dose, and that blood tests be done to measure antibodies before a second dose.
Panel overhaul
After becoming health secretary, Kennedy sacked every member of the once-staid Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices (ACIP), replacing them with figures whose vaccine-sceptic views track more closely with his own.
It has since set to work on reviewing prior recommendations — already tweaking advice on Covid-19 and measles jabs.
Medical experts fear the push could further contribute to declining vaccination rates in the United States.
The panel on Friday also began a broader review of the childhood vaccination schedule, and sparked further controversy by allowing testimony from lawyer Aaron Siri, a close Kennedy associate known for spreading unfounded theories on the subject.
While Trump vocally supports Kennedy’s policies, some in the Republican Party have pushed back, notably Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy.
Cassidy, a medical doctor, condemned the ACIP decision, noting the original recommendation was never “a mandate” to get the jab.
CDC officials “should not sign these new recommendations and instead retain the current, evidence-based approach,” he said on X.







Cassidy’s expression of alarm, like his prior statements against Kennedy, provoked criticism after he provided the key vote to confirm the health secretary in February.
‘Do no harm’
The United States had urged universal vaccination at birth against hepatitis B since 1991, advice also recommended by China, Australia and the World Health Organisation.
But several ACIP members argued that Friday’s decision would align the United States with other economically developed countries such as France and Britain.
The repercussions of the ACIP’s vaccine recommendations are broad because federal guidelines often dictate whether vaccines are paid for by health insurance companies in the United States, where a vaccine can cost hundreds of dollars.
But the committee’s influence is waning amid withering criticism from the US scientific and medical community, with Democratic-led states announcing they will no longer follow its recommendations.
Ahead of the vote, Cody Meissner, one of the few dissenting voices on the advisory committee, urged his colleagues not to change the current recommendations.
“Do no harm is a moral imperative. We are doing harm by changing this wording,” he warned.</p><small>2025-12-06 05:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/060913020520918.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959529/imfs-executive-board-to-meet-on-dec-8-to-approve-disbursement-of-12bn-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>IMF’s Executive Board to meet on Dec 8 to approve disbursement of $1.2bn to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Executive Board will meet on December 8 (Monday) to approve $1.2 billion in loans to Pakistan.
The IMF had reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan on its loan programmes in October after extensive talks were held in Karachi, Islamabad and Washington from September 24 to October 8.
The agreement still requires approval from IMF’s Executive Board before funds can be released.
If approved, it would unlock about $1.2bn in fresh financing for the country; roughly $1 billion under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and another $200 million under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
The IMF confirmed the date of the meeting in a brief announcement on Friday. The official calendar posted on the IMF website also showed the Executive Board would review Pakistan’s loan programmes.
Negotiations between Islamabad and the lending agency, led by IMF mission chief Iva Petrova, had focused on Pakistan’s fiscal performance, monetary stance, structural reforms and progress on climate-related commitments.
In its earlier assessment, the IMF noted that Pakistan had made “strong progress” in fiscal consolidation, reducing inflation and strengthening external buffers. It also acknowledged the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) continued tight monetary policy, which has played a key role in anchoring inflation expectations.
Structural reforms — especially those related to state-owned enterprises, energy-sector viability, competition and public-service delivery — were cited as areas where the authorities had demonstrated continued commitment.
The Fund also pointed to advances under the RSF-supported climate agenda, including efforts to enhance resilience to natural disasters, strengthen water-resource management and improve the country’s climate-information systems.
These reforms have taken on greater urgency following recent floods that caused widespread damage to agriculture, infrastructure and livelihoods.
Approval of the reviews is widely expected to bolster investor confidence at a critical moment, as Pakistan continues to stabilise its economy amid external pressures and the lingering effects of flood damage.
Islamabad has been under sustained pressure to maintain fiscal discipline, accelerate energy-sector reforms and continue revenue-mobilisation measures to ensure longer-term stability.
The IMF has warned, however, that risks remain elevated. The economic outlook has been tempered by flood-related losses, and the Fund has emphasised that monetary policy must remain “appropriately tight and data-dependent” to keep inflation within the SBP’s target range.
It has also stressed the need for steady implementation of reforms to strengthen competition, enhance productivity, improve public services and reduce persistent vulnerabilities in the energy sector.
If the Board grants its approval on December 8, Pakistan could receive the disbursement as early as the following day.
Officials in Islamabad hope the inflow will reinforce external buffers, support economic recovery and signal continued international confidence in the government’s reform agenda.
Key report released ahead of meeting
Ahead of the meeting, the IMF had released its long-awaited Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), in which it highlighted persistent corruption challenges in Pakistan driven by systemic weaknesses across state institutions and demanded immediate initiation of a 15-point reform agenda to improve transparency, fairness and integrity.
The report, publication of which is a precondition for the IMF Executive Board’s approval of the loan programmes, estimated that Pakistan could boost economic growth by about 5 to 6.5 per cent over five years if it implements a package of governance reforms beginning within the next three to six months.
The report led to criticism of the government, and opposition parties called for a probe into the “worst financial scandal of Pakistan’s history”.
However, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated last week that the report was “not criticism” but a “catalyst for accelerating long-overdue reforms”.
He maintained that the report acknowledged significant progress in sectors including taxation and governance, and that many of its priority recommendations were “already work in progress”.
The finance minister further said the government was committed to implementing the remaining recommendations as part of broader institutional reforms essential to sustaining Pakistan’s economic turnaround.</p><small>2025-12-06 05:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/061011455ebb7a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959405/returning-afghans-leaving-behind-the-complexities-of-a-different-culture' target='_blank'><strong>Returning Afghans — leaving behind the complexities of a different culture</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Uzma was just a toddler when her family fled the escalating conflict, seeking refuge in Pakistan in 1998. Raised in a new land, she navigated through the complexities of a different culture. Over the years, her identity has been shaped by both her Afghan heritage and her Pakistani upbringing.
“Our life was very good in Afghanistan,” she recalls, a wistful tone in her voice. “I was two to three years old when we came from Afghanistan.”
“The main reason for coming to Pakistan was because of the fights there,” she said.
“When the rocket landed in our street, my brother told my parents that either we would die here or we would have to leave our country,” she said.
“Leaving our country and relatives was a very hard decision.” The trauma of war, the fear of violence, and the uncertainty of the future drove her family to seek safety in Pakistan.
Her educational journey reflects this dual identity. She completed her education in Pakistan.
Despite the challenges, she excelled academically, earning accolades and recognition. “I got 4th position in BSc in Peshawar, then I did MSc in which I got a gold medal and also topped in MPhil.” This success, however, was often overshadowed by the practical difficulties of being an Afghan national in Pakistan.
“The biggest obstacle was in education, like university; there was one quota seat for Afghan students.” The struggle for opportunities extended to the professional world. “There were no job facilities in government sectors, but in private sectors too, they would see whether if a person is Pakistani or Afghan.”
The constant worry about visa renewals and the recent blocking of bank accounts, including the one at her workplace where she hasn’t been paid for two months, adds to the stress.
“We have a lot of fears of deportation. We are only three females: me, my sister and mother. Someone said a few days ago that Afghans living near the airport have to leave the country, and we are not getting visas.”
Uzma and thousands other Afghan women are facing deportation as Pakistani authorities have since Sept 1 launched crackdown to expel more than 1.3 million Afghan nationals with Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders, the last category of refugees legally living in the country without visas.
According to UNHCR spokesperson, Qaiser Khan Afridi, there are several categories of Afghan refugees. The first category includes those with PoR cards. These cards were issued by the government in 2006-2007 following a Nadra registration drive, which registered two million people.
As June 2025, approximately one million PoR cardholders remained. These individuals are considered refugees, meaning they are under international protection.
The second category of refugees is defined by 2017 cabinet decision that outlined comprehensive Afghan management strategy with several components. One component focused on border management to prevent undocumented entry.
Another addressed the lack of specific refugee law in Pakistan at the time, with plans to enact such legislation. A third component involved registering undocumented individuals, which led to issuance of Afghan Citizen Cards (ACCs).
The third category of refugees arrived in Pakistan after Taliban took over Afghanistan including approximately 600,000 people, including journalists, singers and others.

 

Action was taken against undocumented individuals in September 2023 against ACC holders in April 2025, and against PoR cardholders in September 2025.
From Sept 15, 2023, to Dec 2023, approximately 490,000 people left Pakistan.

 

In 2024, an additional 315,000 people departed. In 2025, 1,025,000 people left, including undocumented individuals, ACC holders and PoR cardholders.
International Organisation for Migration (IOM) figures issued on November 28 show that since April 1, 2025, a total of 950,028 Afghan nationals returned, of which 134,118 (14pc) were deported.
Many PoR and ACC holders have resided in Pakistan for 40-45 years. PoR cardholders have access to opportunity, including quota in universities.
According to the available data, approximately 92,000 Afghan refugee students are enrolled in government schools in Pakistan. Additionally, 10,000 students receive non-formal education at home, and 56,000 attend refugee schools. Over 1,000 students are enrolled in universities.
UNHCR provides various programmes, including skills training. They also undertake initiatives like providing textbooks, bags and other facilities.
But while many of the returning Afghan refugees, having been born and raised in Pakistan, face an uncertain future in their country of origin, it is female students, like Uzma, who have to worry about their studies and careers in a country where the puritanical rulers have imposed a complete ban on girls education and employment opportunities for them.

The cabinet met with Chief Minister Sohail Afridi in the chair and ministers, chief secretary and administrative secretaries in attendance, according to an official statement.
It added that the participants took key decisions regarding the distribution formula for reserved seats in medical and dental colleges for students from merged tribal districts, the new proposed posting and transfer policy, the committee report on action in aid of civil powers law, matters related to wheat stock and procurement, the May 9 and 10 violence cases, the formation of the KP Sugarcane and Sugar Beet Board, additional funding for development schemes and other public welfare initiatives.
The cabinet decided that “politically-motivated” May 9 and 10 cases registered without credible evidence would be withdrawn. However, it offered no details.

Sends new posting, transfer policy to its panel for review

It referred the matter regarding the award of medical and dental colleges reserved seats after the bifurcation of South Waziristan district to its relevant committee for deliberation and recommendations to be laid in the next meeting.
Similarly, the new proposed posting and transfer policy was sent to the relevant cabinet panel for review.
The cabinet approved the nomination of mill representatives for the KP Sugarcane and Sugar Beet Control Board for 2025-26.
A detailed briefing was also given on wheat stocks, inter-provincial movement and future strategy. The previously notified committee was authorised to take necessary steps for additional wheat procurement as and when required.
The cabinet also approved financial assistance for the treatment of two patients undergoing kidney and bone marrow transplants. Approval was granted for the release of funds under the District Development Plan and District Development Initiatives to ensure timely completion of projects.
Besides, a special grant of Rs150 million was also approved for the counter-terrorism department.
The forum endorsed the implementation of the recommendations of the committee tasked with proposing measures following the repeal of the action in aid of civil powers law.
It also decided to refer the inquiry into the Radio Pakistan Peshawar attack case to a special committee of the provincial assembly for deliberation and recommendations.
Mr Afridi, who chaired the meeting via video link, issued policy guidelines for strengthening good governance, transparency and the use of modern technology in official affairs.
He said that the provincial government had already provided a clear roadmap for good governance and was actively promoting transparency and digitalisation across all departments.
Directing officials to prioritise online participation in official meetings, Mr Afridi said the approach would not only save time but would also result in significant reduction in government expenditure.
He condemned the recent press conference by federal ministers and declared it an inhuman, immoral and unconstitutional act.
The chief minister said that such behaviour was equivalent to deliberately provoking people and destabilising the situation.
He complained that leader of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Imran Khan and his wife were being subjected to solitary confinement in jail.
“Imran Khan is a leader of the entire nation, while his wife is an apolitical and modest woman, so their mistreatment is unacceptable,” he said.
The chief minister said to ensure institutional transparency and merit, all recruitment in provincial government departments, autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies would be strictly conducted through the Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency.
He said that no recruitment would be made through any private testing agency.
Referring to the recent meeting of the National Finance Commission, Mr Afridi said that his government vehemently presented Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s case about constitutional right to resources and received support from all participants.
He pointed out that the continued denial of the due Rs1.375 trillion share of the merged tribal districts in the NFC Award over the last several years was a grave injustice to residents.
The chief minister expressed concern over the 55-day closure of the Torkham border and said truck drivers as well as the travellers, especially women, children and the elderly, were severely affected.
He directed the administration of Khyber district to immediately ensure provision of food, shelter and all essential facilities to those people.
Mr Afridi also ordered the provision of bulletproof vehicles on a priority basis to civil officers, especially the district administration, and said all hurdles to the procurement process should be removed without delay.

While negotiators assembled a sprawling ‘COP30 package’, the final outcome fell well short of the urgency reflected in science. Still, the conference delivered pockets of progress, clashes over process, and — crucially — signals of where the multilateral system may need to evolve to remain credible in an era of overshoot.
From the outset, COP30 marked by opacity, struggled with questions of procedure and transparency. Week one began smoothly, with the COP presidency proposing a ‘Mutirão’ process to advance pending items. Yet week two quickly turned contentious as key negotiations shifted into closed-door ‘shuttle diplomacy’, leaving Parties without access to evolving text and sidelining champions of ambition. This generated frustration, culminating in several delegations raising procedural concerns during the final plenary. The episode underscored a fundamental lesson: climate multilateralism depends on trust, and trust requires open, participatory processes.

 

The Mutirão decision aims to “set the Paris Agreement policy cycle fully in motion”, launching a Global Implementation Accelerator designed to help countries move from pledges to practice. Science is unequivocal that rapid emissions cuts — at least 60 per cent below 2019 levels by 2030 — are required to retain even a 50pc chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C. Achieving these demands domestic action anchored in long-term strategies, regulation, and investment, particularly from G20 economies. With the next Global Stocktake set to begin in 2026 and new roadmaps announced for transitioning away from fossil fuels and halting deforestation, COP30 created frameworks for future acceleration, even if it did not meaningfully advance ambition now.
The new buzzword defining COP30 was ‘implementation’. One of COP30’s rare multilateral bright spots was the Just Transition Work Programme, showing a modest win. It delivered strong rights-based language and created a pathway towards a future Just Transition Mechanism. Missing, however, were concrete references to fossil fuels or coordinated national transition planning — an omission that reflects ongoing political resistance from several Parties.
Billed as the ‘Adaptation COP’, expectations were high but outcomes limited. While the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience was completed and a set of Global Goal on Adaptation indicators was adopted, many Parties found the results underwhelming and the process opaque. Adaptation finance emerged as a partial win: the call to at least triple adaptation finance by 2035 creates a trajectory for growth, though ambiguity around baseline years leaves room for interpretation. Major work remains to ensure indicators become robust, measurable, and legitimate.

COP30 unfolded under an emerging paradigm: the world is now near certain to surpass 1.5°C in the early 2030s.

COP30 saw movement on the Warsaw Inte­rn­ational Mechanism review and guidance to the new Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage. Yet final texts avoided acknowledging the profo­und need to scale up Loss and Damage finance — effectively relegating a political issue to the techn­ical realm. For vulnerable countries already facing escalating climate impacts, this represents one of the most glaring gaps in the COP30 package.
Momentum for transitioning away from fossil fuels grew rapidly at COP30, with nearly 90 countries supporting a roadmap and Colombia announcing a dedicated global conference for 2026. Yet final negotiated text diluted energy language, reducing references to last year’s UAE consensus and excluding any timelines or operational commitments
Finance remained embedded across discussions but ultimately disappointed many vulnerable countries. The absence of clarity on Article 9.1 and ambiguous adaptation finance framing weakened confidence. On the other hand, the first-ever inclusion of ‘trade’ in UNFCCC text marks a turning point: climate-related tariffs, competitiveness concerns, and supply chain transitions are now central to political discourse. A series of dialogues and consultations through 2029 will shape how climate and trade regimes begin to intersect.
COP30 unfolded under an emerging paradigm: the world is now near certain to surpass 1.5°C in the early 2030s. This reality will profoundly reshape multilateral climate governance. The Paris Agreement’s architecture — rooted in voluntary Nationally Determined Contributions — must evolve to remain effective in an era of accelerating impacts, rising adaptation debt, and growing geopolitical fragmentation.
Three shifts are likely and necessary:
From pledges to performance: A decade after Paris, the multilateral system must move beyond cycles of voluntary commitments towards credible mechanisms that ensure delivery. This does not require punitive enforcement, but it does require stronger transparency, clearer benchmarking, and internationally coordinated implementation frameworks — much like the emerging Global Implementation Accelerator. Future agreements will likely need explicit timelines for fossil fuel phase-out, deforestation halts, and adaptation milestones.
From climate finance to a new global finance compact: Overshoot will magnify the cost of adaptation and loss and damage. The next decade demands a systemic overhaul of global finance: reformed MDBs, new concessional windows, debt relief mechanisms, and finance flows aligned with Article 2.1(c). Without predictable public finance and major private sector mobilisation, both adaptation and just transitions will be out of reach.
From sectoral silos to integrated resilience governance: As 1.5°C is breached, climate will no longer be a discrete environmental challenge — it will be a systemic risk affecting health, food security, migration, trade, and geopolitics. Multilateral governance must integrate climate with biodiversity, trade, humanitarian systems, and financial regulation. Future COPs will need stronger links across treaties, clearer cross-sectoral mandates, and more space for subnational and non-state actors who often deliver faster than national governments.
Ten years after Paris, the promise of a safe future remains within reach only if the system evolves. COP30 revealed both the fragility and necessity of multilateralism. The next phase must turn cooperative ambition into coordinated action — because implementation is no longer a slogan. It is the last pathway left.

Israel announced on Wednesday it would unilaterally open the Rafah crossing to allow residents to flee the Gaza Strip, a move swiftly rejected by Egypt as Cairo insisted on lifting the blockade in both directions to relieve the besieged Palestinian territory.
Egypt refused to facilitate what critics fear is the forced displacement of Palestinians, insisting on adherence to the terms of the United States-brokered peace plan, which mandates full humanitarian access.
The Rafah crossing, the only vital artery to the outside world for the residents of Gaza not controlled directly by Israel, has been shuttered for months, strangling the flow of life-saving aid.
The foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar expressed concern over the use of the Rafah crossing to expel Palestinians.
“The Ministers underscore their absolute rejection of any attempts to expel the Palestinian people from their land and stress the necessity of the full adherence to the plan proposed by US President Donald Trump, including its provisions on keeping the Rafah Crossing open in both directions, ensuring the freedom of movement for the population, and refraining from compelling any resident of the Gaza Strip to leave, rather to create the right conditions for them to stay on their land and participate in building their homeland, within a comprehensive vision aimed at restoring stability and improving their humanitarian conditions,” the statement read.







The FMs also underscored the need to fully sustain the ceasefire and ensure the unrestricted entry of humanitarian assistance into the Gaza Strip. They urged early recovery and reconstruction efforts and to create the conditions necessary for the Palestinian Authority to resume its responsibilities in the Gaza Strip.
The top diplomats of the Muslim countries also emphasised the importance of fully implementing the “Trump Plan” without delay or obstruction, “in order to achieve security and peace, and to consolidate the foundations of regional stability”.
“In this regard, the Ministers underscore the need to fully sustain the ceasefire, alleviate civilian suffering, ensure the unrestricted entry of humanitarian assistance into the Gaza Strip, initiate early recovery and reconstruction efforts, and create the conditions necessary for the Palestinian Authority to resume its responsibilities in the Gaza Strip thereby laying the groundwork for a new phase of security and stability in the region,” added the statement.
The ministers also reaffirmed their countries’ commitment to working closely with the United States and all relevant regional and international parties to ensure the full implementation of UNSCR 2803 and other UN Security Council resolutions. They emphasised the importance of creating conducive conditions for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace based on international legitimacy and the two-state solution.
The ministers underscored that this should lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state along the lines of June 4, 1967, including the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Dar speaks with Saudi counterpart
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar slammed Israel’s restriction on the Rafah border crossing to allow only the exit of Gaza residents, calling it a “clear violation” of the peace plan that finally brought an end to the fighting.
The Foreign Office (FO) said FM Dar held a phone call with Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan today and discussed regional developments, particularly Gaza.
“FM strongly condemned Israel’s unilateral plan to restrict the Rafah crossing for the exit only of Gaza residents, a clear violation of the peace plan and a move that undermines humanitarian access.
“Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring unfettered aid to Gaza and advancing coordinated efforts toward lasting peace,” the FO said.







Negotiations on the next stage of the Gaza ceasefire continue without significant progress at a moment when the truce appears particularly fragile, AFP reported on Thursday.
The first phase included a withdrawal of Israeli forces on October 10 to a line that still gave them military control of over half of Gaza, the release of all prisoners, living or dead, held by Hamas or its allies, and an increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza.
Though all living prisoners were released on October 13, one body is still said to be in Gaza.
For now, the Israeli government demands that the last hostage’s remains are returned before any talks begin on the second phase via mediating countries: US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye.
Egypt will also host a conference on Gaza’s reconstruction that will focus on the territory’s humanitarian needs, but no date has yet been set.
The process seems to be stuck mainly due to the Trump plan’s grey areas.</p><small>2025-12-06 04:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959517/fiscal-concerns' target='_blank'><strong>Fiscal concerns</strong></a><br><p>THREE key takeaways have emerged from the inaugural NFC discussions on the 11th Award. First, the federal government has pitched an ambitious revenue mobilisation plan, proposing to raise consolidated revenues by over 5pc of GDP over the next three years.
The FBR will boost its tax collection by 3-3.5 percentage points to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio to 13pc, while the provinces are expected to enhance their share from the existing 0.28pc to 3pc of GDP through effective taxation on services, property and farm income.
Secondly, the provinces declined to share their expenditure details on legal and technical grounds. Sindh rightly pointed out that the commission is a forum to discuss and decide formulae for dividing tax resources vertically between the centre and provinces, and horizontally among the provinces, and not to dictate how the federating units should spend their money.
By implication, they have indicated their opposition to the centre’s reported proposal that the provinces should share expenses on BISP and HEC.

 

Third, the meeting took up KP’s demand for an additional share from the federal divisible pool in view of increased fiscal needs after the Fata merger. A working group was formed to study the impact of the merger on the provincial budget and address additional fiscal needs under the NFC Award.
Though there was no talk of reducing provincial shares from the divisible pool, the government took the opportunity to highlight the fiscal squeeze it has been facing since the finalisation of the seventh NFC Award that significantly reduced its own share some 15 years ago. It was pointed out that the average annual federal fiscal deficit had risen from the previous 4pc to nearly 7pc since 2011 due to the fiscal squeeze.
That said, the talks on the 11th Award have opened at a politically charged moment amid attempts by the centre to undo the constitutional protection given to the existing provincial share under the NFC Award, and reclaim federal control over population and education through the 27th Amendment. In fact, the government has long been trying to, unsuccessfully, reclaim what it ceded to the provinces under the seventh Award.
Meanwhile, it resorted to indirect taxation, including various levies such as on petroleum products and gas outside the divisible pool to avoid sharing these revenues with the federating units. The numbers, however, show that these additional revenues are insufficient for the centre to meet its growing expenditures and now it wants to boost revenues through the divisible pool itself by increasing the federal share or transferring major expenditures to the provinces.
Although the maiden NFC meeting took place in a cordial atmosphere, there is no guarantee that the centre will refrain from attempting to slash the provincial share or, alternatively, impose new expenditures on the provinces as talks move forward.

The little boy fell into an open manhole near NIPA earlier this week and died.
The Water and Sewerage Committee, led by Leader of Opposition in the City Council Advocate Saifuddin, also criticised what was described as a pattern of “irresponsibility and indifference” of senior municipal officials responsible for handling the case.
The meeting called by the committee was attended by representatives from TransKarachi and the KWSC, but the municipal commissioner, despite being formally asked to provide essential details about the incident, neither appeared nor sent a representative.
After the meeting, the members of the committee visited the site of the incident where Saifuddin while talking to media said that the absence of the municipal commissioner reflected a “clear lack of seriousness from the KMC administration and the mayor’s office” especially given the gravity of the incident.
“Throughout the meeting, the departments attempted to distance themselves from responsibility,” he said.
“The officials from TransKarachi and the water board continued to hold each other accountable rather than presenting factual assessments. The KWSC’s initial report, which asserts that the storm-water drain involved in the incident does not fall under its jurisdiction, was categorically rejected by the committee for being incomplete and unsatisfactory.”
He said that although several officers had been suspended, the action seemed to be an attempt to pacify the public outrage rather than addressing the root cause of the tragedy.
“Four days have passed and the authorities still cannot determine who is responsible for leaving the manhole open. This is unacceptable,” he said, adding that such confusion exposed severe administrative gaps.

Reworking the NFC Award by fiat rather than political consensus is a part of this misplaced effort. This is a mistake that history will neither forget nor forgive.
Ever since the seventh NFC Award came into effect in 2010, it has been characterised in conventional wisdom, either mistakenly or disingenuously, as the real reason for the country’s slide towards fiscal ‘insolvency’. Has the said award been solely responsible for sinking Pakistan’s public finances? This false conclusion is the result of simplistic reductionism and is not borne out by facts.

 

A clinical, dispassionate and thorough analysis of Pakistan’s public finances since 2010 reveals the following facts and underlying trends, most of which are not touched upon in the discourse. Instead, a lazy consensus has developed blaming the seventh NFC Award for the start of the country’s fiscal troubles. As this article will illustrate, this position is not supported by the evidence.
Pakistan’s public finances are under water due to four proximate factors. One, perennial low revenue mobilisation. Two, lack of fiscal discipline on the expenditure side. Third, Covid-19. Fourth, the shock introduced by the rapid slide in the rupee since 2018, especially the large devaluations in 2019 and 2023, combined with the steep hike in the policy rate since. None of these are directly related to the seventh NFC Award per se, or are factors that could not have been anticipated and accommodated with better governance.
Firstly, Pakistan’s public finances have been in deep water since the late 1980s. Profligate spending and chronic low mobilisation of revenue led to persistently high fiscal deficits, resulting in public debt touching around 535 per cent of revenue by 2000. This led to the need for debt relief under the Paris Club in 2001. By 2008, the fiscal deficit had once again shot up to 7.6pc of GDP.

The NFC Award’s real failure is not its formula but the misgovernance of the ruling elite.

While the fiscal deficit did receive an impetus in the first few years after the seventh NFC Award went into effect, a result of the centre continuing to pay for substantial provincial expenditures despite the passage of the 18th Amendment, it was contained from 2014 onwards. Despite the need for additional fiscal resources, the centre made no serious effort to raise tax revenue, with FBR’s tax effort remaining underwhelming. The tax-GDP ratio remained flat-lined at around 10pc of GDP.
In spite of the weak tax effort, growth in federal revenues roughly matched the annual increase in debt servicing from 2012 till 2018. As a result, the ratio of debt servicing to net federal revenue (after provincial transfers) was on a declining path in this period.

 

The real shocks to Pakistan’s public finances have come from 2019 onwards. First of these was the impact of the massive rupee devaluation combined with the steep increase in the policy rate by SBP since then. The rupee has lost 63pc of its value against the US dollar since 2017. Cumulatively, the twin shocks have added Rs23.1 trillion to the public debt stock between 2018 and 2025, accounting for a full 48pc of the increase in public debt over this period. Rather than provincial transfers, the sharp fall in the rupee combined with the skyrocketing of the SBP policy rate have strained public finances. A compounding factor occurred in 2020 and 2021, with the government responding to the Covid-19 shock with a fiscal stimulus amounting to over 4.9pc of GDP.
Together with a perennial revenue mobilisation failure, Pakistan faces a public spending crisis. Nothing illustrates the spending misgovernance as much as the utilisation of the additional resources transferred to the provinces under the seventh NFC Award. Cumulatively, Rs40.4tr has been transferred to the provinces since 2010, ostensibly for education, health services, etc, and yet, the number of children out of school has increased exponentially instead of declining, health outcomes are not better, and nearly every social and development indicator in Pakistan has worsened.
The combined public budget for 2024-25 starkly demonstrates this governance failure. Total government expenditure (federal and provinces combined) amounted to Rs24tr. After paying interest, salaries and pensions, and for defence, an amount of Rs 12.6tr (or $45 billion) was available for discretionary spending. Not enough money for the impact on the lives of citizens to be visible? Where has the money gone? The recently released IMF Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment provides an answer with relation to the corruption of the ruling elite. (Interestingly, to support the political project underway in the country since 2022, a sharp increase in low-efficiency, high-leakage and misdirected public spending has occurred under the watch of the very same IMF).
In summary, the seventh NFC Award is at best a compounding factor but not a proximate cause. Pakistan’s weak public finances predate the award, and multiple governments since have failed to respond adequately by stepping up fiscal effort or introducing guardrails for public expenditure. The real failure is a failure of governance of the ruling elite — unwilling to tax themselves or their constituents, and unwilling to spend the country’s resources on meeting its challenges. This predatory mindset is independent of the nature of the NFC Award.
Having said this, it is also important to recognise that instruments of redistribution of resources, such as NFC Awards, should necessarily be the result of political processes. They should inherently be democratic in nature. In federations such as Pakistan, the NFC Award anchors the project of federalism itself. Hence, technocratic proposals to roll-back the vertical distribution formula, are relics of non-democratic set-ups and thinking — and must be resisted.
The real issue is not how the resources are distributed, but how they are raised and where they are spent. Redistributing the federal divisible pool from mis-spending provinces to a mis-spending centre will not address Pakistan’s fiscal woes.

Sources confirmed that shifting of FCC record to the FSC building will begin today (Saturday), though it may take several days to fully transfer files, systems and administrative units.
IHC Bar President Syed Wajid Ali Gillani and Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja held multiple meetings with Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to convey their concerns.
The law minister had recently said that a decision regarding relocation would be made only after consulting lawyers’ bodies.

Once keen on retaining the prized Constitution Avenue premises of the Islamabad High Court, the newly formed court will begin the process of shifting its record today

Initially, the FCC was supposed to establish its offices at the FSC. However, stiff resistance from the Shariat Court judges forced the newly-formed court to commence operations from the IHC building instead. Following the oath-taking ceremony of the FCC judges at the IHC earlier last month, the new court was temporarily allotted several courtrooms. The FCC administration then began seriously considering keeping the same building permanently — a move that caused unease within the high court.
Amid speculations about a possible relocation, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar visited the old G-10 building last week to evaluate its suitability.
Justice Dogar inspected various sections of the renovated facility, including the Chief Justice Block, and reviewed the pace and quality of repair work. The district judiciary briefed him on administrative matters, ongoing upgrades, and the heavy workload of the family courts operating there.
Officials said the chief justice’s visit was aimed at determining whether the old structure — surrounded by workshops, car washes, low-cost eateries and shops — could feasibly accommodate the daily traffic, staff and litigants of a constitutional court.
Plans to shift the IHC back to its old pre­mises have created a clear divide among lawyers. While the District Bar Association supports the proposal, the IHC Bar Association strongly opposes it, arguing that the G-10 building — which currently handles a heavy docket of family matters — lacks the infrastructure needed for the high court’s expanded operations.
Before the IHC’s shift to Constitution Avenue a few years ago, the record room held around 65,000 files. Today, that number has swelled to over 200,000, with pending cases rising from around 10,000 to 18,000. Lawyers maintain that relocating to a smaller, outdated facility would cripple judicial efficiency.
The ongoing tug-of-war over the Const­itution Avenue premises resembles “a joint family squeezed into an ancestral home,” with each side citing space shortages and competing needs.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had reportedly finalised the FSC building as the FCC’s permanent home days before the 27th Amendment was tabled in parliament. Under the plan, the four FSC judges — who have a relatively small backlog of 56 petitions — were to be shifted to the IHC’s third floor, where four new courtrooms were being prepared by the CDA.
To facilitate temporary operations, the IHC administration allotted seven courtrooms to the FCC. However, after senior staff — many drawn from the SC — assumed duties, space shortages became more evident. The FCC chief justice was accommodated in Courtroom No. 2, previously used by Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, a move that reportedly caused discomfort within the high court.

An official statement said the two sides signed Project Readiness Financing (PRFs) papers for the Karachi-Rohri section of ML-1, Quetta Bus Rapid Transit and Balochistan Water Resources Development Sector – Additional financing.
Under these commitments, ADB would provide $10m to prepare project documentation for the $2bn ML-1 section, $3.8m for the $125m Quetta BRT, and $48m for Balochistan Water Resources Development.
At the signing ceremony, Secretary of Economic Affairs Humair Karim welcomed ADB’s support for these critical projects, which are aimed at significantly contributing to Pakistan’s long-term and sustainable economic growth, addressing the vital urban infrastructure needs of Quetta city, and enhancing agricultural productivity in Balochistan Province. He called upon the Ministry of Railways and the Government of Balochistan to utilise the financing in a timely and effective manner to ensure successful implementation.
ADB’s country director, Ms Emma Fan, appreciated the federal government’s strong commitment to these projects and noted that the Railways Improvement Project PRF was a key step toward railways modernisation.
The Central Development Working Party had last month approved the Rs1.24bn ($3.8m) ADB financing for a feasibility study, design, and procurement standards and documentation.
Also, last month, the federal government announced that it had secured a $2bn financing package from ADB to commence the Karachi-Rohri segment of the Karachi-Peshawar mainline (ML-1) next year, aiming to complete it before December 2028 to facilitate transportation from the multi-billion-dollar Reko Diq Copper and Gold Project.
Likewise, the ADB had last month approved $48m loan for the Balochistan Water project to support the completion of critical project components, including the Churi Infiltration Gallery subproject, development of the Siri Toi Dam command area, and watershed management activities, which were previously delayed due to budgetary constraints. These components are considered vital for enhancing irrigation efficiency, promoting sustainable water use, and mitigating soil erosion caused by floods.
Because of inherent project implementation challenges, the government has started raising international financing to avoid project delays and cost overruns. The ADB’s PRFs are normally intended to support project preparation before formal offtake, by identifying various components and activities during the implementation stage.
For example, the ML-1 PRF enables the ADB and Pakistan’s relevant agencies to work closely to improve implementation readiness and the timely processing of subsequent major loans needed for project execution. PRFs are also used for reform and institutional capacity-building activities to support sustainability, including the development of business plans, compliance with international financial reporting standards, digitisation, and consulting services.
According to the ADB, PRF is a fast and flexible modality that funds activities for project preparation, such as detailed engineering design, capacity building, limited project startup support, and project design pilot testing. Such work ensures high project readiness and minimises startup delays during the initial phase of project implementation.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded two days of talks on Friday with a series of agreements to fortify their economic and political ties, though both had their eyes fixed on what lies ahead in their tense encounters with the West.
From the Russian perspective, the two leaders have laid the groundwork for boosting the economic partnership between the traditional allies, with the countries signing a series of pacts to raise bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030.
After summit-level talks on Friday, Russia and India signed a dozen memoranda spanning infrastructure, energy, pharma and media sectors.
“Under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership, India is pursuing an independent sovereign policy, and it attains great results in the economy,” Putin said, adding that Russia is seeking “multifaceted relations” with India in various sectors.
“It is a matter of happiness that my acquaintance with you is more than 25 years old,” Modi told Putin. The Indian leader added that the biggest strength between the two countries “is mutual trust.”
Modi expressed confidence that the countries could meet their $100 billion trade target before 2030.
Russia on its side pledged to ensure uninterrupted energy supplies to India. The catch is how? India has signalled to drastically cut down on its oil imports from Russia under US pressure.
On the other hand, Putin has exuded confidence in recent comments about the impending peaceful end of the Ukraine war, which could entirely change the business climate.
The pressure from the West to stymie the visit was reflected in an editorial the India-based ambassadors of Germany, France and UK wrote in Indian newspapers, which was disparaging of Putin’s alleged push against ending the war soon.
Not to be left behind in the propaganda contest, Putin officially launched the RT India news channel in New Delhi, which he said will give “millions of Indian citizens the opportunity to know more about the reality of Russia.”







The strength of personal relations between the two leaders has been evident throughout the two-day visit, an RT analysis said. It started with Modi’s “remarkable welcome for Putin on the red carpet on Thursday and their brief drive in a Toyota SUV”.
The visit is also thought to have included discussions on collaboration in the defence and space sectors, as well as talks on the joint production of Sukhoi Su-57 fighter jets.
In a clip released to Indian TV channels, Putin was seen as telling Modi that Russia was working with the US and other partners towards a peaceful settlement of his war in Ukraine.
“India is not neutral — India has a position, and that position is for peace,” Modi told the Russian president as they opened their talks in New Delhi on Friday.
“We support every effort for peace, and we stand shoulder to shoulder with every initiative taken for peace,” he said. In response, Putin thanked Modi for his attention and efforts aimed at resolving the war.
“We had the opportunity — and you gave me that opportunity — to speak in detail about what is happening on the Ukrainian track and about the steps we are taking jointly with some other partners, including the United States, toward a possible peaceful settlement of this crisis,” Putin said.
The Russian president highlighted the joint areas of cooperation between Moscow and New Delhi.
India has been under scrutiny from European and US officials for its purchase of Russian oil since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022.
India has continued to buy discounted Russian oil, despite warnings from Washington that this is partly keeping Moscow’s revenues afloat to fund the Ukraine war.
US President Donald Trump has imposed additional 25 per cent tariffs on Indian imports, raising the total duties to 50 per cent in retaliation.
“New areas are emerging — high technologies, joint work in aviation, space, and artificial intelligence. We have a very trusting relationship in the field of military-technical cooperation, and we intend to move forward in all these areas,” Putin said.
Meanwhile, Moscow will tap into New Delhi’s expertise by establishing a major pharmaceutical plant in Russia’s Kaluga region in collaboration with India. The facility will produce high-quality anti-cancer drugs, according to Russian reports.
India is known as the pharmacy of the world. The South Asian nation makes 60 per cent of the world’s vaccines, supplies over 20pc of global generic medicines, and accounts for 60pc of Africa’s generics.
The 23rd Russia-India Summit coincided with a US push for a Ukraine peace deal while seeking global cooperation. The visit by Putin is also a test for New Delhi’s efforts to balance relations with Moscow and Washington as the nearly four-year war in Ukraine grinds on.
Putin last visited India in 2021. Modi was in Moscow last year, and the two leaders briefly met in September in China during a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit.

ISLAMABAD: The government said on Friday it was considering a “time-bound amn­esty” for cryptocurrency traders, as local banks raised risk and compliance concerns amid more than $250 billion in annual crypto trading reportedly conducted by Pakistani users.
Officials floated the idea at a high-level consultative meeting after a top global cryptocurrency exchange argued that virtual assets could boost Pakistan’s GDP.
“These virtual assets should be considered as part of liquid money supply (M-1) … virtual assets collateralisation will help increase M-1” because these are highly visible and dependable, a Binance team member told the meeting, co-chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Pakistan Virtual Assets Regu­latory Authority (PVARA) Chairman Bilal Bin Saqib.







The meeting had been arranged to discuss and advance work on Pakistan’s National Digital Asset Framework, an official statement said, adding that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor also attended, along with presidents and executives of the country’s leading commercial banks and senior leaders from Binance, including Global CEO Richard Teng.
The meeting examined sovereign debt tokenisation to enhance liquidity, widen investor access and position Pakistan as a regional frontrunner in compliant blockchain-based financial instruments.
The meeting also “outlined principles for a practical taxation and compliance framework, including shifting primary oversight to licensed exchanges, designing a gradual capital gains structure to promote stability and considering a time-bound amnesty to encourage users to move assets onto regulated platforms”, the statement said.

 

Sources told Dawn that the Binance team reported that about 17.5 million Pakistanis were currently registered traders of Binance, including 4m active traders. They jointly hold around $5bn in virtual assets with Binance alone, with annual trading turnover of around $250bn.
Pakistani users with other crypto companies are not part of this. Binance had more than 300m active users, mostly in 22 countries.
“This unlocks $5bn of assets that Pakistani users are now able to invest back into economy in Pakistani rupees,” a Binance official said, adding that “banks could also make withdrawals of stablecoins”.
Binance will determine maximum existing loan liability to the bank through Application Programming Interface (API) used for automated trading, “vastly reducing Pakistani users’ default rates”, the official claimed.
Banks raise concerns
The local banks raised questions about security risks and global experiences to safeguard stakeholders’ — banks and customers — interest, including in terms of money laundering issues.
They were told that Binance could help address those concerns through its experiences in other countries as real-time reporting of any individual users’ virtual assets and balances was traceable and visible.
In addition, the SBP’s participation would allow Pakistani banks to determine borrowing capacity and to hold recognised US dollar assets on the Binance platform, hence increasing Pakistan’s asset base and overall volumes to the Pakistan economy.
“Banks can lend confidently based on visible and verified assets,” a Binance official was quoted as assuring local bank representatives.
The banks were told that SDCs — a term used for “shadow cash” — were usable assets for bank credits and loans, and Pakistan would be able to attract billions of US dollars by providing a new avenue for remittances on top of roughly $38bn sent annually through conventional routes by overseas Pakistanis.
The officials said US infrastructure development funds, USAID and US Treasury-linked credits could further drive dollar flows into Pakistan and “boost GDP and economic growth”, despite inherent challenges.
PVARA Chairman Bilal Bin Saqib, who recently stepped down as special assistant to the prime minister on blockchain and cryptocurrency because of a conflict of interest with his regulatory role, declined to comment on the meeting.
An official statement, however, said he stressed the “importance of viewing digital assets as critical financial infrastructure with significant potential to support financial inclusion, expand access to services for the unbanked and create new opportunities for banks through innovative products, expanded deposits and new customer segments”.
The statement said the meeting reviewed Pakistan’s next steps towards building a secure, well-regulated and innovation-driven digital asset ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on responsible operationalisation of on-and-off-ramp infrastructure, enhanced compliance standards, improved market transparency and stronger integration of regulated financial institutions.
Finance Minister Aurangzeb reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to establishing a robust and forward-looking regulatory environment that supports technological innovation while safeguarding national economic interests.
He called for close coordination between government agencies, licensed global exchanges and domestic banks for modernising the payments landscape, improving financial inclusion and aligning national systems with international standards.
The statement said the participants reviewed opportunities to modernise Pakistan’s digital payments landscape, noting that blockchain-based systems could significantly reduce costs from the country’s $38bn annual remittance flows.
They emphasised the need to build local talent pipelines to meet rising global demand for blockchain and Web3 skills, creating high-value employment opportunities for Pakistani youth.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump’s role in arranging a peace deal between India and Pakistan received a mention in the White House’s National Security Strategy (NSS) released on Friday, even as the document largely focuses on China.
The mention carries particular significance because the NSS is a formal statement of the administration’s policy priorities and global assessment. Highlighting Trump’s diplomacy in South Asia underscores Washington’s intention to boost its influence in the region and lends credibility to his intervention claims.
“President Trump has cemented his legacy as the President of Peace. In addition to the remarkable success achieved during his first term with the historic Abraham Accords, President Trump has leveraged his deal-making ability to secure unprecedented peace in eight conflicts throughout the world over the course of just eight months of his second term,” the strategy states.
“He negotiated peace between Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the DRC and Rwanda, Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and ended the war in Gaza with all living hostages returned to their families.”

 

Trump has repeatedly cited claims that five to seven “brand new, beautiful” planes were shot down during the May conflict between Pakistan and India. In recent comments, he said that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.
While the actual number of losses remains disputed, his remarks have bolstered Pakistan’s version of events and strengthened its diplomatic position. India, however, rejects Trump’s claims, maintaining that it ended the brief air war independently and disputing reports of any Pakistani shoot-downs.
The document also pledges to end “the cynical manipulation of our immigration system to build up voting blocs loyal to foreign interests within our country” and highlights the administration’s recent steps to curb immigration, measures announced this week.
To counter China’s growing influence, the strategy stresses closer engagement with India and other allies. Washington is urged to strengthen commercial and security ties with New Delhi, including through quadrilateral cooperation with Australia and Japan. India is also included among the global partners with whom the US needs to coordinate on strategic priorities, including critical minerals in Africa.
On security, the NSS warns that control of the South China Sea by a hostile power could allow tolls or arbitrary closure of vital shipping lanes. Addressing this challenge will require greater cooperation with affected nations, including India and Japan.
The strategy acknowledged that “conflict continues to shape the Middle East,” but suggested the situation is “less severe than headlines suggest”. It noted that Iran has been weakened by Israeli actions and by President Trump’s June 2025 Operation Midnight Hammer, which curtailed Iran’s nuclear programme.
The document said the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “remains thorny”, but added that thanks to the ceasefire and release of prisoners President Trump negotiated, “progress toward a more permanent peace has been made”. It also recognised that “Syria remains a potential challenge, but with American, Arab, Israeli, and Turkish support, it may stabilise and reassume its rightful place as an integral and positive player in the region”.
Turning to Europe, the strategy expressed strong support for the “growing influence of patriotic European parties”, emphasising that a strong Europe is needed to work with the United States to prevent any adversary from dominating the continent. It linked unchecked migration to Europe’s economic challenges, warning of “the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure”.
The paper cautioned that within a few decades, some Nato members could become majority non-European and called for “cultivating resistance” to address this potential demographic shift.
The Trump administration also reaffirmed that there would be no expansion of Nato, the transatlantic alliance in which the United States plays a central role, a stance that undercuts Ukraine’s hopes as it continues to face the Russian invasion.

ISLAMABAD: After a fiery speech in the Senate by a PTI-backed lawmaker, deploring the absence of rule of law and an unannounced ban on meetings with incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, the ruling party once again held out an olive branch to the PTI, reassuring it that all issues could be resolved through dialogue.
Speaking in the upper house of parliament on Friday, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Poli­tical and Public Affairs Rana Sana­ullah said the PTI had always rejected the path of negotiations, even though all issues could be reso­lved through dialogue rather than deadlock.
He said the government was ready to hold a dialogue with the opposition to take the country forward, but the PTI leadership remained unwilling.
The remarks came after PTI Senator Mashal Yousafzai chided two ministers over the claim that VVIP facilities were available to Imran Khan in jail. She demanded that a committee of the House along with local and foreign media visit Adiala jail to see the facilities for themselves.

 

Without naming the military establishment, the adviser to the premier said, “Those who they want [to have] dialogue [with] are not ready for talks with them.”
According to prison rules, the PML-N leader said, jail meetings meant to incite violence could not be allowed.
“The law and jail rules do not permit a convict or under-trial prisoner to create law and order situation in the country while sitting behind bars.”
Referring to repeated offers made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for talks with the opposition and his desire for a charter of Pakistan’s stability, the PML-N leader said both sides should sit together, confront each other’s viewpoint and reach a consensus. “We are ready to discuss all issues to find out a solution. You can start talks from wherever you want,” he remarked.

 

Earlier, Senator Yousafzai alleged that her party supremo and his spouse were illegally put behind bars and being subjected to inhumane treatment.
She rejected the government claim that VVIP facilities were provided to Mr Khan in Adiala jail. She asked the chair to form a house committee, headed by Rana Sanaullah, so that they visit the jail along with media persons to witness what kind of facilities were being available to the incarcerated leader.
“Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were being denied meetings with their family members,” she said while deploring the public announcement by a minister about “banning all meetings” with him. She wondered how such a decision could be taken about the country’s most popular leader whereas jail meetings with an Indian spy were facilitated. She said the Constitution, law and human rights had become a joke. Referring to the allegations levelled against her by PML-N member Khalil Tahir Sandhu in a talk show, the senator maintained that there was no practice of selling party tickets to contest elections in PTI.
FBR messages
A highlight of the day’s proceedings was an alarm raised by Senator Asad Qasim over the issue of text messages being sent to filers by the FBR containing bank balance and transacted amounts that he noted was a clear breach of the financial privacy and data protection.
Speaking on a calling attention notice, the PTI senator said the SMS were a breach of Section 216 of the Income Tax Ordinance, which prohibits sharing or exposing taxpayer’s data besides violation of the right to privacy guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution. In response, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry confirmed that the FBR had sent messages to filers seeking them to match their bank accounts with their income tax returns. He, however, said messages had been sent to the particular individuals on “detection of discrepancies”. He insisted that the move was not a breach of trust and privacy, and in line with Sections 165-A and 175-A of the ordinance.
However, Mr Qasim insisted that the FBR could only collect data but not broadcast it without taxpayer’s consent. He said due process involving issuance of notice must be followed.
PPP Senator Shahadat Awan, who was chairing the session, said a similar matter was pending before Senate’s standing committee on interior and proposed that the matter be referred to the panel. He noted that Senator Qasim could also raise his point there to which Mr Chaudhry agreed.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar also defended the FBR’s powers under tax regulation framework. He said the mechanism to track suspicious transactions under anti-money laundering was similar to this. He initially expressed reservations over the practice of referring every matter to the committees and insisted there was no need to send the matter for further probe, but later agreed that it be referred to the finance committee, headed by Saleem Mandviwala, which the chair did.
The Senate also passed the “The National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority Bill, 2025”. The bill, moved by the law minister, is aimed at establishing the National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority.

Pakistani and Afghan officials accused each other of instigating the flare-up.
Pakistani officials said that Afghan forces had fired mortar shells on the Badani area.

 

But Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid claimed it was Pakistan that launched an attack on Spin Boldak, alleging that their forces were responding.
Official sources said that Pakistani forces retaliated against the Afghan aggression and returned fire.
There were also reports of fighting on the Chaman-Kandahar highway, but these could not be immediately verified.
A senior official in Quetta confirmed on the condition of anonymity that the exchange of fire started at around 10pm and continued till late night.
The medical superintendent of Chaman district hospital, Muhammad Owais, said that three injured, including a woman, were brought to the medical facility.
There was neither any official word from the Inter-Services Public Relations, nor from the Foreign Office by the time of going to press.

Turkiye, one of the mediators alongside Qatar, recently hosted multiple rounds of talks between Islamabad and Kabul following an escalation of tensions between the two neighbours over the past weeks.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had earlier signalled plans to send a delegation to Islamabad, but the visit has not materialised. The Turkiye-Qatar effort had produced a fragile ceasefire, though the FO spokesperson said the truce had faltered because it was “contingent on a halt in terrorist activities”.
Questioned in his weekly press briefing about the lack of a visit thus far from the Turkish delegation, the FO spokesperson responded: “Pakistan was open, and stands ready. And I believe that the delegation has not arrived because of scheduling issues, and perhaps by a lack of cooperation from the Taliban. This, you have to ask the Taliban regime. So, our position on this remains firm.”
The spokesperson maintained that Pakistan had welcomed the announcement made by President Erdogan about the mediation effort and reiterated the government’s readiness to receive the Turkish delegation and hold negotiations and discussions.
The spokesperson said he was not aware of any schedule for its arrival.
He further stressed: “During last week’s briefing, I was asked that Pakistan and the Taliban regime were not cooperating with this mediation framework initiated by Turkiye and Qatar. Let me emphasise that it is not attributable to Pakistan’s cooperation that the Turkish delegation has not arrived yet.”







Saudi Arabia is also engaged in a separate peacemaking initiative and intends to stay engaged with another round of talks possible in the near future. Pakistan and Afghanistan held a brief but high-stakes round of unannounced talks in Riyadh on Sunday, but the engagement ended swiftly and without progress, as both sides stuck rigidly to their positions, multiple diplomatic sources had told Dawn.
However, the FO spokesperson said he did not know anything about the Saudi talks when pressed for details in today’s briefing.
“Our position on this mediation, as I have expressed it in the last few press briefings and today, is that we, in principle, welcome the mediations. We believe that our position on terrorism from Afghanistan is on moral principles strongly rooted in national and international legality. So, any objective mediation would naturally favour Pakistan.”
“As regards any country offering its mediation, we will react if we receive any request for official proposal for a mechanism of mediation process.”
The spokesperson also elaborated on the government clearing humanitarian cons­i­g­n­ments for Afghan­istan, marking the first controlled reopening of transit trade since routine trade was suspended in October, saying it was done at the United Nations’ request.
“Consistent with our own commitment to humanitarian access and the requests made by UN agencies, the government has officially approved the movement of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan which will take place in three phases: in the first phase, the containers with food items will be allowed; in the second phase, containers carrying pharmaceutical products and medical equipment will be granted access; and in the final phase, containers transporting other essential goods related to education and health will be allowed.”
He said the FO did not intend to categorise the three phases for any purpose other than to ensure the process would be seamless and to determine how humanitarian aid would flow into Afghanistan.
The spokesperson said there were meetings between the FO and the commerce ministry, with the former directed to expedite the procedural formalities.
He said the utilisation of border crossings for the resumption of trade and overall movement would remain closed.
“This decision to allow UN aid was taken in line with our obligation to humanitarian access, and, secondly, Pakistan does not have anything against the people of Afghanistan. The people of Afghanistan are our brothers and sisters. We intend them no harm.”
“While the closure of borders, has a specific context and the rationale behind it still stands. On the issue of aid to the Afghan people, we remain positive and engaged. On the issue of border closure, we would see how far the Afghan Taliban regime in Kabul supports our position to stop the flow of terrorism and terrorist elements from their soil into Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-12-06 01:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/060833520df92b7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959481/border-disruptions-put-200m-medicine-trade-at-risk' target='_blank'><strong>Border disruptions put $200m medicine trade at risk</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Repeated closures of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border have brought bilateral medicine trade to a standstill, leaving hundreds of trucks stranded and “jeopardising” nearly $200 million worth of pharmaceutical exports, industry sources said.
Industry representatives warn that the ongoing blockade at Torkham and Chaman is crippling pharmaceutical supplies to Afg­hanistan, spoiling temperature-sensitive drugs, and exposing Pakistan to massive commercial losses at a time when exporters cannot afford another shock.
They argue that Afg­h­anistan remains Pakistan’s largest overland trading partner and the main transit route for onward access to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kaz­a­khstan. Each shutdown cuts Pakistan off from these landlocked economies, disrupts regional connectivity projects, and undermines multilateral investments tied to the Pakistan-Uzbekistan-Afghanistan railway and other corridor initiatives.
“The closures are now so frequent that they have become a structural threat, forcing countries investing in this route to consider more predictable alternatives. For Pakistan’s pharmaceutical sector, the impact is already severe,” said Tauqeer ul Haq of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA).
“Almost all exports to Afghanistan have stopped, and containers carrying antibiotics, insulin, vacci­nes, cardiovascular dru­gs, and other essential medicines are stuck at border crossings, dry ports, and warehouses. The delays have pushed local manufacturers toward irreversible financial losses. In one case, a single firm has products worth Rs850 million stranded at Torkham and Chaman, while more than fifty companies face similar setbacks.”

South Africa are appearing for the first time since 2010, when they drew with Mexico in the opening match but failed to reach the knockout stage.
Fellow hosts the United States and Canada will join the party the next day, against Paraguay and a playoff winner — possibly Italy — respectively in Los Angeles and Toronto.
Defending champions Argentina were grouped with Algeria, Austria and Jordan, while five-times winners Brazil will play Morocco — semi-finalists in 2022 — Haiti and Scotland.
The Scots are appearing in the finals for the first time since 1998, when they lost to Brazil in the opening game.
France’s first game will be against Senegal in a repeat of one of the biggest tournament upsets, when the Africans stunned the then-holders in their first game of the 2002 tournament.
England will start against Croatia, who beat them in the 2018 semi-finals, and also face Panama, who they beat 6-1 in the group stage in the same tournament.
The teams outside the hosts’ groups will have to wait until Saturday to find out the venues and kickoff times for their games after FIFA attempts to optimise venues and kickoff times relating to the various worldwide TV markets.
A newly introduced seeding system ensures that the current top four in the world — Spain, holders Argentina, 2022 runners-up France and England — cannot meet until the semi-final stage if they win their groups.
The 48 teams — including six still-to-be-decided playoff winners — were divided into 12 groups of four to produce a mammoth 104-match schedule across 16 cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, culminating in the final in New Jersey on July 19.
Venues and kickoff times will be announced in another globally broadcast event on Saturday, though even that is subject to adjustment in March once the six playoff qualification spots have been filled.

Trump, who has campaigned aggressively this year for a Nobel Peace Prize, was given FIFA’s inaugural peace prize for his efforts to promote dialogue and de-escalation in some of the world’s hotspots.
Amid TV cameras and flashbulbs from the international press, Trump dominated the scene at Washington’s Kennedy Center on Friday, placing himself squarely at the center of one of the biggest events in the sporting world.
The United States, along with Canada and Mexico, will host the soccer tournament next year. The prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, and the president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, were there, too, but it was all Trump’s show.
“This will be unique, this will be stellar, this will be spectacular,” Gianni Infantino, the gregarious president of FIFA, soccer’s global governing body, said at the opening of the ceremony, talking about next year’s games.
But he could have been talking about the Kennedy Center event itself, which was located in Washington at Trump’s urging.
Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli sang “Nessun Dorma,” a favorite of Trump’s and a staple at his campaign rallies, to launch the proceedings.
“Nobody ever thought a thing like this could happen,” Trump said before proceedings got under way, omitting the fact that the United States hosted the World Cup in 1994.
Last month, FIFA announced that a new annual award called the FIFA Peace Prize would be presented at the draw to “reward individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace.”
A video prior to the presentation celebrated Trump for resolving the war in Gaza and trying to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. The trophy, a gold-plated globe carried by upraised hands, was considerably larger than the Nobel, which is just a simple medal.
But Trump got a medal as well and donned it as Infantino lauded him. The president deserved the award for “promoting peace and unity around the world,” Infantino said.
Trump called the award “an awfully nice tribute to you and the game of football, or as we call it, soccer.”
He took a moment to congratulate himself. America, he said, was “not doing too well” before he took office.
“Now, I have to say, we’re the hottest country anywhere in the world,” Trump said.
Trump received the award the same week his administration froze immigration applications from 19 countries after last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington.
It also came days after the president demeaned Somali immigrants in the United States as “garbage” — sparking an outcry both at home and abroad.
Earlier, Trump told reporters he did not care about the prize, but noted that he had “settled eight wars” in his 10 months in office.
“I don’t need prizes. I need to save lives,” Trump said. “I saved millions and millions of lives, and that’s really what I want to do.”</p><small>2025-12-05 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637645-ptis-barrister-gohar-urges-de-escalation-after-isprs-hard-hitting-presser' target='_blank'><strong>PTI's Barrister Gohar urges 'de-escalation' after ISPR DG's hard-hitting presser</strong></a><br><p>

In a blistering press conference earlier today, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric.
Separately, PTI figures, in recent days, have staged demonstrations outside the prison. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had staged a sit-in outside the prison after he was barred from meeting Imran for the eighth time, while Imran’s sisters also staged sit-ins on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the minister said that strict action would be taken against any individual who creates a law and order situation outside the prison, including arrests and the registration of legal cases.
“If anyone tries to create a law and order situation outside the jail, they will be dealt with very harshly. The gloves are off,” Tarar emphasised.



He added that during her recent visit, Uzma violated jail rules and the law when she discussed politics with Imran, thus she would not be allowed any more meetings with the ex-premier.
“Meetings happen in accordance with the law and jail rules,” he said, adding that the jail superintendent reported this. “It is written in the jail manual that well-being and legal matters can be discussed, but not politics. She violated these rules, and she has been barred from meetings.”
The minister added that when Uzma emerged from the meeting, she said Imran “was angry and frustrated”.
“It means that he cannot find a way out of the punishment for the mega corruption £190 million case and sees no political future for himself,” Tarar said.
“We truly believe he is a mentally ill man,” he added.
When asked about the Inter-Services Public Relations director general’s press conference earlier today, Tarar said he endorsed every word on behalf of the civilian government and stated that Imran is a threat to the country.
“This person’s party prayed for the country to come to the brink of default and wrote to the IMF declining a bailout without thinking about the effect on citizens, the chaos, or the economy,” he said.
The information minister reiterated that on May 9, PTI supporters staged riots nationwide and destroyed state property, including monuments to martyred soldiers.
A day prior, the federal government ruled out any further meetings for Uzma and others who violated the prison code while meeting the PTI founder.
Addressing a press conference with Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on the entire situation, the information minister announced: “There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen.”
He added that reports of incitement against the state and its officials had surfaced. “Meetings are banned for anyone who violates the rules,” Attaullah said, adding that it was not right for people to hold meetings and then go on to peddle “Indian and Afghan stances and orchestrate posts against the army and the army chief”.</p><small>2025-12-05 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0522374047f136a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959371/ptis-barrister-gohar-appeals-for-reducing-tensions-after-disappointing-ispr-briefing' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Barrister Gohar appeals for reducing tensions after ‘disappointing’ ISPR briefing</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali appealed to pro-democratic forces to help reduce political tensions, expressing “disappointment” over a briefing by the military spokesperson targeting the party and former premier Imran Khan.
In a blistering press conference earlier today, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
The majority of the DG ISPR’s 90-minute press conference focused on criticising Imran, the party and its government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“This is the time for everyone to acknowledge one another, make space for each other and eliminate the lack of trust. I appeal to all pro-democracy forces to play their role in reducing tensions,” said PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar in a post on X, reacting to the military spokesperson’s remarks.
Gohar said he had always held hope that tensions would ease and relations would improve, but expressed that he was “disappointed” by the press conference held by DG ISPR.
“The defence of the country is paramount. PTI’s narrative has never been, nor will it ever be, anti-state. It is regrettable when state institutions and political figures label each other as mentally ill or perceive each other as threats. Pakistan belongs to us, and so does the army; we have demonstrated this in practice and will continue to do so.”
He further urged that the conduct of “certain non-stakeholders”, without specifying who he was referring to, should not become a cause of tension between PTI and the institutions.
Barrister Gohar said Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were incarcerated and the overall situation would improve if permission were granted for meetings with them.
“The country cannot afford tension and chaos,” Gohar concluded.







On a different note, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said: “A troubled response is not a political strategy.”







Meanwhile, Shahid Khattak, Imran’s nominee for the parliamentary leader in the National Assembly, said insulting remarks against KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi were an “insult to the entire Pakhtun nation and the tribal people”.

Pakistan has long been viewed as having potential in both tight and shale gas, which are trapped in rock and can only be released with specialised drilling, but commercial output has yet to be proved.
Managing Director Ahmed Lak told Reuters that OGDCL had tripled its tight-gas study area to 4,500 square kilometres after new seismic and reservoir analysis indicated larger potential. Phase two of a technical evaluation will finish by the end of January, followed by full development plans.
The renewed push comes after US President Donald Trump said Pakistan held “massive” oil reserves in July, a statement analysts said lacked credible geological evidence, but which prompted Islamabad to underscore that it is pursuing its own efforts to unlock unconventional resources.


Ahmed Hayat Lak, Managing Director and CEO of the Oil & Gas Development Company Limited, speaks during an interview with Reuters, during the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025, in Islamabad on April 9. — Reuters

“We started with 85 wells, but the footprint has expanded massively,” Lak said, adding that OGDCL’s next five-year plan would look “drastically different”.
Early results point to a “significant” resource across parts of Sindh and Balochistan, where multiple reservoirs show tight-gas characteristics, he said.
Shale pilot ramps up
OGDCL is also fast-tracking its shale programme, shifting from a single test well to a five-to-six-well plan in 2026-27, with expected flows of 34 million standard cubic feet per day (mmcfd) per well. If successful, the development could scale to hundreds or even more than 1,000 wells, Lak said.
He said shale alone could eventually add 600 mmcfd to 1 billion standard cubic feet per day of incremental supply, though partners would be needed if the pilot proves viable.
The company is open to partners “on a reciprocal basis”, potentially exchanging acreage abroad for participation in Pakistan, he said.
A 2015 US Energy Information Administration study estimated Pakistan had 9.1 billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil, the largest such resource outside China and the United States.
A 2022 assessment found parts of the Indus Basin geologically comparable to North American shale plays, though analysts say commercial viability still hinges on better geomechanical data, expanded fracking capacity and water availability.
OGDCL plans to begin drilling a deep-water offshore well in the Indus Basin in the fourth quarter of 2026, Lak said. In October, Turkey’s TPAO, with PPL and its consortium partners, including OGDCL, were awarded a block for offshore exploration.
A combination of weak gas demand, rising solar uptake and a rigid LNG import schedule has created a surplus of gas that forced OGDCL to curb output and pushed Pakistan to divert cargoes from Italy’s ENI and seek revised terms with Qatar.</p><small>2025-12-05 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637616-extremist-imran-khans-adiala-jail-meetings-completely-banned-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's Adiala jail meetings completely banned: minister</strong></a><br><p>

In a bid to improve air travel safety, Indian authorities have introduced new stricter regulations limiting pilot flying times and placing tighter restrictions on their operation of night-time flights.
Airports across India have been in disarray since Monday, with the private carrier blaming the disruption on “unforeseen operational challenges”.
On Thursday, IndiGo admitted to aviation regulators that “misjudgement and planning gaps” in adapting to new rules led to the operational meltdown, even though it had two years to prepare for the switch.
The new rules came into effect last month with the aim of giving pilots more rest periods to enhance passenger safety.
India’s civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said the ‘Flight Duty Time Limitations’ rules “have been placed in abeyance with immediate effect”.
“Without compromising on air safety, this decision has been taken solely in the interest of passengers, especially senior citizens, students, patients, and others who rely on timely air travel for essential needs,” Naidu said in a statement.
Naidu said his ministry expected that “flight schedules will begin to stabilise and return to normal by tomorrow”.







IndiGo, which cancelled all domestic flights Friday from New Delhi and Chennai, apologised for “the immense inconvenience and distress” caused to travellers.
In a video statement, the company’s CEO Pieter Elbers said late Friday the relaxation of the rules was “of great help” but there was “still lots of work in progress”.
Friday was the “most severely impacted day” with “well over a thousand” cancellations, Elbers said.
He added that the company expected cancellations to fall below 1,000 on Saturday ahead of a return to normal between December 10 and 15.







IndiGo, which commands 60 per cent of India’s domestic market, operates over 2,000 flights a day.
The carrier admitted it failed to plan properly ahead of a November 1 deadline for the measures’ introduction. And with air travel now approaching its December peak, that has forced widespread flight cancellations this week, which have stranded thousands of travellers.
“These last few days, we have [had] a serious operational crisis,” it said in a statement. “While this will not get resolved overnight, we assure you we will do everything in our capacity to help you in the meantime.”







Following a request by IndiGo, India’s civil aviation authorities granted it a temporary exemption from some of the new rules on Friday to help it deal with the crisis.
IndiGo had earlier flagged that it did not expect to fully restore operations until February 10, though on Friday it said there should be “progressive improvement” from Saturday.
Other major Indian airlines, including Air India and Akasa, have not had to cancel flights due to the new rules.
Hundreds of flights cancelled, passengers vent anger
On Friday, Delhi airport announced all IndiGo departures were cancelled for the day, a number that a source put at 235 flights. Chennai airport also announced all departing IndiGo flights were cancelled.
The airline cancelled 165 flights in Mumbai, 102 in Bengaluru, 92 in Hyderabad, airport sources, who declined to be named, said. Other major metro airports saw IndiGo flights up to 6pm (5:30pm PKT) cancelled on Friday.

At many airports across the country, crowds of stranded passengers voiced their frustrations, aggressively arguing with staff.
Social media platforms and local media were flooded with videos of angry travellers.
“Down with IndiGo! Down with IndiGo!” a group of passengers at Bengaluru airport shouted in protest, a video post on X showed.
Another video showed a father shouting at IndiGo crew members, demanding a sanitary pad for his daughter.







A post on X from earlier Friday morning showed dozens of young children sitting inside a Delhi airport terminal.
“Kids waiting since 4am for their IndiGo (flight) … hungry, tired, sleepy,” read the post’s caption.
IndiGo receives exemptions from new pilot duty rules
Shares of IndiGo dropped nearly 3pc on Friday, taking their weekly slump to 10.3%. India’s main opposition party has demanded a discussion on the issue in parliament.
The new pilot duty rules mandate that pilots can only make two night-time landings per week, down from six previously.
That provision was put on hold for IndiGo until February 10 by India’s civil aviation regulator. The airline was also temporarily exempted from a rule specifying maximum flight duty periods for pilots doing some night flying.
IndiGo said it will offer waivers on all cancellations and booking changes for travel between December 5 and December 15. The airline has also arranged ground transportation and thousands of hotel rooms for stranded customers, it said.</p><small>2025-12-05 15:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051917311ee3589.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959364/pakistan-will-definitely-launch-sovereign-stablecoin-crypto-czar-says' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan will ‘definitely launch’ sovereign stablecoin, crypto czar says</strong></a><br><p>Chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) Bilal Bin Saqib announced that Pakistan is set to launch its first “stablecoin” as part of its drive to make virtual assets a part of the economy.
The PVARA is an autonomous federal body governed by a multi-stakeholder board including the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and the chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue. Its mandate is to curb illicit finance, protect consumers and unlock opportunities in fintech, remittances and tokenised assets, while fostering Shariah-compliant innovation through regulatory sandboxes.
A stablecoin, according to Bloomberg, is a digital token whose value is intrinsically linked to a physical currency, such as the US dollar, making it more stable than other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.­
Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai, the crypto czar said that Pakistan will “definitely launch” a stablecoin, adding that the country is working on both that and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).
“I think it is a great way to collateralise the government debt,” Saqib said. “We want to be at the forefront of this financial digital innovation that is happening. Why should we be at the tail-end of it when we have the muscle and the adoption?”







The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) said that Saqib also participated in a panel discussion on the future of virtual assets and emerging-market regulation, according to a post on their X account.
“He emphasised that for countries like Pakistan, clear and innovation-friendly crypto regulation is a key driver of economic growth,” the post read. “Pakistan’s work on stablecoins, data frameworks, and banking the unbanked can become valuable case studies for the world.”







Earlier this year, Saqib unveiled the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He announced the reserve after delivering a keynote address before an elite audience, which included United States Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 in Las Vegas.
In May, the government announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.</p><small>2025-12-05 15:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637604-cleric-engineer-muhammad-ali-mirza-released-from-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Cleric Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza released from Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>

At the beginning of his press conference in Rawalpindi, he talked about a “creeping national security threat” that had become necessary for the military to address.
“That threat emanates from a delusional mindset of a delusional person who has become captive to his own ego, thinking that his wishes are bigger than those of the state of Pakistan,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, in an apparent reference to incarcerated PTI founder, Imran Khan.
“His ego, his wishes, and frustrations have grown to such an extent that he thinks that the world would cease to exist without him.”
The DG ISPR added that it would be “a bit strange to see it coming from me, but the narrative that person is pushing is no more about politics now but has become a matter of national security.”
According to Lt Gen Chaudhry, it was “very important” for the military’s media wing to clarify, remove all ambiguities and doubts, and say what needs to be said. “We need to understand how this narrative is working, and unfortunately, how it is working in deep collusion with external actors.”



He continued: “To understand that, first, I will set the stage by repeating something that the armed forces have been saying again and again, that we are the armed forces of Pakistan, we don’t represent any ethnicity, don’t represent any language, religious inclination, political thought or school of thought. We have people from all areas of Pakistan, all religions, all sects, all languages, and all political views, but we put all that aside once we wear this uniform.
“That is our pride, that is our honour; we strive, we die daily not for some language, area or political viewpoint. We strive and die on a daily basis for the people of Pakistan, for the integrity of Pakistan. And that we say very clearly, and we also don’t come from the elite class of Pakistan, we belong to the middle, lower-middle, and the poor socio-economic classes; we do not carry the flag of any political actor, class or elitism; This is your armed forces, and we are absolutely clear about the character of the armed forces of Pakistan, starting from a soldier all the way up to his field marshal,” he said.The DG ISPR added that if someone attacked the armed forces and its leadership for the sake of their ego, delusional mindset and narcissistic way of thinking, “then we will also come and fight bare-knuckle, there should be no doubt about that,” he said.“That is why we request again and again, you must be doing your politics. We respect all political parties and personalities, but please keep your politics away from the armed forces of Pakistan; don’t drag us into it. We don’t want to be part of your politics. That is why we need to communicate a few things clearly.”
Lt Gen Chaudhry then pointed out ways in which Imran’s rhetoric was harming the armed forces.
“First, no one can be allowed to create fissures between the people and the armed forces of Pakistan. Why? Because this is the only armed force that you have. You don’t have a choice; this country doesn’t have any other armed forces. You can have an opinion or observation about the forces, and if that could be a constructive observation or criticism, you are most welcome to do that. But that doesn’t allow you to instigate or provoke the people of Pakistan against the army and try to create a gap between the two.”
He said that it was the armed forces that were standing between the Hindutva mindset in India and their hegemonic design, and the people of Pakistan.
“It is these armed forces that are standing between the khawarij, terrorists, fitna al-khawarij, fitna al-Hindustan operating from Afghanistan and the people, and we also know for a fact that every country has an army. It is a famous saying that there will always be an army in a country, but if it is not yours, it will be your enemy’s. So, the one who attacks their own army and its leadership, is he trying to create space for someone else’s army? What is his design? Why is he trying to do that?
“We are clear, and the people of Pakistan are clear that this cannot happen, because they understand, we understand, that you can fool some of the people all the time,” he said.
Continuing to assail the PTI founder, the DG ISPR said that whenever someone meets “this person”, he keeps aside the law, Constitution and rules and plays the narrative against the state of Pakistan, especially the armed forces of Pakistan and its leadership.
“Tell me, under which law, rules and Constitution can this be allowed? Which politics in Pakistan allows you to go and meet a convict, and a narrative is continuously built from there against their own country’s armed forces? Which constitutional provision allows this?” Lt Gen Chaudhry questioned, referring to PTI’s demand to allow them to meet Imran at Adiala Jail, where he’s been imprisoned since 2023.
“You talk about Article 17 of the Constitution and freedom of expression, it clearly says that freedom of expression and political activity are permitted, subject to reasonable restrictions. Under reasonable restrictions, nothing can be allowed that will be against the security and integrity of the state.
“Article 19 says freedom of expression is allowed, it absolutely is, but such freedom of expression cannot be allowed that goes against the security, integrity and defence of Pakistan. Is it written [in the Constitution] or not? So, under which law, constitution, or rules, when you meet a convict, he spins a narrative against the army and its leadership? This is beyond our understanding.”
Citing some examples, the DG ISPR recalled how Imran had been “spinning this narrative by trying to stop remittances to Pakistan so that the country defaults.”
“He then writes a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), asking it not to enter into any agreement with the country so that the state could default. He then resorts to civil disobedience, doesn’t pay electricity bills, so that anarchy is spread in the country. Let me give you another example from a few days ago: He (Imran) tells his followers to target the leadership of the army — the army which stood against an economy and an armed forces eight times bigger than it during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and Marka-i-Haq. And doing so, they gained respect for the nation.”
He then questioned who would actually benefit from such a narrative, adding that anyone living in Pakistan could not have such an agenda against the country.
“That agenda can only come from someone in Delhi. Someone sitting there and guiding that — who wishes that this army, which is your armour against kharjis and terrorists, sacrificing their lives — stops doing it. This agenda and narrative cannot come from elsewhere,” he said.
It is also worth mentioning that while he did not mention Imran’s name throughout the presser, he showed a video clip containing Imran’s anti-army tweets to prove his point.
Pointing out to certain social media accounts, the DG ISPR asked, “From where are these accounts run? No one knows. And when the party [PTI] is asked about where the accounts are run from, they say they don’t know it either, but they completely own the narrative that is being spread through these accounts.”
Calling Imran a “mental patient”, the DG ISPR recalled how a tweet was posted on Imran’s X account two days ago, which went viral within minutes.
“A lot of unnamed, troll accounts are involved in making the post viral. These accounts are being operated from outside Pakistan. They carry forward this narrative, but they originate from this mental patient’s post”.
He said that the Indian media and the accounts linked to the Indian-intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) were making the posts viral.
“The Indian media is reporting against your army chief with such happiness. Who is providing this narrative to them? They air this narrative for hours. Why are they spending so much money on spreading the narrative of this delusional mindset of this narcissist? There is one reason, because he is speaking against the army and its chief. He is talking about creating a rift between the Pakistani army and the public.”
The head of the military’s media wing added that Afghan social media, being “facilitators of the khawarij”, was also involved in spreading Imran’s anti-army rhetoric.
“Why wouldn’t they do it? Because someone here is saying things about the Pakistan army and its leadership, then why will they not do it? They all operate simultaneously, and then the international media picks up such news, too. It is a collusion because they have the same purpose and the same enemy, i.e. the Pakistan Army and its leadership.”
Referring to Imran’s harsh comments against PTI members who attended a function at the National Defence University (NDU) in Islamabad and terming them as traitors, the DG ISPR said: “By that logic, he is also saying that anyone in the ISPR and army is also a traitor, because they too went to NDU, he believes anyone who even is linked [to the army] is a traitor.”
Continuing to assail the PTI founder, the DG ISPR said: “I will again repeat that you can fool some of the people all the time, you can fool all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.”
He said the time had come “for an end” to the PTI’s “political trickery”.
The military spokesperson also slammed the persistent speculation over the issue of the notification for the chief of defence forces and questioned the “obsession” with the army.
He questioned why the PTI continued to talk about the army instead of the governance of its government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and its performance against terrorism.
“Please grow up. Talk about real issues.”
The military spokesperson also criticised the PTI for its policy and stance on the issues of terrorism, Afghanistan and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“Tell me, can the state’s security be sublet? Is appeasement a security policy?”
The DG ISPR quipped that if Kabul or New Delhi would be the ones to ensure Pakistan’s security.
“The world knows that security is only granted by standing tall against the evil, the aggressor, there is no other way … had appeasement granted security, Libya and Gaza wouldn’t be in the situation that they are in today.
“We know that without this state, we neither have any identity, nor any worth, nor any politics, that is why we are ready to sacrifice our lives every day, because we are absolutely clear
“Similarly, we are also clear that anyone’s person and politics cannot be above the state for us.”
The DG ISPR also wondered why the PTI and its founder called for talks with terrorists.
“Firstly, he is a mental patient. Apart from that, there are two more reasons. One, there is a terror crime nexus … there is political patronage and terrorists provide them with protection. The terrorists act against law enforcers, FC personnel, security forces and anyone who stands against them. There is a huge economic interest and there is a political reason also … the only story that comes out of KP is security … there is a narrative of the army being behind terrorism so that no one questions them about governance in the province where they have been in power for the past 12-13 years.”
He said even more could be found if one looked for them.
“It is clear to us that what is happening, why it is happening and why it is being carried out. We need to tell that this business of lies and deception will not continue anymore in Pakistan. This cannot be allowed.”
DG Chaudhry said that if anyone thought their person and politics were bigger than the country’s security, they would be wrong to do so.
“The Pakistan Army is standing and will keep on standing. We are not going anywhere. We have taken an oath for the protection of this state.”
The military spokesperson also criticised the KP chief minister and said no one talked about the province’s governance from the PTI but kept focusing on the army.
“If the barking dog barks, don’t pay attention to it.”
Questioned about a ban on the PTI, the military spokesperson said: “The state is above the army. It is all wise. It is their decision. What they do and why they do. You need to ask them. … We are not politicians … the state has much more vision and clarity.”
The DG ISPR was also asked about the imposition of governor’s rule in KP and said it had nothing to do with the army, adding that the government had to decide on the matter.
He said it was for the government, Parliament and all stakeholders to decide the future course of the province.
Headquarters of chief of defence forces
The DG ISPR congratulated the nation on the chief of defence forces (CDF) headquarters beginning its work today, stating that it was one of the most important steps towards providing the requisite synergy and jointness for military operations in the country.
“This was debated a lot in the media, and we understand that the character of warfare has changed — now there are multidomain operations taking place. It’s no more just land, sea and air; it’s in space, it’s in cyberspace, it is the informational domain, it’s intelligence-based, and war is fought in multiple domains,” he told reporters.
“The wars have become violent, short and intense, so to get efficiency, efficacy and economy of effort in that, the CDF headquarters was a long-awaited essential requirement, and it’s not only in Pakistan, but there are more than a dozen countries, almost more than 70 countries, where synergetic headquarters of the chief of defence are available,” he said.
The chief of the military’s media wing added that the CDF headquarters had been established on the directives and orders of the parliament; therefore, it was a “monumental and great day for the national security of Pakistan”.</p><small>2025-12-05 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05185420618d4d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959360/crackdown-against-passengers-using-fake-documents-to-intensify' target='_blank'><strong>Crackdown against passengers using fake documents to intensify</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Friday decided to intensify its crackdown against passengers attempting to travel abroad using fake documents.
Recently, several incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crackdown on migrant smuggling following last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives.
The interior minister subsequently declared that anyone attempting to travel on incomplete or bogus documents would be stopped under all circumstances.
In a special meeting held in Islamabad under the chairmanship of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain, it was decided to make the protector issuance system foolproof with reforms to be introduced in the immigration system to facilitate passengers.
The federal ministers sought final recommendations within seven days.
‎An effective crackdown was ordered against those involved in the business of fake visas and agent mafias. Naqvi said an AI-based pilot application would be launched in Islamabad from January to curb illegal immigration, enabling authorities to determine in advance who was eligible to travel and who was not.
The interior minister said that deported individuals would not be reissued visas after their passports were cancelled, adding that there would be zero tolerance for fake visas and agent mafias.
“We are in contact with other countries to improve the ranking of the green passport. People going abroad through illegal means damage the country’s reputation. Immigration reforms aim to facilitate the public and improve our global standing,” he added.
Naqvi also said that the National Police Bureau would issue a standardised international driving licence.
Meanwhile, Hussain stated that a fully transparent protector system was the need of the hour, since it was essential for individuals travelling on labour visas to possess authentic documents.
He said the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis would extend full cooperation to the Ministry of Interior in improving the protector and immigration systems.
‎The meeting’s participants also reviewed measures regarding action against illegal migrants and individuals with incomplete documentation. E-driving licences, protector stamps and immigration matters were discussed in detail.</p><small>2025-12-05 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637577-takeaways-from-ispr-dg-lt-gen-chaudhrys-press-conference' target='_blank'><strong>Takeaways from ISPR DG Lt Gen Chaudhry's hard-hitting press conference</strong></a><br><p>

At the start of the hearing, Chatha filed a fresh application requesting the court to allow both accused to record their statements under Section 342 of the Criminal Code of Procedure (CRPC) and to present witnesses in their defence. The court issued a notice to the prosecution on the application and briefly adjourned the hearing until 10am.
When proceedings resumed, Chatha argued the application himself, stating that the 342 statement submitted by the state counsel was not theirs and had been filed without the accused being informed.
He maintained that during cross-examination, the state counsel was given a questionnaire of 33 questions, which was later used to prepare a 342 reply that the defence does not accept.
Chatha also informed the court that a no-confidence application had been filed against state counsel Taimur Janjua and insisted that the accused must be allowed to submit their own statement.
He also read out the names of proposed defence witnesses, which include Ahmed Noorani’s mother, journalist Mudassar Naru’s mother, Sardar Akhtar Mengal, poet Ahmed Farhad, journalist Arifa Noor and others. Chatha added that the witnesses could appear physically or online, subject to the court’s approval.
Representatives of the bar, including District Bar President Naeem Gujjar, Raja Aleem Abbasi, and Riasat Ali Azad, supported Chatha’s plea, arguing that the right to a fair trial required the court to record the accused’s personal statements under Section 342.
They maintained that no case could proceed without ensuring that the accused were fully aware of the contents submitted on their behalf.
The prosecution began its arguments after the defence submissions, disputing the claim that no forensic examination had been conducted and asserting that the matter had already been examined. The prosecution also cited Supreme Court precedents to support its position.
During the proceedings, the state counsel submitted written closing arguments.
Judge Majoka briefly exited the courtroom, prompting slogans from some lawyers before he returned.
After arguments on various applications and the prosecution’s main submissions, the court adjourned the hearing until Monday, December 8.</p><small>2025-12-05 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637559-us-lawmakers-express-concern-over-worsening-human-rights-crisis-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>US lawmakers express 'concern' over worsening human rights crisis in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>
