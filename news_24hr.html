More than 100 bodies were brought to a hospital in Ahmedabad after the incident, local police told Reuters.
Air India said the Boeing 787-8 aircraft was carrying 242 passengers and crew members, it said, adding that the injured were being taken to the nearest hospitals.
 






Flight-tracking website Flightradar24 said signal from the plane was lost less than a minute after take-off from the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at 1:38pm (1:18pm PKT).
According to air traffic control at the Ahmedabad airport, the aircraft gave a “Mayday” call, signalling an emergency, but thereafter, there was no response from the aircraft.
 






According to The Guardian: “The Air India tragedy in Ahmedabad is the first time a Boeing 787 Dreamliner has crashed.
“While airlines using the Boeing plane have had widespread problems with engines on the 787 plane, leaving many having to ground planes and reduce flights, the 787’s safety record in service has been so far good,” the report by Guardian’s transport correspondent Gwyn Topham added.
Al Jazeera also reported that it was the “first crash ever of a Boeing 787 aircraft”, citing the Aviation Safety Network database.
 






Rescue operations
Visuals from right after the crash showed debris on fire, with thick black smoke rising up into the sky near the airport. TV channels also showed visuals of people being moved in stretchers and being taken away in ambulances.
In its statement, Air India detailed that 169 Indians, 53 British, seven Portuguese and a Canadian national were among the people on board, with the nationalities of the 12 others not specified. Times of India quoted the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) as saying that the 242 people comprised 230 passengers, two pilots and 10 crew members.

In one of the worst aviation disasters in India, two passenger planes collided mid-air near New Delhi in 1996, with the loss of all 349 on board both flights.
Decades earlier, an Air India Boeing 747 flying from Montreal to London in June 1985 crashed into the sea off Ireland with 329 people on board and leaving no survivors.
India’s airline industry has boomed in recent years, International Air Transport Association (IATA) Director General Willie Walsh last month calling growth “nothing short of phenomenal”.
The growth of its economy has made India and its 1.4 billion people the world’s fourth-largest air market — domestic and international — with IATA projecting it will become the third biggest within the decade.
Air India ordered 100 more Airbus planes last year after a giant contract in 2023 for 470 aircraft — 250 Airbus and 220 Boeing.
India’s domestic air passenger traffic reached a milestone last year by “surpassing 500,000 passengers in a single day”, according to India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation.</p><small>2025-06-12 12:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/121352074606083.jpg?r=135411' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916710/dacoit-with-extensive-criminal-record-arrested-in-punjabs-lodhran-police' target='_blank'><strong>Dacoit with extensive criminal record arrested in Punjab’s Lodhran: police</strong></a><br><p>Police arrested a suspect with an extensive criminal record in Punjab’s Lodhran district, while two other suspected dacoits escaped during an exchange of fire, police officials said on Thursday.
A first information report (FIR) was filed against the suspect at the City Kahror Pakka Police Station on the behalf of the state under sections 324 (attempt to murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) for “deliberately attacking police officers with the intention to kill and assisting his accomplices escape”.
The suspect was arrested in an injured condition by the Crime Control Department (CCD), the FIR said. It added that the police team was present at Allah Warai chowk when they received a tip-off that three armed persons were present at Khudai Phatak area.
“Police immediately formed teams and conducted a raid, when the suspects suddenly opened direct fire on the CCD team,” the complaint said.
“The suspects ran towards the railway track as police resorted to aerial firing and chased the suspects,” the FIR added. “Suddenly, two suspects managed to escape on a motorcycle while taking advantage of the darkness of the night.”
Police searched the area and found one of the suspects in an “injured condition”, the FIR further said. The suspect was wounded during an exchange of fire with his accomplices, it stated.
The suspect identified himself as Gul Sher, a resident of Bahawalpur’s Karpal district, while one pistol and 30-bore ammunition were recovered from his possession.
According to a police statement, efforts were being made to arrest the escaped suspects.
It added the suspect had an “extensive criminal record comprising 15 cases related to murder, attempt to murder, resisting a public servant, and robbery”. The cases had been registered against him in different police stations.
The police record showed the suspect was also a “proclaimed offender”, according to a case registered at the Musafir Khana Police Station Bahawalpur on charges of murder, attempt to murder and resisting a government servant.
In another similar incident, a criminal was arrested in an injured condition following an exchange of fire between police and his accomplices, police said.
They added the suspect, Imran alias Imran Khoja, also had an extensive criminal record and had been previously nominated in 30 cases, including armed robbery.
A case was registered against him at the CCD Lodhran police station under Section 324, 353 186 and 34 of the penal code on the complaint of the state, stating that a police team was present at the Jind Pir bridge when they received a tip-off that two suspects, including Imran, were spotted at Aibak Mor.
Police conducted a raid to arrest them when “three suspects opened direct fire upon seeing the police vehicle,” the FIR said.
The police responded by firing shots as the suspects managed run towards the crop fields, it said.
“The exchange of gunfire continued as police searched the fields using a torch and found one of the suspect in an injured condition,” it added.
The complaint said the suspect was “injured after being shot by his accomplices during the exchange of fire.” He identified himself as Imran, while one pistol and 30-bore ammunition were recovered from his possession.
Police said two suspects escaped taking advantage of the darkness of the night and are being perused while police have blocked the exit routes.</p><small>2025-06-12 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608807-karachi-experiences-36-mild-quakes-in-12-days-other-regions-jittery-too' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi experiences 36 mild quakes in 12 days, other regions jittery too</strong></a><br><p>

Trump unveiled the first such visa aboard Air Force One in April, holding a golden prototype that bore his face and promising the special permit would probably be available “in less than two weeks.”
The visas are not available yet, but the website announced on Wednesday allows interested parties to submit their name, desired visa and email address under a header that says “The Trump Card is Coming.”
Trump previously said the new visa, a high-priced version of the traditional green card, would bring in job creators and could be used to reduce the US national deficit.
The announcement comes as deportation raids are being ramped up across the country, prompting protests, and as Trump’s administration faces ongoing lawsuits and accusations of rights violations over its anti-immigration blitz.
Trump has said the new card would be a route to highly prized US citizenship. He said in February that his administration hoped to sell “maybe a million” of the cards and did not rule out that Russian oligarchs may be eligible.</p><small>2025-06-12 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608814-lahore-scorches-at-50c-felt-temperature-heatwave-to-persist' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore scorches at 50°C felt temperature, heatwave to persist</strong></a><br><p>

• JI says federal govt has ‘literally shelved’ the project
• Sharjeel expresses concerns over earmarking of ‘inadequate’ funds
KARACHI: Lingering for over two decades, the much-delayed K-IV water project now faces another major setback as the federal government has allocated only Rs3.2 billion in the budget against the required amount of Rs40bn for the scheme, sparking fears that the city may have to wait for “another 10 years” or more for the completion of the plan.
Officials associated with the project, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have expressed deep frustration over the paltry allocation, warning that the funding shortfall has derailed any realistic timeline set for the project’s completion.
“Over 63 per cent of the work is already done, and with proper funding, we were confident of wrapping it up within a year,” said one senior official. “But with just Rs3.2bn, we are now staring at a scenario where it could take another 10 years to complete. This delay is devastating for a city already facing an acute water shortage.”
Now, with that timeline missed and funds inadequate for the current fiscal year, experts and stakeholders fear that the K-IV would be held in limbo for years to come.
For a city of over 20 million, already grappling with severe water shortages and infrastructure failures, the delay has real and immediate consequences.
 
 

“Karachi can’t wait another decade,” warned one project insider. “This isn’t just a budget line — this is about water, survival, and dignity for millions.”
The K-IV project, originally launched in the early 2000s to address Karachi’s chronic water supply problems, has witnessed multiple revisions, cost escalations, and bureaucratic hurdles. Despite renewed federal attention in recent years, the latest budget allocation has cast dark shadow on its future.
Adding weight to the criticism, former federal minister for planning, development, reforms and special initiatives Asad Umar — who oversaw the K-IV project during the PTI government from 2018 to 2022 — said the current allocation shows the government lacks commitment.
“The Rs3.2bn allocation suggests the government isn’t serious about building the project,” he said. “It’s merely a political statement, not a development commitment. There was a real momentum. We had a vision and a timeline. This setback is unfortunate.”
It was Mr Umar who had pushed the K-IV forward during his tenure, recommending to the then prime minister Imran Khan that the federal government take over the full funding of the project, eliminating the previous cost-sharing arrangement with the Sindh government.
Under his supervision, the planning ministry had tasked Wapda with completing the project and assigned August 14, 2023, as the proposed inauguration date.
PPP, JI express concerns
Islamabad’s latest move has also triggered a kind of rift between two key federal allies — the PML-N and the PPP.
The Sindh government of PPP has expressed strong reservations over the “inadequate allocation” in the federal budget, saying it is taking the matter very seriously and in the process of reviewing the entire budget.
“We have serious concerns not only about this project but also the K-4 initiative,” said Sindh Information and Transport Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon. “The funds allocated are highly inadequate. The Pakistan Peoples Party is taking these issues seriously and will thoroughly review the budget.”
He stressed the need for fiscal discipline and smarter resource management at the federal level.
“We’ve submitted formal proposals to the prime minister and urged the federal government to cut down on unnecessary expenditures,” he said. “If revenue is not increasing, it becomes essential to control expenditures. All spending must be managed wisely; otherwise, we’re putting our entire fiscal policy at risk.”
Meanwhile, Jamaat-i-Islami leader Monem Zafar echoed similar frustrations during a press conference.
“Against the backdrop of the severe water crisis in Karachi, the K-IV project became the most important plan for the city’s future,” he said. “But it seems the federal government has literally shelved it.”
He referred to the “disparity” in funding priorities.
“Some Rs133 billion was allocated to the Water Resources Division, yet only Rs3.2 billion was earmarked for the K-IV. That’s just 2.5 per cent of the division’s total budget. This clearly shows that those in the corridors of power don’t want to grant Karachi and Karachiites more than a symbolic fraction — no more than Zakat or alms,” said the JI leader.

Babar — a three-term senator, Hilal-i-Imtiaz recipient, and council member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) — highlights his decades-long advocacy, including efforts to regulate intelligence agencies.
The petition seeks to quash an anti-corruption inquiry against him, calling it a baseless “fishing expedition” designed to harass a critic of state institutions.
 






The FIA’s Anti-Corruption Circle (ACC) initiated an inquiry based on a private complaint by Rawalpindi resident Touseef Abbas.
Babar claims he received no details of allegations, complaint copies, or legal basis for the probe despite repeated requests.
The first notice of March 27, 2025 demanded his appearance within 24 hours without specifying charges.
A 12-point questionnaire dated March 28 was sent via WhatsApp on April 11—with a response deadline of April 7 (4 days before receipt).
Babar, who last held public office in 2013 as presidential spokesperson, asserts the FIA’s actions target his human rights advocacy. He cites a 2023 UN report documenting threats against him linked to an alleged ‘Kill List’.
 
 

The petition argues that the FIA violated due process of law provided in Articles 4, 10A, 19, 25 of the Constitution by denying access to accusations.
The petition requested the court to quash the inquiry and all related notices and sought direction to FIA to disclose allegations, documents, and legal basis for the probe.
It also prayed that the FIA may be restrained from arresting or harassing Babar pending the petition’s outcome.
IHC Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas will hear the petition on Thursday (today).

This assurance was given by Country Director of Cambridge Assessment International Education Uzma Yousuf to the subcommittee of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Education, which met at the education ministry with MNA Sabheen Ghoury in the chair. She said everything will be clearer during the inquiry.
On the other hand, during the meeting, MNA Mohammad Ali Sarfraz, who attended the meeting as special invitee, pointed out that several papers were leaked. He also presented paper codes and video evidence to the subcommittee. The committee also stated that in case papers are leaked, the committee will ensure no loss to students, and if paper/s are retaken, they should be retaken immediately so that students can get their results in August this year.
The committee also decided to hear school heads, who, besides British Council, also conduct O/A level exams, in the next meeting.

Subcommittee to probe cost, frequency of CAIE exams held in Pakistan

Recently, the subcommittee was formed to look into the issues relating to A level papers leaked in examinations conducted by Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE) in Pakistan during 2025.
The subcommittee is also supposed to look into the authority and legal cover under which CAIE is conducting examinations in Pakistan, the number of examinations per year, the number of students per year, and cost of each examination. Whereas, it will also look at any remedies and measures taken by CAIE in the past on such incidents of leakage of question papers.
The terms of reference of the subcommittee stated that after hearing all sides, actions will be finalised to safeguard students and get assurance from the CAIE that befitting measures will be taken to compensate students and avert such incidents in future.
“Since today was the first meeting, we got an important briefing, in the next meeting, the CAIE will provide findings of its inquiry report,” said a participant of the meeting.
It is relevant to note here that the main committee, which formed the said sub-committee, in its last meeting had raised alarm over the alleged leaking of Cambridge University’s Advanced Level (A-Level) examination papers in Pakistan, stating that the issue of leaked paper has put the academic future of bright students in jeopardy.
 
 

Headed by MNA Dr Azimuddin Zahid Lakhvi, the main committee had shown its grave concerns over report of leaked papers. The committee had pointed out an alleged incident of leaked paper had raised questions on the integrity of the examination process of Cambridge University in Pakistan. The committee had urged relevant authorities to address these critical concerns promptly.
Whereas, recently, a press release shared by the Country Director of Cambridge Assessment International Education with Dawn stated: “We are aware of alleged leaks of specific exam questions and we fully understand the concerns and frustration these claims cause students and their families. We would like to reassure you that our legal compliance teams will urgently investigate all evidence thoroughly so that results are fair.”
It also claimed, “We have seen a significant amount of fake information, including scam circulation on social media, and we don’t comment on specific allegations during exam series, we don’t want to distract students at an important time.”

• Political leadership and intel agencies’ help enlisted to ensure compliance, root out corruption
KARACHI: Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial on Wednesday detailed a sweeping overhaul of the country’s tax compliance system, vowing to crack down on non-compliant sectors, expand digital monitoring, and address longstanding loopholes in the tobacco, retail and passive income tax regimes.
Speaking to Geo News, Mr Lan­g­rial said that the government’s re­­cent enforcement drive in the sugar sector had resulted in a 39 per cent increase in tax collection without any change in tax rates, and that si­­milar measures are now being rol­led out across other key industries.
“The story of non-compliance in the tobacco sector will fundamentally change, just as it did in sugar,” he said.
 


He acknowledged that raising tax rates on the formal sector often led to market erosion by the informal sector, but said the government’s solution is to target non-compliant businesses directly.
“Sugar mills that were non-compliant have gone out of business due to our monitoring. We are now achieving almost 100 per cent compliance in most parts of the country,” Mr Langrial said.
He also revealed that the Intelligence Bureau was tasked with monitoring FBR teams to prevent collusion and corruption. “Thanks to the IB, we took several actions against black sheep within our own ranks,” he said.
Mr Langrial said similar monitoring has begun in the poultry sector, where initial checks revealed significant under-reporting of production and tax evasion. “One month of monitoring revealed millions of rupees in income tax evasion,” he said.
 
 

On the issue of passive income, Mr Langrial said a new 15pc tax rate on passive income, compared to 29pc on active income, in an effort to address the bias against business investment and encourage investment.
Mr Langrial also addressed comparisons between the salaried and construction sectors, noting that such comparisons are misleading.
“There exists a salaried sector inside construction, and sectors can’t be compared with types of income,” he said, emphasising the complexity of tax policy across different industries.
“We are saying that a person who has Rs50 million in the bank will be taxed at 15pc. This is an attempt to address the discrimination between active and passive income,” he said.

Her social media feed — featuring quirky, funny and optimistic content — was akin to that of any other teenager marking life’s small achievements.
But for Sana Yousaf, a bubbly girl from Chitral, this small milestone became her last. She was shot dead in Islamabad by Omar Hayat, 22, for saying ‘no’. The inspector-general of the capital police, at a press conference, classified the murder case as one of “repeated rejection”.
Hayat had called her, followed her, and stalked her while Sana repeatedly said ‘no’. To him, not being able to possess her meant she didn’t deserve to live. Unfortunately, in our society, this is a frighteningly common tale. A man looking at a woman — in this case, a teenager — across a crowded room, driving a car, at school or online, and deciding all by himself that she belongs to him.
Whether or not the girl is made aware of this proprietorship is irrelevant. But whenever she is made aware, she must accept the terms. If she refuses, he threatens to either kill himself or, in most cases, such as that of Sana’s, kill her. Just like toddlers break their toys when someone threatens to take them away, men break women.
 
 

Novelist and poet Margaret Atwood famously said, “Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.” And believe me, we are. Whether we talk about it or not, most of us Pakistani women live our entire lives negotiating space and safety around men, both the ones we know and the ones we don’t.
“Why didn’t you just say no?”, “you should have been firm”, “you must not have stood your ground, so he thought there was a chance” are some of the sentences that every woman in Pakistan must have heard at some point in their life. As if a woman saying ‘no’ to a man will fix everything.
Learning the art of not offending men
Women in our society spend a majority of their lives negotiating how to politely (read safely) reject men’s advances. It requires command over body language, management of opinions, and the art of not offending men, because that could prove fatal.
In Sara’s case and several others, men never know how to quantify ‘too much’  because no setting is truly ever safe — not quiet or shy or bold or loud, not hunched or upright shoulders, not pretty or not not pretty. Men can always find ways to weaponise every equation involving women, even those carefully calibrated and cultivated to guarantee safety.
How to say no isn’t just about rejecting marriage proposals but also ranges from negotiating online spaces to workplaces and even within one’s own home — how should women talk back to their male bosses/colleagues without being fired? How should they say no to their husbands without being beaten and abused? How should they say no to strangers who invade her space without getting stalked, or worse, killed?
‘No’ is more than a complete sentence; for women, it is a complex syntax that has been perfected by navigating a complicated web — body language, tone, eye contact, walk, clothes, and even a smile — all to try and ensure that we can draw boundaries with men that keep us safe rather than get us killed.
 
 

Then again, what would have happened if Sana had said ‘Yes’? Would she have then been killed for having had a relationship that was “unfortunate for our society and contrary to religion and morality”, as Supreme Court’s Justice Hashim Kakar remarked regarding Noor Muqaddam during Zahir Jaffer’s appeal against his death sentence? There is simply no equitable setting for women shrinking themselves or projecting themselves that keeps them safe from the violence that men consider their fundamental right to inflict upon female bodies to keep them in line.
The politics of rejecting men
Every day, women are beaten, raped and killed in this country regardless of what they wear or where they are because these questions still exist and persist in public discourse. Relying on such qualifiers, exclusively reserved for female victims, is akin to asking what she did to ‘deserve it’. The only answer to that question is: Nothing.
It is always nothing because no one ever deserves it.
At present, the politics of rejecting men is a matter of global debate, framed and marketed as the ‘male loneliness epidemic’, wherein men around the world now imbibe online incel culture, and red pill codes so they can argue how they are owed female attention and sex. Sadly, in Pakistan, incel culture is not a new phenomenon. It is the gold standard, a permanent staple.
Currently, the JUI-F is launching protests across the country to protest a recently passed Child Marriages Restraint Bill because they feel they have the right to marry and have sex with children under the age of 18. The same politics of control play out in deeply troubling ways in online spaces. There is a pernicious vocabulary being developed and weaponised to target women on social media, particularly TikTok.
Most television channels continue to identify Sana Yousaf as a TikToker as if she were nothing else — a teenager, a student, an aspiring doctor. The word ‘TikToker’ has emerged as a deeply gendered term in recent years because men are seldom, if ever, morally targeted for being on an online platform that helps them generate an income.
This is also an increasingly classist phenomenon as TikTok has some of the most diverse user bases in countries such as Pakistan. According to a 2021 Gallup Poll, the bulk of Pakistani TikTok users, around 33 per cent, are under the age of 30 — the number is split almost evenly between urban and rural populations. This means that not only does the medium provide exposure to men and women from varying income classes, but also opens avenues for financial independence along with fame. The latter, however, is considered objectionable for women.
 
 

For this reason, the term TikToker is increasingly being weaponised to carve a new terrain for abuse that feeds toxic frameworks of moral/ immoral women as a terrifying new spin on the ‘chaadar chaardivari’ matrix. The implication is that the more public-facing a woman is, the more she is inviting the violence that may befall her. The underlying misogyny behind such doxxing and digital surveillance leads to tangible violence. This is demonstrated in the way dozens of men have ‘celebrated’ Sana Yousaf’s murder by calling it a ‘zabardast move’ to ‘clean up’ the ‘filth’ she was allegedly spreading with her naive posts about books, mangoes, and dinner with her friends.
The same language and fallout was witnessed when Qandeel Baloch was murdered in 2016 or when Ayesha Akram was groped and harassed by over 300 men at Minar-i-Pakistan on Independence Day in 2021. According to a 2023 United Nations report, female social media influencers are susceptible to four times more abuse than their male counterparts. In Pakistan, this abuse is deadly. Literally.
The brand of misogyny
Understanding and recognising that misogyny is not only normalised but institutionally licensed across Pakistan is essential if we are ever to put a stop to the ongoing femicide in the country. The fact that Pakistan repeatedly performs in the bottom five countries in the world when it comes to women’s rights and gender parity is not because there is a concentrated campaign against us, but because we lack the introspection needed to address the real issue at hand.
From Qandeel to Noor to Sana and all the women in between, the public discourse following their murder has always focused on whether ‘they did anything to deserve’ what happened to them rather than on the murderous malignancy of toxic masculinity that permeates down to our very social fabric.
The brand of misogyny that one sees displayed in the wake of the murder of young women, the closure of girls’ schools, calls to uphold child marriage as a fundamental right, and clerics making music videos about girls ‘dancing in school’ is a malaise that stems from shared patriarchal roots. Men’s utter lack of accountability drives our social discourse, and men have to begin holding each other accountable for any sustainable solution to Pakistan’s multiple human rights crises.
Attacking women and verbally abusing them for pointing out that men are violent only affirms the premise. Men need to talk to each other and enforce consequences for their own actions, which they alone are responsible for.
Stop telling women to stay home to stay safe. Most women get beaten, raped, and killed at home. Women are not unsafe because of what they wear or where they walk — they are unsafe because men hurt them. Men tell women that they are our protectors, but never ask who we need protection from and why. Patriarchy’s most convenient causal bind is that men will protect only the women they deem ‘good enough’ to merit safety or the women in their family at the expense of all other women who are some other man’s responsibility.
This way, men never need to address the root cause of the violence — themselves. If we stop being violent and excusing violence on each other’s part, women, children, and other men will no longer require protection.

The PAC meeting, headed by its Chairman Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, directed the provincial labour department and Sindh Employees’ Social Security Institution (SESSI) to ensure the strict implementation of the officially notified minimum wage of Rs37,000 to workers in all industrial units across the province.
While reviewing the audit reports of the SESSI for the years 2018 and 2019, the PAC chair­man said that non-implementation of mon­thly minimum wages in 80 per cent of private industrial units was a violation of labour laws.
He directed the SESSI and the labour department to strictly implement the policy of providing the minimum monthly wage to all workers across the province.

Committee asks labour secretary to investigate payment of Rs50m on alleged fake bills; orders audit of annual procurement of Rs9bn medicines for SESSI hospitals, dispensaries

SESSI Commissioner Miandad Rahujo told the PAC that out of 67,000 industrial units, 24,000 units were registered with the organisation. He said that 6,000 units were closed, while 18,000 industrial units were functional and over 800,000 workers of the registered units had been registered with the SESSI.
He shared that many industrial units had implemented the official minimum monthly salary to their workers, but the private security guards of private security agencies were not being paid the officially notified salary.
When asked by the PAC chairman, the SESSI commissioner said that several SESSI employees with fake degrees had been dismissed from their jobs. There were around 4,200 employees in the SESSI and their attendance was checked digitally, he added.
It was also revealed in the meeting that bogus payments of Rs50 million were made through fake bills for the repair work of SESSI institutions.
Taking notice of financial irregularities in the SESSI, the PAC directed the labour secretary to investigate the issue of the bogus payments and submit a report.
The PAC also ordered an audit of the annual procurement of medicines worth Rs9 billion for seven hospitals and 42 dispensaries of the provincial labour department.
The order was given following complaints of irregularities worth billions of rupees in the procurement of substandard medicines and machinery for the hospitals and dispensaries of the labour department.
To a question, the SESSI commissioner informed the PAC that seven hospitals and 42 dispensaries were functioning under the SESSI across the province where industrial workers were provided with health facilities.
He said that out of a fund of Rs13bn, 70pc or Rs9bn was being spent annually on purchasing medicines and healthcare services for the SESSI hospitals and dispensaries.
The SESSI commissioner added that 70pc of medicines for SESSI hospital and dispensaries were being purchased through tenders and 30pc are purchased by SESSI directors at the local level where there were problems in purchase.
He said that hospital management committees had been formed to run SESSI hospitals, while the SESSI governing body had approved a Rs1.4bn project for the infrastructure and building of Valika Hospital, the work on which would start within a year.

Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday that the US is preparing a partial evacuation of its Iraqi embassy and will allow military dependents to leave locations around the Middle East due to heightened security risks in the region, according to US and Iraqi sources.
The four US and two Iraqi sources did not say what security risks had prompted the decision, and reports of the potential evacuation pushed up oil prices by more than four per cent.
A US official said the State Department had authorised voluntary departures from Bahrain and Kuwait.
The State Department updated its worldwide travel advisory on Wednesday evening to reflect the latest US posture. “On June 11, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency US government personnel due to heightened regional tensions,” the advisory said.
The decision by the US to evacuate some personnel comes at a volatile moment in the region. Trump’s efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran appear to be deadlocked, and US intelligence indicates that Israel has been making preparations for a strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities.
 
 

“They are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place, and we’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters. “We’ve given notice to move out.”
Asked whether anything can be done to lower the temperature in the region, Trump said: “They can’t have a nuclear weapon. Very simple, they can’t have a nuclear weapon.”
Trump has repeatedly threatened to strike Iran if stuttering talks over its nuclear programme fail. In an interview released earlier on Wednesday, Trump said that he was growing less confident that Tehran would agree to stop enriching uranium, a key American demand.
Iranian Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh also said yesterday that if Iran was subjected to strikes, it would retaliate by hitting US bases in the region.
The US embassy in Kuwait said in a statement that it had “not changed its staffing posture and remains fully operational.”
Military presence
The US has a military presence across the major oil-producing region, with bases in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.
 
 

US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorised the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations across the Middle East, a US official said. Another US official said that it was mostly relevant to family members located in Bahrain — where the bulk of them are based.
“The State Department is set to have an ordered departure for [the] US embassy in Baghdad. The intent is to do it through commercial means, but the US military is standing by if help is requested,” a third US official said.
Iraq’s state news agency cited a government source as saying Baghdad had not recorded any security indication that called for an evacuation.
Another US official said that there was no change in operations at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US military base in the Middle East and that no evacuation order had been issued for employees or families linked to the US embassy in Qatar, which was operating as usual.
Tensions
Oil futures climbed $3 on reports of the Baghdad evacuation, with Brent crude futures at $69.18 a barrel.
Earlier on Wednesday, Britain’s maritime agency warned that increased tensions in the Middle East may lead to an escalation in military activity that could impact shipping in critical waterways. It advised vessels to use caution while travelling through the Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Straits of Hormuz, which all border Iran.
Britain’s Foreign Office said it was monitoring the situation and would keep its embassy in Iraq under constant review following the US moves.
 
 

Iraq, a rare regional partner of both the US and its arch-regional foe Iran, hosts 2,500 US troops, although allegedly Tehran-backed armed factions are linked to its security forces.
Tensions inside Iraq have heightened since the start of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza in October 2023, with armed groups in the country repeatedly attacking US troops, though attacks have subsided since last year.
Israel and Iran also twice exchanged fire last year — the first ever such direct attacks between the region’s most entrenched enemies — with missiles and war drones hurtling across Iraqi airspace.
Top US regional ally Israel has also struck targets across the region, including Iraqi armed groups operating both inside Iraq and in neighbouring Syria.
In recent months, the US has deployed more military assets in the Middle East, including B-2 bombers, which have since been replaced, and extended the deployment of a second aircraft carrier, which has since departed.
The next round of nuclear talks between Iran and the US is due in the coming days, with Iran expected to hand over a counterproposal after rejecting an offer by Washington.
A senior Iranian official told Reuters that a military threat had always been part of the US’s negotiation tactics with Iran.
“Any military action against Iran, whether by the US or Israel, will have serious consequences,” the official warned.
Iran’s UN mission yesterday posted on X: “Threats of ‘overwhelming force’ won’t change facts: Iran is not seeking a nuclear weapon and US militarism only fuels instability.”
 






The statement appeared to be a response to an earlier comment by US Army General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, the head of US Central Command, that he had provided the president with “a wide range of options” to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.
Kurilla postponed testimony he was due to deliver before US lawmakers today because of tensions in the Middle East, two other US officials said.</p><small>2025-06-12 05:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608797-pm-shehbaz-jets-off-to-uae-for-one-day-official-visit' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz reaches UAE on day-long visit</strong></a><br><p>

• Income tax rate of first slab reduced to 2.5pc, not 1pc as initially printed in Finance Bill
• Change offsets additional fiscal impact from increased govt salaries
• Aurangzeb defends steep pay hikes for lawmakers, ministers
• Says govt held back on raising minimum wage as industry unwilling to implement previous rate
• Contributory pension scheme for forces personnel may face delays
ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday repeatedly warned that the government would be compelled to impose a further Rs400 to 500 billion in taxes if parliamentarians failed to approve the sweeping enforcement measures proposed in the 2025-26 budget — as they were already cleared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“I now request my colleagues in both houses of parliament to get the enabling clauses for enforcement measures passed, otherwise we would have to take Rs400-500bn additional tax measures,” the usually soft-spoken minister said at his post-budget press conference, hinting at potential resistance within the ruling party, coalition partners and other pressure groups.
While Mr Aurangzeb did not name specific provisions, he was apparently referring to expanded enforcement powers for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). These include the authority to block high-value financial transactions by non-filers — such as vehicle and property purchases, investment in securities and mutual funds, and opening certain prestigious bank accounts — along with powers to seal unregistered business premises, confiscate goods and recover taxes from firms, including those in the public sector.
At a recent special meeting, the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue raised objections to some of those measures introduced through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 last month and hinted at tight scrutiny in due course. “Legal backing will be critical to institutionalise compliance and sustaining revenue growth,” the finance minister asserted.
Mr Aurangzeb explained that of the Rs700bn additional revenues envisaged for the next fiscal year — on top of an estimated 12 per cent organic growth in taxes driven by inflation and economic activity — about Rs389bn is tied to enforcement measures, while Rs312bn stems from additional tax measures.
“These numbers are locked with the IMF,” Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said, adding that the federal cabinet’s decision to increase government workers’ salaries by 10pc — up from the originally proposed 6pc — will have an additional fiscal impact of roughly Rs28bn.
He was responding to a question abo­ut whether talks with the Fund were com­plete or changes would ensue bet­ween the budget presented before and to be subsequently passed by parliament.
Both the finance minister and the finance secretary indicated that this additional fiscal impact was filled with a change in income tax rates for the salaried class. The first income tax slab — people earning between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million per year — was reduced from 5pc to 2.5pc, as announced by the finance minister in his budget speech, instead of the 1pc earlier envisaged (and printed in the Finance Bill).
Responding to a question, Mr Auran­gzeb said that, given Pakistan’s history, int­ernational stakeholders had also dou­bted the country’s ability to enforce tax laws effectively and insisted on results.
During the current year, “we have demonstrated practically that we can deliver”, with Rs400bn recoveries through enforcement. “We now have the trust and credibility,” the minister said, reiterating the need for legal provisions to continue enforc­e­ment or risk Rs400bn of more taxes.
Journalist walkout
The presser was marred by a walkout from journalists over the cancellation of a traditional technical briefing on the Finance Bill.

The protest turned into a full-blown boycott following a decision by officials to continue the live event in the presence of their own people alone. Information Minister Atta­u­llah Tarar, who was not in attendance, had to rush to the scene to acknowledge journalists’ grievances and convince them to return to the presser.
Mr Aurangzeb also defended sharp increases, some of them as large as 550pc, in the salaries of the speaker, deputy speaker, members of parliament and ministers.
He insisted the hikes sh­­ould be seen in the context that the salaries of the mi­­nisters had last been adju­s­ted in 2016, compared to annual increases in the wa­­­ges of employees in pu­­blic and private sectors in line with inflation and other factors. “Had these been adjusted on an an­­n­ual basis, there would have been no sudden jump.”
At the same time, the finance secretary indicated delays in the implementation of a contributory pension scheme for armed forces personnel with effect from July 1, 2025, as announced by the finance minister last year.
Mr Bosal said the contributory scheme for military employees was not an easy job and consultations had been taking place with the Ministry of Defence.
Both the minister and the secretary parried questions about the size of salary increases and special allowance for armed forces personnel annou­nced in the budget speech.
They also did not respond to repeated questions regarding the justification and increase in allocation of funds for parliamentarians’ schemes to Rs70bn, instead of the Rs50bn approved by the Annual Plan Coordination Committee.
 
 

The minister conceded the relief in tax rates for the salaried class, corporates and other sectors was minor but insisted it should be seen in the “direction of travel” that the government would keep on following as more fiscal space became available.
He insisted that the government showed acknowledgement that certain sections of society are overburdened. “This is a signal from the government to start moving in the right direction,” he said.
Responding to a question, Mr Aurangzeb said the federal government had called provincial nominations for the new National Finance Comm­ission, as the prime minister had already announced to call its meeting in August. He rejected the impression that the Centre could unilaterally delink population from resource distribution.
When questioned about the proposed debt servicing surcharge (DSS) on electricity, the finance minister did not recall he had announced any such thing in his budget speech.
However, in his budget speech, he had said the DSS would be used not only for servicing interest but also for repaying principal debt. He also proposed amendments to the Nepra Act to allow the federal government to raise the DSS beyond the current 10pc ceiling on a case-by-case basis.
Minimum wage
Asked why the government did not announce a minimum wage, the minister said the industry, in particular, and the private sector, in general, were not willing to pay even the previous minimum wage announced by the government.
He said Pakistan’s two international bonds are due for repayment in September and in April 2026, and the government was in a good position for their repayment.
Additionally, he ann­oun­ced plans to issue Panda bonds later this year to access China’s capital markets for diversification. The government also hopes to return to the US and European markets in 2026, contingent on improved credit ratings.
The minister stated that the government had eliminated additional customs duties on 4,000 tariff lines out of a total of 7,000 and reduced duties on an additional 2,700 lines as part of structural reforms aim­ed at aligning Pakis­tan’s trade and industrial policy with global standards.
These steps are part of a phased reform plan to simplify Pakistan’s tariff reg­i­me, aiming for an average rate of just over 4pc.
“Of these, around 2,000 tariff lines are directly linked to raw materials and intermediary goods used by the exporters,” he said. “This is the structural reform not taken in the past 30 years. This is a huge step, and we are committed to taking it forward gradually.”
Breathe Pakistan
The finance minister also expressed his gratitude to DawnMedia for its climate change initiative, Breathe Pakistan.
“I am very thankful to Dawn Group for the initiative it has taken on climate cha­n­­ge,” he said. “I have repeatedly said this (climate cha­nge) is an existential threat to Pakistan. Through Breathe Paki­st­an, you have taken it forward, and I commend you, your institution and your sponsors for highlighting this issue and its importance.”
He added, “It’s no longer just about the floods of 2022 — those of us living in Islamabad now experience windstorms and hailstorm every week. This never happened before. We are living climate change day in and day out. I want to sincerely thank your institution for leading the charge under Breathe Pakistan.”

There is no point sugar-coating this harsh reality.
For too many years now, we have been repeating what is now a familiar ritual, where the budget is announced accompanied with pious-sounding intentions, well-meaning rhetoric, and pointed reminders about the state’s constraints. And yet the only thing that changes is the increase in the burden on those who are registered, compliant taxpayers.
The budget announced on Tuesday follows this well-trodden path. This was the year to make something big happen. Rarely have conditions been more favourable for a government to undertake far-reaching change.
 
 

The powerful establishment stands behind them. There is no opposition worth the name in parliament. The economy has stabilised. The raging inferno of inflation has been doused. The runaway fiscal and external sector deficits have been either converted into surpluses or at least brought within manageable bounds. There is political and economic stability in the country. Never mind for now the blood, sweat and tears through which this brief moment of respite has been procured.
The question to ask is what are they doing with this hard-earned moment of opportunity?
We now have our answer. There is not a single reform measure in this budget. No strategic change of direction is indicated anywhere. They claim to be trying to boost exports through wide-ranging reduction in custom duties across thousands of tariff lines but one is hard-pressed to find an exporter who is keen on this proposal. The most significant area one looks for in a budget are measures designed to broaden the base of taxation. And all we find is steps designed to bring online marketplaces, incomes and transactions of the digital economy into the net and ramp up the powers of tax commissioners to penalise those refusing compliance.
There are revenue measures to make you cry. Last year, they taxed stationery and children’s school supplies. This year they have dropped a bombshell of a tax on teachers by abruptly withdrawing a tax rebate that they had only a few days ago committed they would keep. And then they sat in their ritual ‘post-budget press conference’ and told us how much they value the work of educated Pakistani youth, who have brought $400 million into the country as freelancers, adding that they would like to see these same code writers make $90 to $100 per hour or something like that in the years to come.

There is not a single reform measure in this budget. No strategic change of direction is indicated anywhere.

This is vintage budget theatre. Put the tax burden on teachers and professors, tax students’ school supplies, then sing paeans to the productive energies of the youth. Wag a finger at those who pay no taxes in this country. And with the other hand pick the pockets of those who do. Salaried individuals got relief sufficient maybe to pay for a pizza delivery per month.
 
 

The finance minister justified this by saying the “direction of travel” is correct, even if the distance covered is not satisfactory, adding that things that go up rarely ever come down where taxes are concerned. This is a polite way of saying ‘count your blessings, others would have given you even less than what I did’.
But let’s talk about the “direction of travel” for a moment. The last major tax reform that was attempted in Pakistan was the so-called Reformed General Sales Tax, or RGST, bill back in 2009. It died a loud and messy death in parliament as even the government’s coalition partners at the time refused to vote for it. Since then, we have been reduced to clever little gimmicks to squeeze more and more revenue out of those foolish enough to be registered and complying with the tax laws of the country.
Along the way, we have invented whole new categories of taxpayers, and whole new income streams. Somewhere around the middle of the 2010s we had a new category of taxpayer called ‘non-filer of tax returns’. In 2022, the government invented the category of ‘deemed income’. Along the way, we had amnesty schemes, incentives and penalties to try and get recalcitrant non-filers to register, and pay their taxes.
It began in 2014 with an amnesty scheme and a withholding tax on bank transactions of non-filers. It continued through 2019 when the FBR was prodded into serving tens of thousands of notices to non-filers in the services sector. It continued in 2021 when we were supposed to collect tens of billions of rupees from ‘point of sale machines’ that were going to be mainstreamed across the retail sector.
 
 

It raced passed 2022 when incomes were deemed to have come from otherwise dormant assets on the wealth statements of the rich, and taxes were to be collected from shopkeepers based on power consumed and the square footage of their outlets. In 2024 we had the ‘Tajir Dost scheme’, announced by the same finance minister who gave us the latest budget.
And what do we have to show for this decade-long effort? Vast databases of non-compliant individuals and businesses?
All these schemes and gimmicks show us a state thrashing around within the shrinking confines of its resource envelope. Meanwhile, every year the same ritual plays out. A new scheme is announced, and the burden on those who pay is increased further, while we are all reminded that times are hard and the fiscal space is limited. This stasis, this inability to drive any change, is taking the state deeper and deeper into non-viability as it is forced to squeeze more from less and borrow the remainder. This was the year when that could have changed.
Instead, we got this elephantine mediocrity they’re calling a budget. Another year of treading water. Another year of limping from one IMF review to the next, with no end in sight.

On each occasion, without fail, the economy has achieved stabilisation similar to what it is experiencing currently. Each time, the government of the day has launched into a song and dance to celebrate an invariably short-lived achievement. More importantly, one that has come at great human cost.
This time is different, however. Not because the incumbent government has embarked on a path of serious reform that will break the country free from its continual dependence on the IMF.
But because the current IMF programme is the harshest in Pakistan’s history, demanding a level of fiscal austerity that has exacted an un­­precedented toll of economic devastation, misery and impoverishment. Ordinary Pakista­nis have paid a very heavy price for the stabilisation the government is celebrating. And there is no place for their suffering in the official narrative.
 
 

A deadly combination of declining real incomes with rising unemployment and poverty, has meant that ordinary Pakistanis are in economic distress as never before. According to the government’s own statistics, from the recently published 7th Population and Housing Census-2023, over 18 million Pakistanis are now officially unemployed, with the jobless rate at an unheard of 22 per cent. Youth unemployment has hit an all-time high of 29pc.
Though not strictly comparable, the corresponding figure from the Labour Force Survey 2020-21, was 6.3pc — or 4.5m unemployed Pakistanis recorded two years prior to the digital census. This points to a steep increase in unemployment in a short span of time.

Beyond the official hype, the economic reality of ordinary Pakistanis is dire.

Not surprisingly, given the widespread joblessness, the latest poverty statistics are equally alarming. According to the World Bank, nearly 45pc of the population is now below the economic waterline, of $4.2/day. Using a lower international poverty line (of $3.65/day based on 2017 PPP), an additional 12.8m Pakistanis have been pushed into poverty since 2022, for a total of over 107m citizens. As in the case of unemployment, this is very likely the sharpest increa­­se over a two-year period in Pakistan’s history.
Placed in the context of faltering economic growth and an unprecedented loss in purchasing power for the average Pakistani since 2022, the foregoing statistics, however shocking on their own, are likely understating the true scale of economic misery being experienced by the masses.
Real GDP growth has averaged only 1.7pc since 2022-23, the lowest three-year average growth ever recorded since 1952 — and well below the population growth rate. All the main growth engines of prosperity in the economy have sputtered since 2023. Agriculture has performed poorly, with major crops posting one of the largest declines ever recorded. The Manufacturing sector has contracted over 10pc cumulatively since 2022-23. The Services sector has grown at two-thirds its long-run average rate of growth.
 
 

No economic sector or population segment has been spared. Farm incomes have collapsed, leading to a poverty rate of 50pc in rural areas, according to the World Bank. Countless factory workers are now jobless, while middle class households across Pakistan struggle to make ends meet. Since March 2022, the purchasing power of an average Pakistani has declined by 58pc. This means anyone earning Rs50,000 per month in March 2022, now has a purchasing power of just Rs20,833.
None of this should be surprising given the nature of the IMF programme. Widespread factory closures and industrial job losses, devastation of the farm sector, and the decimation of the middle class are the hallmarks of the Fund’s anti-growth and anti-people austerity policies. The social devastation visited upon Greece since 2010 is a glaring example. As I have previously written, despite the emphasis on social safety nets, the IMF gets the burden of adjustment of its programmes so tragically wrong.
How then can one explain the wide disconnect between the harsh daily struggles of ordinary Pakistanis set against official celebration of macroeconomic stabilisation? And the supportive, and sometimes embarrassingly gushing, endorsement from the IFIs?
It is useful to remember that Pakistan has received similar endorsements from the IMF and World Bank, the sovereign credit rating agencies and the likes of Barron’s, multiple times in the past. In each case, there is a combination of a particular set of incentives or a narrow point of view at work.
 
 

In the case of the IMF especially, there are professional as well as institutional incentives at work that can lead to over-hyping results of a programme, or condoning lapses. IMF mission chiefs and their management have every incentive to avoid a failed programme as it can be career-limiting. To do so, they can indulge in playing up programme successes, or pursue performative reforms to notch marginal wins to amplify the ‘success-factor’ of the programme under their watch.
The institutional incentive for the IMF is to portray, as quickly as possible, both to the financial markets as well as to bilateral donors, that a programme country under its watch is now eligible for a resumption of capital flows. This also plays out via the fairly charitable and ‘behind the curve’ debt sustainability assessments the Fund produces.
To left-leaning critics of the Bretton Woods Institutions, there is a hidden, more sinister dynamic at play. Support from the West in terms of access to funding from the IFIs, and the subsequent endorsements from the BWIs, are part of a system-legitimising re-stratification effort to consolidate the hold of Western-aligned ruling elites on power.
In Pakistan’s case, this plays out as timely and generous financial assistance, spinning a helpful narrative, facilitating political largesse and profligate spending in the budget for the past over two years while imposing austerity policies on ordinary Pakistanis. The IMF has much to answer for.
With one in two Pakistanis now below the poverty line, and nearly one in four unemployed, the state of Pakistan’s economy has never been as dismal and worrisome as over the past three years. This is the human cost of the stabilisation the government and the IMF are celebrating — and sadly, glossing over.

His concerns are not unfounded. Speaking at the post-budget press conference yesterday, he recounted how he was stopped at the last minute from announcing a proposal to withdraw sales tax exemptions for the steel and edible oil industry in ex-Fata/Pata in the budget for the outgoing fiscal year. The proposal has now been included in the next year’s budget.
 
 

He twice told lawmakers that they have the option of either passing the legislation and empowering the tax machinery to recover Rs389bn through enforcement measures, or to prepare for additional taxation to achieve the budgeted target.
Even if his plan goes according to script, the overall FBR target of Rs14.1tr, up by nearly 19pc from this year’s collection of Rs11.9tr, appears too ambitious due to overly optimistic GDP growth expectations, moderate inflation targets, and the absence of steps to effectively tax the undertaxed and untaxed segments. Some analysts resultantly expect the tax target to be revised downward in the coming months.
And it is not just the tax target: the government’s growth projection also faces the risk of downward revision. Islamabad says it plans to pursue an admittedly moderate growth rate of 4.2pc without breaching the IMF’s red lines or putting pressure on the precarious external sector. It appears to be betting on the rejuvenation of the real estate sector through the announced tax relief and expectations of a continued upward trend in remittances.
But this will prove to be a challenge, considering the fact that the new budget focuses on meeting the stabilisation goals of the IMF loan; public development spending continues to shrink as the government curtails expenditures to contain the large budget deficit; and big industry and major crops are contracting.
 
 

In short, few believe that a government desperate to grow the economy can actually pull it off, as the dynamism required is not visible. This is underlined by the downward revision of the IMF’s growth projection for FY26 from the previous 4pc to 3.6pc a few months earlier. At the presser, the minister dubbed his second budget an “East Asian moment” for Pakistan.
However, a budget devoid of bold reforms and a strategic direction, thanks to the ruling PML-N’s political concerns, can hardly be described in such terms. Even if we, for a moment, accept that the budget will meet its growth goals, it will remain unsustainable without a structural shift in the economy.

In a petition, it instead requested retention of approximately Rs800 million in its accounts on the same pattern as the regulator had allowed fuel cost savings worth Rs15.2 billion in past claims. KE reported that its fuel cost came out to be Rs4.69 per unit lower than it had charged consumers in April, resulting in a fiscal impact of Rs7.2bn.
KE submitted that pursuant to the determination of the generation tariff for its power plants for the period post-June 2023, it had submitted the required partial load, open cycle and degradation curves along with startup cost for approval and an amount of Rs16bn for the period July 2023 to April 2025 was accordingly pending for adjustment.
Additionally, the heat rate adjustments for its two plants at Korangi and Port Qasim, for the previous multi-year tariff amounting to Rs600m and Rs200m, were also pending.

Regulator fixes public hearing on 19th to decide retention plea

Out of this, the regulator has already set aside Rs15.2bn in KE’s fuel cost decisions for November 2024 to March 2025. KE has requested the regulator “to also consider aforementioned adjustment of accumulated actualisation of fuel cost so that the recovery can be made from the negative fuel cost variation of March 2025 and April 2025 to ensure consumers are not burdened at a later stage”.
 
 

Nepra has scheduled June 19 for the public hearing to examine whether the requested FCA was justified and KE followed the merit order when despatching to its power plants, as well as when purchasing power from external sources, including the cheaper national grid.
While Nepra has already settled through its five monthly determinations by allowing Rs15.2bn out of Rs16bn, just to complete the formality, it has also raised the question of the KE’s request for adjustment of accumulated actualisation of fuel cost on account of partial load, open cycle and degradation curves along with startup cost from July 2023 to April 2025, from the negative fuel cost variation was justified.
The FCA is reviewed monthly, in accordance with the tariff regime applicable nationwide.

• US president warns protests at army parade will be met with force
LOS ANGELES: Protests against Donald Trump’s harsh immigration policies spread on Wednesday across the United States despite a military-backed crackdown in Los Angeles and a threat by the Republican president to use “heavy force.”
In Los Angeles, where the unrest began last Friday, the downtown area was calm but tense after an overnight curfew saw police make 25 arrests.
Heavily armed officers patrolled near government buildings, and storekeepers boarded up windows to protect against vandalism.
US Marines — ordered by Trump to deploy in addition to more than 4,000 National Guard soldiers — were expected to make their first appearance on the streets on Wednesday.
“US military troops deployed to Los Angeles are allowed to temporarily detain individuals until law enforcement agents arrive to arrest them,” a senior US military official said.  The mostly peaceful protests ignited over a sudden escalation in efforts to apprehend migrants who were in the country illegally.
 
 

Pockets of violence — including the burning of self-driving taxis and hurling stones at police — triggered a massive response from authorities using tear gas and other non-lethal weapons.
Trump won the election last year partly on promises to combat what he claims is an “invasion” by undocumented migrants.
He is now seizing the opportunity to make political capital, ordering the California National Guard to deploy despite Governor Gavin Newsom’s objections, the first time a US president has taken such action in decades.
Trump then tested the constitutional limits of his power even further by ordering about 700 Marines — a force designed primarily for combat in foreign wars — to the scene.
“If our troops didn’t go into Los Angeles, it would be burning to the ground right now,” Trump insisted on social media Wednesday.
But in a televised address late on Tuesday, Newsom said “democracy is under assault right before our eyes.” “California may be first, but it clearly won’t end here,” the Democrat said.
Trump has expressed support for a call by one of his top officials to arrest Newsom, who is seen as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2028, when Trump will be required by the constitution to step down.
 
 

Despite Trump’s threats to deploy the National Guard to other Democratic-run states over the objections of governors, protesters appear undeterred.
Thousands marched in New York and Chicago late on Tuesday.
Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced he was deploying the state’s National Guard to counter a protest announced for San Antonio on Wednesday.
Demonstrations were also planned on Wednesday in New York, Seattle and Las Vegas ahead of what organisers say will be a nationwide “No Kings” movement on Saturday, when Trump will attend a highly unusual military parade in the US capital.
In a speech at an army base on Tuesday, Trump warned that any protests during the Washington parade would face “very heavy force.”
The parade, featuring warplanes and tanks, has been organised to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the US Army but also happens to be the day of Trump’s 79th birthday.

LAHORE: Amid no let-up in extreme heat that has engulfed Pakistan since last week, almost all cities in Punjab reported temperatures exceeding 45 degrees Celsius, with Bhakkar and Sindh’s Jacobabad topping the charts with 49°C.
The intense weather is expected to continue today as well, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department. “Mainly hot and dry weather is expected in most parts of the country, while very hot in plain areas,” it said in a statement posted on its website.
“However, dust-raising/gusty winds are likely in plain areas during the afternoon. Partly cloudy weather with isolated rain-wind/thunderstorm is likely in upper Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, Potohar region, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan during the evening/night,” it added.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) reported extreme conditions across Punjab, including Sargodha City at 47.8°C, Gujranwala and Hafizabad at 47.5°C, and Lahore at 46.2°C. Only the hill station of Murree offered some respite with a relatively cooler temperature of 32°C.
Like Punjab, the rest of the country sizzled as well, bringing life to a standstill. In Sindh, Jacobabad reported 49 and Mohenjo-Daro simmered at 48°C. Larkana and Sukkur recorded 47°C. Karachi experienced sweltering 40°C with 70% humidity, making conditions unbearable for citizens in the port city.
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) plains, including Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan, baked at 45-46°C. The northern mountainous areas remained relatively cooler, however. Balochistan’s Sibi and Turbat reported 47°C, while Quetta witnessed a comparatively mild temperature of 38°C.
Across Punjab, people avoided stepping outside to hide from the sun while markets and streets wore a deserted look during the afternoon. The relentless heat left streets deserted during the afternoon, with vendors and labourers struggling to cope. “The heat is unbearable. Even standing in the shade feels like being in an oven,” said Muhammad Asif, a rickshaw driver in Lahore.
Due to extreme heat, hospitals in Punjab received scores of heatstroke cases, which were treated by the authorities that had set up dedicated counters in the state-run hospitals. Most cases were reported particularly among labourers, the elderly and children. To add to the misery were the intermittent power outages in various cities, leaving many without fans or air-conditioning.
In light of the heatwave, the National Disaster Management Authority alerted all provincial departments to remain vigilant as the heatwave persists.
In response to the crisis, the Punjab government issued directives to mitigate the situation.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabil Javed ordered all commissioners and deputy commissioners to remain on high alert. He said the authorities were providing cool drinking water at public spaces, transport hubs, and markets, and hospitals had set up heatstroke emergency counters, and medical supplies were stocked to treat heat-related illnesses.
He said that the water supply in Cholistan was being closely monitored to prevent shortages.
The authorities issued health advisories urging citizens to stay hydrated, avoid unnecessary outdoor activities between 11am-4pm and watch for heatstroke symptoms.
Residents were encouraged to wear light-coloured, loose cotton clothing and stay hydrated. Special attention was called for children, the elderly, and sick individuals who are at highest risk, with authorities recommending they remain in cool environments.
People were advised to avoid strenuous work or exercise in direct sunlight and to call PDMA’s emergency helpline 1129 in case of experiencing heatstroke symptoms.
The Met department predicts no immediate relief, with the heatwave expected to continue for the next 48-72 hours.
“This is a life-threatening situation,” warned PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia, stressing that vulnerable groups must be protected at all costs.

The case was dropped from the cause list after Justice Mohammad Asif, a member of Islamabad High Court division bench, headed by acting Chief  Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfaraz Dogar, proceeded on leave.
Senior PTI leaders, including party chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Leader of the Opposition in the Natio­nal Assembly Omar Ayub Khan, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, and Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan, arrived at the IHC and met officials in the chief justice’s secretariat to press for rescheduling the hearing.
After a two-and-a-half-hour wait, the court fixed June 26 as the new date for hearing the pleas, seeking suspension of sentence.
Security at the IHC was visibly heightened, with additional personnel dep­lo­yed and barbed wires ins­t­alled around entrances amid PTI leaders’ presence and media activity.
Speaking to the media outside the court, the party chairman expressed disappointment over the delay but remained optimistic about Mr Khan’s early release.
“The judge was on leave, so the case could not be heard today. But the day is not far when the PTI founder would walk free,” he said.
He criticised the backlog of cases, stating that proceedings of cases such as the present one should be concluded within a month.
He also voiced concern over the deteriorating state of justice, pointing out that the country now ranks 129th in the Rule of Law Index, down from 97th in 1996.

• France-based charity accuses Tel Aviv of deadly strike on its office building
CAIRO: Israeli gunfire and airstrikes killed at least 60 Palestinians in Gaza on Wednesday, most of them near an aid site operated by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in the centre of the enclave, local health officials said.
Medical officials at Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals said at least 25 people were killed and dozens wounded as they approached a food distribution centre near the former Jewish settlement of Netzarim before dawn.
Israel’s military said its forces fired warning shots overnight towards a group of suspects as they posed a threat to troops in the area of the Netzarim Corridor.
“This is despite warnings that the area is an active combat zone. The IDF is aware of reports regarding individuals injured; the details are under review,” it said.
Later on Wednesday, health officials at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip said at least 14 people had been killed by Israeli gunfire as they approached another GHF site in Rafah.
The foundation said it was unaware of Wednesday’s incidents but added that it was working closely with Israeli authorities to ensure safe passage routes are maintained, and that it was essential for Palestinians to closely follow instructions.
“Ultimately, the solution is more aid, which will create more certainty and less urgency among the population,” it said by email in response to Reuters questions.
“There is not yet enough food to feed everyone in need in Gaza. Our current focus is to feed as many people as is safely possible within the constraints of a highly volatile environment.” In a statement, GHF said it distributed 2.5 million meals on Wednesday, the largest single-day delivery since it began operations, bringing to more than 16 million the number of meals provided since its operations started in late May.
Gaza’s health ministry says that since then, 163 Palestinians had been killed and over 1,000 wounded trying to obtain the food boxes.
The United Nations has condemned the killings and has refused to supply aid via the foundation, which uses private contractors with Israeli military backup in what they say is a breach of humanitarian standards.

Elsewhere in Gaza on Wednesday, its health ministry said at least 11 other people were killed by separate Israeli gunfire and strikes across the coastal enclave.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday there had been “significant progress” in efforts to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, but that it was “too soon” to raise hopes that a deal would be reached.
Two Hamas sources told Reuters that they did not know about any breakthrough in negotiations.
Violation of international law
Medical charity Medecins du Monde on Wednesday accused Israel of violating international law with drone strikes on a building housing one of its offices in war-torn Gaza that killed eight people, none of them staff.
The France-based aid group said in a statement the attack on Tuesday “constitutes a serious violation of international humanitarian law, which protects both civilian populations and humanitarian organisations operating in conflict zones”.
The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“Yesterday morning, at around 11am local time, a building in Deir el-Balah housing a Medecins du Monde office was attacked by drones,” the aid group said.
Its staff had not been present as they had been off as part of the Eid al-Adha holiday, it added.
“At least eight people were killed in the bombardment. All were on the last floor of the building,” it said, without providing more details on those killed.
“Medecins du Monde had informed the Israeli military of the presence of its office, which had officially been declared ‘deconflicted’, or shielded from Israeli military attacks under humanitarian coordination agreements,” it said.

• Banks, couriers to deduct withholding tax under new plan
• Fine for failing to submit withholding tax statements raised by 10 times
• Govt to take over property valuation powers from FBR
ISLAMABAD: The federal government has proposed sweeping reforms to tighten tax compliance, including significantly higher penalties for non-compliance and stronger enforcement measures to target under-taxed and digitally active sectors.
The changes, proposed in the Finance Bill 2025, aim to deter non-compliance, discourage cash-based transactions and enh­ance documentation of the economy. Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said enforcement was the only viable option to boost revenue collection, rather than relying on new taxes.
 
 

One of the key amendments is a tenfold increase in the penalty for failure to submit withholding tax statements — from Rs5,000 to Rs50,000. Authorities believe this will compel withholding agents to comply with deadlines and file statements within the due date.
A substantial penalty has been proposed for online marketplaces that allow unregistered, non-resident vendors engaged in e-commerce to sell digitally ord­ered goods without proper registration under the Sales Tax Act and the Income Tax Ordinance.
 
 

Under the proposed framework, the first violation would incur a fine of Rs500,000, with subsequent defaults carrying a penalty of Rs1 million. These fines would apply to both online platforms and courier services facilitating such transactions.
According to the Finance Bill, if a banking company, payment gateway or courier service provider fails to deduct tax when making payments to sellers or neglects to remit the deducted tax, the government proposes strict penalties.
In cases involving digitally ordered goods or the provision of digitally delivered services via e-commerce platforms, the government proposed a penalty equal to 100 per cent of the tax amount for violations.
The government has made banks and courier services withholding agents for deducting withholding tax and sales tax from buyers of online goods and services. The collected tax will be submitted to the FBR, while the remaining amount will be transferred to the seller.
The Finance Bill 2025 introduces several revisions across various sections, tightening restrictions on economic transactions by certain individuals. These limitations were initially outlined in the Tax Laws Amendment Bill 2024.
Under the proposed amendments, the federal government — rather than the FBR — will be responsible for notifying the value of immovable property. Until this valuation is officially declared, restrictions on registering, recording or attesting property transfers will not take effect, and no individual will be deemed ineligible for such transactions.
The Finance Bill 2025 also expands exemptions to restrictions on bank account operations. Pensioner accounts, along with previously exempted Aasan accounts, are now explicitly excluded from limitations on opening or maintaining current or savings accounts.
The bill seeks to broaden the definition of an “eligible person” by including individuals who have submitted a statement of investment sources and expenditures, demonstrating sufficient resources and providing an explanation for a specific purchase or investment transaction.
The bill removes “special child” from the definition of immediate family members and eliminates the age limit of 25 years for a child’s classification as an immediate family member. As a result, individuals aged 26 or older who remain financially dependent on their parents will now qualify under this definition.
The definition of “sufficient resources” has also been broadened to encompass cash in local or foreign currency, the fair market value of gold, and the net realisable value of stocks, bonds, receivables or other prescribed cash-equivalent assets.
Individuals may declare these assets in their sources of investment and expenditure statements or their wealth statements filed for the latest tax year.
For companies and associations of persons (AOPs), sufficient resources include cash and equivalent assets reported in financial statements accompanying the income tax return for the latest tax year.
The Finance Bill proposes a proviso in the definition of sufficient resources, specifying that when an asset is acquired through the exchange of capital assets already declared in a wealth statement, financial statement or sources of investment and expenditure statement, the disposed capital assets shall be considered part of cash-equivalent assets, up to the value stated in the agreement.

Dr Mahrang Baloch, a leader of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), is held at the Hudda District Prison, Quetta, pursuant to a March 22 detention order by the deputy commissioner under the Mainte­nance of Public Order.
 
 

Moved through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi, the appeal pleaded that Mah­rang Baloch had challen­ged her detention before the BHC, but the high court rejected her plea.
Now the appeal before the apex court contended that the high court order was contrary to the Cons­titution, law and facts.
The federal governm­ent through interior ministry, home and tribal aff­airs department of Baloch­istan, prosecutor general, inspector general of police, Federal Investiga­tion Agency director general, Quetta deputy commissioner and the state have been named as res­pon­dents in the petition.
The petition alleged that her repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a sympathiser of militants was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising voice for missing persons. It apprised the court that her father and brother too were subjected to enforced disappearance in 2011 and 2017.
Along with the main appeal, a separate application was also filed before the Supreme Court, seeking suspension of the BHC order during the pendency of the present case.
Another petition challenging the extension of detention order is also expected to be filed before the SC in a day or two.
The main appeal pleaded that in December 2023, the “Baloch Long March”, organised and led by the detenue and other members of the BYC, was allegedly met with excessive and unlawful force.
The petition alleged that following a militant attack on a passenger train on March 11, there was a marked escalation in retaliatory measures by the state. On March 20, Bebarg Zehri, a BYC central committee member and his brother were abducted from their residence, the petition alleged, adding on March 19, their relative Saeeda Baloch was arrested and unlawfully detained for two days without any formal charge.
The appeal contended that the BHC erred by not ensuring the production of all the relevant material before it on which Balochistan MPO was passed so that the high court could have satisfied itself regarding reasonableness, arbitrariness and legality of the MPO.
It reminded that the SC held in 2003 that it was incumbent upon the detaining authority to place entire material before court on which basis the detention order was passed, regardless of any claim of privilege related to any document, as the high court was competent to decide the same and satisfy itself regarding the existence of the requisite condition of MPO of the detaining authority.
The court was apprised that the balance of convenience was in favour of the petitioner and irreparable loss would be caused to the petitioner unless the operation of the high court order was not suspended during the pendency of the present case.
The petitioner asserted that the deputy commissioner by issuing MPO order acted in clear excess of his statutory mandate, since it was issued unilaterally by him without securing the requisite approval from the chief minister.

The visit reflects the deep-rooted fraternal ties between Pakistan and the UAE, which are marked by mutual trust, shared values, and close cooperation across multiple sectors, said an official press rel­ease issued here on Wednesday.
The prime minister will be accompanied by a high-level delegation, including Deputy Prime Min­ister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar, federal ministers, and other senior officers.
PM Shehbaz will hold high-level meetings with the UAE leadership, including a bilateral meeting with the President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
A wide range of bilateral, regional, and global issues of mutual interest and concern will be discussed during the high-level interactions.
The PM’s visit will serve to further stre­n­g­then the longstanding bro­­therly rel­a­tions between Pakistan and the UAE, deepen economic ties, and foster multifaceted collaboration.
Record remittances
Earlier, PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction over increase in remittances during May 2025 which was 13.7 per cent more than the previous fiscal year.
In a statement, the prime minister said the country had received some $34.9 billion in remittances during the current fiscal year, which was 28.8pc higher than the outgoing financial year.
“$3.7 billion was received in re­­mittances during May 2025, which is 13.7 per cent more than May last year. The increase in remittances is evidence of the growing confidence of overseas Pakistanis in the economic policies of the government,” the prime minister said.
PML-Q delegation meets PM
Meanwhile, a delegation of the PML-Q on Wednesday called on PM Shehbaz and expressed full support for all the initiatives taken by him for the country’s economic development and public welfare.
The delegation, led by Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain, comprised MNAs Chaudhry Hussain Elahi, Mu­­h­a­mmad Ilyas Chaudhry and Farukh Khan, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.
The MNAs praised the prime minister and his team for presenting the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026 in the National Assembly.
The delegation said that both the military and political leadership were working tirelessly for the national development and the welfare of the people.
They also lauded the prime mi­­nister’s exemplary leadership during the recent tensions with India and his efforts to elevate the country’s prestige at the global stage.

Last week, Hafizabad police launched raids to arrest eight suspects who allegedly abducted a couple in Hafizabad and subjected them to physical and sexual assault.
 
 

A first information report (FIR) filed by the husband at the Kasoki Police Station said that the incident occurred on April 25 when the complainant and his wife were on a motorcycle and they stopped for a bit. As the wife got off the motorcycle, a man came towards them who verbally abused and hit her, it stated.
A group of armed men later arrived and took the couple to a secluded place near a graveyard, the FIR said, detailing how the couple were subjected to physical violence, sexual assault, and robbery.
According to a press release issued by the prosecutor general’s office today, the prosecutor general declared the case as “high-profile”,  summoning the investigating officer (IO) along with the record under Section (3)10C of the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service Act, 2006.
The IO appeared with the record and briefed the Punjab government official regarding the investigation, it said.
“The prosecutor general of Punjab issued a line of inquiry and instructed the IO to complete the investigation on merit,” the press release added.
Shah was quoted as saying that, according to the vision of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, it was the responsibility of the state to protect the honour and dignity of women.
“The state will use all its resources to bring the culprits to justice,” he added.
On June 5, one of the four suspects involved in the incident was allegedly killed in the firing by his own accomplices during an “encounter” with a Crime Control Department (CCD) team near Jorian bridge in Kassoki police precincts, Hafizabad district.
Sources in the CCD said the police had been informed about the presence of the suspects, upon which a team conducted a raid on a premises near Jorrian bridge along an open drain. On seeing the police party, the armed men had opened fire, which was returned by the policemen.
The sources had said that when the firing stopped, the police had found a body which was identified as that of one of the four gang-rape suspects. The sources claimed the suspect was killed in his accomplices’ firing.
They said that the remaining suspects had managed to flee the scene.
 
 

Investigation into the incident had taken a new turn a day later when two policemen were arrested for freeing an alleged rapist after taking bribe a few days after the April 25 incident.
Meanwhile, the Federal Investigation Agency had placed the names of two of the four alleged rapists on the Provisional National Identification List following reports that they were trying to escape abroad.
The list is maintained by the agency to prevent the travel or escape of individuals involved in “heinous crimes”.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
In March, Punjab police arrested three suspects for allegedly gang-raping a woman in Lahore.</p><small>2025-06-11 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608718-pakistan-calls-for-bold-global-action-to-protect-oceans' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan calls for bold ‘global action' to protect oceans</strong></a><br><p>

The Indian minister’s comments come in the wake of a four-day military conflict between the nuclear powers last month.
Speaking in Brussels on Tuesday, Jaishankar said when India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintained that ‘Operation Sindoor’ was not over, it was a clear message that “we reserve the right to go after terrorists anytime, anywhere if they have done harm to us”.
According to the FO statement, Pakistan rejected Jaishankar’s comments, stating that top diplomats should aim to promote peace and harmony rather than producing “bellicose punchlines”. Criticising his conduct, the FO said the tone and tenor of a foreign minister “should be commensurate with his dignified status”.
 
 

The FO further said: “For the last several years, India has been engaged in a malicious campaign to mislead the international community through a fictitious narrative of victimhood.
“However, India’s continued anti-Pakistan diatribe cannot hide its sponsorship of terrorism beyond its borders, nor can it cover up the state-sanctioned oppression in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
It added that instead of pointing fingers at others, India should “introspect on its own involvement in terrorism, subversion and targeted assassinations.”
Reiterating that Pakistan believed in peaceful coexistence, the FO urged India to “stop concocting narratives” to justify its aggressive actions in the wake of the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir.
“The narrative emerging from India betrays sheer frustration, following an unsuccessful military adventure against Pakistan,” the FO said. “Indian leaders would be well-advised to improve the standard of their discourse and discard their obsession with Pakistan.”
The FO stated that while Pakistan pursued peace, it would defend its sovereignty against aggression such as that by India last month.
“History will judge not by who shouted the loudest, but by who acted the wisest,” the statement concluded.
 






A day prior, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman termed India a “belligerent power spinning out of control” in response to Jaishankar’s remarks.
“Pakistan cannot be responsible for every attack in India, which is home to a dozen insurgencies,” she said, adding that “no lessons seem to have been learnt from the encounter with Pakistan, and no evidence provided”.
Pakistan and India have been at odds since the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly denied the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a four-day conflict before the US brokered a ceasefire on May 10.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India to the world and counter New Delhi’s unproven allegations. As part of its global outreach, a delegation — including Rehman — has visited the United States, is currently in London and will also head to Brussels.</p><small>2025-06-11 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608690-fo-slams-indian-foreign-minister-for-irresponsible-remarks-in-brussels' target='_blank'><strong>FO slams Indian foreign minister for 'irresponsible remarks' in Brussels</strong></a><br><p>
