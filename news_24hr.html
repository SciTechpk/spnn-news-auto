Addressing the media following the conclusion of the Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting, Bilawal said the CEC debated the matter of constitutional courts for two days and said that the party “agrees in principle  with the idea that constitutional courts should be formed”.
Earlier today, the PPP appeared divided over the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment but signalled support for changes to Article 243.
Last night, the party indicated conditional support for limited amendments to Article 243 governing federal control of the armed forces.
Announcing decisions of the party’s CEC at Bilawal House late on Thursday night, PPP Chairman Bil­awal Bhutto-Zardari said discussions on the government’s proposed constitutional changes would continue on Friday but stressed the PPP “can never compromise on the financial rights of the provinces”.
PPP insiders told Dawn that today’s meeting began after Friday prayers and is ongoing. They said that, except for the proposed amendments to Article 243, none of the other proposals have been agreed upon.
They added that the party will support the proposed amendment to the constitutional courts if provinces receive equal representation. Proposals related to the provincial share of the National Finance Commission (NFC) award and federalising education — which was devolved to provinces — were rejected.</p><small>2025-11-07 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632549-ppp-backs-amending-article-243-constitutional-court-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>PPP backs amending Article 243, constitutional court: Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple agreements across sectors such as energy and trade. The two sides also expressed eagerness to further foster cooperation with each other in the fields of mutual interest.
The commitments were made when Speaker of Iranian Parliament Dr Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, a statement from the PM’s Office said.
“Both countries condemn state-sponsored terrorism and have always supported each other in the wake of unilateral aggression against their sovereign states”, the statement quoted the PM as saying.
The prime minister said Pakistan and Iran had unfortunately been victims of terrorism; thus, they firmly shared the resolve of global peace, prosperity and positive cooperation in the region.
“Pakistan and Iran are determined to work in cohesion and cooperation for the unity of the Muslim Ummah,” he added.
He warmly welcomed the delegation and recalled the cordial bilateral ties with the brotherly Muslim country of Iran.
The PM also extended utmost reverence to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pazeshkian.
Dr Ghalibaf expressed his gratitude to the prime minister, the government and people of Pakistan for their valued and well-placed support in the recent Iran-Israel conflict, the statement added.
He said the support shown by Pakistan to Iran in the 12-day war against Israel was deeply appreciated and cherished by the people of Iran. “Iran and Pakistan firmly believe in the unity of the Muslim Ummah and in the message of global peace,” he was quoted as saying.
While expressing special gratitude to the Speaker National Assembly, Ayaz Sadiq, the Iranian speaker cherished the positive and robust cooperation between the parliaments of both countries.
He also expressed Iran’s commitment to further enhance bilateral cooperation with Pakistan in the fields of economic development and trade.
The Iranian speaker conveyed a message of warmth and reverence from Iranian President Masoud Pazeshkian for the PM and people of Pakistan. He also expressed gratitude for the warm hospitality extended to him during his visit to Pakistan.
In August, President Pezeshkian visited Pakistan. During his visit, Islamabad and Tehran signed 12 agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoUs).</p><small>2025-11-07 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/07194107b43c40b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953712/lahores-bird-market-demolition-sparks-controversy-public-outcry' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore’s bird market demolition sparks controversy, public outcry</strong></a><br><p>A demolition operation carried out at a bird market in Lahore’s Bhati Chowk area, near Data Darbar, has become mired in controversy, with shopkeepers accusing the Punjab government of killing dozens of birds and other caged pets, allegations the government has denied.
The operation was conducted on Wednesday morning by joint teams of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) and the Traffic Engineering and Transport Planning Agency (Tepa) to launch the Bhaati Chowk remodeling project, aiming to reduce traffic congestion and control pollution.
“The market consisted of a total of 149 shops, including some tuck (pan) shops. Around 13 to 14 [shops] were situated in the front, where the shopkeepers were able to take out the birds and cages late at night. The other shopkeepers could not do this since they closed the shops in the evening as per routine,“ Bahu Khan, Lahore Bhaati bird association office bearer told Dawn.
“Thus, all birds (parrots, sparrows, etc) were buried to death after the field operation teams raised all structures with heavy machinery,” Khan lamented.
The shopkeepers lashed out at the government for not even giving them adequate time to evacuate their birds and pets worth millions of rupees.
On the other hand, the government has rejected the allegations, claiming that not a single bird was killed during the operation.
“All shopkeepers were aware of this operation already, and our teams also helped them shift birds and other goods to other places,” LDA director general Tahir Farooq claimed in a telephonic conversation with Dawn.
“The pictures being shown on the media are fake, as not a single bird was injured,” Farooq said, calling it a “propaganda by the shopkeepers to defame the government” and adding that “some political elements are running this campaign against the government”.
Meanwhile, horrified after seeing videos from the demolition site, netizens have termed the action “cruel” and “inhumane”.</p><small>2025-11-07 15:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/072013283b6ccb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953685/pm-shehbaz-arrives-in-azerbaijan-for-2-day-visit' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz arrives in Azerbaijan for 2-day visit</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Baku on Friday for a two-day official visit to Azerbaijan at the invitation of President Ilham Aliyev, where he will attend the country’s Victory Day ceremony.
PM Shehbaz, accompanied by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, was received at Heydar Aliyev International Airport by First Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan Yagub Eyyubov, First Deputy Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Fariz Razayev, Pakistani Ambassador to Azerbaijan Qasim Mohiuddin and diplomatic staff.
He is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Aliyev during his visit.
 






Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said PM Shehbaz would undertake the visit to participate in events being held in connection with the fifth anniversary of Victory Day, which commemorates Azerbaijan’s triumph in liberating its territories from Armenian occupation.
The statement said that the premier was undertaking the visit at the invitation of Azerbaijan President Aliyev. “During the visit, the prime minister will attend the official Victory Day celebrations and hold a meeting with President Aliyev,” the FO said.
“Discussions will focus on reviewing the entire gamut of bilateral relations and identifying new avenues to further deepen cooperation in diverse sectors, including trade and investment, energy, defence, education, and regional connectivity,” it added.
 






The FO said that Pakistan and Azerbaijan enjoy “long-standing fraternal relations, rooted in shared faith, history, culture, and mutual trust”.
“The visit by the prime minister will reaffirm Pakistan’s steadfast support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and to further advance the strategic partnership between the two brotherly nations,” the FO concluded.
The premier had visited Azerbaijan earlier this year in May as well while on a four-nation tour. He had met the Azerbaijan president, and the two had renewed their pledge to diversify the strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues.
President Aliyev had also called PM Shehbaz in August and expressed his appreciation for Pakistan’s consistent support on the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.</p><small>2025-11-07 15:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/071810289035177.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953709/matter-of-appointing-opposition-leader-in-na-is-sub-judice-speaker' target='_blank'><strong>Matter of appointing opposition leader in NA is ‘sub judice’: speaker</strong></a><br><p>National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Friday told a PTI delegation that the matter of the nomination of the opposition leader in the house is “sub judice”.
After the conviction of Omer Ayub Khan in the May 9 cases, the party nominated Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai as opposition leader in the National Assembly.
The speaker stated that the matter is under consideration during a meeting with a parliamentary delegation of the PTI — led by party chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and comprising former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser and other PTI members — at Parliament House.
An official handout issued by the NA Secretariat also said that “during the meeting, detailed discussions were held regarding the appointment of the Leader of the Opposition in the House and the speaker informed the delegation that the matter was currently sub judice.”
The speaker emphasised that the Parliament was the most important and credible institution of democracy, and all political parties should play a constructive role in strengthening it.
He urged the Opposition to play an active and positive role on the parliamentary forum.
“Both the government and the opposition need to move forward with a spirit of consultation and cooperation to resolve the political, economic, and public challenges facing the country,” he said.
He affirmed his readiness to serve as a bridge between the government and the opposition for the promotion of national reconciliation, parliamentary traditions, and the consolidation of the democratic process.
The speaker further expressed hope that all members of Parliament would continue to participate in the legislative process in an effective, positive, and result-oriented manner in the national interest, ensuring durable solutions to the public’s problems.
Akin to the NA, the Senate is also without an opposition leader due to the conviction of Shibli Faraz. The PTI  has nominated Allama Raja Nasir Abbas for the post.
Later speaking at a news conference, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said if the PPP wished to sustain its public-oriented politics, it must reject the entire package of the 27th Constitutional Amendment without exception.
He said the services of PPP’s founder, the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and former prime minister Benazir Bhutto for democracy remain a distinguished chapter in the country’s history, and that the party’s role in the framing of the 1973 Constitution was of fundamental importance.
“Despite this legacy, the PPP seems to be in a mood of political compromise, willing to accept some amendments and reject others,” he said, adding that if the PPP fully turns down the 27th Amendment, it would mark its genuine return to popular politics.
He vowed that the PTI would challenge the passage of the 27th amendment before the courts and would go to the public.
Expressing concern over the recent conduct of the judiciary, the PTI leader said the attitude of the courts had become deeply disappointing.
“When cases are moved or delayed on political grounds or under administrative pressure, it undermines the credibility of the judiciary,” he said. “If a larger bench delivers a verdict and it is not implemented, it raises serious questions over the justice system.”
Qaiser said that justice had practically vanished from the country and the rule of law no longer prevailed, further adding that it was “essential for the judiciary to rise to its primary duty: the delivery of justice and protection of citizens’ rights.”
Referring to the movement led by former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, Qaiser said that the nation had then stood firmly with the judiciary, and would do so again if it acts to uphold the supremacy of the Constitution and the law.
The PTI stalwart added that his party’s contacts with opposition parties were ongoing. “Our first meeting was with Maulana Fazlur Rehman, in which we thanked him for his support in the appointment of the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly,” he said.
“The Maulana hosted a dinner where detailed political discussions took place, and it was agreed that all opposition parties would hold internal consultations before formulating a joint strategy.”
Paying tribute to Sahibzada Hamid Raza, the PTI leader said his services for democracy were commendable. He regretted that “unjust cases” had been filed against him, expressing the hope that they would soon be heard and that justice would prevail.</p><small>2025-11-07 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632542-punjab-govt-considers-raising-challan-amount-upto-rs15000' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt considers raising challan amount upto Rs20,000</strong></a><br><p>

A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held consultations with ruling allies to secure support for the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment, with the government expected to table the bill in the Senate within days.
“The provinces have a constitutional right to an increased NFC (National Finance Commission) award, not a reduced one,” he said, warning that if provincial rights were stripped, the JUI-F would “strongly oppose it.”
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Fazl said his party had agreed on certain points in principle, but would only comment further once a draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment was presented.
Commenting on proposed changes to Article 243, he said the matter must be viewed in two ways: “If it is used to affect democracy, the Constitution or politics, we will not accept it. But if it is purely administrative, we will review it first and then decide.”
He added that nothing was being resolved at the moment because the country was relying too heavily on one institution. “Until we adopt collective thinking, nothing will be fixed,” he said, urging dialogue among parliament, its security committee, and all stakeholders to reach a consensus.
Referring to the 26th Amendment, the JUI-F chief said that during that process, parliament’s engagement had led to the government withdrawing 35 clauses from the draft. “We should not repeat practices that raise questions about parliament’s representation of the people,” he cautioned.
He stressed the need for “natural lawmaking” rather than hurried or self-serving legislation. “We make unusual laws that society rejects. We must avoid misusing our authority,” he said.
On the pace of the amendment process, Fazl noted that the 18th Amendment had been passed through a consensus-driven, months-long process. “When this [27th Amendment] comes forward, we will see how long it takes,” he said, adding that there was no current plan to meet PPP leaders to discuss the matter.
PPP draws red line
PPP, a major ally of the ruling PML-N-led government, on Thursday drew a red line against any change to the provinces’ share under the NFC while indicating conditional support for limited amendments to Article 243 governing federal control of the armed forces.
Announcing decisions of the party’s Central Exe­cutive Committee (CEC) at Bilawal House late in the night, PPP Chairman Bil­awal Bhutto-Zardari said discussions on the government’s proposed constitutional changes would continue on Friday but stressed the PPP “can never compromise on the financial rights of the provinces”.
“The PPP rejects the proposal for constitutional protection of the provinces’ share,” he said, adding that the CEC had, however, authorised support for specific adjustments in Article 243.
“The government has proposed giving the Joint Chiefs a new designation, creating a new position for Strategic Command and a position of Field Marshal. Only this amendment the CEC has allowed me to support,” Bhutto-Zardari added.
On the question of establishing a constitutional court, the PPP remained non-committal, saying further internal deliberation was required before arriving at any decision.</p><small>2025-11-07 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632541-lina-khan-pakistani-american-co-chairing-mamdanis-transition-team' target='_blank'><strong>Lina Khan — Pakistani-American co-chairing Mamdani's transition team</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking to reporters outside Adiala Jail a day prior, the CM alleged that security forces in KP would bring dogs into mosques and tie them down there, thereby violating the sanctity of holy places.
“When we would go and tell them that they are violating the sanctity of the mosque, they would tell us ‘you and these dogs are no different’,” CM Afridi said. “Despite this, we still support them … but do they know the pain of my people?”
Taking to X and posting a video of the CM’s remarks, Kundi wrote that he condemned any rhetoric that undermined the “honour and sacrifice” of the armed forces.
“The brave sons of our soil lay down their lives to protect our province — questioning their intent in sensational terms only damages morale and public safety,” he wrote.
Kundi affirmed the importance of intelligence-based operations, stating that they were necessary to protect the public and were conducted solely to safeguard the population.
 






“Political debate must not cross into actions or words that weaken our security institutions,” he wrote. “[KP CM Afridi] should exercise restraint and place the safety and unity of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa above partisan posturing.”
The governor maintained that KP’s security demands that all political forces stand with the armed forces to ensure peace in the province.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.
“Ultimately, it is the people who will deliver accountability in the coming elections,” Kundi wrote.
Meanwhile, the Khyber Union of Journalists (KUJ) took strong notice of the CM’s remarks and issued a statement expressing “deep concern and regret”.
“Dragging mosques and madrassas into political disputes in any way is a condemnable and irresponsible behaviour,” the statement read, quoting KUJ President Kashifuddin Syed.
“He (Syed) clarified that the sanctity of places of worship, respect for worshippers there and respect for the sacrifices of martyrs are obligatory on all of us,” the statement added. “Such statements cause chaos in society, hurt religious sentiments and increase suspicion against state institutions.”
 






Syed also paid tribute to the sacrifices of the armed forces for their role in fighting terrorism and emphasised that “any attempt to make this important role controversial is tantamount to strengthening the enemy’s narrative,” according to the KUJ.
“The president of the Khyber Union of Journalists demanded that the chief minister should show responsibility and prudence in choosing words, not use religious places for politics, and issue statements keeping in mind the requirements of national unity,” the statement added.
Pakistan Ulema Council chairman condemns KP CM
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Pakistan Ulema Council also condemned CM Afridi in a statement, calling it “misleading”.
“The speech made by KP CM regarding mosques is regrettable,” Maulana Tahir Ashrafi was quoted as saying.
“The statement made by the KP CM is also an attempt to tarnish the image of Pakistan,” Maulana Ashrafi said. “The Pakistan Army is the protector of mosques and madrasas, which will never be unsafe.”
The chairman added that the foundation of the Pakistan Army is “faith, piety, and jihad in the way of Allah” and that the army has fought a major war against terrorism and succeeded.
“The Pakistan Army is once again fighting the war imposed on Pakistan,” Maulana Ashrafi stated. “Terrorists have also come and committed terrorism in the mosques of the Pakistan Army.”</p><small>2025-11-07 13:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/07173856b476a01.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953699/explainer-why-are-aircraft-engineers-protesting-against-pia' target='_blank'><strong>Explainer: Why are aircraft engineers protesting against PIA?</strong></a><br><p>For nearly a year, engineers working at Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), represented by the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP), have been raising their voices over what they describe as unfair treatment and safety concerns within the airline. Recently, however, the matter has escalated, turning into a protest, resulting in the delay of flights and leading to the suspension of a few SAEP officials.
On Monday night, the aircraft engineers refused to issue clearance certificates to aircraft, because of which hundreds of passengers were stranded at different airports due to long delays in the flights, especially those scheduled for Saudi Arabia.
Why are engineers protesting?
According to SAEP representatives, the protest was carried out over two primary issues: salary disparities as well as safety and the unavailability of spare parts.
SAEP members claim that while pilots receive salary hikes, engineers’ pay remains stagnant. Moreover, the engineers claim they are often told to reuse old aircraft parts instead of being provided with new ones, a practice they say could compromise passenger safety.
For the past two months, engineers have been fastening black ribbons around their arms to state a protest against low salaries. On November 3, PIA’s flight operations were disrupted across the country after the engineers’ group refused to issue clearances to aircraft, claiming that they could not compromise on travel safety.
Struggling national carrier
The PIA said in a statement that a “de-recognised entity, SAEP, in order to pressurise the management, tried to halt the operations during late hours of yesterday (Monday) night with their nefarious design to sabotage the privatisation process.“
The government is making efforts to sell the struggling national flag carrier, which has accumulated over $2.5 billion in losses in roughly a decade. In June, it received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm.
Yesterday, SAEP President Abdullah Jadoon and Secretary General Awais Jadoon were dismissed from service, further worsening tensions.
SAEP says it plans to challenge the dismissals of employees in court.
Role of aircraft engineers
Aircraft engineers play a key role in flight operations: a plane cannot take off until they sign off on safety clearances. SAEP maintains that it prioritises passenger safety even as it faces what it calls a “frustrating” work environment created by the management.
Recently, an incident involving PIA flight PK859 highlighted SAEP’s concerns, where an aircraft on its way to Jeddah from Lahore had its windshield broken mid-air, forcing the pilot to reroute back to Lahore.
According to engineers, they had previously cautioned that the aircraft was unfit to fly, but PIA allegedly disregarded those concerns. The captain (pilot) of the flight said the aircraft could not fly any further.</p><small>2025-11-07 13:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632537-deadlock-persists-as-ppp-rejects-key-clauses-of-proposed-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Deadlock persists as PPP rejects key clauses of proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

The two-day negotiations, which began yesterday and are being held at Istanbul’s Conrad Hotel under restricted media access, are the third round of Pakistan–Afghan Taliban engagement following border clashes last month. They are aimed at ending cross-border terrorism and finalising a framework for monitoring and verification of counterterrorism commitments. Intelligence chiefs of both countries are leading their respective sides.
Officials privy to the matter said the talks could be extended beyond today if required.
FO briefing
Foreign Office spokesperson in Islamabad Tahir Hussain Andrabi told reporters at the weekly media briefing today that the Pakistani delegation had presented its case to the mediators in a comprehensive and evidence-based manner.
“The Pakistan delegation has handed over its evidence-based, justified, and logical demands to the mediators with a singular aim to put an end to cross-border terrorism,” Andrabi said. “The mediators fully endorsed Pakistan’s stance on the basis of evidence provided by our side, as well as the tenets of international law and principles.”
“They are now discussing Pakistan’s demands with the Afghan delegation point by point,” he added.
‘Progress encouraging’
Separately, sources privy to the matter described the progress on the negotiations so far as “encouraging,” noting that “an understanding may be achieved on some outstanding points.”
However, they cautioned that agreement on verifiable enforcement against terrorist groups remained elusive.
According to officials familiar with the discussions, Pakistan has pressed the Afghan Taliban to disassociate from the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and take concrete action against anti-Pakistan elements operating from Afghan territory.
Islamabad has sought a clear decree from Kabul, explicitly committing to distancing itself from the TTP, the sources said.
Since the talks resumed on Thursday morning, the mediators have been primarily engaged with the Afghan side to reach an agreement. “Interlocutors are working with mediators to achieve a balanced understanding,” an Afghan source noted.
Potential areas of convergence reportedly may include counterterrorism cooperation and border security protocols, but persistent mistrust and Kabul’s ambiguous stance on the TTP continue to pose challenges to a lasting deal.
Border clashes and talks
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha.
Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved.
After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday.
The talks began yesterday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire.
Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing.</p><small>2025-11-07 12:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/071414220b833fe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953692/indonesian-mosque-blasts-injure-dozens-teenage-suspect-identified' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesian mosque blasts injure dozens, teenage suspect identified</strong></a><br><p>Explosions at a mosque in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta that injured dozens of people during Friday prayers could have been an attack, officials indicated, with a 17-year-old identified as the suspected perpetrator.
Police said 55 people were in hospitals with a range of minor to serious injuries, including burns, after the blasts at the mosque inside a school complex in the Kelapa Gading area.
“The explosion was loud, so loud that I could not breathe because I was shocked,” said Luciana, 43, who was working at the school canteen at the time.
She described multiple blasts and panic as dozens fled the complex.
“I thought it was a short circuit or the sound system which exploded — we were so afraid, so we rushed out.”
Deputy House Speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, speaking to the media after visiting a hospital, said the young male suspect was undergoing surgery, without giving more details or a possible motive.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences over the incident in a post on X, offering prayers for the swift recovery of the injured.
“Pakistan stands with Indonesia in global efforts against terrorism and extremism,” he wrote. “The Pakistani nation has already made heavy sacrifices against terrorism … Terrorism has severely affected my own life as well, but I never lost courage.”
 






Investigation
At a news conference, Jakarta city police chief Asep Edi Suheri said a probe was under way.
“We have taken several measures such as investigating the crime scene, setting up a police line and sterilising the area,” Suheri said.
Indonesia does have a history of attacks on churches and Western targets — but not mosques.
News channel KompasTV showed footage of a green-painted mosque with a line of shoes outside, cordoned off with police tape. There were no signs of damage to the exterior.
State news agency Antara quoted the deputy chief security minister, Lodewijk Freidrich, as saying there were two explosions.
Black-clad police carrying assault rifles guarded the iron gates of the compound, with emergency vehicles and armoured police vehicles on the street outside.
The complex is located in a crowded area of North Jakarta on largely navy-owned land, home to many military personnel and retired officers.</p><small>2025-11-07 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0715395788cdefa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953695/speculation-about-27th-constitutional-amendment-results-in-plea-landing-in-supreme-court' target='_blank'><strong>Speculation about 27th Constitutional Amendment results in plea landing in Supreme Court</strong></a><br><p>A petition was filed in the Supreme Court on Friday to challenge the “attempts to do away with the constitutional jurisdiction of the superior judiciary”, apparently by means of a 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The proposed changes to the Constitution have raised concerns that the move could roll back some powers devolved under the landmark 18th Constitution Amendment and further “fine-tune” the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.
“The said proposal, as publicly reported, contemplates the establishment of separate ‘Constitutional Courts’ and the curtailment or transfer of the existing jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the high courts of Pakistan conferred under Articles 184(3) and 199 of the Constitution.
“Such an attempt, if permitted to proceed, would fundamentally alter the constitutional framework, destroy the independence of the judiciary, violate the doctrine of separation of powers, and extinguish the citizens’ right of access to justice and judicial review guaranteed by the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973,” the petition, filed by Barrister Ali Tahir, read.
The Federation of Pakistan, the Senate chairperson and the National Assembly speaker have been named as respondents in the plea.
In the plea, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Barrister Tahir urged the court to declare that “any proposal, attempt, or measure, whether by way of a bill, draft, discussion, or otherwise, that seeks to curtail, transfer, suspend, or abolish the constitutional jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan under Article 184(3) or the high courts under Article 199 of the Constitution, is unconstitutional, void, and of no legal effect, being violative of the independence of the judiciary, the separation of powers, and the basic structure of the Constitution”.
Article 199 of the Constitution deals with the jurisdiction of high courts, while Article 184(3) sets out the SC’s original jurisdiction and enables it to assume jurisdiction in matters involving a question of “public importance” with reference to the “enforcement of any of the fundamental rights” of Pakistan’s citizens.
In this connection, the petitioner urged the apex court to declare that the original jurisdiction of the SC under Article 184(3) “constitutes an essential, inviolable, and non-amendable feature of the Constitution, forming part of its basic structure and fundamental framework, and that no constitutional amendment, legislation, or executive action can lawfully diminish or extinguish the same”.
The court may also declare that “any attempt to establish a parallel or superior
forum styled as a ‘Constitutional Court’, distinct from or in substitution of the Supreme Court or the high courts, would be repugnant to Articles 175 to 191 of the Constitution and hencе unconstitutional”, the petition further stated.
The said articles of the Constitution cover matters pertaining to the establishment and jurisdiction of courts.
The petitioner also asked the court to “hold and affirm that the Supreme Court and the high courts are the sole and exclusive repositories of judicial power under the Constitution, and that their jurisdiction, composition, and independence cannot be interfered with, altered, or restructured
by any organ of the State”.
He sought the court’s intervention to restrain “all organs of the State, including the Federation of Pakistan, the federal government, and any parliamentary body or committee, from taking any step or initiating any process aimed at curtailing, transferring, suspending, or otherwise affecting the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or the high courts, whether through the proposed Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Bill, 2025, or by any other means”.
Moreover, the petitioner urged the court to declare that “any constitutional amendment which results in the subordination of the judiciary to the executive or legislature, or which undermines judicial review, is contrary to the supremacy of the Constitution and therefore void ab initio (having no legal effect)”.
The court may also direct all state institutions, authorities and functionaries to
“act strictly in accordance with the Constitution, uphold judicial independence, and refrain from any measure that tends to erode or diminish the powers and jurisdiction of the superior judiciary”.
The petition sought an affirmation by the SC that it was, as the “ultimate guardian of the Constitution, empowered and obligated to preserve, protect, and defend the constitutional framework, including its own jurisdiction, against any encroachment, whether actual or imminent”.
During the pendency of this plea, the petition said, the court may restrain “the Federation of Pakistan, through the federal government, the cabinet, the Parliament, and all other organs or functionaries of the State, from taking any step, action, or measure, whether legislative, executive, or administrative, aimed at introducing, debating, processing, or passing any bill or proposal, including the proposed Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Bill, 2025, that seeks to curtail, transfer, suspend, or otherwise affect the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or the high courts as conferred under Articles 184(3) and 199 of the Constitution”.
The petitioner also sought the court’s intervention to bar any “discussion, approval, or voting” from being undertaken in any parliamentary forum or committee regarding “any proposal that would alter the existing constitutional jurisdiction or structure of the superior judiciary until the final adjudication” of his plea.
The court may declare that “any step taken or measure initiated in contravention of the above restraint shall be without lawful authority, having no constitutional effect, and subject to being set aside by this honourable court,” the petition said.
The petitioner also requested the court to “issue such further interim directions as may be necessary to ensure that the constitutional jurisdiction, authority, and independence of the Supreme Court and the high courts remain fully protected, preserved, and unimpaired during the pendency” of his plea.
Moreover, the court may pass any other appropriate order during the plea’s pendency that it may deem “just, expedient, and necessary to safeguard the supremacy of the Constitution, the rule of law, and the continued exercise of judicial power by the superior courts”.</p><small>2025-11-07 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632503-istanbul-talks-pakistan-presents-evidence-based-demands-to-end-cross-border-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Istanbul talks: Pakistan presents 'evidence-based' demands to end cross-border terrorism</strong></a><br><p>

Hamid was convicted in the case along with several PTI leaders on July 31. According to his brother, he was detained by Islamabad police earlier today while he was on his way to Faisalabad to court arrest.
He was later presented before the court, which issued an order, noting that Hamid had been convicted in the case registered at Civil Lines police station in Faisalabad by then-ATC Judge Javed Iqbal Sheikh.
He was produced before the court today by Inspector Mujahid Iqbal of Civil Lines police station, it added.
According to the order, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Hamid was sentenced in the case on multiple counts, with the maximum term being 10 years.
It said that the Faisalabad Central Jail superintendent was required and authorised to receive the convict in his custody for the completion of his sentences in accordance with the law.
“The sentences of imprisonment awarded to the convict for all the offences shall run concurrently,” the order read, adding that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been extended in favour of the convict.
The detention
Earlier today, Hamid’s brother, Sahibzada Hassan Raza, had said the SIC chief had been detained by Islamabad police while he was travelling to Faisalabad with the intention of surrendering himself before the court.
Police arrested him near a picket on Islamabad bypass road, Hassan said while speaking to the media outside the Faisalabad ATC, where Hamid was produced.
A separate post on Hamid’s X account also cited Hassan as saying that Hamid
was detained by Islamabad police as he was en route to Faisalabad.
“He was travelling from Peshawar to Faisalabad to surrender. Islamabad police arrested him,” the early morning post stated.
 






PTI leader Omar Ayub also posted about the development, saying that Raza was “abducted” from Islamabad late last night.
“Sahibzada Hamid Raza sahib, my dear friend and colleague, has been abducted from Islamabad late last night whilst en route to surrender in the conviction awarded by an anti-terrorism court [in] Faisalabad,” Ayub said, adding that he “strongly” condemned the move.
 






“Sahibzada Hamid Raza sahib is a brave and very loyal ally of PM Imran Khan (sic). He must be produced immediately in the relevant court,” the PTI leader added.
The development comes just two days after the Peshawar High Court rejected Raza’s plea seeking transit bail in the May 9 riots case.
Violent demonstrations had broken out in the country on May 9, 2023 following the arrest of ex-premier and PTI founder Imran Khan.
Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested. Later, the ECP had also deprived the PTI of its bat symbol, compelling party members to contest the 2024 elections as independent candidates. Subsequently, the PTI had allied with the SIC in a bid to get reserved seats, which are allocated on a party basis.
Raza’s conviction also led to his disqualification as a member of the National Assembly by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
After today’s court order, Hassan said while speaking to the media in Faisalabad that they would move the court for a stay order against election for the seat vacated after Hamid’s disqualification.</p><small>2025-11-07 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/071302227424de0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953688/lhc-orders-punjab-govt-to-act-against-smoke-emitting-vehicles' target='_blank'><strong>LHC orders Punjab govt to act against smoke-emitting vehicles</strong></a><br><p>The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Friday ordered the Punjab government to launch a rigorous campaign against smoke-emitting vehicles in the province in an effort to curb smog and air pollution.
“Whenever you go out, you see dozens of smoke-emitting vehicles on the roads,” Justice Shahid Karim said while hearing a set of petitions against smog and environmental pollution.
Justice Karim instructed authorities to run the campaign for at least two to three weeks and urged strict implementation. He also observed that vehicles travelling from Lahore to Karachi, in particular, were causing pollution.
Officials from the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the Parks and Horticultural Authority (PHA) and other departments also appeared before the court at today’s hearing.
However, the judge expressed his displeasure over the absence of a director-level officer from the EPA, as instructed at the previous hearing.
Taking exception to pollution caused by vehicles, Justice Karim directed the EPA to display banners across Lahore which warned commuters that smoke-emitting vehicles would be impounded.
The EPA official informed the court that such banners had indeed been placed around the city. At this, the judge ordered the agency to depute its officers alongside police personnel at inter-city bus terminals.
He also enquired if vehicles travelling through the motorway toll plazas were being inspected and ordered officials to ensure strict checking of vehicles plying GT Road from Lahore to Multan.
If the court’s previous orders had been implemented in letter and spirit, Lahore’s condition would have been different, he regretted, directing authorities to “take action against anyone responsible for spreading pollution.”
The judge also instructed the Punjab government’s law officer to arrange a joint meeting of the environment department, the chief traffic officer and the transport department.
Earlier, the EPA officer informed the court that at least 60 tons of old tyres had been seized from plants in South Punjab and other cities.
Over the past few weeks, Lahore has continued to remain high on the list of cities with the most polluted air. Today, it ranked as the fifth worst in the world in terms of poor air quality, according to global monitor IQAir. The city registered an air quality index (AQI) reading of 177, which the monitor considers unhealthy.
On Monday, the LHC had expressed its displeasure at the city administration’s lack of action to counter smog and pollution, questioning the use of anti-smog guns and tree cutting in the metropolis. Justice Karim had clarified that the proceedings were not against anyone but meant to guide and assist the government.</p><small>2025-11-07 08:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632485-pakistan-backs-unsc-resolution-lifting-sanctions-on-syrian-president-sharaa' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan backs UNSC resolution lifting sanctions on Syrian President Sharaa</strong></a><br><p>

Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative, made the remarks while addressing the UN Security Council (UNSC). According to a press release issued by the Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the United Nations (UN), the envoy sounded alarm over the “deliberate weaponisation of shared natural resources”, citing the suspension of the IWT as an example.
In his remarks, he warned that the move “should be of grave concern for every member of this council and for the international community as a whole”.
 


“For more than six decades, this treaty has stood as a model of cooperation, ensuring equitable and predictable sharing of the Indus basin’s waters between Pakistan and India even in times of war,” he said.
“India’s unlawful unilateral decision to suspend this framework undermines the letter and spirit of this treaty, threatens ecosystems, disrupts data sharing and endangers the lives of millions who depend on the Indus water system for food and energy security for their very survival,” he said.

The ambassador emphasised that “such acts do not just harm one country … they weaken confidence in international water law and set a precedent for resource-based and driven coercion elsewhere.”
The envoy asserted that “Pakistan has consistently maintained that no provision of the IWT permits unilateral suspension or modification”.
Reiterating Pakistan’s position on the matter, the ambassador called for “full respect for the treaty and an early return to compliance and normal functioning through the established channels.”
According to the press release, Ambassador Asim also highlighted the structural nexus between environment and security and advocated a paradigm shift toward preventive and sustainable peacebuilding.
He also urged “concerted international measures to integrate environmental considerations into conflict prevention, peacekeeping, and post-conflict recovery”.
He called on the UNSC to “fulfil its charter responsibility to address threats to international peace and security at their very inception”. Ahmad further cautioned that “environmental degradation in conflict is not just collateral damage but also a catalyst for instability.”
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s “determination to advance collective action for ecological restoration, strengthen compliance with international law, and transform shared natural resources into instruments of cooperation rather than vectors of division”.
Under the 1960 IWT, three rivers that flow westwards were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers. In 2023, Pakistan brought a case to the the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
In April, India held the IWT in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”.
In June, the PCA issued a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
The court, in its August ruling in the case, said it had jurisdiction over the dispute and ruled the treaty “does not permit India to generate hydro-electric power on the Western Rivers based on what might be the ideal or best practices approach for engineering” of these projects. Instead, the design of these projects must adhere “strictly” to the specifications laid down in the treaty, the court said, adding that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.
Earlier this week, President Asif Ali Zardari said that the violation of the IWT by India could not and would not succeed, and warned against the weaponisation of water.</p><small>2025-11-07 07:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0711184767ea02c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953683/us-influencers-falsely-associate-nyc-mayor-elect-mamdani-with-islamic-state-group' target='_blank'><strong>US influencers falsely associate NYC mayor-elect Mamdani with Islamic State group</strong></a><br><p>US right-wing influencers falsely linked New York’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to the militant Islamic State (IS) group, amplifying a fabricated statement that garnered millions of views on social media, researchers said on Thursday.
Mamdani — the first Muslim and South Asian elected to lead America’s largest city — secured a decisive victory this week in the face of fierce attacks on his policy proposals and religious background.
A slew of anti-Mamdani accounts on the Elon Musk-owned platform X have circulated a statement purportedly from IS titled “Operation Manhattan Project”, which alluded to an attack in New York City on Election Day against what it called “American aggression”.
Among the influencers who linked the fake communique to Mamdani was Laura Loomer, a conservative influencer who has Trump’s ear.
“The Muslims can’t think of a better way for the Muslims to celebrate the victory of a Muslim mayoral candidate today than by committing an ISIS (Islamic State) attack in NYC,” Loomer wrote in a post on X that racked up more than 200,000 views.
 






Other conservative accounts cited the purported statement to falsely claim that the militant group had endorsed Mamdani as mayor.
The posts collectively amassed millions of views across the platform.
The purported letter, which displayed the logo of the IS-affiliated Amaq News Agency, was fabricated, according to multiple researchers including the disinformation watchdog NewsGuard.
Meili Criezis, an American University academic, told the watchdog that the supposed communique did not bear the hallmarks of other statements that emanated from Amaq.
“Amaq is used [by the IS] to share news and claim responsibility for attacks,” Criezis said. “It doesn’t make threats like what is stated in the screenshot.”
The Information Epidemiology Lab, another research group, also said the circulated communique “sharply” diverged from established IS “media practices in language, style, formatting, and distribution”.
The fabricated statement appeared to first surface on the far-right message board 4chan, a known haven for conspiracy theories.
In recent months, Mamdani, a long-standing supporter of the Palestinian cause, has vocally denounced anti-Semitism as well as the Islamophobia he himself suffered following the September 11, 2001 attacks.
 
 

The 34-year-old state lawmaker — who appealed to voters by pledging to tackle the soaring cost of living — has repeatedly been targeted by racist tropes and misinformation.
In the weeks leading up to the highly anticipated election, AFP’s fact-checkers debunked several false internet claims targeting Mamdani, including that a non-citizen illegally voted for him and that one of his campaign staffers posed beside graffiti of Nazi swastika.</p><small>2025-11-07 06:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632470-commander-of-defence-forces-title-on-the-cards-as-part-of-key-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>'Commander of Defence Forces' title on the cards as part of key reforms</strong></a><br><p>

The 32-year-old pacer, in an interview on a YouTube channel, accused officials including then selector and manager Manjurul Islam of sexual harassment during the 2022 Women’s World Cup in South Africa.
Manjurul, who is currently in China, rejected the allegations as “baseless”.
Describing an incident during the 2022 World Cup, Jahanara alleged that Manjurul “made inappropriate physical contact”, claiming he “often hugged or pressed female players to his chest” under the pretext of encouragement.
“You can ask other girls in the team”, Manjurul said. “This is all false.”
Manjurul, 46, a former left-arm seamer, played 12 Tests and 34 ODIs for Bangladesh between 1999 and 2004, before serving in various coaching and managerial roles.
Jahanara took 48 wickets in ODIs, and 60 in T20s, across 135 white-ball matches for her country.
She also named other BCB officials, and said that she had previously written to the board, but that no action had been taken.
The BCB said a committee would submit its findings within 15 working days.
It reaffirmed its commitment to a “safe, respectful, and professional environment”, it said in a statement late on Thursday.
“We have to investigate this, since it’s a serious matter,” BCB vice-president Shakhawat Hossain said.</p><small>2025-11-07 06:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632473-sic-chief-sahibzada-hamid-raza-arrested-in-faisalabad' target='_blank'><strong>SIC chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza arrested in Faisalabad</strong></a><br><p>

The demonstration held in the Kosar area along Bajaur-Peshawar Highway was attended by residents of Lra Banda, Shagi, Kosar, Delhi, Janat Shah, Galo Kass, Gooro and surrounding areas in large numbers.
The gathering was joined by several political and social activists, including a delegation of Bajaur Aman Jirga led by its chief Sahibzada Haroon Rashid.
The participants, who blocked the highway to vehicular movement by sitting on the road, claimed that a number of civilian houses and mosques in Kosar and its adjacent areas were targeted with heavy weapons last night.
The angered protesters asserted that the targeting of civilian houses had not only created fear and panic among the local communities but had also put the lives of their families, mainly children, women and elderly people, in grave danger, as they were living in their houses at the time of the firing.
Bajaur Aman Jirga head Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, Nawagai tehsil council chairman and PTI senior leader Dr Khalilur Rehman, ANP general secretary Shah Naseer Khan, party deputy general secretary Sayed Sadiq Akbar Jan, Hazar Hayat and Irshad Khan addressed the demonstration and expressed concerns over the alleged targeting of civilian houses.
Calling the attacks on the houses of residents intolerable, the speakers said such an act was not only against the civilians but also a violation of the agreement made by authorities to refrain from targeting the local population in the anti-terrorist operation in the region.
“The targeting of the residents’ houses in Kosar and its adjacent areas last night was a clear violation of the agreement made by authorities with them on August 14 before an operation was launched in Mamund tehsil that the civilian population wouldn’t be targeted,” Mr Rashid said.
He and other speakers asked authorities to ensure protection of public life and property during the ongoing operation.
They said that people across the district wanted an early end to the ongoing unrest and uncertainty in the region.
The speakers observed that the prolonged unrest and uncertainty had badly affected the lives of the residents.
The demonstration lasted several hours, forcing transporters to use a difficult alternative route. Protesters dispersed peacefully after Sahibzada Rashid informed them that authorities, through the deputy commissioner, had assured the Bajaur Aman Jirga that the civilian population won’t be targeted in the operation.

The announcement came after Trump said he had held a call with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.
“We will soon announce a signing ceremony to make it official, and there are many more countries trying to join this club of STRENGTH,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
 






The Kazakh government said in a statement that the matter was in the final stage of negotiations.
“Our anticipated accession to the Abraham Accords represents a natural and logical continuation of Kazakhstan’s foreign policy course grounded in dialogue, mutual respect, and regional stability,” it added.
Kazakhstan already has full diplomatic relations and economic ties with Israel, meaning the move would be largely symbolic, something Secretary of State Marco Rubio pushed back against on Thursday.
“It’s an enhanced relationship beyond just diplomatic relations,” he said.
“It is … with all the other countries that are part of the accord. You’re now creating a partnership that brings special and unique economic development on all sorts of issues that they can work on together.”
Trump met with Tokayev alongside four other Central Asian leaders from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan at the White House on Thursday as the US seeks to gain influence in a region long dominated by Russia and increasingly courted by China.
“Some of the countries represented here are going to be joining the Abraham Accords … and those announcements will be made over the next little while,” Trump said.
Witkoff returning for announcement
US special envoy Steve Witkoff said earlier at a business forum in Florida that he would be returning to Washington for the announcement, without naming the country.
Axios first reported that the country would be Kazakhstan.
A second source familiar with the matter said the United States hopes that Kazakhstan’s entry will help reinvigorate the Abraham Accords, the expansion of which has been on hold during the Gaza conflict.
Trump has repeatedly said he wants to expand the accords that he brokered during his first term in the White House.
The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain established ties with Israel in 2020 under the Trump-brokered Abraham Accords. Morocco established ties with Israel later the same year.
Trump has been upbeat about the prospects that regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia will finally join the accords since a ceasefire went into effect in Gaza last month, but Riyadh has shown no willingness to move ahead without at least a pathway to Palestinian statehood.
Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is expected to visit the White House on November 18.
Other Central Asian countries such as Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, both of which have close ties with Israel, have also been seen as potentially joining the Abraham Accords, which is considered a signature foreign policy achievement of Trump’s first term.</p><small>2025-11-07 04:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/07081339ea14ca3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953631/legal-experts-question-rationale-behind-new-legislation-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Legal experts question rationale behind new legislation plan</strong></a><br><p>• Former law officer says nation must brace itself for long struggle against ‘praetorian judges’
• Ruling elite has inflicted unprecedented harm on independence of judiciary, Akram Sheikh argues
ISLAMABAD: As speculations swirl around the controversial 27th Con­stitutional Amend­ment, legal experts have questioned the rationale behind such constitutional tweaks, especially after the previous 26th Amen­dment that had effectively brought the superior judiciary under the executive’s control.
The “final draft” of this Amendment has hitherto been kept under wraps, but its contours were recently shared by PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari when he said a prime minister-led delegation had sought the PPP’s support for its passage. In a statement, he said the proposal included setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, matters related to the transfer of judges, ending the protection of provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, and amending Article 243, which pertains to the command of the armed forces.
While some see it as a continuation of the 26th Amendment, a senior counsel questioned the reason behind such a move at a time when the government had not lost even a single constitutional case in the superior court.
“Not a single case pertaining to constitutional interpretations, be it the reserved seat case, judges transfer matter, military courts case, or matters relating to taxes, has ever been lost by the federal government after the passage of the 26th Amen­dment,” remarked the cou­nsel on condition of ano­nymity. Then what is the rationale behind stirring up the controversy at this juncture, he wondered.
Except for enhancing the retirement age limit from the existing 65 years, that too of ‘a few friends’, what the proposed constitutional court will be doing when the federal government has not lost a single major case from the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court.
The need to establish the Federal Constitutional Court is understandable, had Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah or Justice Munib Akhtar also been included in the CB. But when these judges are not part of the bench, then what is the purpose of establishing this court, he asked.
About speculations that the executive magistracy may be restored through the proposed Amendment, the counsel conceded that the judicial magistracy had failed to meet the expectations since it was common knowledge that they never resisted the remand of an accused in important cases. The reverting back to the executive magistracy will effectively be used to control the streets, he said.
Regarding the transfer of judges, he said that when the CB through a majority judgement has already empowered the government to transfer any high court to another high court, what more does the government intend to achieve?
Inevitable continuation
Meanwhile, former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar was of the view that the proposed 27th Amendment was the inevitable continuation of the 26th Amendment.
The executive wants to tighten its grip on the judiciary: granting unfettered power to transfer high court judges, a federal constitutional court as the ultimate guardian of the Constitution with its head chairing the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), thus playing a pivotal role in the appointment and ouster of judges and reducing the present Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) to an ineffectual position, he said.
The nation must brace itself for a long struggle against praetorian judges, the rollback of the independent judiciary, and the weight of the executive on the scales of justice, he feared.
According to former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Muhammad Akram Sheikh, the result of the general election on Feb 8, 2024, stunned the electors, monitoring agencies and the media beyond reproach.
The ruling elite then impose ‘PCO’ by giving an oath to willing judges while relieving others and thus nailing down the entire superior court. The regime inflicted unprecedented harm on the most paramount state organ of an independent judiciary, Akram Sheikh regretted, adding that the ruling elite decided to punish the Supreme Court in a manner not ever thought about by the respective military regimes.
Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani, considered to be one of the architects of the 18th Amendment, feared that in the brittle political situation prevalent in the country, the proposed tweaks would cast a shadow over the federation that may also help regain an extra nationalist narrative.
The proposed Amendment that deals with the question of bringing changes to the removal of protection for the share of provinces in the divisible pool through the National Finance Commission (NFC), as well as restoring the devolved ministries back to the federal government, amounts to the rollback of the 18th Amendment.
In Jan 2015, Mr Rabbani regretted after a vote on the 21st Amendment, which provided for military courts to try terrorists, stating he was ashamed of voting for the bill, although he did so in line with his party’s discipline.

• Taliban leader asks Afghan team to only make ‘realistic’ commitments
• Flare-up at Chaman-Spin Boldak looms over talks; at least two killed
ISLAMABAD: The third round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks opened in Istanbul on Thursday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested a shaky ceasefire.
Mediated by Turkiye and Qatar and held at the Conrad Hotel with restricted media access, the two-day round is focused on finalising a framework for a “monitoring and verification mechanism” agreed in principle last week, and on addressing long-standing disputes linked to militant sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.
Pakistan’s delegation is led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Asim Malik and includes senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials.
The Afghan Taliban side is headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and includes senior figures such as Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib.
The current dialogue process began after deadly clashes along the border last month — the worst since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul. Pakistan accused the Taliban of harbouring militants from Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), responsible for a series of cross-border attacks. The Taliban denied the accusations and accused Islamabad of airstrikes inside Afghan territory.
A ceasefire was brokered in Doha on Oct 19 through Qatari mediation, followed by two rounds of talks in Istanbul.
Before formal discussions resumed in Istanbul for the third round, Turkish and Qatari intelligence officials held separate consultations with both sides. The talks later continued in both direct and indirect formats.
A Pakistani official familiar with the delegation’s position said Islamabad’s demands remain “non-negotiable”.
“Pakistan’s position is clear,” the official said. “Our position is based on ground realities and solid information. We are seeking a verification mechanism to ensure that commitments made by Taliban representatives are kept. This includes the handover of all TTP leadership currently sheltered in Afghanistan.”
He added that the Pakistani delegation had proposed neutral, third-party observers to look into the presence of “terrorist groups” in Afghanistan and the action that is taken against them to prevent them from carrying out attacks in Pakistan.
“We have credible information that the (Afghan) Taliban regime is relocating TTP fighters within urban civilian populations,” he said. “This is a tactic designed to falsely portray any necessary action by Pakistan against TTP terrorists as an attack on civilians.”
According to Afghan sources, the Taliban delegation came to Istanbul with specific instructions from their leader, Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada. The Taliban chief reportedly told his negotiators to make only those commitments that could be realistically fulfilled and warned them against yielding to Pakistani demands.
Exchange of fire
Expectations for the Istanbul round were already modest, given the deep mistrust between the two sides and the little progress made in the previous two rounds. The situation worsened briefly on Thursday afternoon after two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing, threatening to derail the fragile dialogue.
Both sides accused the other of initiating the gunfire, though no casualties were reported. The incident, which lasted for a short time, came just hours after the opening session of talks in Istanbul.
“Afghan forces opened fire at Tasadaq and Iqbal Posts located along the Chaman border around 5pm, and Pakistani troops immediately retaliated and returned fire,” an official told Dawn.
He said the mortars landed in the Vesh Mandi area. However, he said it was a brief exchange of fire and no loss of life or property was reported.
An Afghan official in Spin Boldak told Chaman-based journalists that the incident was a result of a misunderstanding arising from celebratory fire at a marriage ceremony.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, however, disputed the account, accusing Pakistani forces of violating the truce.
“While the third round of negotiations with the Pakistani side had begun in Istanbul, unfortunately, this afternoon Pakistani forces once again opened fire on Spin Boldak, causing concern among the local population,” he said in a statement. “The Islamic emirate’s forces, out of respect for the negotiation team and to prevent civilian casualties, have so far shown no reaction.”
However, Pakistan rejected Mr Mujahid’s claim as “baseless”.
“We strongly reject claims circulated by the Afghan side regarding today’s incident at the Pak-Afghan border at Chaman,” the Information Ministry said. “Firing was initiated from the Afghan side, to which our security forces responded immediately in a measured and responsible manner.”
It added that the situation was brought under control, and the ceasefire remains intact.

The regulator conducted a public hearing for additional recovery worth Rs8.4 billion from all consumers over the coming three months — December to February 2026 — under quarterly tariff adjustment (QRA) for the first quarter (July-September) that would result in a per unit additional charge of about 50 paise per unit.
Since a previous negative QTA of about Rs1.80 per unit is expiring this month, the consumers would be paying a Rs2.30 per unit net higher cost in the December-February period.
 
 

Separately, Nepra called a public hearing on Nov 11 on another government directive for slashing power rates on incremental consumption by Rs11 per unit to Rs22.98 per unit for industrial and agricultural users to revive consumption that has plummeted by 14pc and 47pc, respectively.
Both revisions, upon approval, would apply across the country, including all distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric, under the government’s end-to-end national uniform tariff policy.

Power tariffs set to increase by Rs2.30 for users; govt pushes for Rs11 cut for incremental industrial, agricultural consumption

The public hearing was told that capacity charges had increased by Rs21.7bn in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, which was an alarming situation. However, the capacity charges were partly compensated by Rs13.3bn reduction in operation and maintenance costs, use of service charges and market operation fee and impact of technical losses in fuel costs, leaving a net additional financial burden of Rs8.4bn.
The hearing was also told that consumption in the July-September period increased by 1.5pc to 7pc in various Discos, while industrial consumption alone went up by 11 to 28pc, which was a good sign. All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) suggested that, in view of encouraging consumption patterns, the government should not impose fixed charges on net-metering consumers as demanded by some power companies.
 
 

Some industrial representatives said the consumers would get a net benefit Rs2.40 per unit through the proposed incentive package from the government because it would come into force only after 25pc increase in consumption. They said the incentive package was unfeasible given ambitious targets to become eligible for a discount, while there was no improvement in system losses and recoveries.
Nepra’s Member Technical Rafique A. Shaikh said the circular debt would not end unless recoveries improved and losses reduced, as evident from first quarter results showing Rs87bn increase in circular debt due to losses and Rs84bn due to lower recoveries.
On the other hand, the Power Division, in its petition for an incentive package for incremental consumption, the electricity demand across major consumer categories witnessed a noticeable contraction, reflecting broader macroeconomic adjustments, structural changes in consumption patterns, and increased adoption of alternative supply options such as net metering (6,035MW).
“The decline has been (particularly pronounced in the industrial and agricultural sectors, where consumption has reduced by 14pc and 47pc respectively”, it said, adding the demand reduction was leading to a vicious cycle where under-utilisation of system assets further increased the tariff due to under recovery of fixed cost.
It said the targeted incentive package in the past had worked well in stimulating demand and enhancing asset utilisation. The Industrial Support Package of November 2020-2023 helped increase industrial consumption by 14pc while Bijli Sahulat Package of December 2024-February 2025 recorded industrial growth of 6.9pc, 2.7pc and 10.2pc over three consecutive months.

• PTI says current govt lacks mandate to amend Constitution
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday held consultations with ruling allies to secure support for the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment, with the government expected to table the bill in the Senate within days.
The prime minister has also convened a meeting of the federal cabinet today (Friday), with the 27th Amendment topping the agenda. Sources said the amendment could be introduced in parliament after cabinet approval.
The premier is due to depart for Azerbaijan later in the day for a one-day official visit.
Some media reports suggested PM Shehbaz has decided to establish a parliamentary committee bringing all parties together to fine-tune the draft and seek consensus. However, there was no confirmation from the Prime Minister’s Office.
It has been learnt that all government allies, except the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), have assured conditional support, provided the 18th Amendment is not rolled back.
The PPP leadership, which met the prime minister earlier this week, reiterated at its Central Executive Committee meeting on Thursday that it would safeguard the 18th Amendment.
On the other hand, the government is said to be adamant about getting the 27th Amendment passed next week. The plan is to move the 27th Amendment first in the Senate and then in the National Assembly.
As constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority in both houses, winning over the PPP remains pivotal. The next two days are said to be quite crucial in this regard.
Meetings with ruling coalition
Meanwhile, a delegation of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) led by its convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui called on PM Shehbaz on Thursday.
A statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said “discussion and consultation took place on the proposed 27th Amendment” during the meeting.
The delegation also included Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, MNAs Dr Farooq Sattar, Jawed Hanif Khan, Syed Aminul Haque and Khawaja Izharul Hassan, the statement added.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and others also attended the meeting. They were also present in PM Shehbaz’s meetings with the delegations of the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) and Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q).
The IPP delegation was led by party president and Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan and Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, while the PML-Q team was led by Overseas Pakistanis Minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain, with Senator Kamil Ali Agha and MNAs Mohammad Ilyas Choudhary and Farukh Khan in attendance. The premier also held separate meetings with Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) chief Khalid Hussain Magsi, PML-Zia president Ijazul Haq, and an Awami National Party (ANP) delegation led by Senator Aimal Wali Khan.
In a separate development, MQM has presented its own version of additions to the 27th Amendment, calling for strong, autonomous local governments across the country, and has sought JUI-F’s support for constitutional protection of the system.
An MQM delegation led by Mr Siddiqui met JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman at his residence to present the amendment’s draft. MQM leader Mustafa Kamal said the party’s proposal aims to ensure powers and resources “reach the people’s doorsteps”, arguing that the current federal and provincial set-up “fails to deliver services effectively”.
The party said it would now await JUI-F’s formal response.
Meanwhile, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza confirmed that the MQM delegation had called on Maulana Fazlur Rehman and presented the draft amendment.
“The 27th Amendment relates to Article 140-A, which deals with local government powers,” he said. “We will review and study the draft carefully before giving our feedback,” he added.
PPP draws red line
Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Thursday drew a red line against any change to the provinces’ share under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, while indicating conditional support for limited amendments to Article 243 governing federal control of the armed forces.
Announcing decisions of the party’s Central Exe­cutive Committee (CEC) at Bilawal House late in the night, PPP Chairman Bil­awal Bhutto-Zardari said discussions on the government’s proposed constitutional changes would continue on Friday but stressed the PPP “can never compromise on the financial rights of the provinces”.
 






“The PPP rejects the proposal for constitutional protection of the provinces’ share,” he said, adding that the CEC had, however, authorised support for specific adjustments in Article 243.
“The government has proposed giving the Joint Chiefs a new designation, creating a new position for Strategic Command and a position of Field Marshal. Only this amendment the CEC has allowed me to support,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari added.
On the question of establishing a constitutional court, the PPP remained non-committal, saying further internal deliberation was required before arriving at any decision.
‘No roadblocks to amendment’
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday said there are no major roadblocks and impediments with respect to the 27th Amendment, according to a Dawn.com report.
Speaking to Geo News, the minister said consultations among political parties on the proposed amendment were taking place in a “positive environment” and that a broad consensus appeared to be emerging.
“The feeling I got during today’s (Thursday’s) meetings, in which different political parties were present … I got the feeling that there is no major roadblock or impediment,” he said.
“There was no need for any further discussions or debate. Ideas were shared in a positive environment, some of which were agreed upon.”
‘Govt lacks mandate’
Separately, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said the current parliament lacks the mandate and moral authority to amend the Constitution, arguing that such changes require a “genuine two-thirds majority”.
Speaking to the media at the Lahore High Court, he warned the proposed 27th Amendment would harm both the federation and the provinces, noting that the 18th Amendment had faced no provincial objections. He also pointed out that the fate of the 26th Amendment remains pending before the Supreme Court.
Mr Khan said an independent judiciary is essential to democracy and parliamentary sanctity and made clear the PTI would not support the government on the latest amendment.
Referring to the process adopted for the 26th Amendment, he said a committee had been formed, but “no draft ever surfaced”, adding that the PTI has resigned from that body.
He said the release of the party’s incarcerated founder Imran Khan would come “under the law, not through any deal”, and that no protest call had been given for November.
“We are working within the law for his release, and he is satisfied with the ongoing efforts,” Barrister Gohar said, dismissing rumours of foreign involvement.

From Karachi to Peshawar, thousands have been infected and dozens are believed to have died since October, even as official figures remain implausibly low. In Sindh alone, families claim more than two dozen deaths in Hyderabad, but the health department acknowledges only eight. Similar gaps between official and ground-level data have been reported in KP and Punjab, where hospitals continue to receive new patients despite the onset of cooler weather. The scale of underreporting is alarming. By the government’s own admission, figures exclude patients tested or treated at private laboratories and clinics — the primary source of care for many. This omission has rendered the provincial response reactive and confused. Testing kits have been scarce due to procurement disputes, fumigation began only after public outrage, and the Sindh High Court has censured senior health officials for incompetence.
Climate conditions have worsened the crisis. Prolonged humidity and unseasonably warm temperatures have extended the breeding season for mosquitoes, while erratic rainfall and poor drainage have turned urban centres into incubators for disease. Experts believe a more virulent dengue strain may also be circulating this year, with patients taking weeks to recover. Pakistan’s dengue crisis is not new. Each year we see the virus return with predictable ferocity. Yet the authorities repeat the same mistakes — data opacity, delayed coordination, and disregard for research. It is not enough to spray insecticide after public pressure or issue appeals for cleanliness. The state must create an integrated surveillance system that includes private laboratories, ensure steady supplies of testing kits, and support research into evolving viral strains. Without sustained planning and transparency, dengue may become a year-round public-health threat rather than a seasonal one.

According to the SBP, web portal InvestPak has been developed to digitise the process of investing in government papers for customers maintaining rupee accounts with banks, primary dealers (PDs) and microfinance banks (MFBs). 
Government securities are currently issued through auctions of Market Treasury Bills (MTBs) and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs). In addition, the government has recently begun raising funds through the stock market using Sukuk bonds. 
As of June 30, 2025, investment in government securities had reached Rs46.566 trillion. Scheduled banks held Rs38.7tr, or 83 per cent of the total, while corporates held Rs7.856tr, or 17pc. The inclusion of individual investors through InvestPak is expected to further increase investment in government papers and add to the government’s already substantial domestic borrowing. 

Individuals, corporates can now invest via InvestPak

The SBP said the portal enables customers of financial institutions (FIs) to digitally open Investor Portfolio of Sec­urities (IPS) accounts, place bids in primary auctions, and buy or sell securities in the secondary market — all without visiting a bank or financial institution. 
“All banks are mandated to facilitate their customers in registering on the portal. MFBs are also encouraged to help their customers register. All FIs must ensure high service standards and a smooth user experience,” the SBP said in a circular issued on Thursday. 
FIs have been granted access to the portal, which caters to both primary auctions and secondary market trading of government securities. They can also customise their treasury operations across front, middle, and back offices to align with the new system. 
All individuals, joint account holders, and corporates with rupee bank accounts are eligible to register digitally on the portal using their IBAN (International Bank Account Number). 
Customers who do not already hold an IPS account can request its opening through the portal when registering with their respective financial institution.
“The portal allows individuals and corporates to link and operate multiple rupee and IPS accounts across different FIs through a single registered account,” the SBP said. 
FIs are required to process each registration or onboarding request and communicate their decision to the customer within two working days.
