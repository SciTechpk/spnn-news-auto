Since late June, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country — especially KP and northern regions — by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
At least 325 people, including 142 children, have died and 743 others have been injured since June 26 in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan, according to updated daily data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
In Bajaur, there were “reports of several people injured in flash floods, which were caused by a cloudburst (heavy rainfall) in Salarzai tehsil’s Jabrarai village”, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi told Dawn.com.
“Rescue 1122 personnel, with the cooperation of residents, have so far recovered eight bodies and rescued four injured from the rubble and rainwater,” Faizi confirmed. The injured were taken to a hospital after receiving immediate medical aid in an ambulance.
The official detailed that disaster management, medical and diving teams were involved in the rescue efforts.
A search and rescue operation is underway under the supervision of Bajaur District Emergency Officer Amjad Khan, the spokesperson added.
Citing locals, Faizi said about 17 people remained missing, for whom rescue teams were continuing their search. DEO Amjad Khan and the station house in-charge were personally supervising the operation, the Rescue 1122 official added.

Separately, five people died and four were wounded when the roof of a house in the Suri Pao village of Lower Dir’s Maidan area collapsed due to heavy rain, Faizi said.
Detailing the hurdles, the rescue official said: “The rescue team reached the scene after walking for three hours despite heavy rain, flooded rails, difficult and bad roads.”
Yesterday, over a dozen people were killed as rains and flooding ripped through the country’s northern parts, including Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB).
 
 

In Muzaffarabad, a massive landslide in Sarli Sacha village hit a home, leaving six members of a family buried and feared dead. Torrential rains claimed the lives of two more women in AJK’s Bagh and Sudhnoti districts.
In GB, flash floods killed at least eight people, with two still missing in the Ghizer district, while also devastating villages in the Khalti, Ishkoman and Yasin areas.
Similarly, a spell of heavy downpour lashed various parts of Abbottabad district yesterday, triggering flash floods that severely disrupted traffic flow and caused damage to infrastructure.

Dozens more are missing, including Hindu pilgrims who were visiting a shrine, after torrents of water and mud driven by intense rain tore through the village in the Himalayan region.
Officials said a large makeshift kitchen in Chisoti village, where more than 100 pilgrims were completely washed away by what Chief Minister Omar Abdullah reported was a sudden “cloudburst” rain storm.
Heavy earthmovers were brought to the disaster area overnight to dig through deep mud, huge boulders and rubble that the flood brought down the mountainside.
The army’s White Knight Corps said its troops, “braving the harsh weather and rugged terrain, are engaged in evacuation of injured”.
Emergency kit, including ropes and digging tools, were being brought to the disaster site, with the army supporting other rescue teams.
One survivor told the Press Trust of India news agency that he had heard a “big blast” when the wall of water hit the settlement. “We thought it was an earthquake”, the shocked eyewitness said, who did not give his name.
Mohammad Irshad, a top disaster management official, told AFP today that “60 people are recorded dead”, with 80 people unaccounted for. “The search for the missing has intensified,” Irshad told AFP.
Around 50 severely injured people have been taken to hospitals.
Floods and landslides are common during the June-September monsoon season, but experts say climate change, coupled with poorly planned development, is increasing their frequency, severity and impact.
Floods on August 5 overwhelmed the Himalayan town of Dharali in India’s Uttarakhand state and buried it in mud. The likely death toll from that disaster is more than 70 but has yet to be confirmed.
 
 

The UN’s World Meteorological Organisation said last year that increasingly intense floods and droughts are a “distress signal” of what is to come as climate change makes the planet’s water cycle ever more unpredictable.
Roads had already been damaged by days of heavy storms. The area lies more than 200 kilometres by road from the region’s main city Srinagar.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the spate of disasters in his Independence Day speech in New Delhi today.
“In the past few days, we have been facing natural disasters, landslides, cloudbursts, and many other calamities”, Modi said in his public address.
“Our sympathies are with the affected people. State governments and the central government are working together with full strength.”</p><small>2025-08-15 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1511091472ea4d2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930904/over-53000-tourist-vehicles-enter-murree-against-capacity-of-5000' target='_blank'><strong>Over 53,000 tourist vehicles enter Murree against capacity of 5,000</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: More than 53,000 tourist vehicles arrived in Murree on Independence Day, despite the hill station having parking space for 5,000.
The tourist influx continued on Thursday.
A spokesman for the traffic police said that more than 53,000 tourist vehicles had entered Murree so far, compared to its capacity for only 5,000 vehicles.
The city traffic police have been taking all possible measures to facilitate tourists.

More than 200 traffic police personnel perform duty on Independence Day

He said that more than 200 traffic police personnel were on duty on Independence Day to assist visitors. Although 53,000 vehicles have entered Murree so far, many of them have left at the same time.
Therefore, between 6,000 and 9,000 vehicles were present in Murree at a given time, the traffic police spokesman told Dawn.
Driving licences are being checked at entry points and checkpoints to ensure tourist safety, while motorcyclists without helmets are not being allowed to enter Murree.
Entry to Mall Road without family is banned on Independence Day, the traffic police spokesman said.
CTO Waseem Akhtar and Traffic Officer Murree Sohail Shahzad have been personally supervising traffic arrangements in Murree, the spokesman added.
All roads in Murree are open for traffic, and movement is smooth. Awareness pamphlets are also being distributed among tourists for safe travel, the spokesman said.
However, there was unusual traffic pressure due to the rush of pedestrians at GPO Chowk, he said, adding that tourists should follow traffic rules to make their journey safe and enjoyable.
He advised tourists to park only in designated areas provided by the traffic police.
He urged tourists to avoid creating double lanes and to refrain from illegal parking, as officers are continuously patrolling to prevent violations and ensure smooth traffic flow.
Meanwhile, in view of the monsoon rains, the City Traffic Police Murree has issued a special traffic advisory for visitors.
Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Waseem Akhtar directed the traffic police that, since Murree is a mountainous area, they should check the driving licences and fitness certificates of public service vehicles entering the town, in accordance with the SOP.
He further advised tourists to choose suitable vehicles for travelling to Murree, keep wipers and lights in perfect working condition, avoid speeding on slippery roads and dangerous turns, and refrain from violating one-way traffic rules or overtaking wrongly.
All roads in Murree are two-way, so double lines should be avoided.
The CTO said vehicles should not be parked on the road to take pictures, as this affects the flow of traffic.
Tourists should follow the instructions of traffic wardens, who play an important role in ensuring safety and making journeys easier.

In videos that went viral on social media, Mr Tessori was heard as telling a big crowd that recently gathered at the Governor House to attend an Independence Day concert that “Mein bar bar keh raha hoon, tumharay bhai wapas aa rahay hain… tumharay bhai, Karachi ko theek karnay,” [I am repeatedly saying that Bhai is making a comeback, your Bhai, to get Karachi fixed]. And the crowd roared in the affirmative when he asked whether they wanted “old MQM”.
 
 

Earlier, Mr Tessori had talked about the “return of old MQM to revive past glory” during a media interaction after his visit to Bhit Shah. When asked what he was alluding to, he said he would not reveal everything, but hastened to add: “Apkay hosh urr jaey gey jo honay ja raha hay” [You would be shocked to see what is going to unfold].
The governor’s back-to-back statements not only came as a surprise to senior MQM-Pakistan leadership, which parted ways with Mr Hussain following his August 22, 2016 incendiary speech, but also to the powerful circles behind an undeclared ban on the MQM-London.
An MQM-P source told Dawn that some elements within the party conveyed their concerns to certain quarters about the “wrong message the governor’s remarks were sending across the party and the masses”.
As a result, in yet another media interaction, the governor clarified his remarks and said that he was bound to follow the policy of the MQM-P, which had openly dissociated itself from Mr Hussain.
“Altaf Hussain sahab has nothing to do with the politics of MQM Pakistan [and] its leadership is not going to accept him [in their fold] as they openly parted ways with him,” he said, adding that he could not understand why such an impression his remarks were creating.
“There is no policy [regarding Mr Hussain’s comeback] and I cannot talk against the policy of the MQM-P,” he said.

The defendants are accused of forcing both children and adults into grueling labour under threat and coercion, highlighting vulnerabilities in low-wage service industries across the United States.
“This case is about a family business built on human exploitation,” said US Attorney Susan Lehr for the District of Nebraska. “The defendants allegedly profited by compelling vulnerable victims, including children, to work for little or no pay under threat and coercion.”
The five accused — Kentakumar Chaudhari, Rashmi Ajit Samani, Amit Prahladbhai Chaudhari, Amit Babubhai Chaudhari, and Maheshkumar Chaudhari — allegedly ran hotels where undocumented individuals were forced to work in “unclean, unsafe conditions, sometimes in the very hotels where they were forced to work,” according to the DOJ.

27 victims, including 10 children, made to work long hours in unsafe, unclean hotels for little or no pay

Victims were reportedly required to work “long hours, seven days a week, in exchange for little or no pay” and were “threatened with arrest, deportation, and harm to their families if they refused to work.”
Federal raids
On Aug 12, federal, state, and local officers executed search warrants at the Nebraska hotels, including AmericInn, Omaha, The Inn (formerly Super 8), Omaha, The New Victorian Inn and Omaha, Roadway Inn, Bellevue.
 
 

The DOJ said these properties were “used as part of a conspiracy to commit forced labour” and that the defendants “conspired to harbor undocumented non-citizens for the purposes of commercial advantage and private financial gain.”
A total of 27 victims were rescued: “Ten minor children under the age of 12 from the forced labour scheme, and 17 adult victims from the same criminal conspiracy.”
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division emphasised: “No child should ever be forced into labour. We will use every tool available to bring to justice those who exploit the most vulnerable members of our society.”
The Nebraska arrests come amid a wider push by US authorities to dismantle trafficking networks.
India on Tier 2
The US 2024 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report placed India on Tier 2, noting that the government “does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking” but is “making significant efforts to do so.” The report highlighted persistent concerns about “forced labour, sex trafficking in religious and tourist destinations, and the exploitation of children, including in the context of child sex tourism.”
Experts in Washington stress that the Nebraska case underscores the global nature of trafficking. Indian authorities have increasingly coordinated with US counterparts to investigate potential exploitation networks affecting Indian nationals abroad, especially in low-wage labour sectors.
The five Nebraska defendants now face federal charges that could carry decades in prison if convicted, and the investigation remains ongoing.

He said the decision would depend on the outcome of President Donald Trump’s meeting with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.
“We’ve put secondary tariffs on Indians for buying Russian oil. And I could see, If things don’t go well, then sanctions or secondary tariffs could go up,” Bessent said in an interview to Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.
 
 

Earlier this month, Trump imposed a 25 per cent penalty on India in addition to 25pc tariffs for buying oil and weapons from Russia. The US has been trying to mediate a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, and on Wednesday, Trump warned of “severe consequences” if Moscow did not agree to a peace deal.

Russian oil made up 35-40pc of India’s oil imports in 2024, up from 3pc in 2021

Trump and Putin are set to meet in Anchorage on Friday to discuss how to end the war in Ukraine.
“President Trump is meeting with President Putin, and the Europeans are in the wings carping about how he should do it, what he should do. The Europeans need to join us in these sanctions. The Europeans need to be willing to put on these secondary sanctions,” Bessent said.
Delhi’s increased imports of cheap Russian crude since the Ukraine war have strained India-US relations and disrupted ongoing trade talks with Washington. Russian oil made up 35pc to 40pc of India’s oil imports in 2024 — up from 3pc in 2021.
Delhi has defended its purchases of Russian oil, arguing that as a major energy importer, it must buy the cheapest available crude to protect millions of poor Indians from rising costs.
Bessent’s comments come after he called India a “bit recalcitrant” on trade negotiations in an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday. Trump says his tariffs are part of his administration’s plan to boost the US’ economy and make global trade fairer.
He has repeatedly called India a tariff abuser and is keen to trim a $45bn (£33bn) trade deficit with Asia’s third largest economy. Trade negotiations between Delhi and Washington have been under way for several months, and are set to renew with US negotiators expected to arrive in India on August 25.
 
 

But experts say India’s refusal to reduce duties on agriculture and dairy products has been a major thorn in the negotiations.
Trump’s new 50pc tariff rate on India is set to come into effect on August 27, which some experts have said is akin to an embargo on trade between the two countries. It makes India the most heavily taxed US trading partner in Asia and is expected to severely hamper its exports focused industries like textiles and jewellery, and could drag India’s growth down by as much as half a percent.
Published in Dawn, August 15th, 2025</p><small>2025-08-15 06:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/689e6ea80a71d.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930957/digital-tracking-to-end-fuel-black-market' target='_blank'><strong>Digital tracking to end fuel black market</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a landmark reform, the government will launch real-time digital tracking of every litre of petroleum products — from import and production to storage, transport, and final sale — within a month, in a bid to curb rampant smuggling, theft, misappropriation, and adulteration, which are estimated to cause annual revenue losses of Rs300-500 billion.
A senior government official told Dawn that the National Assembly passed the Petroleum (Amendment) Act 2025 on Wednesday, empowering authorities to deploy information technology-based systems for continuous monitoring of petroleum products. The law aims to coordinate the efforts of various enforcement agencies to regulate storage, transportation, and sale, both jointly and independently.
 
 

The new legislation amends the nearly century-old Petroleum Act 1934, introducing provisions for digital tracking and granting enforcement powers to deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners, and designated officers under the Customs Act 1969, allowing them to seize smuggled or illegally stored fuel and related infrastructure before and after conviction.
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), along with market stakeholders, has been working for months on the technical side of the rollout to ensure smooth implementation. The system will cover monitoring at petrol stations, en route transportation, and designated storage facilities.

New law introduces real-time tracking of petroleum products from import to retail, aims to curb Rs300-500bn in annual losses

Local refineries and oil marketing companies have long pushed for stricter controls on smuggling — particularly at borders and key domestic points — citing severe damage to their businesses and the resultant loss of government revenue. The illicit trade of petroleum products, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), remains a persistent issue.
 
 

A 2020 inquiry, commissioned by then-Prime Minister Imran Khan, revealed oil smuggling worth over Rs250bn annually from Iran and exposed the absence of oversight in the sector. A more comprehensive intelligence report submitted in April 2024 noted that around 10 million litres of Iranian petrol and diesel were being smuggled into Pakistan daily, resulting in a revenue loss of over Rs227bn.
The report also identified the involvement of 533 illegal petrol stations, 105 known oil smugglers, and complicit personnel in more than a dozen law enforcement agencies. It detailed informal border crossings and established smuggling routes across the country.
The amended law introduces severe penalties for violators. Individuals involved in the illegal import, transport, storage, sale, refining, or blending of petroleum products will face fines of Rs1m, with repeat offenders subject to Rs5m penalties. Facilities operating without valid licences will face closure and the confiscation of all machinery, storage tanks, and petroleum products. Owners of such facilities will be fined Rs10m.
For facilities with expired or cancelled storage licences (issued under Form K by the Department of Explosives), a six-month grace period has been granted for renewal or restoration. Failure to comply will result in the sealing of the facility, confiscation of assets, and a fine of Rs1m. The Department of Explosives is required to renew licences within 30 days of receiving complete documentation and payment.
In cases where premises are found storing or selling smuggled fuel, the law mandates immediate closure, confiscation of assets, and a fine of Rs100m. Furthermore, the Depart­ment of Explosives must cancel the operating licence of such a facility.
Vehicles involved in smuggling activities will also be confiscated under the provisions of the Customs Act 1969. Any seized goods will be handed over to customs officers for further action under applicable laws. Importantly, confiscation proceedings can begin before any conviction.
Additionally, the law vests the trial of accused individuals with the Sessions Court, while administrative powers will be exercised by deputy or assistant commissioners. Aggrieved parties will retain the right to appeal to the High Court within 30 days of receiving a decision.
The reform is seen as a long-overdue step to bring order to Pakistan’s petroleum supply chain, reduce environmental and engine damage from adulterated fuel, and plug significant leakages in public revenue.

• Registration begins for displaced families; each household offered Rs75,000
BAJAUR: As security forces claimed to have eliminated nine terrorists in an ongoing ‘targeted operation’, the district administration on Thursday ordered residents of 26 areas in the restive Lowi and War Mamund tehsils to evacuate their homes by Aug 16 for the ‘planned targeted operation’ against militants in Bajaur.
Sources claimed nine militants had been killed during the ongoing operation in Bajaur’s mountainous areas. They claimed that the operation, based on credible intelligence, involves both ground and aerial assets to neutralise the terrorist presence and was conducted in the Damadola area.
Official sources said militants tried to hide bodies in caves and hideouts, but security forces have systematically cleared these areas. However, the military’s media wing, ISPR, has not issued any statement in this regard so far.
 
 

Residents of 26 areas in both Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils, including Malangi, Sapary, Dawowgi, Mena Sulman Khail Khoorchai, Zagai, Gat, Agra, Gondai, Zari, Nakhtat, Mula Kalley, Bakaroo, Gohati, Chimialoo, Lar Kalan, Bar Kalan, Choohtra, Damadola, Inam Khoro Chinagi and Agra, have been told to evacuate their homes by 10am on Aug 16 for a short period to ensure their safety during the targeted operation against terrorists, according to a notification posted on the deputy commissioner Bajaur’s official Facebook page.
The notification, seen by Dawn, asked the residents of the specified areas to move to several relief camps in Khar using official transport arranged by the district administration. The notification added that the decision was intended to clear their areas of militants permanently.
Protest
Meanwhile, scores of people attended a demonstration on Thursday, calling for the protection of civilians in the ongoing operation in Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils here.
People from all walks of life, including political and social activists, participated in the gathering held at Umary Chowk on the Inayat Kallay-Laghari road.
A number of senior political figures and members of the Bajaur Aman Jirga also took part in the demonstration, held two days after the death of a woman and her two children following a mortar shell allegedly hitting the house of a resident in the Erab area of Lowi Mamund tehsil on Tuesday. The attack also wounded two children from the affected family.
The participants, some of whom were carrying black flags, also chanted slogans for peace and against the offensive. Bajaur Aman Jirga chief Sahib Zada Haroon Rashid, PTI local MPA Dr Hamidur Rehman, former MNA Gul Zafar Khan, ANP district president Gul Afzal Khan, PTI senior activist Najibullah Khan Mamund, Malik Khalid Khan and Irfan Janbaz addressed the gathering.
They expressed their deep anger over Tuesday’s incident in the Erab area of Lowi Mamund, which left a woman and her two children dead and wounded two children.
They called on the authorities to investigate the incident and to take special care of the civilian population during the offensive to prevent such incidents in future.
The gathering, which continued for a couple of hours, ended after Dr Hamidur Rehaman informed the participants that the authorities had assured them of investigating the Tuesday incident.
He claimed that the authorities had also agreed with them to ask the residents to evacuate their homes days before the operation. In addition, he mentioned that the authorities also agreed to provide compensation for property damage to residents during the operation.
Registration to begin today
Authorities are set to initiate a registration process for displaced persons affected by the ongoing operation in Bajaur district, starting today (Friday), to provide them with financial support.
Talking to the media on Thursday, Additional Deputy Commissioner (Planning and Finance) Saeedullah Jan said all arrangements had been finalised to start the process from Friday.
 
 

He mentioned that a registration centre has been established at the Utman Khail complex in Qazafi, equipped with 10 counters and five mobile verification units. He said it is a joint initiative of Nadra and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to offer a financial package of Rs75,000 to each displaced family from the provincial government.
Mr Jan said that under the package, each family would receive Rs50,000 for their arrival and Rs25,000 for transportation to facilitate their return. He said that displaced people from about 27 areas of Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils would be paid digitally, regardless of whether they were staying in relief camps or with relatives.
According to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, the provincial cabinet had approved Rs5 billion in relief funds for people displaced by the military operation in Bajaur’s Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils.
Also on Thursday, the district administration provided non-food items to displaced people staying at relief camps in Bajaur, including the Bajaur Sports Complex in Khar.

Addressing a public meeting at Paharpur Sports Stadium after leading a large rally from Al-Amin House, CM Gandapur said the Constitution and law gave them the right to reclaim their mandate and that they were ready to “take bullets on the chest” in their struggle.
The rally, organised as part of PTI’s protest movement on August 14, consisted of hundreds of vehicles and was welcomed at various points  along the route to Paharpur.
In his fiery speech, the chief minister accused the state of  “oppression” since May 9, 2023, adding that PTI supporters had endured arrests and violence but kept the party’s flag flying. “We will not commit suicide, we will fight. Those who shoot at us will face the same,” he  declared.
 






He criticised the state for waging “war against its own people” and said that peace was essential for development. “If people have taken up arms, the state also bears responsibility,” he said, adding that while terrorism must end, the government should not oppress its citizens.
Highlighting cultural ties with Afghanistan, he called for better bilateral relations. He also announced that Paharpur would be granted district status.

The result is intellectual stultification, and, what Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz called a ‘logocracy’, or a society where the narrative is manipulated to fit the regime’s propaganda. Troublesome people, inconvenient facts and awkward aspects of journalistic probe must be removed from public life. In such dispensations, the deep state calls the shots.
After years of watching Pakistan “suffocate under the weight of its democratic collapse”, I have come to understand what former US ambassador to Hungary David Pressman felt. He said that “the real danger of a strongman isn’t his tactics; it’s how others, especially those with power, justify their acquiescence”.
 
 

A pliant silence prevails in the corridors of power. Some even rue the fact that our democracy is too fragile to withstand a strongman. Institutions like parliament, the judiciary, bureaucracy and police have capitulated, tacitly admitting that they cannot maintain their independence or stay above the fray. Even a large section of the media, which is supposed to hold the government to account, has fallen silent.
Many politicians, including former self-identified defenders of civilian supremacy, are skirting their moral responsibility to take a stand in support of democratic principles. Some have even aligned themselves with and praised the hybrid governance paradigm. Unfortunately, it is a “self-aggrandising myth and a potent tool of self-deception”.
Metaphorically, they could not outfox the fox and have ended up welcoming it to their henhouse. They think it is a savvy strategy of appeasement. They are mistaken. History has the unsavoury habit of repeating itself. Subjugation can eventually result in humiliation.
The black-coat revolution stood defeated the day the bold stance of a few judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the machinations of the powers that be was not supported by their seniors in the apex court, and lawyers, by and large, chose the path of least resistance. That choice, unfortunately, strengthened the autocratic state machinery that uses fear to suppress dissent. This is the climate of menace that prevails.
Now that we have celebrated the 78th anniversary of our independence, it is high time we reflected upon the follies of our successive military and civilian rulers and decided to “choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong”. The harder right is never easy. Balochistan is a case in point.
 
 

Last year, after my annual visit to Quetta, I had written an article for this paper on Aug 24, asserting that the state was fast losing its writ over vast swathes of its ungoverned areas and that Dr Mahrang Baloch had captured the imagination of the Baloch youth who felt alienated and ignored by both the federal and provincial governments.
It was time to genuinely redress their grievances related to the issue of missing persons, and grant them their political, social and economic rights, creating, above all, a sense of ownership in the future of Pakistan as a federation. That write-up proved to be a cry in the wilderness. No one in the corridors of power took notice.

It is high time we made a decision to ‘choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong’.

Last month, I visited Quetta again and came back deeply disappointed and disillusioned as the situation in the province is utterly bleak and despondent. The security agencies have detained Baloch women activists, including Mahrang and a few of her companions.
While I was there, she was produced in the anti-terrorism court, Quetta, for extension of her physical custody. She addressed the judge calmly, and, with a smirk, asked him to announce the decision as dictated to him by the powers that be. She accepted her further custodial remand, and calmly walked away. Her sister, along with some other young activists of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), are yet again in Islamabad, seeking justice and suitable legal remedies to the issue of missing persons.
 
 

The state has resorted to the ultimate insult to the Baloch code of honour, by showing disrespect and detaining their daughters. This kind of indignity evokes deep anger and disaffection against the state. It could have been avoided. What is the result? Public transport is not allowed to ply at night on the vast road network of the province as the threat of militant attacks is so great. Even daytime travel for pilgrims going to Iran and Iraq has been discontinued by road.
My sentiments stand endorsed by a recent HRCP fact-finding report on Balochistan’s crisis of trust. In the light of its findings, 13 key recommendations have been made to the state “to address the human rights, governance and political challenges currently facing Balochistan”.
While all the recommendations are important, the following need urgent attention. One, “demilitarise the province and create conditions conducive to meaningful dialogue with all genuine political stakeholders to rebuild public trust…”. Reconciliation was a key point of the counterterrorism National Action Plan, originally launched in 2015 and reinforced in 2021.
While relentless kinetic measures may be taken against proscribed militant organisations like the BLA, including the Majeed Brigade, and BRA and BLF, the government must undertake constructive engagement with the BYC that represents the angry Baloch youth. They should not be deprived of their political, social, economic and legal rights.
 
 

Two, “immediately cease the practice of enforced disappearances”. The issue of the missing persons must be resolved in the light of recommendations made by the IHC-designated commission headed by Akhtar Mengal. A constitutional and legal framework under ATA 1997 is a viable way to heal this festering wound in the province’s body politic.
Three, “ensure transparency, fairness and accountability in all electoral processes”. Only a legitimate and truly representative government can earn the trust of the public and deal effectively with militancy.
Four, end “reliance on paramilitary forces for civilian law enforcement”. Highly professional, accountable and rights-compliant policing is critical to gaining public trust. Above all, give respect to the Baloch: they may break but will not bend.

This is a large number but not surprising: it is some of the chickens coming home to roost.
Here are some changes that Pakistan has seen in the higher education sector lately. The number of universities has risen significantly. We have 270-odd universities now, with 160 or so in the public sector. There are several foreign and online programmes that have also entered the sector. And the expansion drive continues. Existing universities have been expanding enrolments and programmes as well.
Higher education funding has either remained static or decreased, even in nominal terms. It has definitely gone down in real terms. Inflation has hit every person in recent years, but fee increases have also been going up in the higher education sector.
The regulator’s focus has been on expansion, encouraging universities to introduce more Master’s and doctoral programmes and faculty to produce more (not necessarily of higher quality) publications.

Higher education funding has either remained static or decreased.

Some of the consequences, intended and unintended, should have been expected. Generally, the quality of education delivered by most undergraduate programmes across Pakistan has never been very good. Expansion, with little planning for faculty availability, has exacerbated the problem.
 
 

The regulators’ focus on the Master’s and doctoral levels has hurt the quality of undergraduate programmes even more. Undergraduate programmes are seen by many universities and colleges as just a way of earning revenue. The pressure to expand programmes has meant that every university, whether or not it is ready for it, has launched every faculty and programme it could think of. Fewer resources and rising costs have worsened matters.
The pressure to publish and increase the number of publications has also shifted the focus from teaching in general and undergraduate teaching in particular. It has also led to increased gaming, fraud and plagiarism. More significantly for us, it has led to the neglect of undergraduate teaching, with most faculty wanting to teach graduate programmes, supervise theses and publish with their students to make research numbers impressive.
It should not come as a surprise then that parents do not want their children to enrol in programmes where perceived and real rates of return to undergraduate studies are low. The students themselves don’t want to enrol. If you were a student, would you do something different? If you were a parent, would you not suggest something different?
 
 

Do bear in mind that there is plenty of evidence that universities, private and public, that offer good quality undergraduate education, have not seen any decline in the number of admissions or applications. Similarly, majors that are perceived to be in high demand in the job market have not seen any decline either.
There are issues that should be kept in mind though. There is a massive increase in demand for computer science, IT, data analytics and similar programmes. People feel, and rightly so, that job prospects in these areas are very bright. The buzz around AI makes this perception even stronger. So, it is not surprising that parents are asking students to enter these fields and many students are also shifting their sights to them. Most universities with relevant departments are expanding enrolments. Others are scrambling to start relevant departments and programmes. But there is a limit to how much expansion can take place in these programmes. And there should be too.
Globally, there is a fair bit of conversation going around the four-year undergraduate programmes. Is four years too long? Some argue that if people can do a few six-month or so courses, especially in computer- and IT-related fields, and enter the job market and get decent returns, why should they spend a lot of money on four-year degrees.
Others say that with online education becoming more accessible, undergraduate can move online. Others talk of micro-credentialing and argue that selected courses, rather than a four-year degree, which makes the student go through a broader curriculum and more diverse courses, is the need of the day.
 
 

There is some merit to many of these arguments, though the four-year undergraduate programme has a lot going for it too. Different routes will be better for different people. Education has time and money costs, and quality education tends to be quite expensive.
University education is not recognised as a right anywhere, though states might have functional reasons — human resource development, social and economic mobility, growth — to subsidise undergraduate and graduate education for a part of the population. Students will have to make careful choices about what suits them, what is possible for them and their families, and what is the best way forward.
The state has to carefully assess what it has been doing as well. Do we need to expand at this pace and make every university launch every department, or should we look for a more tiered approach amongst universities and greater specialisation? Should we incentivise some schools to improve undergraduate education (very needed)? And how do we improve the financing of higher education?
When we moved from the University Grants Commission to the Higher Education Commission in the early 2000s, we went through a fairly thorough review of what needed to be done. Much has happened since then, including the passage of the 18th Constitutional Amendment.
 
 

We need a thorough review of the higher education sector and a resetting of priorities. Otherwise, this sector will continue to flounder and disappoint all stakeholders — students, parents, citizens and the state.
The government is in the process of hiring a new chair for the HEC, maybe it would serve everyone better if either a thorough review is done before the new chair comes in or her first task, post-appointment, is a thorough review of the higher education sector and what we need to do to make it function better and serve the needs of all stakeholders.

•  Flea markets have become vital for low-income groups as new branded goods become unaffordable
KARACHI: Pakistan’s imports of second-hand clothing have surged to an all-time high of 1.137 million tonnes worth $511 million in the previous fiscal year, surpassing the previous record of 990,266 tonnes ($434 million) in FY24.
This sharp rise reflects both the growing demand for affordable clothing and the country’s deepening poverty crisis.
A significant number of people, unable to afford locally made branded goods, have turned to second-hand clothing markets known as landa bazaars or flea markets.
These markets, such as those in Shershah and Banaras, have become a lifeline for lower-income groups, where used clothing, shoes, and other items are sold at a fraction of the price of new, branded goods.
According to the World Bank’s latest report, nearly 45 per cent of Pakistan’s population now lives below the poverty line, with the new threshold set at $4.20 per person per day, up from $3.65.
This increase has pushed the poverty ratio for lower-middle-income groups to 44.7pc, up from 39.8pc under the previous threshold.
Muhammad Usman Farooqui, General Secretary of the Pakistan Second Hand Clothing Merchants Associa­tion (PSHCMA), attributed the rise in second-hand clothing imports to escalating poverty.
Mr Farooqui noted that many families, especially from lower and middle-income brackets, are increasingly dependent on affordable used goods.
Farooqui has called on the government to reduce various taxes and duties on these imports.
These include a 10pc regulatory duty, 5pc customs duty, 6pc advance income tax, and approximately 5pc sales tax, which, he said, make second-hand clothing unaffordable for those who need it most.
Traders involved in the purchase and sale of used clothing also face additional taxes, including a 5pc sales tax on the difference between their sale and purchase prices. Domestic traders are also liable to pay income tax if their annual income from the business exceeds Rs 600,000.
In the Finance Bill 2024, second-hand clothing importers were designated withholding agents, requiring them to collect advance tax at 0.1pc from distributors, dealers, and wholesalers.
However, if the parties involved are not registered with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the withholding tax increases to 2pc or even 2.5pc for non-compliant retailers.
According to Farooqui, many individuals working in the used clothing trade are not registered with the FBR, and often do not have fixed business locations or proper records, making it difficult for them to comply with these tax regulations.
Despite the government’s efforts to stabilise the economy, Farooqui argued that the benefits of this recovery must be transferred to the masses.
He called for the removal of the regulatory duty and tax exemptions for used clothing imports to ease the financial burden on people with low incomes.
Used clothing is primarily imported from European countries, the USA, Japan, Korea, China, and Canada. Within Pakistan, exporters in special zones hold a dominant share of 60-70pc of the imports. These units sort through unsorted clothing to extract higher-quality items, which are then re-exported, with only 10-20pc sold locally.
Import duties on used clothing stand at Rs 36 per kg, while shoes are taxed at Rs 66 per kg at the import stage. Farooqui stressed that reducing these taxes could provide much-needed relief for Pakistan’s disadvantaged segments.
Market surveys reveal the high prices of second-hand clothing.
Imported used jeans cost between Rs300-400, while a second-hand shirt is priced around Rs250-300. In contrast, new sports shoes made in Lahore are priced between Rs2,500-3,500, while branded shoes made in Vietnam or China can go for Rs4,000-5,500. However, used sports shoes are available for Rs600-800, making them more accessible for many consumers.
With the rising demand for affordable second-hand goods, landa bazaars have become essential in offering an alternative to increasingly unaffordable new items. While Pakistan’s economy continues to struggle, these flea markets are proving to be crucial for the lower-income population, struggling to make ends meet amidst a growing poverty crisis.

• Kremlin says Russian, US presidents to hold ‘one-on-one’ talks in Alaska
ANCHORAGE: US President Donald Trump on Thursday acknowledged his high-stakes summit with Vladimir Putin may fail, and said any Ukraine deal would come through a future three-way meeting with Kyiv to “divvy things up”.
Russian President Vladimir Putin flies to Alaska on Friday at the invitation of Trump in his first visit to a Western country since he ordered the 2022 invasion of Ukraine that has killed tens of thousands of people.
The Kremlin said that the two presidents planned to meet one-on-one, heightening fears by European leaders that Putin will cajole Trump into a settlement imposed on Ukraine.
Trump, on the eve of the summit, insisted that he would not finalise any deal with Putin and that he would include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in any decisions.
“This meeting sets up the second meeting, but there is a 25 per cent chance that this meeting will not be a successful meeting,” Trump told Fox News Radio.
 


“The second meeting is going to be very, very important, because that’s going to be a meeting where they make a deal. And I don’t want to use the word ‘divvy’ things up. But you know, to a certain extent, it’s not a bad term,” Trump said.
Zelensky has refused any territorial concessions to Russia, which has ramped up attacks and made sharp gains on the battlefield just ahead of the summit.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said any future deal needed to ensure Ukraine’s security. “To achieve peace, I think we all recognise that there’ll have to be some conversation about security guarantees,” Rubio told reporters in Washington, adding that he was “hopeful” about the summit.
Trump has previously ruled out letting Ukraine join Nato and backed Russia’s stance that Kyiv’s aspirations to enter the transatlantic alliance triggered the war.
Ukraine and most of its European allies reject Putin’s narrative and point to his remarks denying the historical legitimacy of Ukraine.
Putin welcomes US efforts
Meanwhile, Putin on Thursday welcomed US efforts to end the conflict and said that talks could also help yield an agreement on nuclear arms control.
“The US administration… is making quite energetic and sincere efforts to end the fighting,” Putin told a meeting of top officials in Moscow.
The talks are set to begin at 11:30am (1930 GMT) on Friday at the Elmendorf Air Force Base, a major US military installation in Alaska that has been crucial in monitoring Russia.
 
 

“This conversation will take place in a one-on-one format, naturally with the participation of interpreters,” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters in Moscow.
He said that delegations would continue discussions over a working lunch and that Putin and Trump would hold a joint news conference.
The White House has not confirmed any plans for a joint press appearance.
Trump faced heated criticism over his joint news conference after his 2018 summit with Putin in Helsinki where he sided with Russia over US intelligence in accepting Putin’s denials of interfering in the 2016 US election to help Trump.
European support for Zelensky
Zelensky, who will not join Friday’s summit in Alaska, on Thursday met British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, after talks a day earlier in Berlin.
Starmer greeted the Ukrainian leader with a warm hug and handshake on the steps of his Downing Street residence and later voiced solidarity.
 


European leaders expressed relief after a call with Trump on Wednesday, saying he appeared focused on a ceasefire rather than concessions by Ukraine.
A day before the summit, Ukraine fired dozens of drones at Russia, wounding several people and sparking fires at an oil refinery in the southern city of Volgograd.

• US urged to pressure Tel Aviv to stop settlement building; EU opposed to territorial change
• 17 more killed as Gaza bombardment intensifies
MAALE: Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced work would start on a long-delayed settlement that would divide the West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem, a move his office said would “bury” the idea of a Palestinian state.
The Palestinian government, allies and campaign groups condemned the scheme, calling it illegal and saying the fragmentation of territory would rip up peace plans for the region.
Standing at the site of the planned settlement in Maale Adumim on Thursday, Smotrich, a settler himself, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump had agreed to the revival of the E1 development, though there was no immediate confirmation from either.
“Whoever in the world is trying to recognise a Palestinian state today will receive our answer on the ground. Not with documents nor with decisions or statements, but with facts. Facts of houses, facts of neighbourhoods,” Smotrich said.
Israel froze construction plans at Maale Adumim in 2012, and again after a revival in 2020, because of objections from the US, European allies and other powers who considered the project a threat to any future peace deal with the Palestinians.
 


Restarting the project could further isolate Israel, which has watched some of its Western allies condemn its military offensive in Gaza and announce they may recognise a Palestinian state.
Palestinians fear the settlement building in the West Bank — which has sharply intensified since the 2023 Gaza war — will rob them of any chance to build a state of their own in the area.
In a statement headlined “Burying the idea of a Palestinian state,” Smotrich’s spokesperson said the minister had approved the plan to build 3,401 houses for Israeli settlers between an existing settlement in the West Bank and Jerusalem.
In Maale Adumim, Smotrich told Reuters that the plan would go into effect on Wednesday.
Breaking the Silence, an Israeli rights group established by former Israeli soldiers, said what it called a land grab “will not only further fragment the Palestinian territory, but will further entrench apartheid”.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, the Palestinian president’s spokesperson, called on the United States to pressure Israel to stop settlement building.
“The EU rejects any territorial change that is not part of a political agreement between involved parties. So annexation of territory is illegal under international law,” European Commission spokesperson Anitta Hipper said.
Bombardment of Gaza
Meanwhile, Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least 17 people were killed on Thursday in Israeli strikes as the military intensified its bombardment of Gaza City.
The dead included six civilians who had been waiting for humanitarian aid, said civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal. “The Israeli occupation forces are intensifying their raids in the Zeitun area” of Gaza City, he said.
“For the fourth consecutive day, the area has been subject to a military operation, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries,” said Bassal.
 


“Since dawn today, we have received 28 calls from families and residents of this neighbourhood, some of whose children have been killed. Many people cannot leave these areas due to artillery fire,” the spokesperson added.
Maram Kashko, a resident of Zeitun, said the strikes had increased over the past four days. “My nephew, his wife and their children were killed in a bombardment,” he said.
An AFP videographer said their bodies were taken to Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City and buried shortly afterwards at the Sayyid Hashim cemetery.
On Wednesday, the head of the Israeli military said he had approved a new plan for operations in the Gaza Strip aimed at freeing all hostages and defeating Hamas.

This was announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during a ceremony on the eve of Independence Day in Islamabad. “On this occasion, I announce the establishment of the Army Rocket Force Command,” he remarked during his speech.
The new command will be responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines.
The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger. PM Shehbaz described the force as “equipped with modern technology and having the capability to strike at the enemy from different directions… another milestone in strengthening our conventional warfare capacity.”
The timing of the announcement is significant. It came almost three months after a four-day war with India — the most intense in decades. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but the shortcoming of not having much to fire back with at longer range was noted.
A senior security official, cited by Reuters, said that the “force would have its own command in the military, which would be dedicated to handling and deployment of missiles in the event of a conventional war”. “It is obvious that it is meant for India,” the official said.
 
 

The establishment of the new command seems to be the outcome of lessons learned from that conflict: to deter India in the conventional space, something more than fighters and artillery was needed.
“Crucially, it is a lesson of the May war. Pakistan didn’t have much in the way of longer-range conventional rockets, which could be employed for deep targeting,” said Muhammad Faisal, a scholar at the University of Technology Sydney, who specialises in South Asia security.
This is not an entirely new concept. China has its own dedicated missile arm, the PLA Rocket Force. Iran, in recent conflicts with Israel, has used mass missile launches to swamp enemy defences. Pakistan is now joining this small club. The record of missile use is mixed. Iran’s 12-day clash with Israel in June saw plenty of missile launches and indeed caused substantive damage but failed to bring any real change in the strategic picture.
In Ukraine, Russia’s vast missile arsenal has battered cities without delivering victory. Recent conflicts have shown that drones have mattered more.
This raises the obvious question: will Pakistan’s rocket force be a real game-changer, or just an expensive new project?
Long-range precision missiles aren’t cheap to build, buy, or maintain. Similarly, its place in Pakistan’s broader military doctrine also remains unclear.
“It is a significant development and could lead to changes in our military doctrine and force posture. Since not much is available in the public domain about the role of this new entity and the employment concept, it may be premature to speculate about its effectiveness against the Indian threat,” said Dr Adil Sultan, dean of the Faculty of Aerospace and Strategic Studies (FASS) at Air University.

In approving them, the ruling coalition has completely ignored the opposition’s vocal protestations and human rights observers’ growing alarm. Civil and military forces may now detain “terror suspects” for a period of three months or more based merely on “reasonable or credible information” or “reasonable suspicion”.
If the reader finds themselves wondering what, precisely, constitutes “reasonable information” and “reasonable suspicion”, they are not alone. The language of the amendment seems to have been left vague on purpose, creating conditions in which abuse is not only possible but, given past precedent, likely inevitable.
There are plenty of reasons to fear that it will be weaponised against dissidents. For starters, this regime has consistently shown scant regard for inconveniences like constitutional safeguards for citizens against arbitrary arrest or detention, or their right to a fair trial.
 
 

The judgements recently rendered by Anti-Terrorism Courts against political workers and publicly elected leaders are still fresh in the public memory. When government representatives were arguing in parliament that the opposition’s objections to the ATA amendments were ‘unreasonable’ because they were very similar to antiterrorism laws enacted elsewhere in the world, they should have been asked: where else are political workers tried and convicted as terrorists for the crime of rioting, vandalising public property and engaging in hooliganism?
That too, based on questionable evidence and suspicious testimonies given by police personnel who claimed to have infiltrated a closed-door political meeting without being detected by a single soul. And this is just a high-profile example. In restive parts of the country, locals are regularly branded as ‘terrorists’ by the authorities and pursued relentlessly, often merely for opposing state policies.
 
 

If the country’s policing and criminal justice system has been hollowed out to the point that apprehending criminals now requires holding constitutional rights in abeyance, the ruling parties should reconsider their priorities and focus on fixing what is broken.
By exposing citizens to state excesses with vaguely worded laws, enacted seemingly in obedience to unelected quarters, they are inflicting a grave injury on parliament. As public representatives, their priority should be the public’s welfare and creating resilient systems of governance.
Instead, by ceding unprecedented power and authority to those who have, time and again, appeared willing to abuse it, they are setting the country up for greater turmoil. Even without this amendment, the authorities had been detaining citizens without sufficient reason in peripheral areas.
Every day, the headlines bear testimony that such policies do not work. It is time to rethink, not reinforce them. A state that erodes its own constitutional foundations in the name of security will soon find itself neither secure nor free.

PESHAWAR: Six police personnel were martyred and eight others injured as militants targeted police at five different locations, including the outskirts of the provincial capital.
The deadliest assault occurred in Upper Dir, which claimed the lives of three police personnel, while other attacks occurred in Lower Dir and Shangla districts.
Late on Wednesday night, a police official deputed at Hassan Khel Police Station informed senior officers of an ongoing attack.
Superintendent of Police for Sadar Division Raza Muhammad said the police station is surrounded by dense natural forest, adding that the exchange of fire continued for almost three hours, and the police responded bravely.
Hassan Khel Police Station, located around 40 kilometres south of Pesh­awar, is situated on the border between districts Peshawar and Kohat.
This area has been a hotspot for intelligence-based operations aimed at dismantling militant groups. Recent attacks in the area have claimed the lives of several law enforcement officers.
While the attack on Hassan Khel was underway, police at the Adezai Post, located five kilometres north, successfully repelled a similar attack. “The exchange of fire lasted 10 minutes, but the militants had to retreat due to the intense response from the Adezai police,” said SP Raza.
Further attacks were thwarted the same night.
Militants opened fire on a police post at Sakhi Pull in the Nasir Bagh area, but the attack was successfully repelled.
In Kurram, Qaisar Hussain, the Station House Officer of Roza Police Station, was martyred in an exchange of gunfire during an intelligence-based operation targeting Abid Hussain alias Tehran Turi, a notorious militant leader.
Turi, a trained fighter who allegedly fled to Syria after the 2007 sectarian clashes in Kurram, played a leading role in the Bagan incident in November last year.
Dir attacks
Separately, four policemen were martyred and seven others injured when militants carried out coordinated attacks on a Quick Response Force (QRF) van in Upper Dir and multiple police posts in Lower Dir late on Wednesday night, officials and police sources said.
They said that the gunmen, in a midnight attack, ambushed a QRF van in Upper Dir’s Panakot area, which left three police officials, including Akbar Hussain, Nasr Minullah and driver Ismail martyred on the spot.
Six others, including policemen and Frontier Constabulary personnel identified as Jalal, Rahimullah, Niaz, Abdul Ghaffar, Rahim and Riasat Khan, sustained injuries and were shifted to the hospital.
 


Police said the attackers targeted the vehicle with automatic weapons, but the elite force personnel travelling in a separate vehicle remained unharmed. All units in the area were placed on high alert following the assault.
In Lower Dir’s Maidan subdivision, militants attacked three police posts in Lajbok, Shadas, and Kolal Dherai, in separate incidents during the night.
One constable was martyred in the Lajbok attack, which occurred around midnight. Another constable sustained minor injuries in the assault on Shadas post at about 1:15am. The third attack, on Kolal Dherai post around 2:30am, was repulsed without casualties.
S. Waziristan
Separately, a Frontier Corps official was martyred when a patrolling party of the paramilitary force came under attack in Lower South Waziristan. Sources said that the security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search operation.
In Shangla, a militant attack was thwarted by law enforcement personnel near Dambra Chowk on Chawga-Shekoli Road. Police said the attack took place at 1:23 am on Thursday when militants opened fire, adding that police responded immediately.
They said that the attackers took cover behind stacks of construction blocks. At around 1:40am, the militants, while dragging away two injured accomplices, retreated towards Shekoli Road.
Attack foiled in Lakki
Meanwhile, police in Lakki Marwat also claimed to have thwarted a late-night militant attack on a police post in the Mazanga area of Bannu district.
A police official said that a group of militants attacked the post with light and heavy weapons in an attempt to seize the building. He added that the exchange of fire lasted for some time, causing the assailants to flee.
Separately, a police officer and a cook sustained injuries when unidentified militants threw a grenade at the Bamkhel police post in Swabi district on Thursday.

• Eight killed, seven missing in Gilgit-Baltistan
MUZAFFARABAD / GILGIT: Over a dozen people were killed on Thursday as rains and flooding ripped through the country’s northern parts, including Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, while in Punjab, authorities remained on high alert as water levels in rivers and nullahs started rising.
In Muzaffarabad district, a massive landslide in Sarli Sacha village hit a home, leaving six members of a family buried, and feared dead.
A cloudburst sent a wall of water surging down Jhugiyan Nullah, destroying summer homes and livestock. In the same area, a raging flood in Machhiara Nullah obliterated a major bridge.
In Sudhnoti district, Misbah Ashfaq, 26, died after being swept away by a stream. Deputy Commissioner Mumtaz Kazmi said 34 houses in his district were partially or completely damaged.
In Bagh district, Akhtar Begum, 57, was killed when her home collapsed.
The northeastern Neelum Valley also faced major disruptions, where tourists were shifted to safety.
More than 600 tourists camping at the Ratti Gali lake base were advised to remain in place after the link road was damaged. The floods also washed away two connecting bridges over Lawat Nullah, and the swollen Jagran Nullah tore away a bridge in Kundal Shahi. A scenic riverside restaurant and at least three houses in the area were also swept away.
In the Jhelum Valley, a cloudburst over Palhot unleashed a flash flood that damaged part of the road and left dozens of vehicles stranded. In Nardajiyan village, a raging torrent swept away six shops.
With the Neelum River rising rapidly, authorities issued a flood warning and plan to relocate vulnerable riverside families.
The Muzaffarabad–Mansehra highway remains blocked at Lohar Gali due to a landslide.
Damages in GB
In Gilgit-Baltistan, flash floods killed at least eight people and with two still missing in the Ghizer district, devastating villages in the Khalti, Ishkoman and Yasin areas.
“Daen Area of Ishkoman Tehsil, Khalti of Gupis Tehsil and Thoi, Barkulti and Taus areas of Yasin Tehsil have received short but heavy rains, which devastated many villages and infrastructure,” said provincial spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.
 
 

In the Khalti valley, a house with at least seven people inside was struck by heavy debris, Additional Deputy Commissioner Mir Afzal said. Only two bodies and one injured girl were recovered.
An elderly man in Barkulti also died after being caught in the floods, Afzal said.
The floods damaged more than a dozen houses, several vehicles, schools and health units, while blocking major arteries including the Karakoram Highway and Baltistan Highway at several points.
In Diamer, flash floods triggered submerged parts of Babusar Road.
Punjab on high alert
Authorities across Punjab were on high alert on Thursday as monsoon rains battered cities and villages, causing water levels to swell in rivers and nullahs.
PDMA said Sutlej River at Ganda Singh Wala was flowing at 64,554 cusecs on Thursday evening, crossing the low-flood mark of 18 feet. The rising waters prompted a rescue in Shakargarh, where four men were stranded in the surging Nullah Bain.
 
 

The Met Office and PDMA predicted scattered to very heavy rainfall across upper Punjab from August 18-21, with Rawalpindi, Lahore, Sialkot and Narowal.
Alerts were issued for the River Jhelum at Mangla Dam, the Indus River at Chashma, and the Chenab River at Marala Barrage. Over two dozen villages, including Bhikiwind, Mahiwala and Kalanjer, are at risk of being submerged.

• Official says flood damaged homes built in riverbed
TWO weeks after a flood that washed away their houses, crops, and cattle, locals living along the banks of the Indus in Layyah district are still reeling from the ongoing ordeal — bracing for another river surge even though the previously-flooded fields have yet to be drained.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department, the water level is rising in the Indus River at Tarbela, Kalabagh, and Chashma, and the flow is expected to rise to “medium to moderate levels” within the next 24 hours.
On July 28, more than 23 union councils in the district had submerged after a protective dyke built to support the newly constructed Layyah-Taunsa Bridge buckled under the raging floodwater. Now, the river flows through the areas once protected by this protective dyke.
The bridge, which connects the cities of Layyah and Taunsa, is 2km long, while the riverbed spans a width of app­roximately 24km. The government approved Rs10 billion for its construction in 2017. The area also has a ferry service, which takes a little over an hour to reach the other side.
A visit to the area showed that roads leading to the bridge had been swept away, and three to four feet of water was standing in fields of sugarcane and sesame. The locals, without any help from the government, were preparing for another eventuality — shifting their belongings from damaged houses to other places, saying the land and their houses were damaged by the river daily.
 
 

According to them, the river water did not enter their villages in the past and they blamed the ‘flawed bridge’ that altered its course and directed the water towards settlements. They feared that if the river further swelled, their houses and farmland would be permanently lost.
A resident of Dulu Nashaib, Ameer Muhammad, told Dawn that there were about 40 homes in Kumharan Wala village. “All houses were washed away and they could not take away their belongings,” he said, adding that the river was flowing through the now-vanished village. “Hundreds of acres of sugarcane crop and dozens of houses were completely washed away and became part of the river,” he lamented.
A resident of Chandhar village, Muhammad Iqbal, said they managed to retrieve some of their belongings before they were washed away by the floodwater after the dyke collapsed. They lost their crops in 2005 and 2010, but in this flood, all their belongings were gone. He claimed substandard material was used for the construction of the dyke and the contractor of the bridge and its connecting roads fled soon after the dyke was swept away.
Ruined harvest
A government report revealed that 47 villages were affected, 75 houses were fully destroyed, and 29,788 acres of crops vanished in the flood. Besides the death of a person and four head of cattle, entire crops were damaged in some areas, including Mirani Paka. Sumra Nashaib, Dulu Nashaib, Lohanch Nashiab, Mirani Paka, and Mosan Shah now stand in ruins, with mud and brick houses reduced to debris.
With their harvest ruined, farmers stare at drowned fields in disbelief. Like others, Riaz Hussain was also sifting through the rubble of his house, hoping to salvage something.
“The river never flowed here before the bridge,” said one villager, echoing widespread anger. “We warned them, and now we are paying the price.”
Villages like Sehmal Nashaib lost 92 per cent of their crop, but compensation is still awaited. As many as 75 families in Karor tehsil alone, whose homes were ‘fully damaged’ have yet to receive help. The locals demanded immediate reconstruction of the dyke and flood barriers and compensation for crops, houses, and livestock, as well as a judicial inquiry into the bridge’s design and approval process.
Pervaiz Dulu, who runs a ferry service between the two cities, told Dawn that even after two weeks, the 800-foot-wide breach had still not been plugged by the government.
On the other hand, a local PPP leader claimed that the bridge’s construction went on despite legal challenges.
Dr Javed Kunjal told Dawn that he had challenged the construction of the bridge and also filed a writ petition before Lahore High Court, but no one listened. He said that they had pointed out flaws in the design and mentioned that it would erode the human settlements. He said that the natural path of the river was obstructed by the bridge and its supportive dykes.
“How can a 24km wide river… be covered by a two kilometre bridge? The remaining part of the river was closed to build supportive dykes and roads for the bridge,” he said.
“Despite legal challenges questioning the bridge’s engineering, construction was allowed to proceed,” he claimed.
According to Punjab Irrigation Department Layyah XEN Abdul Rauf, the flood entered villages after the protective dyke washed away under the pressure of 400,000 cusecs of water. He said that the settlements were established in the floodplains, which always flooded during the high-flow season.
“Locals should not be allowed to build houses and infrastructure there.” However, he did not address why the government was building roads in the riverbed.
He assured that the flooded river did not pose any threats to Layyah and Karor Lal Esan cities because their protective embankments were still 10km away. Meanwhile, the government allocated over Rs150 million for the construction of new and existing dykes to protect the area from flooding.

• Top judge says move might affect unity among judges, expose court to public comment
• Insists Article 184 petitions must go to Constitutional Bench, not full court
• SC Rules 2025 published, aim to modernise court procedures
ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi ignored a decision made last year by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment of the Constitution before the full Supreme Court, according to minutes of the communication exchange between CJP and two senior judges of the apex court.
CJP argued that such a move would dampen the much-needed spirit of collegiality among judges, besides exposing the court to public comment, as in the recent past.
The committee, which met on Oct 31, 2024, under the Practice and Procedure Act (PPA) 2023, was convened by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. In response, CJP Afridi, who chairs the committee, said he did not find it appropriate to call for a full court hearing. He also mentioned receiving the letters from the two senior judges late in the afternoon.
 
 

CJP explained that he had been compelled to send the committee’s decision and his response in sealed envelopes to the secretary of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) for safekeeping until the JCP meeting, which was convened on Nov 5, 2024.
In his reply, the CJP expressed his intention to request the JCP to nominate additional judges to join him on the Constitutional Bench. This would enable the committee, as envisaged under Article 191A (3a) of the Constitution, to bring the petitions challenging the 26th Amendment before the full court.
He observed that convening the committee to form benches under PPA or constituting the full court would violate the Constitution’s provisions.
He also asked the JCP Secretary to present his response, along with the letters from the two judges, for due consideration at the upcoming JCP meeting.
CJP Afridi asserted that the constitutional mandate regarding the jurisdiction of any bench to hear petitions under Article 184 of the Constitution was clear. Under Article 191A, petitions filed under Article 184 must be placed before the Constitutional Bench. He further noted that the constitution of benches to hear such petitions is solely within the purview of a three-judge committee of the Constitutional Bench, not the PPA committee.
He recalled how he consulted all 13 judges of the Supreme Court. Nine of them agreed that petitions challenging the 26th Amendment should be placed before the Constitutional Bench, not the full court.
In separate minutes dated May 20, 2025, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah stressed the need for meaningful consultation, which he stated was the core purpose of the PPA. Justice Shah noted that delegating powers to the Supreme Court’s registrar was not covered by the act.
He suggested finding a permanent solution for urgent matters and proposed that the next senior judge should attend committee meetings in the absence of a member, but only if the CJP was unavailable.
The committee discussed Justice Shah’s proposals and agreed with his view on non-delegation of committee powers but differed with the rest of his assertions. The committee directed the registrar to revise the draft and resubmit it.
SC Rules 2025
Meanwhile, the apex court on Thursday formally published the Supreme Court Rules 2025, replacing the Supreme Court Rules 1980.
Framed under Article 191 of the Constitution, the new rules replace outdated provisions and bring court procedures in line with contemporary legal, constitutional and technological developments that have emerged immediately.
To carry out this revision, CJP had formed a committee comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi. The committee engaged with judges, the Pakistan Bar Council, the Supreme Court Bar Association and other bar associations. The final draft was placed before the full court and approved after detailed deliberation.
The Supreme Court Rules 2025 consist of seven parts, 38 orders and six schedules, with around 280 provisions amended (including 160 from the schedules), 60 new provisions added, and five outdated provisions deleted.
Key highlights of the new rules include that all petitions and paper books must be filed electronically, and notices, orders and certified copies will be issued digitally. Pleadings, hearings and affidavits may be conducted via video link, and judicial documents sent by post will no longer be entertained.
The rules update court fees for the first time in decades, with special provisions for criminal petitions, fees for petitions submitted from jail and fee exemptions for habeas corpus and Article 184(3) petitions. Counsel fees have also been increased, and the registrar may appoint advocates at state expense in death penalty cases.
Intra-Court Appeals have been introduced for orders under Article 184(3) and contempt proceedings, with one review petition allowed per judgement. Frivolous reviews will incur penalties, and the security deposit has been increased.
Appeals from interlocutory orders must be heard by a bench of at least two judges. The registrar is empowered to recall ex parte orders and enforce compliance with procedural formats.
The registrar is granted authority to oversee staff and exercise procedural powers, and procedural failures will not invalidate proceedings.

Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
At least 313 people, including 142 children, have died and 740 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, according to updated daily data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
The incident occurred in Nariyah Behak, part of Sarli Sacha village northwest of Muzaffarabad, where a cloudburst sent a wall of water surging down Jhugiyan Nullah, smashing into houses perched on the highland pastures where villagers live in summer with their livestock.
“Two houses were swept away by the flood,” Saeed Qureshi, senior director at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), told Dawn.com.
“Six members of one family are missing — Muhammad Naveed, his wife Asiya Bibi, and their four children, all under 10 years of age, and there are no chances of their survival,” he added.
The downpour also triggered flash floods and landslides across much of AJK, washing away small bridges, cutting off roads, and damaging dozens of houses.
In a nearby home, 60-year-old Jamdali narrowly escaped but suffered critical injuries.
Raja Manzoor Hussain, a local councillor in Jhing village, said the site was in difficult terrain.
“The incident happened around 2pm, but we only got the news after 3:30pm,” he said. “There’s no telecom service there, and the main track was cut off, so the messenger had to take an extra two-kilometre detour on foot.
“Losses will be much higher than what we know right now — only tomorrow will reveal the true scale,” he told Dawn.com by telephone.
 


In the same area, a raging flood in Machhiara Nullah destroyed a major bridge at Batdara, severing the only ground connection for four villages and bringing daily life to a standstill.
In Sudhnoti district, 26-year-old Misbah Ashfaq was swept away by a stream and killed, while her younger sister was injured.
“Local residents managed to recover the body shortly afterwards,” Deputy Commissioner Mumtaz Kazmi told Dawn.com, adding that 34 houses in his district had been partially or completely damaged.
In the Bagh district, 57-year-old Akhtar Begum was killed when her home collapsed in Jia Na Bun village. Heavy rains also destroyed part of a road and a service station.
A vehicle carrying four tourists from Jaranwala was trapped in floodwaters but rescued safely, according to Deputy Commissioner Sadaqat Adalat.
Meanwhile, the northeastern Neelum Valley faced major disruptions.
Deputy District Disaster Management Officer Akhtar Ayoub informed Dawn.com that dozens of tourists stranded along Ratti Gali Nullah had been safely transported to Dawarian Kallas.
“While a stranded vehicle was recovered from the floodwaters, a motorcycle was swept away by Ratti Galli Nullah,” he said.
More than 600 tourists camping at the lake’s base had been advised by the administration to remain in place, as the link road had been damaged by ongoing rains and flooding.
AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed, who was also present at the site, issued a video message saying that all camp owners had agreed not to charge tourists for meals and accommodation that night.
“This is the beauty of Neelum Valley — it’s what draws tourists here,” he remarked, adding that all visitors would be safely evacuated on Friday when weather conditions were expected to improve.
Ayoub said that two connecting bridges over Lawat Nullah in the Valley’s upper belt had also been washed away.
“In Kundal Shahi, the swollen Jagran Nullah tore away a well-known bridge near a popular waterfall, the same location where a suspension bridge collapsed in 2018, killing several tourists,” he said.
Further upstream, the floodwaters also swept away another bridge as well as a store, four containers and some equipment related to the Jagran-II hydropower project.
A scenic riverside restaurant and at least three houses in the area were swept away, with further losses still being assessed.
In Jhelum Valley, a cloudburst over Palhot along the Bani Hafiz Road unleashed a flash flood that damaged part of the road and left dozens of vehicles stranded. In Nardajiyan village, a raging torrent swept away six shops, Qureshi said.
In Muzaffarabad, the SDMA reported in a statement that the Neelum River was rising rapidly, with outflow from Nauseri Dam reaching 1,000 cubic metres per second — an unusually high volume — and climbing.
Authorities issued a flood warning and plan to relocate vulnerable riverside families to Jinnah Pilot High School in Lower Plate and Ali Akbar Awan High School in Upper Chhattar.
The Muzaffarabad–Mansehra highway remained blocked at Lohar Gali due to a landslide, while other connecting roads were open but littered with debris.
Officials have urged residents and travellers to exercise extreme caution until conditions improve.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday forecast widespread rain, wind, and thundershowers in most parts of the country in the coming days, with monsoon activity expected to intensify from August 17.
In its latest weather advisory, the Met Office said monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea were continuously penetrating the upper parts of Pakistan, while moist currents from the Bay of Bengal were likely to strengthen midweek.
Under these conditions, rain-wind/thundershower with scattered heavy falls was expected in Islamabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, upper Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan from Aug 14-17.
Last month, a cloudburst-triggered flash flood caused widespread damage in AJK, damaging around two dozen houses and six shops and leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.</p><small>2025-08-14 19:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1422591680ccd1f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930879/water-minister-slams-india-for-running-away-from-indus-waters-treaty-rejecting-hague-court-award' target='_blank'><strong>Water minister slams India for ‘running away’ from Indus Waters Treaty, rejecting Hague court award</strong></a><br><p>Federal Minister for Water Resources Muhammad Moeen Wattoo on Thursday criticised India for seeking to “run away” from the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) after its foreign ministry rejected a Hague court ruling to follow the accord in designing new hydroelectric projects on rivers flowing to Pakistan.
Under the 1960 IWT, three rivers that flow westwards were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers. In 2023, Pakistan brought a case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
The court, in its ruling that was posted on its website on Monday, said it had jurisdiction over the dispute and ruled the treaty “does not permit India to generate hydro-electric power on the Western Rivers based on what might be the ideal or best practices approach for engineering” of these projects. Instead, the design of these projects must adhere “strictly” to the specifications laid down in the treaty, the court said, adding that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.
The government had welcomed the decision and Attorney General Mansoor Usman had said the court had accepted Pakistan’s position.
Questioned about the matter today in his weekly press briefing, Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “India has never accepted the legality, legitimacy, or competence of the so-called Court of Arbitration. Its pronouncements are therefore without jurisdiction, devoid of legal standing, and have no bearing on India’s rights of utilisation of waters.”
He said India stood by its decision to hold the treaty in abeyance.
 






Responding to the MEA spokesperson’s stance, the water minister told Dawn.com: “India wants to run away from this agreement (IWT). Under any article of the agreement, India or Pakistan cannot terminate this agreement.”
He said India’s claim was “baseless and wrong”, adding that Pakistan rejected it.
“The court has already said that it has the power to decide. India had made this claim before, which the court has rejected.”
He said a letter by India earlier in the year seeking modification in the treaty had no legal cover and the country could not unilaterally take a decision regarding the IWT.
India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
A supplemental award by the PCA in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it did not recognise the court or its decisions.
International lawyer Ayesha Malik said India’s stance was a “testament to the extent to which India has departed from being a responsible, law-abiding state”.
She said the PCA award rested on India complying with its obligations under the IWT as well as international law.
“India is choosing to ignore the fact that it cannot merely suspend a treaty like the IWT and act like those obligations are no longer incumbent upon it. Furthermore, it is entirely incorrect for India to say that ‘New Delhi has never recognised the legitimacy of the court’, having entirely recognised its legitimacy in the Kishenganga arbitration of 2013.”
She said the PCA’s appeal for dialogue between the parties in its ruling had “fallen on deaf ears”.
“An increasingly bellicose India under [Narendra] Modi’s Hindutva regime seems to be repeatedly eschewing cooperation in favour of confrontation. While legal wins are good for Pakistan, it seems that its belligerent neighbour does not want the matter settled in a courtroom in The Hague, but by force.”</p><small>2025-08-14 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/14190600189a313.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930867/civil-and-military-leadership-martyrs-of-marka-i-haq-honoured-with-independence-day-awards' target='_blank'><strong>Civil and military leadership, martyrs of Marka-i-Haq honoured with Independence Day awards</strong></a><br><p>Military and civilian leadership, as well as the martyrs of “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth), were presented with national honours as part of celebrations to mark Pakistan’s 79th Independence Day on Thursday.
In July, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said this year’s Independence Day would be marked as “Marka-i-Haq”. The term is used by the state to name the conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the end of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos with a ceasefire on May 10.
In an earlier message today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari said the day served as a reminder of courage, unity, and sacrifices that led to the creation of Pakistan and paid homage to the founding father Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the workers of the Pakistan Movement for their struggle and sacrifices.
The awards, including both wartime and peacetime honours, were conferred by President Zardari and PM Shehbaz during a ceremony at the Presidency in Islamabad. Awards were conferred upon senior military and civilian officials, members of the PM’s war cabinet, as well as the delegation that presented Pakistan’s case to the world in the wake of the military confrontation with India.
According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), eight Sitara-i-Jurat (Star of Courage), five Tamgha-i-Jurat (Medal of Courage), 24 Sitara-i-Basalat (Star of Valour), 45 Tamgha-i-Basalat (Medal of Valour), 146 Imtiazi Asnad (mentioned in the Dispatches of senior commanders), 259 COAS Commendation Cards and one Tamgha-i-Imtiaz (Military) (Medal of Excellence) were awarded to both officers and enlisted men.
Field Marshal Asim Munir was presented with the Hilal-i-Jurat (Crescent of Courage), Pakistan’s second-highest wartime gallantry medal.

According to state broadcaster PTV News, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif was also awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for his “exceptional leadership and strategic contributions during the recent India-Pakistan war and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”.
 






The broadcaster also reported that Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “effectively and successfully presenting the national narrative on an international level during the recent Pakistan-India tensions.
“During the tense situation between Pakistan and India, Attaullah Tarar ensured complete coordination in the dissemination of information by civil and military institutions, successfully countering India’s propaganda and powerfully highlighting Pakistan’s stance on international forums,” PTV News wrote in a post on X.

The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.</p><small>2025-08-14 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/142146305512be8.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930881/trump-says-putin-ready-to-make-deal-on-ukraine-us-hopes-to-include-zelensky' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Putin ready to make deal on Ukraine, US hopes to include Zelensky</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin will make a deal on his war on Ukraine and that the threat of sanctions against Russia likely played a role in Moscow’s decision to seek a meeting.
Trump is scheduled to meet with Putin in Alaska tomorrow.
The US president said he is unsure whether an immediate ceasefire can be achieved, but expressed interest in brokering a peace agreement.
“I believe now, he’s convinced that he’s going to make a deal. He’s going to make a deal. I think he’s going to, and we’re going to find out,” Trump said in an interview on Fox News Radio’s ‘The Brian Kilmeade Show’.
Trump also mentioned during the Fox interview that he has three locations in mind for a follow-up meeting with Putin and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, though he noted that a second meeting is not guaranteed.
He said staying in Alaska for a three-way summit would be the easiest scenario.
“Depending on what happens with my meeting, I’m going to be calling up President Zelensky, and let’s get him over to wherever we’re going to meet,” Trump said.
He said a second meeting, featuring Trump, Putin and Zelensky, would likely dig deeper into boundary issues. Zelensky has been adamant about not ceding territory that Russian forces occupy.
“The second meeting is going to be very, very important, because that’s going to be a meeting where they make a deal. And I don’t want to use the word ‘divvy things up’, but you know, to a certain extent, it’s not a bad term, okay?” he said.
“But there will be a give and take as to boundaries, lands, etc, etc. The second meeting is going to be very, very, very important. This meeting sets up like a chess game. This [first] meeting sets up a second meeting, but there is a 25 per cent chance that this meeting will not be a successful meeting,” he said.
 


He said it would be up to Putin and Zelensky to strike an agreement.
“I’m not going to negotiate their deal. I’m going to let them negotiate their deal,” he said.
Earlier today, Putin spoke to his most senior ministers and security officials as he prepared for a meeting with Trump in Anchorage, Alaska, that could shape the endgame to the largest war in Europe since World War Two.
In televised comments, Putin said the US was “making, in my opinion, quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict”.
This was happening, Putin said, “in order to create long-term conditions for peace between our countries, and in Europe, and in the world as a whole — if, by the next stages, we reach agreements in the area of control over strategic offensive weapons.”
His comments signalled that Russia will raise nuclear arms control as part of a wide-ranging discussion on security when he sits down with Trump.

A Kremlin aide said Putin and Trump would also discuss the “huge untapped potential” for Russia-US economic ties.
A senior Eastern European official, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said Putin would try to distract Trump from Ukraine at the talks by offering him possible progress on nuclear arms control or something business-related.
“We hope Trump won’t be fooled by the Russians; he understands all [these] dangerous things,” the official said, adding that Russia’s only goal was to avoid any new sanctions and have existing sanctions lifted.
Russia controls around a fifth of Ukraine, and Zelensky and the Europeans worry that a deal could cement those gains, rewarding Putin for 11 years of efforts to seize Ukrainian land and emboldening him to expand further into Europe.
An EU diplomat said it would be “scary to see how it all unfolds in the coming hours. Trump had very good calls yesterday with Europe, but that was yesterday”.
Trump had shown willingness to join the security guarantees for Ukraine at a last-ditch virtual meeting with European leaders and Zelensky on Wednesday, European leaders said, though he made no public mention of them afterwards.

Friday’s summit, the first Russia-US summit since June 2021, comes at one of the toughest moments for Ukraine in a war that has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Speaking after Wednesday’s meeting, French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump had said the transatlantic Nato alliance should not be part of any security guarantees designed to protect Ukraine from future attacks in a post-war settlement.
However, Trump also said the US and all willing allies should be part of the security guarantees, Macron added.
Expanding on that, a European official told Reuters that Trump said on the call he was willing to provide some security guarantees for Europe, without spelling out what they would be.
It “felt like a big step forward,” said the official, who did not want to be named.
It was not immediately clear what such guarantees could mean in practice.
On Wednesday, Trump threatened “severe consequences” if Putin does not agree to peace in Ukraine and has warned of economic sanctions if his meeting on Friday proves fruitless.
Russia is likely to resist Ukraine and Europe’s demands and has previously said its stance had not changed since it was first detailed by Putin in June 2024.</p><small>2025-08-14 17:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/142122454e9bb08.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930880/karachi-police-arrest-dha-woman-for-allegedly-murdering-her-two-young-children' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police arrest DHA woman for allegedly murdering her two young children</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi police arrested a 37-year-old woman on Thursday who allegedly slaughtered her two young children in Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
“A lady killed her two children, who were eight and four years old, with a sharp knife due to a marital issue with her husband,” South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com, adding that police arrested the suspect and seized the murder weapon.
He added that the children’s bodies were recovered from a house on 10th Street off Khayaban-i-Mujahid with their throats slit.
“The suspect sent pictures to her ex-husband after killing the children,” he said, adding that the father then called the police. However, both children were found murdered when Darakhshan police arrived at the residence.
“The bodies were taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal formalities,” DIG Raza said.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the children’s throats were slit, which damaged vital structures and vessels in the neck, leading to their death. “Swabs have also been collected to rule out sexual violence,” she added.
A passerby told Dawn.com that a large group of police personnel, media persons and an ambulance were gathered outside the residence earlier today.
“I passed by a house and there were loads of cops, an Edhi ambulance and a DSNG of some channel … on the road that leads to Bahria,” she said.
“On the way back, there was one cameraman and another person still there. I asked them what happened. They said some woman murdered her two small children, had a mental disorder and was getting divorced or something.”
DIG Raza said that the suspect and her husband divorced last year. “The custody of the children was contested in court, which ruled in favour of the father,” he stated. “However, the mother was allowed to meet her children. On Wednesday night, the children stayed at her home in DHA, where she allegedly slaughtered them.”
The DIG said that the children’s father told police that the suspect was “emotionally disturbed” and that he had been financially supporting her.
During the initial probe, he said, it was found that the suspect met her husband in Karachi in 2012 and they subsequently married.
“The suspect enrolled at an institute in Karachi affiliated with a British university, but she did not graduate,” DIG Raza outlined. “She sometimes did minor jobs in the metropolis, but she had no regular employment.”
DIG Raza said that in her initial statement before investigators, the suspect stated she did not want to defend herself as there was “nothing logical or reasonable enough for the murder”.
“She said she woke up between 8:30 and 9am and saw her children having breakfast with her mother,” he explained. “She contacted her ex-husband, but she did not elaborate as to what transpired during their phone calls.
“She claimed that the children were telling her ‘to send them somewhere where they could not face such a situation, which she (the mother) was facing’,” he added
The DIG said that when asked whether her children were facing an “undesirable attitude” from their father, she did not elaborate.
“The woman admitted that she was taking medicines to treat psychiatric issues,” he said, adding that police suspected that she might be under the influence of drugs.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, the Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in the year 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objectives of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” it read.</p><small>2025-08-14 16:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618839-scp-issues-new-supreme-court-rules-2025' target='_blank'><strong>SCP issues new Supreme Court Rules 2025</strong></a><br><p>

In July, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said this year’s Independence Day would be marked as “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth). The term is used by the state for the conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the end of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos with a ceasefire on May 10. The May conflict was sparked as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence — a claim strongly refuted by Pakistan. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians. In retaliation, PAF downed six Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7. India’s highest-ranking general has also acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.
At a ceremony in Islamabad today, the awards, including both wartime and peacetime honours, were conferred by President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), eight Sitara-i-Jurat (Star of Courage), five Tamgha-i-Jurat (Medal of Courage), 24 Sitara-i-Basalat (Star of Valour), 45 Tamgha-i-Basalat (Medal of Valour), 146 Imtiazi Asnad (mentioned in the Dispatches of senior commanders), 259 COAS Commendation Cards and one Tamgha-i-Imtiaz (Military) (Medal of Excellence) were awarded to both officers and enlisted men.

While describing Pakistan’s response to the Indian Air Force, PAF Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed on May 12 said the PAF’s response was based “on the time and place of own choosing”, displaying “bold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership”.
Last month, Chinese air force chief Lieutenant General Wang Gang lauded the “exemplary performance” during the aerial clash, praising the “decisive and measured response delivered by PAF pilots under the resolute leadership of the air chief”.
Last week, in response to claims that India had shot down Pakistani aircraft, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif noted that “not a single Pakistani aircraft was hit or destroyed” by India, adding that Pakistan took out six Indian jets, S400 air defence batteries and unmanned aircraft of India while “swiftly putting several Indian airbases out of action”.
France’s air chief, General Jerome Bellanger, has previously said that he has seen evidence of the loss of three Indian fighters, including a Rafale. The Indian Air Force has not commented on those claims.
Days after the air combat, The Washington Post, based on visual evidence analysed by experts, reported that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.
According to The Wire, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, while speaking at a seminar in June, acknowledged that the PAF downed the Indian fighters.
During his presentation at the event, Kumar had acknowledged the loss of Indian planes. According to Kumar, Indian fighter jets were “operating under strict political orders from the Modi government not to target Pakistani military installations or air defence systems”, The Wire reported.
“This self-imposed limitation by the government was intended to prevent escalation of conflict in a nuclear environment,” the outlet added, quoting the Indian officer.
India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle between Pakistan and India, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force’s J-10 fighters using PL-15s missiles, according to a report.
Reuters interviews with two Indian officials and three of their Pakistani counterparts found that the performance of the Rafale wasn’t the key problem: central to its downing was an Indian intelligence failure concerning the range of the China-made PL-15 missile fired by the J-10 fighter. China and Pakistan are the only countries to operate both J-10s, known as Vigorous Dragons, and PL-15s.
The faulty intelligence gave the Rafale pilots a false sense of confidence that they were out of Pakistani firing distance, which they believed was only around 150km, the Indian officials said, referring to the widely cited range of PL-15’s export variant.
“We ambushed them,” the PAF official said, adding that Islamabad conducted an electronic warfare assault on Delhi’s systems in an attempt to confuse Indian pilots. Indian officials dispute the effectiveness of those efforts.
“The Indians were not expecting to be shot at,” said Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London’s Royal United Services Institute think-tank. “And the PL-15 is clearly very capable at long range.” The PL-15 that hit the Rafale was fired from around 200km away, according to Pakistani officials, and even farther according to Indian officials. That would make it among the longest-range air-to-air strikes recorded.</p><small>2025-08-14 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618838-pakistans-high-commission-in-new-delhi-celebrates-independence-day' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's High Commission in New Delhi celebrates Independence Day</strong></a><br><p>

Islamabad is boosting its military capabilities following its recent military confict with India, increasing defence budget by 20 per cent for the fiscal year 2025-2026.
“On this occasion, today, I announce the formation of the Army Rocket Force Command,” the prime minister said while addressing a special ceremony held at Islamabad’s Jinnah Sports Stadium on late Wednesday night to celebrate Pakistan’s 79th Independence Day and Marka-i-Haq.
Marka-i-Haq (Battle of Truth) is a term the state uses for the recent conflict with India, when Pakistan responded to Indian aggression following the April 22 Pahalgam attack, before a ceasefire was reached on May 10.
“Equipped with modern technology and capable of targeting the enemy from every direction, this force will prove another milestone in further strengthening our conventional war capabilities,” PM Shehbaz said.
 






Pakistan has sophisticated missile capabilities, some of which it deployed in May alongside J-10C Vigorous Dragon and JF-17 Thunder fighter jets.
“After the recent conflict, the object of course is to further strengthen Pakistan’s military capability and this is a part of that process,” defence analyst Talat Masood, a former general, told AFP.
The high-profile event last night featured a countdown to midnight and culminated in a spectacular fireworks display as the national anthem was played.
It was attended by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, President Asif Ali Zardari, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, federal and state ministers, and diplomats.
Parades were taken out by the different branches of the armed forces, while military personnel from Turkiye and Azerbaijan also featured in the parade. Pakistan Air Force Falcons also performed a fly past over the venue.
During his address, the premier highlighted that the recent military conflict with India concluded with Pakistan’s decisive victory “within three to four days”.
“India forgot that wars are not won with weapons alone, but with the spirit of the nation,” he said, adding that the defeat taught India a lesson it will never forget.
 
 

PM Shehbaz hailed the post-conflict period as the “birth of a new Pakistan” and called COAS Munir a “son of the nation”, whose strategy led to a decisive military victory.
The prime minister also unveiled the digital model of the Marka-i-Haq Monument.
He praised the leadership of COAS Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad, and PAF Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber for their coordinated and swift response to Indian aggression.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.
During his address, the premier also paid homage to the pioneers of Pakistan’s atomic programme, especially ex-president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, along with other politicians, scientists, and the armed forces, for making Pakistan the seventh atomic power of the world.
He also commended then-PM Nawaz Sharif, his brother and PML-N president, for resisting international pressure in 1998 and taking the brave decision to go ahead with the nuclear tests in Balochistan’s Chagai.
“Our nuclear arsenal is not for aggression. It is only for defence purposes,” the prime minister stressed.
 
 

The premier also unveiled the digital model of the Marka-i-Haq Monument.
In another highlight of the event, PM Shehbaz invited all political parties to become part of ‘Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan’, to lay the basis for the greater national interest.
He underscored the need for the pact so the whole world could see that “differences have their own place, but we are all one for the sake of our beloved Pakistan”.
