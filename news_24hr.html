WE are at a turning point of regional and global history because of several seminal developments. The moral, institutional, political, and economic degeneration of the US. The berserk aggression of Israel, which has finally destroyed the credibility of the US as a force for regional and international stability.
The realisation among Arab elites that they can no longer rely on a trade-off between national humiliation and external protection against Arab streets. China’s recognition that its diplomacy will not significantly postpone a day of reckoning with a fearful and implacable US. The emergence of a vast Afro-Asian Muslim playground waiting to be co-opted by the East as deliverance from the West. India’s failure to transition from regional power status to international power status, and become a credible partner for the US against China.
Above all, climate change in the Anthropocene age, in which human activity becomes a principal determinant of the rate of global warming and the fate of plant and animal species, including human beings. Because of the irresponsibility of the principal industrial powers, climate change will shortly become irreversible.
 
 

Management of and adaptation to climate change may at most delay, but not avert the demise of human civilisation — possibly within this century. As a result, Noam Chomsky observed that far from the noblest of God’s creatures, mankind will be the stupidest and most short-lived of animal species. All of the above is reflected in the last reset of the Doomsday Clock, which at 89 seconds to ‘midnight’, is the closest yet to doomsday. The next reset next January will be even closer.
This is the global context in which we are today witnessing the culmination of a century-long genocidal process against the trapped and defenceless Palestinian people. This unparalleled crime against humanity was initiated by Imperial Britain, and is culminating in the comprehensive connivance of the US. If, God forbid, Palestine dies, the Arab and Muslim world will face a colossal moral and civilisational failure, which it may not survive. The genocidal policy of the US and Israel has made the two-state solution for Palestine, as mandated by the UN, impossible to achieve. Accordingly, Israel has forfeited the right to exist.
The only just solution now is the liberation of the State of Palestine in which people of all faiths who have the right to be there — including all Palestinians who have an internationally recognised right of return — are encouraged and assisted to live together in harmony, peace and justice.
 
 

All other proposed solutions to the Palestinian tragedy have been rendered impossible by the violence, greed, guilt and hypocrisy of the US and its European allies, in support of the rabid racism of the criminal and illegitimate State of Israel.
What is to be done? What can be done? How can it be done? Where do we begin? If answers to such questions regarding the genocide in Palestine can be agreed upon and implemented, it will be possible to similarly address other challenges that in greater or lesser measure threaten the future of humanity.

What is to be done? What can be done? How can it be done? Where do we begin?

Historically, power systems have always opposed the implementation of sensible and practical answers to such questions. This has been the warp and woof of human history. The finest brains have been selected to conjure up appealing or convincing reasons for such perversity. The difference today is that mankind has the capacity to destroy itself. The stakes are globally existential.
Alex Carey noted that ‘grass-roots’ propaganda is designed to sway the masses through their beliefs, fears and prejudices, as well as their ignorance which is sustained by the social system in which they are confined. ‘Tree-top’ propaganda, on the contrary, is designed to comfort the upper- and middle-class intelligentsia who like to see themselves as decent human beings while serving the avarice and rapacity of their masters, who similarly wish to see themselves in a benevolent light. The comprador intellectual, whatever his or her profession, is accordingly among the vilest of social beings.
 
 

Nevertheless, Chomsky suggests there are things that can be done to make a difference. One is for concerned people “not to be passive and quiescent” and to make life uncomfortable for exploiting elites and their cohorts who wish to preserve a decent opinion of themselves. Just persistently asking questions in all kinds of forums can be effective. Being a pest can also make a significant contribution. But he also notes that whatever one does should be done consistently.
Power systems do not mind occasional protesters. In fact, they welcome them as proof of their tolerance and respect for free speech. A jihad or struggle has to be an organised and sustained learning process for it to be meaningful and ultimately successful.
And this is where the men are distinguished from the boys. And this is also where women are often ‘more men’ than most men. They “hold up half the sky”, according to Mao. That is why they are taught by men — and unfortunately but understandably often enough by their mothers — to see their world in the household and virtue in obedience, tolerance, and suffering. Those women who excel in these docile qualities are worshipped by men — largely in the abstract.
 
 

Men never seem to ask why God gave human intelligence to women if it was superfluous, even when they rightly suspect women are wiser, stronger, and braver than them.
To sum up, starting with turning points, I focused on Palestine, asked questions, quoted Chomsky and Carey, and paid due homage to women. Good things can lead to more good things. So let us begin by feeling uncomfortable about the prevailing situation at home and abroad. That might lead to reflection, anger, action and eventually deliverance from climate catastrophe and political evil.
Let us then resolve to keep doing something good for Pakistan, our only country, and for Earth, our Mother Planet.

TEHRAN: Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan and Iranian Minister for Roads and Urban Development Farzaneh Sadeq exchange the notes after signing protocols at the Pak-Iran 22nd JEC meeting.—APP

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Iran have signed a series of crucial protocols aimed at dismantling tariff and non-tariff barriers, expanding electricity exchanges, and strengthening communication channels to increase bilateral trade volume significantly.
The protocols were signed at the conclusion of the Pakistan-Iran Joint Economic Commission (JEC) held in Tehran. Pakistan’s Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan and Iran’s Minister for Roads and Urban Development Farzaneh Sadeq led their respective delegations during the signing ceremony.
An official announcement of the commerce ministry released on Wednesday said that the signing of the protocols will help achieve a $10 billion trade target between the two countries.
 
 

In a separate engagement, Mr Jam Kamal held talks with Iran’s First Vice President Mohammad-Reza Aref to advance bilateral trade cooperation. The meeting centred on removing trade barriers, exploring export-import opportunities, and strengthening regulatory alignment between the two countries.

Agreements cover trade, energy, transport and labour mobility

Under the newly signed protocols, Pakistan and Iran reaffirmed their commitment to deepening trade and investment ties by eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers, activating cross-border markets, and encouraging regular Business-to-Business (B2B) engagements to strengthen commercial linkages.
In the energy and infrastructure sectors, both sides reached consensus on expanding electricity exchanges, including the revival of construction on a 220-kilovolt transmission line to Gwadar.
Discussions also included joint exploration of renewable energy initiatives. A dedicated Joint Working Group will facilitate investment in the power sector, while enhanced cooperation in water resource management and sustainable urban development was identified as a strategic priority.
In the domains of agriculture and environmental sustainability, both countries pledged to implement agreements on veterinary health standards, pest control measures, and joint development of agricultural seeds and equipment. Collaborative efforts will also target climate-related challenges, including mitigation of sand and dust storms and the conservation of mangrove ecosystems.
Transportation and connectivity emerged as strategic priorities, with accords to reinforce road, rail, air, and maritime links. Key initiatives include boosting rail cargo capacity, upgrading air navigation systems, and exploring passenger ferry services — particularly for Zaireen — between designated seaports.
Cultural and educational exchanges received renewed momentum through planned cultural festivals, joint media productions, academic collaborations, student mobility programs, and vocational training initiatives aimed at deepening people-to-people ties.
Agreements on joint training programmes, harmonisation of pharmaceutical registration protocols, and coordinated cross-border disease surveillance mechanisms marked progress in health sector collaboration.
Labour mobility received a boost through the establishment of a Joint Committee on Labour Cooperation, tasked with facilitating workforce movement in key sectors including construction, textiles, and agriculture. Both countries also reiterated their commitment to counter-narcotics efforts, agreeing to intensify intelligence-led operations and strengthen border coordination. Proposals to streamline visa procedures for businesspersons and commercial drivers were tabled, aimed at easing cross-border movement and enhancing trade facilitation.

In a keynote address at the Natural Resources and Energy Summit 2025 on Wednesday, Shamsuddin A. Shaikh, CEO of National Resources Ltd (NRL), highlighted the sector’s underutilised potential. He noted that while Pakistan sits on one of the world’s richest mineral belts, it contributes only 0.15pc to global mineral output and 2-3pc to national GDP. Of the 92 known minerals in the country, nearly 90pc remain unexplored.
Shaikh stressed the urgency of exploiting these resources, warning that failure to act quickly could result in foreign companies capitalising on the opportunity. “This is the time for Pakistani companies and investors to lead through joint ventures and partnerships, creating wealth and jobs at home,” he said.
Key projects already underway include Reko Diq, which has the potential to generate $4-5bn annually, Siah Diq ($1-2bn), Thar coal expansion ($200m), and barite, lead, and zinc projects ($100m). Together, these initiatives are expected to add billions of dollars to the economy within the next five years. Shaikh also pointed to further copper and gold exploration in the Chagai region, which could generate an additional $5-10bn annually after 2030.

Investment in Reko Diq and Thar coal could raise mining revenue to $6-8bn by 2030, says NRL chief

He emphasised that responsible mining could bring significant social benefits, including job creation, improved housing, and access to healthcare and education, particularly in impoverished regions. “Mining is not just about extracting minerals; it’s about building communities and eradicating poverty,” he said.
Hassan R. Muhammadi, Founder and Director of Fidelity Insurance Brokers, also spoke at the summit, highlighting the importance of mining and energy sectors in driving economic growth, enhancing energy security, and earning foreign exchange. He assured that the insurance sector is ready to support both local and foreign investors with tailored risk solutions.
Khurram Ali Khan, CEO of Fidelity Insurance Brokers, underscored the critical role of insurance in sustaining large-scale projects. “In volatile environments, insurance provides the safety net that keeps projects moving and investors confident,” he said.
Muhammad Sohail Tabba, Chairman of Lucky Cement, pointed out that mining could offer significant socio-economic benefits, particularly in rural provinces. He suggested that developing these resources, coupled with investments in education and capacity building, could bring prosperity, stability, and peace to underserved regions.
However, experts cautioned that without investment in governance, regulation, and human resource development, the sector’s potential could be undermined. Challenges such as inconsistent policies and climate-related risks need to be carefully managed, with innovation and technology playing a crucial role.
The summit, which brought together policymakers, investors, CEOs, insurers, and international experts, focused on how mining and energy sectors could become central pillars of Pakistan’s economic future. Discussions also centred on the role of specialised insurance and emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, in supporting these industries.
Shaikh urged both government and industry to act decisively. “This is Pakistan’s moment,” he concluded. “With the right policies and local investments, mining can become a $10bn-plus industry, driving growth, stability, and national pride.”

LHC Justice Jawad Hassan took up the petition, filed by Mahnoor Omer, which seeks to exempt sanitary pads and related products from sales tax.
With the court’s approval, the petition also added the Revenue Division via its Secretary as a respondent, arguing that the tax system indirectly discriminates against women and violates constitutional rights to equality and dignity as outlined in Articles 3, 9, 14, 25 and 37.
Advocate Ahsan Jehangir Khan, the petitioner’s counsel, said that only 12pc of menstruating women in Pakistan can afford commercial sanitary pads, forcing the rest to use unsafe alternatives.

Petition argues levy on sanitary napkins violates gender equality rights

 
 

He noted that locally manufactured sanitary products have an 18pc sales tax, while imports face a 25pc customs duty on top of sales tax. Even a key raw material, superabsorbent polymer (SAP) pa­­per, is subjected to a 25pc tax, he added.
“By taxing sanitary products, the state is penalising women for a natural biological function,” the counsel argued.
The bench, whoever, questioned the maintainability of the petition in light of the 26th Constitutional Amendment and raised jurisdictional concerns since the respondents, including the Revenue Division, are based in Islamabad. The petitioner’s counsel sought time to address these points.
Barrister Zain Mansoor, Assistant Attorney General, and Barrister Raja Hashim Javed, Assistant Advocate General, appeared on behalf of the federal and provincial governments.
 
 

The court issued notices to the federal government and other respondents to submit their replies within two weeks.
A separate notice, under Order XXVII-A of the Civil Procedure Code, was issued to the Attorney General for Pakistan to respond on the constitutional questions involved.
The matter was adjourned, subject to the petitioner addressing the court’s question of maintainability.

According to the military’s media wing, the terrorists were killed in the district on the night of September 14-15. The ope­r­a­tion was conducted aft­er the “reported presence of terrorists” belonging to the separatist Baloch outfits, it added.
ISPR said the forces eff­e­c­tively engaged the ter­­­r­­o­­rists’ location, five terrorists were killed after aft­er an intense exchange of fire.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained act­ively involved in num­erous terrorist activities in the area,” the ISPR said, adding that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any oth­er terrorists found in the area.
Four killed in Kech
Four alleged militants were also killed in the Kech district.
The Counter-Terrorism Department of the Balochistan police claimed two suspects were killed in Dasht, Turbat, at a crossing of the M-8 motorway.
They were allegedly spotted in the CCTV footage planting an explosive device. The CTD personnel immediately acted and killed the suspects.
Policeman slain
In the Sherani district, an official of the Balochistan Police Constabulary was martyred and two Levies men were injured in the attack on the police and Levies stations on Tuesday night in Mir Ali Khel area of the district. The assailants used heavy weapons, including rockets, to target the personnel from nearby mountains.
 
 

The law enforcement officials immediately took positions and returned fire. “A heavy gun battle continued for over two hours in the area,” Deputy Commissioner Hazrat Wali Kakar told Dawn. He said the attack was repulsed and the militants’ effort to enter the police lines was foiled.
In the exchange of fire, Balochistan Police Constabulary’s Aftabur Rehman, a resident of Muslim Bagh, was martyred, while two Levies personnel were injured in the attack. “One Levies man is missing,” DC Kakar said, adding that the search operation in the area was ongoing.
The assailants set a Levies vehicle on fire, and buildings also sustained damage.
Landmine blasts
In another incident, three civilians were killed and a girl was injured in two landmine explosions in the Dera Bugti district.
Officials said that both incidents occurred in the Lanjo Saghari area of the Sui tehsil. In the first explosion, a woman was killed, while in the second blast, two men were killed.
No one had claimed responsibility by the time this report went to press.

The commitment was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Wednesday. The plan, aligned with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), seeks to enhance maritime cooperation with China while promoting economic connectivity with Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
The framework emphasises infrastructure development, including the expansion of Gwadar Port, completion of Free Zone Stage II, and acceleration of East Bay Expressway Phase II to improve inland accessibility. A key component is the integration of the airport with the port to support multi-modal transit and regional logistics.
The plan also supports the adoption of electronic data interchange systems and smart port technologies to integrate Gwadar with Chinese and international shipping networks. Development of port-related industries, cold storage facilities, and warehousing is part of the strategy to facilitate transshipment and regional trade.

Govt plans strategic leap with port and airport integration

Beyond logistics, the framework outlines initiatives for scientific cooperation, industrial development, and maritime tourism. Proposed projects include joint marine science research centres, CPEC-linked industrial parks for fisheries, shipbuilding and aquaculture, as well as tourism ventures along Balochistan’s coast.
Education and human resource development are positioned as cross-cutting priorities, with proposed academic partnerships and training exchanges between Pakistani and Chinese institutions to develop skilled manpower in logistics, port management, and fisheries.
The plan aligns with the Belt and Road Initiative’s “green energy and ocean” objectives, emphasising sustainable use of marine resources and environmental protection. The minister stated that the 2025-2029 action plan reflects Pakistan’s commitment to building a resilient maritime economy and strengthening strategic maritime ties with China under the CPEC framework.

Soon after Tel Aviv launched its barbaric assault on Gaza, following the Hamas attacks of Oct 7, 2023, there were clear signs that Israel was indiscriminately and purposefully targeting civilians, including children. In the years since, credible voices from around the world have said that what the Zionist state is doing in Gaza amounts to genocide.
The UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry is the latest to endorse this view. On Tuesday, the UN body said that Israel’s leadership, including its prime minister, president and former defence minister “incited the commission of genocide”.
 
 

Many other respectable voices have earlier come to the same conclusion. This includes Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, MSF, UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, as well as the International Association of Genocide Scholars. Israel may dismiss all of this as “distorted and false”, but the evidence against it is damning.
It has also been pointed out that the descendants of those who themselves faced a genocide are today perpetrating a modern-day holocaust. It is a shocking irony that the children of Holocaust survivors should themselves have unleashed monstrous violence on the men, women and youngsters of occupied Palestine.
Some argue that the seeds of the present butchery were sown during the Nakba. But while the events of eight decades ago may be open to historical interpretation, Israel’s holocaust in Gaza is being carried out live, unfolding on our TV and mobile screens. Despite Tel Aviv’s repeated denials, the tiny corpses of Palestinian children murdered by Israel, as well the lifeless bodies of toddlers wasting away due to a man-made famine, are undeniable evidence of the Zionist state’s cold-blooded, inhuman tactics in the occupied territories.
 
 

There should be no more waffling about what is going on in Gaza. Those who raise the slogan of ‘never again’, and keep reminding humanity of the horrors Europe’s fascists unleashed on the continent’s Jewish population, need to help bring to an immediate end the Gaza genocide. In fact, the global community must unite to bring the perpetrators of the Palestinian genocide to justice. The Israeli leadership, as identified by the UN commission, must be tried for crimes against humanity, just as Nazi Germany’s leaders faced the law at the Nuremberg trials.
Moreover, there should be a global, UN-backed arms, economic and diplomatic embargo — along the lines of what apartheid-era South Africa faced — of Israel until it stops its campaign of extermination in Gaza. And if states refuse to cooperate and continue to arm and fund Israel, they must be considered partners in crime with Tel Aviv.

The Pakistan-UAE clash was set to go through on Wednesday after Zimbabwean referee Andy Pycroft apologised to the manager and captain of the Green Shirts after much uncertainty surrounding the fixture in the fallout of the Pakistan-India match last Sunday.
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha at the post-match ceremony said his team hasn’t batted at their best yet.
“We need to bat better in the middle overs… we’re till finding our way to 150+ scores,” Salman said.
Salman called player of the match, Shaheen Afridi a match-winner. The left-arm pacer was adjudicated POTM for his heroics with the bat and his contribution with the ball in what became a comprehensive victory for the Green Shirts.

Match analysis by Abyan Amir:
Shaheen reminded us of his father-in-law yet again with another terrific Afridi cameo that helped salvage the dithering Pakistani batting innings to reach 146-8 at the end of 20 overs, and that was too much for the UAE batters from the get-go.
After all the drama in the lead-up to the match, Pakistan ended with a comprehensive victory in a match they were expected to win with ease and will now face India again with a chance at redemption in the aftermath of the controversy over the  Men in Blue’s “disappointing” conduct in last Sunday’s encounter.
 






Fakhar Zaman reached his 50 off just 35 deliveries and got out trying to up the rate. The Mardan-born player was the Green Shirts’ sole batter who was dominating the UAE bowlers till Shaheen showed up.
The Pakistani batters made for another sorry showing as the home bowlers kept them in check throughout — barring Fakhar and Shaheen.
Simranjeet Singh was the pick of the bowlers for the UAE as he ended with figures of 3-26 and kept the home team in the match going into the second innings.

LAHORE: Following instructions from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Punjab government has announced it will soon be launching a comprehensive damage assessment survey across the 28 flood-hit districts of the province.
The decision to launch the survey was taken in a meeting chaired by Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman at the Civil Secretariat on Wednesday.
The meeting reviewed the ongoing flood relief and rehabilitation efforts in the province and assessed the readiness of the local administrations for the effective distribution of aid, restoration of damaged infrastructure and deployment of health services in the affected areas.
The chief secretary directed the provision of additional tents and food supplies to the flood-stricken communities of Uch Sharif. He instructed the Bahawalpur deputy commissioner (DC) to remain in the field and personally oversee relief operations in the district.
Mr Zaman said a survey would be initiated soon to assess loss of human lives during the flood and the damage caused to houses, crops and livestock.
The DCs have been directed to personally supervise the survey process in the field to ensure transparency and accuracy.
 


The chief secretary also stressed swift drainage of stagnant floodwater, prevention of disease outbreaks, improvement in sanitation and restoration  of road connectivity in the affected areas.
“As water levels recede, water ponding must be cleared without any delay,” he said.
 
 

Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javed brie­fed the meeting that more than 4,500 villages had been affected by recent floods. Over 2,000 teams are being mobilised for the assessment. Families displaced in Narowal, Sialkot, Chiniot, Jhang, Okara, Sahiwal and Sargodha districts have now begun returning home.
The meeting was attended by additional chief secretary, fina­nce secretary and other senior officials from relevant departments. Divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners from across the province participated in the meeting via video link.
Sutlej surging
Meanwhile, water levels in the Sutlej River continued to rise, inundating low-lying areas of Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodh­ran.
Four days ago, the Noraja Bhutta dyke broke, submerging several union councils of Jalalpur Pirwala, including Noraja Bhutta, Basti Lang, Bahadurpur, Dipal, Sundra, Kanu, Jhando, Beetowali and Kotla Chakar.
To save Jalalpur Pirwala city, the district administration carri­­ed out a controlled breach at Gil­­lani Road, diverting water tow­ards villages and kutcha areas.
Floodwaters damaged the Multan-Suk­kur Motorway (M-5) at five points and spread into villages along the highway in Mul­tan, Lo­­dhran and Bahawalpur districts, including Phagal Marhi, Hayat­pur, Jhanmp, Soiwala and Muradpur.
Floodwaters also reached Uch Sharif, submerging nearby settlements such as Jhangra and Basti Mir Chakar Rind. The Multan-Uch Sharif Motorway section has been closed to traffic after severe damage to more than five locations. National Highway Autho­rity (NHA) officials and police are enforcing diversions, with reopening contingent on receding water levels and repairs.
As water receded in Muzaf­fargarh’s Alipur tehsil, authorities recovered nine bodies from submerged areas, all of whom drowned during the flood.
Multan district administration spokesperson Waseem Yousuf told Dawn that while the Chenab’s levels were falling, a major flood surge in the Sutlej was expected to reach Jalalpur within days, threatening adjacent villages in Lodhran and Bahawalpur.
Relief Commissioner Javed said 118 people had died in various flood-related accidents. He said that 4.7 million people across 47,000 mouzas had been affected, with 2.6m people and 2m cattle evacuated. A total of 337 relief camps, 429 medical camps and 368 veterinary camps have been established.
He said that Mangla Dam is 95 per cent full and Tarbela is at full capacity, while India’s Bhakra Dam is 88pc full, Pong 94pc and Thein 88pc.
Punjab PDMA spokesperson said water levels were falling in nearly all major rivers of Punjab, including Jhelum, Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab.
“A low-level flood persists at Panjnad, with water level now at 148,450 cusecs, while Ganda Singh Wala continues to be in a medium flood with water level 95,000 cusecs,” he said.
He said that the water level at Sulemanki Headworks was rising at 88,238 cusecs while Islam Headworks was steady 71,751.
Earlier, Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman said the government will soon begin a survey to assess the flood damage in the 28 flood-hit districts of the province. He was chairing a meeting to oversee rehabilitation efforts and directed relevant authorities to ensure the drainage of water in flood-affected areas and the restoration of roads.
The chief secretary also directed the immediate dispatch of additional tents and rations to flood-affected areas, particularly Uch Sharif in Bahawalpur, instructing authorities to remain present in the field to oversee relief arrangements.
Motorway damage
The NHA said on Wednesday that its teams were working round the clock to restore the damaged section of the M-5 Motorway near Jalalpur Pirwala.
 
 

In a statement, the authority said temporary restoration of one carriageway had been achieved while engineers and experts continued permanent repair work. Federal Secretary for Communi­cations Ali Sher Mehsud and NHA Chairman Shehryar Sultan have been on site to monitor the situation.
Several sections of the motorway were damaged after protective embankments cracked under flood pressure from the Chenab and Sutlej rivers. Traffic remains diverted to alternative highways until full restoration is complete.

• Putin, Modi hail friendly ties amid Trump pressure
BRUSSELS: The European Union’s top diplomat warned on Wednesday that  its push for closer ties with India could be hampered by New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil and involvement in military drills with Moscow.
The 27-nation bloc is pressing to seal a trade deal with the world’s most populous nation and strengthen bonds in areas like defence as US President Donald Trump has rocked the global order.
“Ultimately, our partnership is not only about trade, but also about defending the  rules-based international order,” EU foreign policy chief Kallas said,  as she unveiled a new strategy from Brussels to bolster relations.
“Participating  in military exercises, purchases of oil — all these are obstacles to  our cooperation when it comes to deepening the ties,” Kallas said.
But  she acknowledged the EU did not believe India would “completely  decouple” from Russia and the two sides sought to talk through their  issues.
Alongside other Moscow allies including Iran, India has taken part in Russia’s Zapad (West) joint drills with Belarus this  month, part of which took place close to Nato borders.
India became a major buyer of Russian oil — saving itself billions of dollars  and providing a much-needed export market for Moscow after it was cut  off from traditional buyers in Europe because of the Ukraine war.
US President Donald Trump last week pushed the EU to slap hefty tariffs on  India and China to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the  war.
But EU diplomats say that is unlikely while Brussels chases  a trade deal with New Delhi, although it could take steps against  Russian entities in India as in a previous sanctions package against Moscow.
Despite a lack of alignment over Russia, the European  Union and India are also working to conclude talks on a free trade  agreement by the end of 2025, amid New Delhi’s own tensions with Washington.
 
 

US-India ties have been strained since Trump raised  tariffs on most Indian exports to 50 per cent last month in retaliation  for New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner, with trade between the two economic  giants up 90pc over the past decade, Sefcovic said alongside Kallas in  Brussels.
Senior figures from India and the European Union hope to meet for a high-level summit early next year.
Putin-Modi friendship
Meanwhile, Putin and Modi on Wednesday hailed their friendship and warm relations,  holding a phone call despite pressure from Washington over growing  economic ties between the two.
Trump has bumped up tariffs on  India, which has become a major purchaser of Russian oil, with Western  sanctions imposed on Moscow over its offensive on Ukraine.
The Russian and Indian leaders spoke by phone a day after Modi held talks with Trump on the Ukraine conflict and the tariffs.
“Relations between India and Russia have been exceptionally trustful and  friendly,” the Russian president said in a televised government meeting  after the phone call.
Modi said on X he was “committed to  further strengthening our Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership”  and that India was “ready to make all possible contributions towards a  peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict”.
 






Trump and Ukraine are trying to cut off Russia’s vital energy revenues, which they say  fund Moscow’s army and enable it to keep up with its offensive.

Ambassador Asim Ifti­khar Ahmed, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told a Council meeting on Afghanistan on Tuesday that entities like Al Qaeda, IS-Khorasan, TTP, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and Baloch insurgent groups such as the BLA and Majeed Brigade continue to operate with impunity from across the border.
“We have credible evidence of collaboration among these groups through joint training, illicit weapons trade, refuge to terrorists and coordinated attacks,” he said. More than 60 terrorist camps function as hubs for infiltration, targeting civilians, security forces and development projects inside Pakistan, he added.
The envoy said the threat extended to cyberspace, where nearly 70 propaganda accounts traced to Afghan IP addresses were spreading extremist messaging. “Curb­ing these networks requires full cooperation from social media platforms with governments,” he stressed.
 






Ambassador Ahmed said Pakistan and China had jointly asked the Security Council’s 1267 Sanctions Committee to designate the BLA and Majeed Brigade as terrorist organisations. He urged the Council to act swiftly on the request to curb their terrorist activities.
He also pointed to the TTP, describing it as the largest UN-designated group on Afghan soil with nearly 6,000 fighters. Pakistan, he said, had thwarted multiple infiltration attempts, seizing caches of sophisticated military equipment abandoned by international forces during their withdrawal from Afghanistan. “These efforts come at a heavy price … just this month, 12 Pakistani soldiers were martyred in a single incident,” he noted.
 
 

He said that while four years of Taliban rule had ended decades of civil war, the country remained mired in sanctions, poverty, narcotics and human rights concerns.
He lamented that the UN’s 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan had received only 27pc of its required $2.42 billion.
The envoy reminded the Council that Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for over four decades, often with inadequate international assistance.

• New route opened for Palestinians fleeing the embattled city
• EU proposes curbing Israel trade ties, sanctioning far-right ministers
GAZA CITY: Huge numbers of Palestinians were fleeing Gaza City by any means on Wednesday as the Israeli military pressed its ground offensive, killing dozens in strikes.
The Israeli army said it had struck more than 150 targets in Gaza City since launching a major ground offensive on the Gaza Strip’s main urban hub early on Tuesday.
AFP images showed a steady stream of Gazans heading south on foot, by car and on donkey carts, with their few belongings piled high as Israel bombarded the city.
Israel had announced the day before that the US-backed campaign in the Gaza Strip’s largest city had begun, pledging to destroy Hamas in the area.
The offensive has sparked outrage among the international community, with the Palestinian territory already devastated by nearly two years of war and the Gaza City region gripped by a UN-declared famine.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli fire had killed at least 62 people across the territory on Wednesday.
 


The Israeli military said it was opening a temporary new route on Wednesday to allow people to flee, after unleashing a massive bombardment before dawn on Tuesday and pushing its troops deeper into Gaza City.
It came as a United Nations probe accused Israel of committing genocide in the Palestinian territory, saying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials had incited the crime.
On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it was opening “a temporary transportation route via Salah al-Din Street”, as AFP images showed fresh bombardments.
Its Arabic-language spokesman, Colonel Avichay Adraee, said the corridor would remain open for just 48 hours from midday (0900 GMT).
‘Death is cheaper’
The United Nations estimated at the end of August that about one million people were living in Gaza City and its surroundings.
The Israeli military said Wednesday that more than 350,000 had so far fled south.
But many Gazans say nowhere is safe and have vowed to stay in their homes.
“I won’t leave Gaza. There’s shelling here and there,” said Umm Ahmed Yunes, who is living in her partially destroyed home.
“Where would I find $1,000 or $2,000 for transport costs? Where would I buy a tent? There are no tents and prices are insane,” said the 44-year-old. “Death is cheaper and more merciful.”
Mother of four Fatima Lubbad left Gaza City with 10 relatives but said the ordeal was unbearable. “I wish we would all die together,” said the 36-year-old.
“Last night we slept in the street by the sea in Deir el-Balah — there was nowhere to put a tent… I cried all night as I looked at my children sleeping on the ground.”
In Gaza City’s Shati camp, an Israeli air strike killed four people, including a woman and her child, according to the civil defence agency.
“Enough, we want to be free. We want to live, we don’t want to die, who told you we want to die? Tell Netanyahu: we don’t want to die!” said Mohammed al-Danf, an eyewitness.
EU sanctions
The European Union on Wednesday proposed curbing trade ties with Israel and sanctioning ministers in its strongest action yet over the war in Gaza, though reluctance from key member states risks blocking adoption.
The bloc’s executive, however, said it would take immediate action by freezing some 20 million euros ($23.7m) in support for Israel.
“The horrific events taking place in Gaza on a daily basis must stop,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said.
 
 

“There needs to be an immediate ceasefire, unrestrained access for all humanitarian aid, and the release of all prisoners.” Under its new proposals, Brussels is pressing to suspend the parts of a cooperation deal that allow for reduced tariffs on goods coming from Israel.
The EU also called for asset freezes and visa bans on far-right Israeli government ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich over their “extremist” rhetoric.
Those measures — initially floated by von der Leyen in a speech last week — represent the firmest attempt by the EU chief to pressure Israel.
“Today marks a critical turning point in holding Israel accountable,” said Irish foreign minister Simon Harris.

• PTA policy draft ready, but chief’s legal troubles may delay promulgation
• Draft envisions all user data remaining ‘within Pakistan’; ISPs to block any content when asked
ISLAMABAD: With at least five companies interested in entering the Paki­stani market, the Pakistan Telecommu­nication Author­ity’s (PTA) spadework for launching satellite internet services in the country is almost complete.
However, a final requirement — registration of the service providers with the Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board (PSARB) — has yet to be fulfilled, holding up large amounts of potential foreign investment and stalling high-speed connectivity plans.
In addition, while the PTA’s draft policy for the registration of satellite-based internet providers is also ready to be rolled out, the legal troubles facing its chairman could delay its formal approval.
The policy draft was expected to be approved by the end of this month, but a court order declaring the appointment of the PTA chief illegal may delay its approval, since its notification requires sign-off from the chairman and two other members.
Meanwhile, PSARB sour­ces told Dawn that apart from Starlink and Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Techn­ology Limited (SSST), Eutels­at OneWeb, Amazon’s Project Kuiper, and Canadian satellite company Telesat have expressed their willingness and completed their groundwork for launching services in Pakistan.
 
 

However, the key requirement of PSARB registration remains pending, as the board has yet to finalise its licencing regime.
A senior PSARB official told Dawn that consultations with stakeholders were underway, but the draft registration process for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite providers had yet to be finalised.
The process is expected to take more time, but officials could offer no clear timeframe for how long it might take.
Officials from the IT ministry explained that the main requirement was security clearance of the internet companies in question.
IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja had earlier claimed that satellite internet services would commence by Nov or Dec this year. However, she did not respond to a query regarding delays in the registration process.
A senior executive from one of the aspiring companies told Dawn that the registration process with PSARB was a first step, but establishing the administrative and network infrastructure to provide internet services to end-users would also take time.
Draft policy
The PTA’s draft policy for satellite internet providers envisions prompt compliance with official requests for content blocking, and a commitment to store all data locally.
Under the new “Fixed Satellite Service — Licence” policy, LEO internet service providers will be required to block websites, web content, or other services when directed by the PTA.
These providers are also prohibited from granting remote operational control, network infrastructure access, or monitoring facility access to any foreign entity, government, or person.
All LEO internet providers must install Fixed Gateway Earth Stations within Pakistan, through which all internet traffic will be routed. Similarly, all user data generated, stored, or processed by these services must remain within Pakistan.
While these stations appear to be the method for data control and content blocking, the PTA has faced complications in managing content censorship on social media platforms like X and YouTube in the past, so it remains to be seen how it will regulate satellite internet.
 
 

“The LEO companies provide internet directly to the customers at a fixed point through the satellites, like any Wi-Fi system — but this is fibreless,” a senior PTA official told Dawn.
The policy also permits LEO satellite internet providers to offer “Backhaul Services” to cellular mobile operators (CMOs). This means LEO companies can transmit data from cell towers and base stations to a central or core network for mobile operators, especially in remote areas.
“This will allow the telcos to provide data services in very remote areas also, to their customers, and the LEO companies will not sell mobile based data to the customers,” the official added.
Addressing a key concern regarding potential interference, the policy includes clauses to prevent LEO satellite beams from disturbing geostationary orbit (GSO) satellite beams and other wireless networks within Pakistan’s land, sea, and air jurisdiction.
 
 

GSO satellites orbit at an altitude of approximately 35,000 kilometres, whereas LEO satellites orbit below 2,000 km.
A “Satellite Interference Reporting and Resolution System” (SIRRS) is established within the policy for formal reporting and information exchange regarding international harmful interference affecting space services.
The Frequency Allocation Board (FAB), Pakistan’s designated notifying administration for satellite services at the International Tele­communication Union (ITU), will handle such complaints and reporting.
Beyond an initial license fee of $500,000 (or equivalent in Pakistan Rupees), companies will be required to contribute 1.5 per cent of their annual gross revenue to the Universal Service Fund (USF).

The United Arab Emirates became the casualty as Salman Ali Agha’s men knocked the hosts out of the men’s Asia Cup in the final Group ‘A’ match on Wednesday to book a spot in the Super Four stage.
And surprise, surprise; they have been drawn against archrivals India for Sunday’s Super Four opener, which is expected to be a heated affair after the handshake controversy and Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav’s post-match comments left a bad taste after their seven-wicket win in the first-round fixture between the two teams last Sunday.
 
 

But — despite the off-field noise — can we expect it to be a competitive affair? The simple answer is a big, big NO.
In the group match between the neighbours, it was established that Pakistan have tumbled a league below India in terms of quality and skill. But when they go up against weaker opposition, the boys in green tend to be clinical – especially with the ball.
And they did so against the UAE, bundling Mohammad Waseem’s men out for 105 as they missed out by 41 runs. The margin, however, could have been bigger, and that brings us to our first takeaway.
Saim’s struggles continue
Saim Ayub was meant to be Pakistan’s next big star. A winning century in a One-day International against South Africa last year had consolidated his stakes. But when the time has truly arrived, the southpaw from Karachi has become a face of disappointment.
The 23-year-old registered his third duck in a row on Wednesday – flashing outside the off-stump to lose his wicket against the UAE as well after getting out in a similar fashion against India.
Saim’s shotmaking looks criminally casual as the batter continues to deprive Pakistan of important top-order runs, and with his partner Sahibzada Farhan also failing against the UAE, posting an above-par total became an uphill task for the side, which managed a mere 146
Fakhar should take more responsibility
Unlike the first two matches, Pakistan went with Fakhar Zaman at the one-down position instead of Mohammad Haris, who had shown decent form with a half-century against Oman in the team’s Asia Cup opener.
Even after the second wicket fell, skipper Salman Ali Agha showed up at the crease to confirm that Haris was pushed down to his less preferred number six position. The decision, however, did not backfire, as Fakhar hit a 36-ball 50 at number three.
 

UAE’s Muhammad Zohaib (R) watches the ball after playing a shot as Pakistan’s wicketkeeper Mohammad Haris looks on during the Asia Cup 2025 Twenty20 international cricket match between United Arab Emirates and Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai on September 17, 2025 — AFP

After having settled down on a sluggish surface with three sixes and two fours to his name, the veteran batter played a nothing shot to give away his wicket to Simranjeet Singh. Fakhar remains Pakistan’s man to watch out for in the India match, and given the team’s batting struggles, he has to bat for longer periods in the coming matches.
Salman, Hasan need to show up
Salman, meanwhile, struggled against UAE spinners Simranjeet and Haider Ali —the duo, however, put up a decent show as well on a day when Junaid Siddiqui took four wickets with his right-arm pace.
The Pakistan captain, known to be a good player of spin, and having somewhat proven it in the recent tri-series, looked like he was completely trapped by the UAE bowlers. The right-hander was finding it hard to score singles, let alone score a boundary.
He added only two of them in his agonising 20 off 27, yet again raising questions over his utility as a T20 player.  His misery as captain has been doubled by Hasan Nawaz’s failure to make a mark in this tournament after making a promising start to his career earlier this year.
Hasan was trapped in front for a duck despite expectations to be Pakistan’s lower middle-order basher with this hard-hitting prowess that he showed in the PSL and the following Bangladesh series.
Shaheen the lone warrior
While opener Saim was decent with the ball after his third consecutive duck, tailender Shaheen Shah Afridi outshone most Pakistan batters with the bat down the order.
The left-hander hit clean as a whistle for his unbeaten 29 off 14, which features two brutal hits for six and three fours as Shaheen continued his batting form from the India match. He replicated that impact with the ball as well, registering 2-16 to receive the player of the match award. If he repeats such a performance against India on Sunday, he may well go on to win the blockbuster fixure for Pakistan.</p><small>2025-09-17 20:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624268-huge-historic-experts-hail-pakistans-defence-pact-with-saudi-arabia' target='_blank'><strong>'Huge, historic': Experts hail Pakistan's defence pact with Saudi Arabia</strong></a><br><p>

The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
A statement from the PM’s office announced the signing of the pact during a meeting at Riyadh’s Yamama Palace, which stated that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an act of aggression against both”.
“This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement read.
 






The statement added that the agreement was signed on the basis of the “historic partnership extending for nearly eight decades … based on the bonds of brotherhood and Islamic solidarity, … shared strategic interests and close defence cooperation”, between Islamabad and Riyadh.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the two sides and their delegations reviewed the historic and strategic relations between both countries, along with a number of topics of common interest.
“[PM] Shehbaz Sharif … expressed his sincere gratitude and appreciation to [Saudi Crown] Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud … for the warm welcome and generous hospitality extended to him and his accompanying delegation,” the statement read.
“His Excellency [PM Shehbaz] also conveyed his best wishes for the continued well-being of … King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, [Saudi Crown] Prince Mohammed bin Salman … and the continued progress and prosperity, for the brotherly people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”
In turn, the Saudi crown prince extended warm wishes of good health and well-being to PM Shehbaz, the PM’s office said, adding that he wished for further progress and prosperity for the brotherly people of Pakistan.
Earlier, the pair met at the Yamama Palace for a meeting with the Saudi crown prince on multiple issues of bilateral interest.
The premier was welcomed by the Saudi crown prince and presented with a guard of honour.
 






PM Shehbaz was received by Riyadh Deputy Governor Muhammad bin Abdulrahman bin Abdulaziz upon his arrival in the city, according to a post on X by PTV News.
Another post showed PM Shehbaz and the deputy governor having a meeting.
 






As soon as the premier’s plane entered Saudi airspace, “Saudi Air Force jets escorted and protected it”, state-run PTV News reported.
“This was a gesture of brotherly love and respect by the Government of Saudi Arabia. This honour in the Muslim world is the result of Allah’s blessings, Shehbaz Sharif’s diplomatic skills, and the unparalleled achievements of our Armed Forces.”
 






The Foreign Office (FO) said that PM Shehbaz undertook the visit at the invitation of the Saudi crown prince.
“During the visit, the prime minister will hold [a] bilateral meeting with the crown prince, to review the entire spectrum of Pakistan–Saudi Arabia relations,” the statement added.
 






In its statement, the FO said that both leaders were expected to exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest. “The visit is expected to result in the formalisation of cooperation in diverse fields, reflecting the shared commitment of both sides to further enhance and deepen their longstanding fraternal ties,” it added.
Highlighting the “historic relationship” between the countries, the statement said that the visit will “provide an important opportunity to the two leaders to consolidate this unique partnership, while exploring new avenues of collaboration, for the benefit of the peoples of the two countries”.
The premier was accompanied by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Environment Minister Musadik Malik and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, state media Radio Pakistan reported.
In July, President Asif Zardari met Saudi Ambassador Nawaf bin Saeed Ahmed Al-Malki to discuss ways to enhance bilateral cooperation, particularly in trade, economy and culture. During the meeting, President Zardari invited Saudi investors to explore opportunities in Pakistan.
PM Shehbaz had met the Saudi crown prince on a two-day official visit in June, where he thanked the Saudi leader for his role in ending the conflict between Pakistan and India in May.</p><small>2025-09-17 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/172024258f03fbd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942706/public-accounts-subcommittee-informed-about-theft-of-thousands-of-passports' target='_blank'><strong>Public accounts subcommittee informed about theft of thousands of passports</strong></a><br><p>The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was informed on Wednesday about the theft of thousands of passports from passport offices across the country.
In a meeting of Subcommittee IV of the PAC, chaired by Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Passports Director General Mustafa Qazi revealed that thousands of passports had been stolen from 25 passport offices across the country “in different years.”
“All passports in these cases were blocked,” Qazi said. “They have not been reviewed, nor will they be.”
Audit authorities said in the meeting that 32,600 passports were stolen from passport offices in Abbottabad and elsewhere.
“This is a very worrying matter,” Chaudhry said. “Under the current circumstances, these stolen passports could be misused.”
The Passports DG said, “The Ministry of Interior arrested the foreigners who illegally went to Saudi Arabia from Pakistan. Riyadh has deported Afghan citizens from there.”
Qazi added that after the incident, the passport system will be completely digitised, and auditing authorities noted that a cyber-audit of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) was conducted two years ago.
“Now it has become very difficult to produce fake documents,” DG Qazi said.
The subcommittee instructed DG Qazi to submit an inquiry report.</p><small>2025-09-17 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/172201066c67e92.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942718/us-house-panel-questions-fbis-patel-over-epstein-investigation-files' target='_blank'><strong>US House panel questions FBI’s Patel over Epstein investigation files</strong></a><br><p>FBI Director Kash Patel on Wednesday faced a second day of questioning by US lawmakers, defending his handling of investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein against claims from Democratic and one Republican lawmaker that the FBI is shielding information related to the late financier and sex offender.
Appearing before a US House of Representatives panel, Patel offered a variety of explanations for the Trump administration’s about-face on releasing material on the Epstein investigations.
He argued that court orders prevented the release of some evidence and that in other areas the FBI had limited material in its possession.
“We are releasing as much as legally allowed,” Patel told the House Judiciary Committee.
The Justice Department enraged many prominent supporters of President Donald Trump with its decision in July not to release additional documents from the investigation, after raising expectations for a full disclosure.
Many in Trump’s political base believed his administration would implicate other wealthy and powerful people in Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking of underage girls.
Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a critic of the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein probe and co-author of legislation to require more disclosures about it, said he had been told by alleged victims of Epstein that they had given the FBI information about others who had been involved in Epstein’s abuse.
“We know these people exist in the FBI files, files that you control. I don’t know exactly who they are, but the FBI does. Have you launched any investigations into any of these people?” Massie asked.
Patel replied that the FBI would investigate “credible information” but that he has not received any such information.
 


Patel told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the FBI does not have credible evidence that Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, trafficked women and underage girls to anyone other than himself.
The issue has sparked a rare rift between Trump and his Make America Great Again movement. Trump, a one-time friend of Epstein, has urged his supporters to move on and dismissed the issue as a hoax pushed by his Democratic opponents.
Three federal judges have rejected Justice Department requests to unseal material from grand juries that investigated Epstein and his former partner, Ghislaine Maxwell. Judges found, and prosecutors acknowledged, that the material contained little information that was not already public.
Patel also suggested that other material, including reports of witness interviews, was protected from disclosure by court orders. He told lawmakers the FBI does not have videos that implicate others in Epstein’s alleged crimes.
Patel had boosted claims about Epstein during appearances on conservative podcasts before Trump nominated him to lead the FBI. Democrats accused Patel of seeking to shield information about Trump, who has not been accused of misconduct related to Epstein.
“How did you go from being a crusader for accountability and transparency to being a part of the conspiracy and cover-up?” asked Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.
The Justice Department has begun handing records to the House Oversight Committee, which has subpoenaed material related to Epstein.</p><small>2025-09-17 17:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/17202919fa3968f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942602/andy-pycroft-apologises-icc-expresses-willingness-for-probe-of-handshake-controversy-pcb' target='_blank'><strong>Andy Pycroft apologises, ICC expresses willingness for probe of handshake controversy: PCB</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday said that Zimbabwean referee Andy Pycroft apologised to the manager and captain of the Green Shirts over a controversy during the recent Pakistan-India match.
Uncertainty regarding the national team’s participation in the Asia Cup today emerged after the handshake controversy that unfolded in their match against archrivals India.
The Zimbabwean oversaw Sunday’s politically charged clash with India, after which the victorious India team refused to shake hands with the Pakistan players. The PCB said that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav before the match. Pycroft was scheduled to be the match referee for today’s game as reports coming out from India claimed the ICC had rejected Pakistan’s demand.
A statement issued today by the PCB shortly before the toss between Pakistan and UAE said: “The ICC’s match referee, Andy Pycroft, has apologised to the manager and captain of the Pakistan cricket team.”
It said he termed the Sunday incident “a result of miscommunication and apologised”. The PCB also added that the ICC expressed its willingness to conduct an inquiry into the code of conduct violation that occurred during the match.
 






Addressing a press conference in Lahore shortly after the toss, with former PCB chiefs Najam Sethi and Ramiz Raja, cricket board chairman Mohsin Naqvi reiterated the events of the past few days and said Pycroft had apologised.
“Politics and cricket cannot go together. Let sports remain sports. Cricket should be above all this,” he said, adding that he had requested his predecessors for consultation since any boycott would have been a major decision with input from multiple stakeholders.
“These two specially came and we were constantly monitoring this because we did not even know ourselves what decision would be taken at the last moment. God maintained Pakistan’s dignity as the nation was expecting and I hope that we will now focus on cricket and not on politics.”
He said he had hope from the team of performing in the tournament and called on the people to support them till the end.
“We have a big panel of selectors, which will review and if there is any weakness, I promise that I will sit with them and tell them to remove them,” he said.
 






Sethi also said that politics should not be involved with sports, adding that the PCB had displayed sportsmanship. “I think cricket is the winner and we should continue to play the game,” he added.
Meanwhile, Raja termed the development a “win” since he said the situation had become a “critical” one.
“Emotions were running high and I am happy that an emotional decision was not taken that would have damaged cricket,” he said, adding that the cricket team had to do any “talking” and channel any frustration with its performance on the field.
The Pakistan cricket team was earlier seen leaving their hotel for their Asia Cup match against the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday after Naqvi asked them to depart.
 






The Asian Cricket Council confirmed in a statement that the match would go ahead at 8:30pm PKT.
 






In a statement that came late on Tuesday night, following what Dawn learnt was a meeting involving officials from the board and the government in Islamabad, PCB spokesperson Amir Mir had said in a statement that the board had not made any final decision regarding the Asia Cup.
The PCB correspondence was followed by Pakistan’s decision to not hold their pre-match press conference ahead of their final Group ‘A’ fixture against hosts UAE. The Pakistan team did, however, turn up for practice on the eve of the game.
 
 

Earlier, media reports said the Pakistan cricket team would not play their men’s Asia Cup 2025 match against the UAE.
Geo News reported that the team was given official instructions to return to their rooms, with the team bus parking outside the entrance to unload the players’ equipment.
Footage run by DawnNewsTV showed team staff loading kit bags into a bus outside the players’ hotel, adding that the bus was headed to the stadium.
This is not the first time teams have tried to change a match official in international cricket. India, in a  2001 test against South Africa, tried to have match referee Mike Denness removed, according to a report by Cricinfo.
The Indian and South African cricket boards agreed to remove Denness; however, the decision was not taken by the International Cricket Council (ICC).</p><small>2025-09-17 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1721021291adb7c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942638/trump-begins-historic-state-visit-to-uk-amid-pomp-and-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Trump begins historic state visit to UK amid pomp and protests</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump was treated to a royal reception featuring gun salutes, soldiers on horseback and bagpipes as he met Wednesday with Britain’s King Charles III for a historic second state visit, which unfolded far from marching protesters.
The pair laughed and joked as Trump inspected troops at Windsor Castle, west of London, in an elaborate spectacle featuring a carriage procession designed to play into the mercurial American leader’s love of pomp and pageantry.
Some 120 horses, and 1,300 members of the British military — some in red tunics and gold plumed helmets — feted Trump during a ceremonial guard of honour that United Kingdom officials called the largest for a state visit to Britain in living memory.
The president and First Lady Melania Trump were greeted by heir-to-the-throne Prince William and wife Catherine at Windsor after stepping off the Marine One helicopter under grey skies at 12:15pm (1115 GMT).
Inside a ring of steel and out of sight from thousands of demonstrators shouting anti-Trump slogans in London, William and Catherine then walked Trump and his wife a short distance to meet the waiting Charles and Queen Camilla.
As the president shook hands with the king, a 41-gun salute was fired simultaneously from six World War One-era guns on the castle’s east lawn, as a similar display occurred at the Tower of London, in the centre of the capital.
The Trumps and the royals were then taken in a black and gold coach, surrounded by mounted cavalry, through the Windsor estate towards the nearly 1,000-year-old castle, where Trump and Charles inspected the guard of honour.
The pair were seen sharing smiles, and the president saluted as the US national anthem played, before the royals and their guests headed inside for lunch.
They exchanged gifts, with the royals giving Trump a book to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the US declaration of independence next year, and Trump gifting Charles a replica of President Dwight Eisenhower’s sword.
‘Warm my heart’
Britain is pulling out all the stops to dazzle and flatter the unpredictable Trump as the UK government tries to keep him onside during a host of international crises.
The 79-year-old Republican is, however, being kept far away from Britons as polls indicate he remains unpopular with the public, with the entire visit happening behind closed doors.
An estimated 3,000 people marched through central London waving Palestinian flags and displaying banners with slogans, including “Migrants welcome, Trump not welcome”.
“I’m just scared of the way the world’s being taken over by really nasty men,” Jo Williamson, a 58-year-old funeral director from Kent, southeast England, told AFP.
 
 

Trump is the first US president to receive two state visits, after his previous one with Queen Elizabeth II in 2019.
At Windsor, he laid a wreath on the tomb of Charles’s mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2022, and viewed a collection of US-related items, including a letter sent from president Abraham Lincoln to Queen Victoria in 1862 after the death of Prince Albert.
The president and Charles will wrap up with a white-tie state banquet, where they are due to make speeches.
Trump’s unpredictability on everything from tariffs to Ukraine and Gaza has caused global turmoil and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will be hoping the president leaves on Thursday feeling the warm glow of royal soft power — but there are no guarantees.
Epstein’s shadow
“A lot of things here warm my heart,” the president, whose mother hailed from Scotland and who owns two golf resorts in the country, said on arriving late on Tuesday at the US ambassador’s official residence in London.
The US leader may also relish a chance to escape a turbulent period at home, where the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk has caused deep turmoil.
 
 

But the spectre loomed of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who is providing domestic headaches for both Trump and Starmer.
Police arrested four people after they projected images of Trump and Epstein onto Windsor Castle late Tuesday.
Starmer will host Trump on the second day of the visit on Thursday at his country residence, Chequers.
The pair will be buoyed by the announcement of billions of pounds of investment in each other’s economies, including from British pharmaceutical group GSK and Google, but there could be awkward moments.
Starmer’s government seeks to cement the two nations’ “special relationship”, deepen economic ties, secure billions of dollars of investment, discuss tariffs and press the US president on Ukraine and Israel.
Companies including Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and OpenAI have already pledged 31bn pounds ($42bn) in British investments over the next few years, in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy.
Starmer also wants further progress on trade, after Britain secured the first deal with Trump to lower some tariffs. Talks may touch on remaining levies on steel, whisky and salmon.
“They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit,” Trump said when he left the White House for Britain on Tuesday.
But while Starmer is banking on the unrivalled royal allure helping cajole the Anglophile president, many pitfalls for Britain’s prime minister remain.
Polls show Trump is widely unpopular in Britain and Starmer, faced with plummeting poll ratings of his own and economic woes, will need to show that his royal trump card can reap benefits.
Starmer faces political troubles at home after sacking his UK ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, over his links to the late Epstein.
Awkward questions about Epstein could also come to the fore.
Commuters in the capital had mixed views about the visit, with some angry about the invitation and others saying it was smart politics and a good use of Britain’s soft power.
“We’re looking to sort of make the best of a bad situation,” said lawyer Kirstie Robertshaw, 54.
For Charles himself, the visit might provoke mixed emotions. He has little in common with Trump, from his 50 years championing environmental causes to his efforts to bring harmony between religions and his recent steadfast support for Canada, where he is head of state.
But the occasion will also afford him the greatest global attention since his coronation.
“If it goes well … I think this will go down as the most consequential event in his reign,” said historian Anthony Seldon.</p><small>2025-09-17 16:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1717194609a49d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942648/pakistan-palestine-sign-health-mou-in-bid-to-foster-closer-bilateral-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Palestine sign health MoU in bid to foster closer bilateral ties</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the State of Palestine signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) aiming to “strengthen bilateral cooperation in the health sector”, as part of an effort to foster both nations’ brotherly ties, the Ministry of National Health Services said on Wednesday.
The two countries share strong bilateral ties as Pakistan is one of the few countries that recognises the state of Palestine. Pakistan has reiterated its support for Palestine against Israeli occupying forces at multiple international forums. The country also routinely sends humanitarian aid to Palestine’s Gaza, where Israel continues its offensive.
Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, who signed the agreement on Pakistan’s behalf with the Ambassador of Palestine Dr Zuhair Dar Zaid, remarked during the ceremony: “The purpose of this agreement is to foster closer collaboration for improving the health and well-being of the people of both brotherly nations.”
According to a press release by the health ministry, the ceremony was attended by Secretary of Health Hamid Yaqoob, the additional secretary of health and the director general.
Highlighting the details of the agreement, Kamal said, “A Pakistan-Palestine Health Working Group will be established within the next 30 days to oversee the implementation of the agreement and provide guidance for practical collaboration.”
 






The key areas of cooperation between the two countries under the agreement will focus on “enhancing capacity in advanced medical fields such as interventional cardiology, organ transplantation, orthopaedic surgery, endoscopic ultrasound, burn and plastic surgery”.
“Joint efforts will also be pursued in the fields of infectious diseases, ophthalmology, and pharmaceuticals,” the press release quoted Kamal as saying, adding that “opportunities for collaborative research will be explored.”
Underscoring Pakistan’s commitment to supporting Palestine, Kamal assured the Palestinian ambassador of continued support to “Palestinian brothers and sisters in the field of health.”
 
 

“The hearts of the people of Pakistan beat with Palestine, and we stand ready to assist them in every possible way,” he added.
The Palestinian ambassador, while expressing gratitude towards Pakistan for its continued support, remarked that “Palestine and Pakistan are brotherly countries.“
“Together, we will work for the improvement of [the] health and well-being of our peoples.”</p><small>2025-09-17 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/171634156634f9c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942645/fact-check-viral-video-does-not-show-schoolgirls-in-pain-after-hpv-vaccination' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video does not show schoolgirls in pain after HPV vaccination</strong></a><br><p>Multiple users on X on Tuesday shared a video, claiming that it showed schoolgirls falling sick after being vaccinated. However, the clip is of teargas shelling in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and not linked to the current Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaign against cervical cancer.
A day ago, Abdullah Gul, son of former intelligence chief Hamid Gul, shared a video on X showing girls in school uniforms in a hospital ward appearing sick with the following caption:
“After forced vaccination in schools, several girls fell ill and had to be transferred to the hospital. For God’s sake! Take a clear and firm stance in the matter of your children. All the world’s experiments are always conducted on us poor people. No help for flood victims, but the West is giving free vaccines.”
The post gained over 290,000 views, 2,700 reactions and 1,800 shares.
The post did not provide other crucial information, such as the location and date of the video or specify what vaccine was administered.
The same video was shared with a similar claim by a user on X, who appears to be a PTI supporter based on their past posts and profile picture.
The user referred to a HPV vaccination campaign in the caption:
“Big revelation. In Pakistan, the HPV vaccine is being administered to children. Protect your children from this vaccine. Look at the condition of the girls. Share this video with every household.”
The post gained over 30,000 views
The same video with similar claims was shared by multiple users on X as can be seen here and here and on Instagram as well.
A fact-check was initiated to verify the claim due to its virality, keen public interest in vaccine-related matters and to address the harm of such content.
A reverse image search yielded a YouTube video dated May 9, 2024, with the following title: “Police fired tear gas at girls’ schools in Dadyal”.
 


Dadyal is a tehsil in Mirpur district of AJK.
A keyword search for “tear gas”, “Dadyal” and “school girls” yielded a May 9, 2024, X post by journalist Basharat Raja, who had shared the same video with the following caption:
“This is also a clip from Dadyal where tear gas was excessively used by police and unidentified individuals dressed in civilian clothes on schools, causing female students engaged in annual examinations to faint.”
 






A keyword search to corroborate the incident through credible media outlets yielded a May 10, 2024, news report from leading English publication Dawn titled “Police crackdown in AJK prompts ‘shutter-down strike’ call”.
The report stated that police fired tear gas shells during clashes, and some landed in a school, affecting several girls. The demonstrations were part of a wider movement against high electricity bills and taxes in AJK.
A keyword search to determine whether any vaccination campaigns were underway in Pakistan yielded a World Health Organisation (WHO) article dated Sept 16, 2025, titled: “Pakistan joins 150 countries to protect 13 million girls from cervical cancer with WHO-prequalified vaccine”.
The report stated that the WHO, in collaboration with the Federal Directorate of Immunisation (FDI), launched the country’s first-ever HPV vaccination campaign to protect 13 million adolescent girls from cervical cancer, in partnership with vaccine alliance Gavi and Unicef. It added that Pakistan now joined more than 150 countries that include the WHO-prequalified vaccine in their immunisation schedules.
According to the landing page for the campaign on FDI’s website: “The HPV vaccine is safe, free and effective and girls aged 9–14 years will be vaccinated from September 15-27, 2025, in schools, madrassas and health facilities across Punjab, Sindh, AJK and Islamabad.”
In its announcement of the campaign, Gavi noted that the vaccine has “mild side-effects”, such as pain in the injected part of the body or a low fever that might occur, adding, however, that this was “similar to other vaccines”.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows schoolgirls in pain after being inoculated amid the current HPV vaccination campaign is false. The video shows schoolgirls affected by tear gas shelling in AJK in May 2024, not the HPV vaccine — which is safe and only has mild side effects.

“The police and Levies personnel retaliated, and an exchange of fire went on for three hours,” DC Sherani said in a statement, adding that the retaliation prevented any major damage.
“However, one policeman was martyred during the attack and two Levies personnel were injured, while another Levies official remains missing,” he said.
He added that the deceased was identified as Aftab-ur-Rehman, while the two injured — identified as Kalu Khan and Abdul Wahid — were rushed to the Trauma Centre in Quetta.
“A search operation is underway to look for the assailants. They attacked the police with rocket launchers, snipers, and explosives, damaging the stations’ communication system,” he said.
“The unknown assailants set a Levies vehicle on fire along with another vehicle carrying relief supplies from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).”
There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. In August, three security personnel, including a senior officer, were martyred in an attack in Balochistan’s Mastung district.
Earlier this month, at least five people were killed and 29 were injured in a blast at a rally of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium.
In July, a Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred, and two others suffered injuries when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on the National Highway in the Mastung district.</p><small>2025-09-17 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/171510171802d2e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942642/poison-killed-putin-critic-navalny-wife-says' target='_blank'><strong>Poison killed Putin critic Navalny, wife says</strong></a><br><p>The wife of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said Wednesday that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning while incarcerated at an Arctic prison in February 2024.
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin’s most formidable critic for years, died in mysterious circumstances while serving a 19-year prison sentence on a string of charges widely seen as retribution for his opposition.
The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-got gains of Putin’s inner circle.
 
 

His allies allege he was murdered in prison, and Moscow has never fully explained the causes of his death, saying only that he fell ill while walking in the prison yard on February 16, 2024.
Before he was buried, his wife Yulia Navalnaya said his allies “were able to obtain and securely transfer biological samples of Alexei abroad”.
“Laboratories in two countries came to the conclusion that Alexei was killed. Specifically: poisoned,” she said in a video posted on social media.
She did not divulge details of what samples were obtained nor the results of the analysis, but she urged the labs to independently release their results and to specify which poison they believe was used.
Navalnaya also published unverified photos she said were of his prison cell after his body was removed, showing a pool of vomit on the floor, and claimed that testimony from prison officials said he had been convulsing on the floor.
‘Murder’
Navalny was previously poisoned with a nerve agent of the Novichok type in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering.
Jailed upon his return to Russia in January 2021, he was convicted on a series of charges, including “extremism”.
From behind bars, he continued to campaign against Putin and spoke out against the invasion of Ukraine.
Russian authorities said he died suddenly after falling ill while walking outside after lunch in his prison colony.
Following Navalny’s death, officials refused for days to release his body to his relatives, raising suspicions among his followers.
Navalnaya has maintained that her husband was killed on Putin’s orders, an accusation she repeated Wednesday.
“Vladimir Putin is guilty of the murder of my husband, Alexei Navalny,” she said.
The Kremlin denies the charges.
It escalated a crackdown against his allies and opponents even after his death, adding Navalnaya to a “terrorists and extremists” blacklist and sentencing his lawyers and journalists who followed his court cases to years in prison.
Most of his family and key allies have long lived abroad.
The Russian opposition, plagued by infighting, has struggled for relevance in exile following Navalny’s death.
Public displays of opposition to Putin inside Russia have become exceptionally rare since he invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
The Kremlin introduced military censorship, ramped up its targeting of dissenters and critics and effectively outlawed criticism both of the Kremlin and the invasion.</p><small>2025-09-17 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1713591651e2a03.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942626/three-terrorists-killed-as-police-thwarts-attacks-in-kps-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>Three terrorists killed as police thwarts attacks in KP’s Bannu</strong></a><br><p>At least three terrorists were killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district as the police foiled two attacks, officials said on Wednesday.
Bannu District Police Officer Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com, “Three terrorists were killed in the Bannu operation responding to the attacks,
but the rest of the terrorists fled, taking away the bodies.”
The terrorists launched attacks on the Miryan Police Station and Mazang Checkpoints late at night, according to Bannu police spokesperson Kashif Nawaz.
“Due to the timely and effective response by the police, both attacks were successfully repelled,” he said, adding that four police officers were injured.
He also said that the attack on the Miryan Police Station was thwarted within 20 minutes, while an exchange of fire at the Mazang Checkpoint continued for about an hour.
Bannu Deputy Inspector General of Police Sajjad Khan praised the bravery and timely response of the police in a statement.
“Bannu Police stands firm against terrorists on every front. Protecting the lives and property of the public is our top priority, and such cowardly acts only strengthen the morale of our force,” he said.
Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
Last month, police carried out a search and targeted operation alongside security forces in Bannu, arresting “14 terrorist facilitators“ and destroying “three hideouts”.
In July, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was martyred when terrorists attacked him in Bannu.</p><small>2025-09-17 09:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624149-pakistan-urges-taliban-govt-in-afghanistan-to-cut-ties-with-ttp' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges Taliban govt in Afghanistan to cut ties with TTP</strong></a><br><p>

In a press release, the ISPR said security forces conducted the IBO on the night of 14/15 September on the “reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan”.
“During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the military’s media wing added.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” the ISPR noted.
Sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, according to the ISPR.
“Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the military reaffirmed.
 
 

The operation comes after five security personnel, including an officer, were martyred in an explosion in Balochistan’s Kech district on Monday.
Over the weekend, security forces had killed 31 terrorists in two separate INOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, ISPR said.
On September 12, the ISPR said troops had also killed four “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Balochistan’s Mastung. On September 7, two people were seriously injured in Khuzdar’s Naal area when an improvised explosive device was detonated, police said.
Last month, security forces gunned down 50 terrorists over a four-day operation, foiling an attempt by militants to cross over from Afghanistan into Balochistan.</p><small>2025-09-17 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624134-govt-sees-a-conspiracy-behind-exaggerated-audit-figures-to-target-system' target='_blank'><strong>Govt sees conspiracy behind 'exaggerated audit figures' to target system</strong></a><br><p>
