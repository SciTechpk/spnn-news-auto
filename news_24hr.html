Chinese state broadcaster CCTV and the Xinhua news agency said the call had started.
Trump previewed his talks on Thursday, telling Fox News that they would be discussing “TikTok and also trade”.
“And we’re very close to deals on all of it. And my relationship with China is very good,” he said.
The call was their second since Trump began his second term in January.
On June 5, the US president said Xi had invited him to visit China, and he issued a similar invitation for the Chinese leader to come to the United States.
So far, no travel plans have been made, but several analysts expected Xi to repeat his offer Friday, playing on Trump’s enthusiasm for lavish receptions in foreign capitals.
TikTok
“Each leader will aim to signal that he has outmaneuvered the other” in trade talks focused on tariffs, Ali Wyne, an expert on US-China relations at the International Crisis Group, predicted in a note.
The pair could settle the TikTok drama, after Trump repeatedly put off a ban under a US law designed to force Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell its US operations for national security reasons.
Trump told reporters on Thursday that he hoped to “finalise something on TikTok”.
Under the deal, TikTok’s US business would be “owned by all American investors, and very rich people and companies,” Trump said.
He said he believes TikTok had boosted his appeal to younger voters and helped him win the 2024 election.
The president on Tuesday again pushed back applying a ban on the app, which had been decided under his predecessor president Joe Biden.
The Wall Street Journal raised the possibility of a consortium to control TikTok that would include tech giant Oracle and two California investment funds — Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz.
Tariffs
The telephone talks come as the world’s two biggest economies seek to find a compromise on tariffs.
Both sides dramatically hiked tariffs against each other during a months-long dispute earlier this year, disrupting global supply chains.
Washington and Beijing then reached a deal to reduce levies, which expires in November, with the United States imposing 30 percent duties on imports of Chinese goods and China hitting US products with a 10 percent tariff.
The phone meeting also comes after Xi organised a major summit this month with the leaders of Russia and India — and invited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to observe a major military parade in Beijing.
“Please give my warmest regards to (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un as you conspire against the United States of America,” Trump wrote to Xi on his Truth Social platform.
The US leader slammed India with punitive tariffs for its oil purchases from Moscow, and has called on European countries to sanction China for buying Russian oil, though Washington has not itself sanctioned Beijing.
“If they did that on China, I think the war (in Ukraine) would maybe end,” Trump told Fox News.</p><small>2025-09-19 13:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/191332024318121.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943174/dispute-within-the-ihc-5-judges-petition-supreme-court-over-benches-rosters-case-transfers' target='_blank'><strong>Dispute within the IHC: 5 judges petition Supreme Court over benches, rosters, case transfers</strong></a><br><p>Five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges — namely Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Tariq Mah­mood Jahangiri, Saman Riffat Imtiaz and Ejaz Ishaq — submitted separate petitions at the Supreme Court (SC) together on Friday against a number of issues affecting the court recently, from the composition of benches to rosters to case transfers.
 






The petitions, available with Dawn.com, named the IHC, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and the Federation of Pakistan as respondents and were filed under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
Article 184(3) sets out the SC’s original jurisdiction and enables it to assume jurisdiction in matters involving a question of “public importance” with reference to the “enforcement of any of the fundamental rights” of Pakistan’s citizens.
In their petitions, the judges moved the SC to declare that administrative powers could not be “deployed to undermine or trump the judicial powers” of the high court judges.
They further asked the apex court to declare that a chief justice of the high court was “not authorised to constitute benches or transfer cases” once a high court bench had been assigned a case.
Moreover, the petitions sought the declaration that the chief justice of a high court “cannot exclude available judges from the roster, at will, and use the power to issue a roster to oust judges from performing judicial functions”.
The SC was also urged to declare “that the constitution of benches, transfer of cases and issuance of roster can only be done in accordance with the rules adopted by the entirety of the High Court under Article 202 (rules of procedure), read with Article 192(1) (constitution of high court) of the Constitution”.
The petitioners also asked the apex court to declare that the “decision-making” with respect to the constitution of benches, issuance of roster and transfer of cases could not “solely rest in the hands of the chief justice”.
“Declare that the ‘Doctrine of the Master of the Roster’ has definitely been set aside in Supreme Court decisions,” the petitions read.
The petitions further sought the declaration that formation of IHC’s administration committees through notifications dated February 3  and July 15 and all the actions taken by them “suffer from mala fide in law and are illegal”. They asked the court to set aside these notifications and all actions taken by the administration committees constituted under them for “being illegal and coram non judice”.
Moreover, they stated: “Declare that the adoption and approval of Islamabad High Court Practice and Procedure Rules, 2025, by the illegally constituted administration committee, and its notification without prior approval of the high court is in breach of Article 192(1) and Article 202 of the Constitution, and its subsequent endorsement in September, are illegal and of no legal effect.”
The judges further stated in their prayers that the SC “direct the IHC to provide effective supervision and oversight” over the functioning of the district judiciary, as mandated by the Constitution under Article 203, which states that each high court shall supervise and control all courts subordinate to it.
The petitioner asked the SC to “declare that a high court cannot issue a writ under Article 199 of the Constitution to itself.” Article 199 pertains to the jurisdiction of a high court.
They continued: “A Division Bench of high court is neither vested with jurisdiction to sit in appeal over interlocutory orders of a single bench nor can assume control over the proceedings of a single bench as if it is an inferior court or tribunal.”
An interlocutory order refers to a temporary judgment passed in an ongoing case.
The petitioners requested the SC to declare that a high court judge can only be “restrained from working from performing judicial duties under Article 209 and a writ of quo warranto seeking the removal of a judge from office is not maintainable.”
Article 209 of the Constitution empowers the Supreme Judicial Council to carry out inquiries into the capacity and conduct of Supreme Court and high court judges.
The petitioners concluded their statement by asking the SC to “grant any other relief deemed appropriate in the circumstances of this case.”
Rift within IHC
Today’s development has once again highlighted deep fissures within the IHC, which gained prominence as Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar was appointed as the high court’s chief justice.
The fissures in the high court can be traced back to March last year, when in a startling letter written to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) members, the five IHC judges, along with Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir had accused the country’s intelligence apparatus of interference in judicial affairs, including attempts to pressure judges through abduction and torture of their relatives and secret surveillance inside their homes.
Widespread calls subsequently emerged from various quarters for a probe into the investigation, amid which former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa summoned a full court meeting of the Supreme Court’s judges. After a meeting between CJP Isa and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on March 28, the duo decided to form a commission to investigate the concerns of interference in judicial affairs following the cabinet’s approval. However, former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, who was appointed to head the commission, subsequently recused himself from the matter, leading to the apex court taking a suo motu notice of the issue.
In November 2024, the Supreme Judicial Council, chaired by incumbent CJP Yahya Afridi, who also heads the council, had considered different options concerning the letter and agreed to expand consultations, noting that the code of conduct of judges applies to heads of different institutions as well as judges.
Meanwhile, the 26th Constitutional Amendment was passed in October 2024, bringing many changes, most of which pertain to the judiciary.
Rumours began circulating in December 2024 that the judicial bureaucracy was reportedly planning to bring a judge from the Lahore High Court (LHC) to lead the IHC after the elevation of the then-IHC chief justice.
Traditionally, the senior puisne judge of a high court was appointed as the chief justice, but the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) had introduced new rules to bypass the seniority criterion in light of the 26th Amendment. The JCP had proposed that the chief justice of a high court could be appointed from among the panel of five senior-most judges.
In February 2025, the five IHC judges had formally opposed the then-potential transfer of then-LHC Justice Dogar, warning that his elevation as the IHC chief justice would violate constitutional procedures and judicial norms.
The letter was addressed to CJP Afridi, then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq, LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Sindh High Court Chief Justice Mohammad Shafi Siddiqui and raised serious concerns over the possible transfer.
However, Justice Dogar, who was sworn in as a LHC judge in June 2015, was formally transferred to the IHC on February 1. His transfer, along with those of two other judges, to the IHC had also impacted its seniority list and led to many changes as  Justice Kayani, who was senior puisne jud­ge before Justice Dogar’s transfer, has been removed from the top decision-making committee. Justice Kayani was also stripped of the position of inspection judge of the special courts.
The IHC administration had formally notified Jus­t­ice Dogar as the senior puisne IHC judge of the Islam­abad High Court and also revi­sed its seniority list.
The seniority list is as follows: Justice Sarfaraz Dogar, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Jus­tice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, Justice Saman Rif­fat Imtiaz, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro, Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, Justice Mohammad Asif and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas.
The five IHC judges had then sent a representation to the IHC chief justice and CJP Afridi against placing them down on the seniority list but this was rejected.
Justice Dogar was appointed as the acting IHC chief justice on Feb 13. The next day, he took the oath in a ceremony. All IHC judges were invited, but five of them — the same ones who filed petitions in the SC today — did not attend the ceremony and boycotted it.
Following the development, the IHC went through a major administrative restructuring, which notably reduced the authority of senior puisne judge Justice Kayani — who previously held key decision-making roles — following amendments to the high court rules.
The IHC Administration Com­mittee, previously comprising the chief justice, the senior puisne judge and a senior judge, was restructured to include CJ Dogar and two of his nominees. This reconstitution significantly altered the court’s decision-making authority.
On Feb 20, the five judges had petitioned the SC to restrain Justice Dogar from carrying out his duties as the acting IHC chief justice.
In March, Justice Sattar and Justice Imtiaz had expressed concerns over the demanding of gratuity by the court staff and changes to the rules that stripped the senior puisne judge of his powers.
A subsequent consolidation of all petitions related to ex-PM Imran Khan’s jail conditions apparently widened the gulf among the IHC judges as Justice Ishaq had raised critical questions about the transfer of a case pending before his court.
The tensions simmering among the IHC judges seemingly boiled over on March 21, when three members of the IHC Tribunal — who were replaced earlier this month when the tribunal was reconstituted — declared that neither the acting chief justice nor the president had the authority to dissolve or reconstitute the tribunal without legal justification.
Around the end of March, Justice Sattar had questioned the chief justice’s authority to administratively reassign cases, emphasising that such decisions fell within the jurisdiction of judges and the deputy registrar.
A fresh controversy emerged within the IHC in April over the acting chief justice’s authority to unilaterally transfer cases from single benches to division benches. The move reportedly spar­ked concerns about judicial procedure and administrative transparency.
A division bench comprising Justice Kayani and Justice Ishaq, while upholding an order previously issued by Justice Sattar, had expressed surprise at the recent transfer of several cases without clear legal justification.
The two judges subsequently ruled that the acting chief justice had exceeded his authority by transferring cases from one bench to another, calling for the ambiguity in judicial rules to be addressed through a full court meeting.
Meanwhile, amid the growing concerns among senior IHC judges over the shifting of cases between benches, Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas had issued a judicial verdict reinforcing the authority of the chief justice to assign and reassign cases, backing the top judge’s ex­­clusive role as the “Master of the Ros­ter”.
Ten­sions within the IHC escalated sharply on April 28, as two separate but interlinked proceedings exposed a deepening ‘institutional rift’ over judicial authority, procedural conduct and internal accountability.
Justice Sattar had issued a strongly worded order criticising the registrar’s office for not listing a case related to the removal of the former director general of Malir Development Authority from the no-fly list. The judge had issued the contempt notices to the heads of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Immi­gration and Passport.
However, a division bench comprising Justice Dogar had already suspended the contempt notices after the penalised government officials filed an intra-court appeal. The bench also merged the case with another identical matter. Subsequently, the case was not fixed before Justice Sattar on April 28 as was scheduled.
Justice Sattar had lambasted the deputy registrar (judicial) for what he described as “prima facie defiance” of court orders. He had summoned court officials to explain why the case was not listed before him and also the removal of his prior orders from the high court’s public database.
The case listing controversy escalated in May as two judges accused Justice Sattar of conducting unauthorised proceedings in a stay matter. However, in a dramatic courtroom episode, Justice Sattar had openly challenged the authority of a division bench, rejecting its order suspending his previous directive to remove a citizen’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL).
During the proceedings, the assistant attorney general had presented a copy of the division bench’s interim order, stating that Justice Sattar’s directive had been suspended. However, Justice Sattar had responded that he would continue hearing the case and issue a comprehensive judgement, arguing that the division bench could not lawfully suspend a single bench’s order in such a manner.

Taliban officials have refused to detail why Peter Reynolds, 80, and his wife Barbara, 76, were arrested in February as they were returning to their home.
“We’ve been treated very well. We’re looking forward to seeing our children,” said Barbara, in a red headscarf, standing next to her bearded husband, near a plane on the tarmac of Kabul airport.
“We are looking forward to returning to Afghanistan if we can. We are Afghan citizens,” she added, after Qatar-facilitated negotiations for their release.
The couple were married in Kabul in 1970, and have spent almost two decades living in Afghanistan, running educational programmes for women and children. They also became official Afghan citizens.
When the Taliban returned to power in 2021, the couple remained in Afghanistan against the advice of the British embassy.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi, in a statement posted on social media, said the couple were handed over to the UK’s special representative to the countr,y Richard Lindsay.
“Two British nationals named Peter and Barbara Reynolds, who had violated the laws of Afghanistan, were released from custody today following the judicial process,” Balkhi added.
Images of the couple standing together with Lindsay at Kabul airport before their departure to the Qatari capital Doha were broadcast on Sky News.
“They are very relieved to be going home,” Lindsay told the broadcaster.
The couple were first held in a maximum security facility, “then in underground cells, without daylight, before being transferred” to the intelligence services in Kabul, according to UN experts.
In late July, the independent UN human rights experts called for the Taliban government to free the pair, warning of the “rapid deterioration” of their physical and mental health, stating that they “risk irreparable harm or even death”.
Their family had made repeated pleas about their ailing health after their arrest.
Hamish Falconer, the UK’s minister for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan, said in a statement that he was “relieved… their ordeal has come to an end”.
He added that it was against travel advice for British citizens to visit Afghanistan, warning that the government’s ability to offer consular assistance “is extremely limited”.
Russia is the only country to have officially recognised the Taliban government, which has imposed a strict version of Islamic law and been accused of sweeping human rights violations.
Only a handful of embassies have reopened in the capital after most were evacuated at the end of the NATO-led war against Taliban militants.
Foreign ministry spokesman Balkhi in his statement said that the government “does not view the matters of citizens from a political or transactional angle”, adding that “Afghans, wherever they may be, should also receive consular services”.
 
 

It comes after Washington’s special envoy on hostages, Adam Boehler, made a rare visit on Saturday to Kabul to discuss the possibility of a prisoner exchange.
At least one US citizen, Mahmood Habibi, is held in Afghanistan.
Dozens of foreign nationals have been arrested since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021 following the withdrawal of the US military.
A Qatari official, on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, told AFP that the couple were “safely released from detention in Afghanistan following mediation led by Qatar”.
“The Qataris had been engaged with the Afghan authorities for many months, working in close coordination with the British government,” he added.</p><small>2025-09-19 13:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/19171845f69e8bc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943199/fo-clarifies-that-pak-saudi-defence-agreement-will-not-be-used-to-threaten-any-third-country' target='_blank'><strong>FO clarifies that Pak-Saudi defence agreement ‘will not be used to threaten any third country’</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) said on Friday that the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement signed between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia earlier this week would not be used to threaten any other country.
Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday. On Thursday, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif stated in an interview that the pact was defensive in nature.
During a weekly press briefing today, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan called the agreement “an important milestone for promoting peace and security in the region and the world” and noted that since the 1960s, a key pillar of the ties between Islamabad and Riyadh has been defence cooperation.
“The Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement formalises this decades-old and robust defence partnership,” the spokesperson said. “It is defensive in nature and not directed against any third country. It will contribute to regional peace, security and stability.”
 


Khan added that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received a telephone call from the Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty on Thursday night, congratulating him on the landmark agreement.
“The strategic defence agreement is a milestone in promoting partnership and trust,” the spokesperson said, quoting the Egyptian FM. “Both foreign ministers discussed regional and global issues and emphasised the importance of peace, stability and economic development.”
According to the spokesperson, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia enjoy a “long and distinguished history of brotherhood and cooperation”.
“[The] Pakistan-Saudi Arabia bilateral relationship is unique, enduring and multifaceted,” Khan outlined. “The leadership of the two countries share the common vision to take it to new heights.
“The relationship lives in the hearts of the people of [the] two countries. [The] people of Pakistan have special sentiments for Saudi Arabia, the land of Mecca and Madinah, and they hold the Royal family in high esteem for being the custodian of the holy sites.
Formalising historic ties
Calling the agreement a “historic pact”, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told reporters in London that Pakistan has always maintained an informal defence arrangement with Saudi Arabia, which is the same as the agreement signed on Wednesday.
“It’s premature to say something, but some other countries desire to enter into an agreement of this nature”, Dar said, replying to a question about whether other states will join the pact or ink similar deals. “This was not signed overnight; it has taken several months.
“I believe that both sides are very happy. Let’s be frank: Saudi Arabia has stood with us during difficult times, such as the sanctions. Their support was very relevant and important,” the FM added. “Similarly, during the current crisis since 2022-2023, when we needed IMF (International Monetary Fund) support, Saudi Arabia stood with us.”</p><small>2025-09-19 12:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624521-pakistan-saudi-defence-pact-not-directed-against-any-third-country-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-Saudi defence pact not against any particular country: Foreign Office</strong></a><br><p>

The DG ISPR expressed these views during an interview, which was aired by Pakistani television channels on Friday. According to television channels, the interview was purportedly given to a German media house.
During the interview, the military spokesperson was asked about Army Chief Asim Munir’s visits to the US and whether they had helped with “warming up” relations between Islamabad and Washington.
In his response, Lt-Gen Chaudhry appreciated the US and President Trump’s role in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in May after a four-day escalation. He said, “Over a period of time, we have been able to enhance and amplify on our convergences (with the US) and deftly managed the divergences.”

“There are areas where a lot can be done, there are areas where a lot of engagement can be done,” he said, adding that “Pakistan views its relationship with the US as very important.”
“We don’t think that these relationships have anything to do — or there is either-or with other countries.” At this point, the interviewer interjected him to mention China, with the DG ISPR continuing — following a cut in the video — that “we, at the same time, have very constructive and strategic relationships with China and other countries.”
 
 

He said that there is a lot of “scope” for collaboration between the US and Pakistan on the matter of counterterrorism.
On that note, he expressed satisfaction over the United States’ recent declaration of the Majeed brigade as a terrorist outfit.
Pakistan has proscribed the Majeed Brigade — the terrorist outfit Balochistan Liberation Army’s suicide squad — as a terrorist entity since July 18, 2024.
On the question of Pakistan’s concerns over weapons systems left behind by the US in the wake of its withdrawal from Afghanistan, DG ISPR cited the retrieval of US-made weapons from terrorists involved in the Mianwali airbase attack on 4 November 2023 as evidence.
He said that “we share all this data with the Americans,” adding that “the amount of weapons left behind by the US is huge.”
Quoting a report prepared by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), Lt-Gen Chaudhry said that, “after withdrawal of the United States and NATO forces, more than $7.2 billion worth of US equipment has been left.”
On the issue of strained relations with India, DG ISPR referred to the May escalation, noting that “On May 10, actually the fire ceased — it’s the cease of fire that happened, [but] the conflict endures.”
“Whether it is the Kashmir issue, whether it is state-sponsored terrorism of India, whether it is the rising extremism of Hindutva mentality, rationality that has gripped India —” Lt-Gen Chaudhry said.
Stating Pakistan’s position on the matter, he said, “Pakistan believes that the issues need [a] resolution,” calling for international actors to intervene.
“Especially players like the USA, they must intervene,” he said.
He went on to say: “We have no doubt in our minds in Pakistan that each and every incident of terrorism that happens in Pakistan — behind that is Indian support and its abetment.”
Noting Pakistan’s efforts in curbing terrorism and the frequency of terrorist attacks in the country, DG ISPR highlighted that, “just by the threat that is coming to Pakistan, any sane mind can understand this can not go on without external support.”
 
 

DG ISPR alleged that, “the base of operation that the Indians use is Afghanistan, the whole of terrorism that is being done is executed by the Indians over there.”
“Indians have a playbook of using terror as a tool of state,” he said, claiming that their “main tools” at the moment are terrorist outfits Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and BLA.
On the question of insurgency in the country, DG ISPR denied that such a thing existed, stating, “There is no insurgency in Pakistan; the correct term is terrorist,” he said.
Asked if the grievances of the people in Balochistan are properly addressed, he claimed that out of Balochistan’s total population, only a fraction actually lived in Balochistan, saying that “before talking about the issue, it is important to see how many Baloch are we talking about.”
 
 

Over the issue of missing persons in Balochistan, he claimed that “half of these missing persons are part of BLA.”
He said that several terrorists killed in Balochistan were included in the list of missing persons as well, claiming that there were more missing persons in Sindh and Punjab than in Balochistan.</p><small>2025-09-19 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/191246416ebb06b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943160/ghq-attack-case-rawalpindi-atc-dismisses-plea-against-imrans-appearance-via-video-link' target='_blank'><strong>GHQ attack case: Rawalpindi ATC dismisses plea against Imran’s appearance via video link</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi dismissed on Friday the PTI’s plea that contested the decision to make incarcerated party founder Imran Khan appear in trial proceedings of the General Headquarters (GHQ) attack case via video link.
Imran’s arrest on May 9, 2023 sparked violent protests across the country, during which state buildings and military installations, including the GHQ, were torched and vandalised.
He was expected to attend today’s hearing at the ATC via video link, but his counsel argued before Judge Amjad Ali Shah against this arrangement on the PTI’s application.
For his part, prosecutor Zaheer Shah contended that trial proceedings were transferred to the ATC from Adiala Jail — where Imran is imprisoned — on the Punjab government’s executive order. “The authority to review the executive order lies with the constitutional court,” he added.
He further argued that in 2016, the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended to allow suspects to appear in courts via video link.
Shah also cited Sections 15 and 21 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, saying that they authorised the courts to make “decisions regarding trials”. He added that the government was “not obliged” to give a reason for transferring the trial.
The prosecutor said submitting an application against Imran’s appearance via video link “is tantamount to creating hurdles in the trial and wasting time”. He said it was the defence lawyer’s right to approach the superior court against the notification for transferring trial proceedings from jail to the ATC, but the trial could not be stopped.
During his arguments, Imran’s lawyer, Faisal Malik, said, “We demand fair trial from the court.” He added that a fair trial was conditional upon the accused being physically present in the court.
He informed the ATC that they had received a copy of the provincial government’s notification yesterday, and they would approach the higher court against it.
The judge then asked Malik whether he wanted to present any more arguments on the matter.
At that, the defence counsel sought some time for consultation with his legal team.
The court then adjourned the hearing for half an hour.
When the hearing resumed, the testimony of two prosecution witnesses — Sub-Inspector Saleem Qureshi and Sub-Inspector Manzoor Shahzad — was recorded.
The witnesses presented 13 USB drives containing video clips to the court.
Forty videos of the PTI founder related to May 9 were downloaded, the witnesses said in their statements.
They also presented video clips of others, namely Khadim Khokhar, Shehryar Afridi, Umar Tanveer, Sadaqat Abbasi and Sikandar Mirza, along with clippings from various national newspapers, all of which were saved on the USB drives.
The witnesses said the “digital evidence” was obtained from CCTV cameras installed on Benazir Bhutto Road, Mall Road, Liaquat Bagh and ajoining areas.
Concluding the hearing, the court dismissed the PTI’s plea seeking Imran’s appearance during the proceedings in person and maintained that he would appear via video link, in line with the Punjab government’s notification.
The court summoned 10 more witnesses from the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, the Federal Investigation Agency, the PTI, the Press Information Department, Internal Security and the interior ministry to record their statements at the next hearing, slated for September 23.
Yesterday, a police spokesperson told Dawn that security will be beefed up around the Rawalpindi ATC on Friday during the hearing of the GHQ attack case.
Imran was indicted in the case on December 5 last year. The PTI founder, who has been incarcerated in Adiala Jail since August 2023, was arrested by the Rawalpindi police in the May 9 protest case in January 2024.</p><small>2025-09-19 08:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/19131409b1d5a2d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943171/iran-says-made-fair-proposal-to-avert-sanctions-snapback' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says made ‘fair’ proposal to avert sanctions snapback</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday that he put forward a “fair and balanced” nuclear proposal to European powers to prevent the return of United Nations sanctions on the Islamic republic.
Iran is “introducing a creative, fair, and balanced proposal which addresses genuine concerns and is mutually beneficial,” Araghchi said on X.
He added that the proposal was made on Thursday to Britain, France and Germany — known collectively as the E3 — as well as the European Union.
“Turning this idea into action can be prompt and resolve the respective bottom lines to avert a crisis,” Araghchi said, arguing that “Iran cannot be the sole responsible actor”.
 






The comments were made as the United Nations Security Council was set to vote on Friday on reimposing biting economic sanctions on Tehran over its contested nuclear programme.
Diplomatic sources expect that Iran does not have the nine votes needed to maintain the status quo and prevent the punitive measures from being reimposed by the end of the month.
The E3, signatories to a landmark 2015 nuclear agreement that lifted international sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, claim Tehran has reneged on its commitments under the deal.
The accord was intended to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, a goal that Western powers and Iran’s arch-enemy Israel have long accused it of harbouring, but which it has consistently denied.
Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the deal has been hanging by a thread ever since the United States withdrew from it in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term and reimposed sanctions on Tehran.
The withdrawal prompted Iran in 2019 to begin rolling back on its own commitments, including limiting access to its facilities by inspectors from the UN’s nuclear watchdog.
In June, Israel launched an unprecedented attack on Iran targeting nuclear and military sites, as well as residential areas, and killing more than 1,000 people, including senior commanders and nuclear scientists. Iran retaliated with missile and drone attacks that killed dozens in Israel.
The US briefly joined Israel’s campaign for a series of strikes on key nuclear facilities before a ceasefire was reached after 12 days of war.
Last week, Iran agreed on a new framework for working with the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) after it suspended cooperation following the Israeli and US strikes.
The IAEA has warned that Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed country that enriches uranium to 60 per cent — far beyond the 3.67pc cap set by the 2015 deal, and a short step from the 90pc required for a weapon.</p><small>2025-09-19 08:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624492-atc-rejects-pti-plea-against-imran-khans-video-link-appearance-in-ghq-attack-case' target='_blank'><strong>ATC throws out PTI plea for Imran Khan's in-person appearance in GHQ attack case</strong></a><br><p>

To make themselves small. To cause little havoc when offering opinions outside the narrow fields deemed acceptable — education, medicine, caretaking.
But the world has taught us something the hard way: silence does not bring peace either.
There is an African proverb: “If your mother doesn’t teach you something, the world will.”
And the world is teaching us women, again and again, that the system is not built to listen to us, especially not when we speak with force, confidence, and independence.
A clash in the courtroom
Consider Imaan Mazari, a human rights lawyer in Pakistan, unapologetically outspoken in a courtroom that too often doubles as a boys’ club. Last week, she faced Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, a man entrusted with upholding dignity through the rule of law, who instead subjected her to humiliation.
In open court, Justice Dogar told Mazari to shut her mouth (moun band rakho). He threatened physical violence (jiss din maine pakar lia). He told her husband to rein her in, as if she were a farm animal, the ward of some guardian rather than a full constitutional citizen.
This is not an offhand slight. Neither is it a one-off offence. Justice Dogar has a pattern of dismissing her with comments like, “Why are you so stubborn?” — targeting her person instead of her arguments. But this recent outburst crosses into much darker terrain.
When the moral custodian of a legal system speaks to a woman this way, the insult ricochets beyond one courtroom. It lands on every woman who has ever been told to sit down, lower her voice, stay in her place. Or else.
Often, the men threatening women are vagabonds of some sort. We are all reeling because this comes from a man that the vagabonds should fear.
We have all been told that courtrooms are no place for a woman. But we should not have to hear that from the very people tasked with our protection.
No, we don’t want to leave.
When confronted by women’s groups, Justice Dogar insisted his words to Iman were gracious, merely meant to scold a child. But even by that framing, it reflects a troubling paternalism — one that women have long been forced to resist.
We want to stand up to our uncles, our fathers, our make-shift fathers; the whole lot.
To deny a woman’s intelligence is a form of violence. To neglect her educational expertise is a form of violence.
A legacy of resistance
Imaan Mazari is not small. She stands in a lineage of women like Asma Jahangir — the iconic Pakistani lawyer and activist who fought for those buried under patriarchy and state violence. The world finds it easier to dignify Jahangir now that she is gone. Mazari, alive and forceful, is harder to dismiss. Young, sharp, blisteringly defiant; she is a blinding force field in a landscape still upheld by men who prefer obedience. She prefers equality.
They have tried to punish her before — locking her in jail without the medication she needs to keep her kidneys functioning, counting on her dignity to fracture. She walked out of prison with her head still high. That, too, is why they fear her.
The broader context
What Mazari faced fits within a much larger story. In Pakistan, women’s rights are not merely curtailed — they are structurally undermined. Marital rape is effectively legal. Honour killings persist. Child marriage is jealously defended by powerful religious institutions. Rape survivors are disbelieved and humiliated. Women’s testimony still counts for half a man’s in court.
Mukhtaran Mai. Noor Mukadam. Dr Mahrang Baloch, Imaan’s client, whom she was representing in court the day she was asked to shut up.
Imagine living under laws that over-legislate your existence, simultaneously fearing you, and pitying you, reducing you to a reproductive vessel. If a woman were a car, to use one analogy, she would be denied headlights and an engine — deliberately mutilated.
In that context, every insult hurled at a lawyer like Mazari carries disproportionate weight. Because if the lawyers are silenced, what chance do their clients, the poor, the vulnerable, the disappeared, ever have?
So no. The kind of compliance needed from women in our country is not the nation-building kind of woman our founding mothers were. Imaan is a mouth on legs, and if you ask me, that is far more judge-like than the people she calls “my lord”.
The moral choice
This is not just Pakistan’s story. It is a universal story about how patriarchies function, how power defaults to diminishing women, how “everyday sexism” provides cover for systems of slavery, casteism, ownership, and silencing.
Iman Mazari knew Justice Dogar’s words were not just outbursts; they were claims to authority. She knew they must be resisted. By calling him out publicly on her social media, she broke the cycle of complicity that silence demands. That act alone is worth celebrating.
Because sexism is not just another side of the story. And respect — in law, as in life — must be earned.
What comes next
Pakistan can choose differently. It has shown remarkable willpower when it comes to reshaping skylines with housing societies and concrete developments, often for profit. Yet the more urgent task lies in rebuilding the moral and social foundations of the state.
Justice Dogar, too, has choices. He can approach his office as a servant of law, as a reconciler of fractured social trust between genders. He can help build a country where women are treated as equals under justice: citizens, never subjects.
Or he can continue playing the old patriarch, reinforcing the entrenched patterns of authority that rely on diminishing women’s place in public life.
Pakistan’s women already know this much: they have been the invisible half of its economy, its politics, its homes. They have fought, endured, marched, and still received nothing — no capital, no inheritance, no protection. Just marching orders.
That is why, after centuries of silence, they are no longer whispering.
They will not keep their mouths shut.</p><small>2025-09-19 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624483-citigroup-morgan-stanley-among-bidders-to-advise-govt-on-roosevelt-hotel-p' target='_blank'><strong>Citigroup, Morgan Stanley among bidders to advise govt on Roosevelt Hotel privatisation</strong></a><br><p>

A Senate standing committee recently summoned YouTuber Rizwan Razi, also known as Razi Dada, and grilled him for making derogatory remarks about the people of Sindh. The panel subsequently directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to block his YouTube channel over what it termed “hate speech” against the people of Sindh.
Committee members also questioned how a presenter who appeared on the state-run PTV News could make such remarks on his personal YouTube channel.
In one of his recent vlogs, Razi considered close to the CM made unsavoury, racist remarks.

CM Maryam backs Razi’s apology after PPP terms his remarks a slight to Sindh

However, the Punjab government and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz openly came out in support of Razi, with a social media campaign launched to express solidarity with him.
The PPP strongly objected to the Maryam administration’s stance, questioning how it could support a man who had openly demonstrated hatred toward Sindh and fuelled provincialism.
“It is very unfortunate that the PML-N and the Punjab government have launched a campaign in support of a sick man,” Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon said in a post on Thursday.
He added that this sent a negative message to Sindh, accusing the Punjab government of trying to divert public attention from its poor performance during the floods.
 






PPP Punjab executive member Ahsan Rizvi also condemned the campaign by PML-N-backed X accounts, calling it “absolutely unacceptable.”
“It is regrettable that the PML-N’s social media is supporting a biased YouTuber. Describing someone who engages in blackmail and ethnic prejudice as a journalist is an insult to journalism,” Mr. Rizvi said.
 






The controversy has become a hot topic on social media, with many users urging the Punjab government not to support an “anti-Sindh man” merely because he targets the PML-N’s opponents.
In a statement, CM Maryam Nawaz said that even if Razi had used an inappropriate phrase, he showed “good character” by apologizing with an open heart.
“Those who fuel provincial prejudice and spread hate-filled narratives are never questioned. Rejecting the politics of hatred and the narrative of provincial division is the only way to make Pakistan stronger,” she said.
Punjab Information and Culture Minister Azma Bokhari also stressed that her party had never engaged in the politics of provincialism, nor had it played the river-or-dam card.

• Focus on Middle East may affect scheduled Trump-Shehbaz meeting
• PM heads to London, will attend UN moot on two-state solution
WASHINGTON: With world leaders expected to converge on New York for the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the escalating crises in Gaza and Qatar are reshaping global diplomatic priorities, with significant implications for Pakistan’s engagement with the United States.
In addition to his address at the General Assembly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is also expected to take part in the high-level international conference for the ‘Peaceful Sett­lement of the Question of Pales­tine and the Imple­men­tation of the Two-State Solution’.
The conference, which will take place on Monday, would require the Pakistani delegation to hold close consultations with Arab and Muslim leaders during the UNGA.
At a news briefing this week, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres noted that the 80th UNGA was meeting “in turbulent — even uncharted — waters”.
 
 

The UN chief pointed out that nearly 150 heads of state and government, alongside thousands of officials and diplomats, will participate in this “World Cup of diplomacy” that begins in New York on Monday.
“Palestine is going to be the huge elephant [in the room] in this session of the General Assembly,” said Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour, while explaining how this issue will keep the world leaders busy.
US veto and resolution
On Thursday, Washington reverted to its usual ways as it vetoed a draft Security Council resolution, which would have demanded an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, as well as calling on Israel to lift all restrictions on aid deliveries into the besieged Palestinian enclave.
The text, drafted by the elected 10 members of the 15-member council, would also have demanded the immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all prisoners held in Gaza.
It received 14 votes in favour, but the US used its veto power for a sixth time to come to Israel’s aid.
In a rare move last week, the US had backed a Security Council statement condemning recent strikes on Qatar, though the text did not mention Israel was responsible.
 
 

In another surprising development, Senate Democrats introduced a resolution calling for the US to extend recognition to the Palestinian state.
Although the measure is unlikely to pass the chamber where President Donald Trump’s Repu­blicans have a 53-47 majority, the resolution urges US recognition of a demilitarised Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel.
Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who is leading the effort, said in a statement: “America has a responsibility to lead, and the time to act is now.”
Rescheduled
Islamabad’s proactive stance in condemning the Israeli airstrike on Qatar and its subsequent diplomatic engagements have elevated its profile within the Muslim world, with the recent signing of a mutual defence accord with Saudi Arabia further enhancing its significance in regional security discussions.
In addition, the shifting focus of the UNGA in the wake of Israel’s belligerent actions is also expected to impact meetings scheduled to be held on the sidelines of the summit, as those are now expected to be dominated by hectic diplomacy by Middle Eastern actors. Amidst all this, diplomatic sources in Washington suggested that a proposed meeting between US President Donald Trump and PM Shehbaz Sharif may have to be rescheduled.
While the White House is still interested in the meeting, the intensifying crises in Gaza and Qatar may necessitate a shift in focus, sources said.
President Trump is expected to engage with Israeli and Arab leaders during the UNGA. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already announced that he is meeting President Trump at the White House on Sept. 29, soon after Trump’s consultations with world leaders at the UNGA.
This may mean that the Shehbaz-Trump interaction is confined to the sidelines of the assembly session in New York. Embassy sources, however, say that Islamabad would prefer a full-fledged meeting at the White House, to address bilateral and regional issues.
Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, who has previously met President Trump at the White House, is also expected to accompany PM Shehbaz.
PM in London
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz Sharif arrived in London on Thursday for meetings with senior British officials, ahead of his US trip.
According to sources, the prime minister will remain in London until Sept 21. During his stay, he is scheduled to hold meetings with senior officials and address a gathering of Pakistanis organised by the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation.
Before landing in London, the premier made a stopover in Geneva to meet his elder brother, Nawaz Sharif.
The elder Sharif had arrived in Geneva four days ago for medical treatment, accompanied by his son, Hassan Nawaz, and his physician, Dr Adnan.
Mr Sharif is expected to travel to London on Monday to join the prime minister and his delegation, which includes Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and the prime minister’s special assistant, Tariq Fatemi.

This initiative is part of a broader move towards a cashless economy.
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad briefed the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, outlining the country’s progress in developing a digital payments ecosystem. He discussed the current infrastructure, achievements, and emerging trends, noting that 88 per cent of retail transactions are now conducted digitally.
He added that Pakistan’s digital infrastructure supports 226 million accounts and 46m RAAST IDs across the country. Efforts are ongoing to increase the value of these transactions and improve security, including the introduction of a bank liability framework and a two-hour transaction cooling-off period to reduce fraud.
 
 

Mr Ahmad highlighted the successful launch of Mashreq Bank’s digital operations in Pakistan, which took just 12 months — a rapid timeline compared to the typical five-year rollout elsewhere. He also mentioned that five new digital banks had been granted in-principle approval to operate in the country.

SBP chief says push for cashless economy gains momentum with new initiatives

Despite the progress, the SBP governor acknowledged challenges such as low levels of financial literacy and regulatory gaps. However, he reassured the committee that the SBP was committed to addressing these issues and building a secure, inclusive, and innovative digital payments ecosystem.
MNA Naveed Qamar, chairing the meeting, emphasised the need to expand digital payments and social protection systems, particularly through digital wallets. This would replace branchless banking, providing beneficiaries with direct access to funds and multiple withdrawal options.
Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar briefed the committee on the prime minister’s cashless initiative, which is supported by three subcommittees focused on digital payments innovation and adoption. The committee discussed the roadmap for the initiative, underlining the role of digital financial services in enhancing financial inclusion, transparency, and economic growth.
Separately, Mr Ahmad inaugurated the JazzCash Experience Lounge, designed to showcase various digital payment innovations, including facial recognition payments, palm verification, wearables, and QR code-based transactions.

• Justice Saman Imtiaz defends assuming jurisdiction, says courtroom is a workplace
ISLAMABAD: Two judges of the Isla­m­abad High Court (IHC) have written letters expressing conflicting views over the proceeding on the harassment complaint filed against the chief justice by Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, who was part of the now-defunct committee constituted to examine harassment allegations against IHC CJ Justice Sarfraz Dogar, aligned himself with the top judge, asserting that such allegations did not fall within the ambit of the workplace harassment law.
In a letter, Justice Tahir clarified that the appropriate forum to address such grievances was the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). He maintained that the competent authority had erroneously assumed jurisdiction over the matter, according to sources familiar with the development.
The letter was circulated among judges as well as the chief justice shortly after the IHC administration de-notified Justice Sa­­­­man Rafat Imtiaz as the competent authority.
In a separate letter, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz defended assuming jurisdiction and termed the courtroom a workplace.
She stated that, as the competent auth­o­r­ity under the Protection Against Haras­sment of Women at Workplace Act, she was duty-bound to entertain the complaint.
Although there was no provision for including herself in the inquiry committee constituted to probe the allegations against the chief justice—since Subsection 4 of Section 4 of the Act states: “The inquiry committee shall submit its findings and recommendations to the competent authority within thirty days of the initiation of inquiry”.
Justice Imtiaz pointed out that Subsection 2 of Section 3 states: “The committee shall consist of three members, of whom at least one member shall be a woman. One member shall be from senior management and one shall be a senior representative of the employees or a senior employee where there is no CBA.” She said that in order to meet this requirement she included herself under compelling circumstances.
The episode took a dramatic turn when the IHC administration de-notified Just­ice Imtiaz and replaced her with Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas as the competent authority.
Justice Imtiaz suggested that her successor would complete the unfinished task, reiterating her view that judges could be tried under the Act and that Article 209 did not grant them immunity from such proceedings.
Besides seeking proceedings against the top judge under the Protection Against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, Ms Mazari-Hazir had earlier also moved the Supreme Judicial Council for misconduct proceedings against Justice Dogar. She again approached the judicial council after the IHC administration removed Justice Imtiaz as the competent authority.
The complaints against CJ Dogar stem­med from a heated exchange between the lawyer and the top judge last week.
Dur­ing the hearing, Justice Dogar had warned Ms Mazari-Hazir of a contempt of court case and was reported to have made remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”.

• 2024 was the third straight year with widespread glacier loss across all regions
ISLAMABAD: The water cycle has become increasingly erratic and extreme, swinging between deluge and drought, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), which highlights the cascading impacts of too much or too little water on economies and society.
The State of Global Water Resources report, released by WMO on Thursday, says only about one-third of the global river basins had “normal” conditions in 2024. The rest were either above or below normal — the sixth consecutive year of clear imbalance.
The year 2024 was the third straight year with widespread glacier loss across all regions. Many small-glacier regions have already reached or are about to pass the so-called peak water point — when a glacier’s melting reaches its maximum annual runoff, after which this decreases due to glacier shrinkage.
Since the 1990s, ice loss has been increasing in almost all regions, and it has considerably accelerated since 2000. This is mostly due to regions consistently presenting larger summer melt than winter accumulation after the 1990s. In 2024, glaciers lost 450 Gt of water, which is equivalent to 1.2mm of contribution to global mean sea-level rise.
“Water sustains our societies, powers our economies and anchors our ecosystems. And yet the world’s water resources are under growing pressure and – at the same time — more extreme water-related hazards are having an increasing impact on lives and livelihoods,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.
An estimated 3.6 billion people face inadequate access to water at least a month per year and this is expected to increase to more than 5 billion by 2050, according to UN Water, and the world falling far short of Sustainable Development Goal 6 on water and sanitation.
According to the report, in the past six years only about one-third of the global river catchment area had normal discharge conditions compared to the 1991-2020 average. This means that two-thirds have too much or too little water, reflecting the increasingly erratic hydrological cycle.
In 2024, deviations of river discharge from normal conditions occurred in approximately 60 per cent of the global catchment area. In the past six years only about one-third of the global catchment area was under normal discharge conditions when compared to the 1991–2020 average.
 
 

In 2024, above- to much-above-normal discharge conditions prevailed across Central and Northern Europe and parts of Asia, including Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation.
Major basins such as the Danube, Ganges, Godavari and Indus experienced above- to much-above-normal conditions.  The analysis of groundwater levels includes data from a total of 37, 406 groundwater monitoring stations across 47 countries.
Groundwater levels vary locally due to aquifer heterogeneity and human influences like pumping; still, larger-scale regional trends were observed. In 2024, 38 per cent of studied stations had normal groundwater levels; 25 per cent were below- or much-below-normal and 37 per cent were above- or much-above-normal.
In 2024 river discharge exhibited deviations from normal conditions in approximately 60pc of the global catchment area. With respect to the historical period, the year 2024 was characterised by drier-than-normal conditions in approximately 30pc of the area globally, while conditions in approximately 30pc were normal and in another 30pc they were above normal. In 2024, at the global scale, a smaller basin area was under dry conditions than in 2023, while the basin area under wetter-than-normal conditions almost doubled.

Opposition leaders and critics have alleged multiple times that voting in the world’s largest democracy has been undermined by targeted manipulation of electoral rolls. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has denied all charges.
But in his latest broadside, 55-year-old Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi accused the ECI of withholding key data that could help identify those accused of tampering with electoral rolls.
He accused ECI chief Gyanesh Kumar of “protecting the people who are destroying and attacking the constitution”.
The ECI called the accusations “incorrect” and “baseless”, saying that it had itself filed a police complaint against “certain unsuccessful attempts” to delete voters from rolls.
Gandhi on Thursday unveiled what he called “100 per cent proof” of an attempt to delete thousands of voters in Karnataka state using automated software. He said the ECI had refused to share technical data sought by investigators examining an alleged operation targeting Congress-leaning areas.
The Karnataka criminal investigation department has asked the ECI “18 times in 18 months,” he alleged. “And they are not giving it.”
The allegations come ahead of elections expected in October or November in Bihar, India’s third-most populous state with at least 130 million people.
The opposition alleged the ECI had embarked on a “mass disenfranchisement” exercise, after it gave voters in the state just weeks to prove their citizenship, requiring documents that few possess in a registration revamp.

• Gazans flee bombardment, head south on foot, in vehicles and on donkey carts
• 85 Palestinians killed in strikes, gunfire; Israeli loses four soldiers
GAZA CITY: Israeli tanks and jets pounded Gaza City, the target of a major ground offensive, on Thursday, prompting Palestinians to flee south, where the Israeli military announced the deaths of four soldiers.
AFP journalists and witnesses saw a steady stream of Gazans heading south on foot, in vehicles and on donkey carts — their meagre belongings piled high.
“There is artillery fire, air strikes, quadcopter and drone gunfire. The bombing never stops,” said Aya Ahmed, 32, sheltering with 13 relatives in Gaza City.
“The world doesn’t understand what is happening. They (Israel) want us to evacuate south — but where will we live? There are no tents, no transport, no money.”
Palestinians say the cost of a ride to the south has soared, in some cases topping $1,000.
“The situation is indescribable — crowds everywhere, the sound of explosions, women and men crying and screaming as they walked while carrying their belongings,” said Shadi Jawad, 47, describing his family’s ordeal as they fled their home on Wednesday.
The offensive has sparked international outrage, with the territory already devastated by the war and the Gaza City area gripped by a UN-declared famine. It comes ahead of a planned move by several countries, including France and Britain, to recognise a Palestinian state later this month at the UN.
Israeli tanks were advancing on Thursday in two Gaza City areas that are gateways to the city centre, while internet and phone lines were cut off across the Gaza Strip, a sign that ground operations were likely to further escalate imminently.
Israeli forces control Gaza City’s eastern suburbs and in recent days have been pounding the Sheikh Radwan and Tel Al-Hawa areas, from where they would be positioned to advance on central and western areas where most of the population is sheltering.
“We are scared, but what can we do?” said Bassam Al-Qanou, a displaced man sheltering with around 30 family members in one of countless ragged improvised tent camps along the city’s beach.
At least 85 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes or gunfire across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, most in Gaza City, according to the territory’s health ministry.
Later on Thursday, the Israeli military said four of its soldiers had been killed using an explosive device in Rafah, in southern Gaza.

Speaking at the Sindh Amn March organised by his party in Karachi, the Maulana said there could be no state within a state, but if a solution through dialogue was proposed, then it should be entertained by the authorities.
He, however, said no one had the right to take the law into their own hands. “It’s unacceptable for someone to carry guns, climb mountains and kill whoever they want calling it ‘Jihad’,” he said.
Besides the JUI-F leader, the PTI has also opposed military operations, particularly in KP, where terrorism has seen a spike after the Taliban government came to power in Afghanistan. Recently, PTI chief Imran Khan had also told his party’s chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur in KP to oppose the move.
Maulana Fazl appreciated the defence pact between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. He termed it a positive development for regional stability and a step towards greater unity in the Muslim world.
“We urge both nations to utilise this agreement not just for bilateral gains but for the collective benefit of the Islamic world. This accord should be made effective for the whole Muslim Ummah,” he said.

He made these remarks in a TV show hosted by Gharidah Farooqi. Rana Sana, who is also the PM’s aide on political affairs, said the BISP could not be continued in its current form — it either needed to be wrapped up or be completely revamped.
The PML-N leader suggested ‘Benazir Rozgar Scheme’ or ‘Hunarmand Scheme’ would be a more effective way to provide skills and employment opportunities to its beneficiaries instead of a monthly stipend. He said the matter would be discussed in parliament, adding that even some PPP leaders were also in agreement with this proposal.
He claimed the federal government has been spending a huge chunk of money on the BISP, which he believed to be inappropriate due to the current fiscal crunch. Rana Sanaullah said BISP should not be used to help flood victims as its ‘true spirit’ required that the programme help people achieve self-sufficiency instead of merely providing financial assistance.
A BISP official told Dawn that the PM’s aide had made this statement in his personal capacity and no such proposal was being discussed at present.
On the other hand, the BISP, at a meeting, reviewed plans for a secure, transparent, and accessible payment system for beneficiaries.
 
 

The initiative aims to make financial assistance more secure, transparent, and easily accessible for millions of BISP beneficiaries across Pakistan, said a statement on Thursday.
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman has repeatedly urged the government to extend BISP to nearly three million flood-affected families immediately. A similar demand has been expressed by PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and other prominent party leaders.

• Two FC men injured in Kalat grenade attack
• Suicide bomber strikes convoy near Kech
QUETTA: At least six people lost their lives in a powerful bomb explosion in the border town of Chaman, a suicide bomber targeted a convoy in Kech district, while security forces killed four militants in Khuzdar during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) on Thursday.
Separately, four people, including two Frontier Corps officials, were injured in a grenade attack and firing by unknown armed men in the Mangochar area of Kalat division late in the evening.
Officials said the Chaman blast ripped through a crowded taxi stand near the Pak-Afghan border in the evening, killing four people instantly and injuring two others. The wounded later succumbed to their injuries, raising the death toll to six.
“The explosion took place near makeshift shops,” Assistant Commissioner Chaman Imtiaz Baloch told Dawn. Police and Levies forces rushed to the scene and shifted the dead and injured to the district hospital.
“The blast left bodies mangled and body parts scattered,” eyewitness Asghar Achakzai, a local reporter, told Dawn by phone.
Police said initial investigations suggested explosives had been planted outside the shops at the taxi stand.
 
 

The Balochistan Home Depart­ment confirmed the casualties and ordered an inquiry into the incident.
It asked citizens to cooperate with investigation officials, stressing that the culprits would be brought to justice.
Kech suicide attack
Meanwhile, a convoy travelling from Gwadar to Turbat came under attack in the Dasht-i-Kuddan area of Kech district, around 60 kilometres from Turbat.
Officials said gunmen opened fire on the convoy before a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden pickup into one of the buses.
There was no official word from the local administration or Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) about the incident. It was not immediately clear whether anyone had been killed or injured.
The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack.
Khuzdar operation
Separately, the military’s media wing said on Thursday that security forces killed four militants linked to the “Indian proxy” group Fitna al-Hindustan during an intelligence-based operation in Khuzdar.
“During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in a statement. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the site, it added.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the ISPR said.
Thursday’s attacks come amid a surge in militant activity across Balochistan.
Earlier this week, five militants were killed in Khuzdar. Last week, four militants were also killed during an IBO in Mastung, according to ISPR.
A day earlier, two police stations and a Levies post were targeted in Sherani district, leaving one poli­ce­­man martyred and two Levies personnel injured.

• Aleema says she’ll visit Supreme Court today to inquire about ‘outcome’
• Ex-PM urges CJP to intervene to fix his pending petitions, requests ‘justice in real time’
ISLAMABAD: As PTI leader Imran Khan has been in jail for more than two years, his lawyer Latif Khosa on Thursday approached Chief Justice Yahya Afridi with a letter from the former prime minister detailing his hardships in jail and requesting the swift scheduling of his pending cases.
Mr Khosa handed over the letter to the top judge in a meeting that lasted for more than an hour and later told media persons that the CJP had assured a “positive response” to their plight within 24 hours and also asked them to move a proper application in this regard.
To deliver the letter ‘Denial of Justice and Fundamental Rights — A Call to the Supreme Court’, Mr Khosa had arrived with Aleema Khan, Javed Hashmi and other PTI leaders, but the rest were briefly stopped by the police at the entrance of the Supreme Court. However, they were subsequently allowed to enter the premises and they waited there till the conclusion of the meeting between the CJP and Mr Khosa.
After the meeting, Mr Khosa told reporters that the CJP attentively listened to them and assured them that a policy of presenting any arrested person within 24 hours would be ensured.
Mr Khosa said the CJP had sought the ex-premier’s complaints regarding the conditions in jail in writing and assured that his grievances would be addressed and responded to within 24 hours, Dawn.com reported. He said, “We will inform you about whatever happens in [the next] 24 hours.”
Mr Khosa said he had also expressed “our reservations” about the judiciary to the chief justice and raised the matter of jail reforms. “The CJP has sought suggestions over jail reforms,” he said.
Aleema Khan, the sister of Imran Khan who flanked the lawyer during the media interaction, announced they would return to the apex court on Friday to learn about the outcome of the letter penned by Imran Khan.
‘Door of justice’
In his message to the CJP, the former prime minister claimed the “doors of justice remain closed to him and his wife” and he had to endure “continuous solitary confinement”. The PTI lea­der said he had been facing 300 “politically motivated cases” and requested the CJP for an immediate hearing of his pending petitions before all courts. He also demanded medical treatment facilities for his spouse Bushra Bibi and phone calls to his sons as mandated by the jail manual. “Her health continues to deteriorate, yet her doctor is barred from examining her, let alone provide any treatment,” he said in the letter.
According to the PTI chief, thousands of the party’s supporters were in jail and many, including his nephew, were subjected to military trials in violation of the constitutional protections.
His letter also mentioned the ‘leaked’ Commonwealth report on the Feb 8 elections and said the PTI’s mandate was “stolen overnight”. The letter claimed that the 26th Amendment had been used as a tool to sanctify this mandate theft, while petitions challenging it rem­ained unheard in the apex court.
The letter alleged that the Islamabad High Court chief justice deliberately refused to fix his Al-Qadir Trust – the £190m corruption case – and Toshakhana appeals.
The IHC top judge has allegedly fully abandoned impartiality and reduced the high court to a facilitator of an “unjust and tyrannical campaign” against him and those associated with him. He urged the CJP to direct Justice Sarfraz Dogar to fix critical petitions, including in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
The letter also alluded to the hanging of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Bhutto was hanged in a prison in Rawalpindi on April 4, 1979, whereas the Supreme Court held in 2024 that fair trial and due process requirements were not met. “Just­ice in its truest sense must happen in real time, pyrrhic justice occurs 44 years later,” the letter said.
“I, as Patron-In-Chief of Pakist­an’s largest political party; seek only what the Constitution guarantees: justice, dignity, and equality before law,” the letter said.

Right from the second throw, he had the lead in the men’s javelin final. The highly-anticipated clash of the South Asian titans — Arshad Nadeem and Neeraj Chopra — failed to gain momentum in the sold-out Japan National Stadium that turned its attention to Walcott on his way to winning his maiden world title. 
Walcott’s win, thanks to a season’s best 88.16m throw, was pleasantly surprising but not entirely unexpected given he was ranked fourth in the world coming into the World Athletics Championships. Anderson Peters of Grenada was the favorite for gold after an “unexpected’ 89.53m throw in the qualifiers. Curtis Thompson was another surprise of the night as he took bronze in an event the US hasn’t medalled in since 2007. 
But the burden of expectations was largely on Arshad and Chopra; one an Olympic champion, one the reigning champion, both poster boys for sporting excellence and Pakistan-India rivalry outside of cricket. A brotherly relationship kindled over years of competitions together — Chopra outshining Arshad on every front until Arshad climbed to supremacy with an Olympic gold last year — was snuffed out with the full force of a fire extinguisher that is geopolitical tensions between the neighbouring countries.  
The burden, or at least the need to give back to the country, was evident in the way Arshad, who finished a disappointing 10th with a best throw of 82.75m — two sports behind Chopra, took to social media a few hours after the event. 
“Although I couldn’t achieve the result I had hoped for in the final, I am proud to have represented our nation on the biggest stage,” his statement read. “Your prayers, messages, and encouragement mean the world to me. I know I let you all down, but I promise to come back stronger and work even harder to make you proud.” 
Whether scripted by his PR manager or written sincerely from the bottom of his heart, Arshad’s relationship with the nation has been one of putting Pakistan on the sporting map and only asking for “sab ki duaein [prayers from everyone]” in return. 
That he made it to the final was itself a big deal considering he underwent surgery barely two months ago. Plans to train in the UK this summer were replaced by surgery owing to a persistent calf injury, followed by rehabilitation in London. Having to pull out of two Diamond League meets in August meant he was competing in Tokyo with just one competition this season, the Asian Athletics Championships in May where he took gold. 
Speaking to World Athletics after Wednesday’s heats, Arshad explained that surgery had impacted him practicing his run-up, which is paramount in an event like javelin that can be anyone’s win if you’re not at your A-game. Mentally, Arshad has the tenacity and mindset to “fight till the last throw, that’s what I do best”. But when peak mental and physical performance don’t align, winning gold and shattering records is near impossible. 
“To be honest, I’ve been dealing with an injury since July 4, which affected my preparation and fitness level. Despite this challenge, I gave it my all, and I appreciate the experience,” he continued in his social media post.  
“Thank you for believing in me and supporting me on this journey. I will keep pushing myself to achieve greatness, not just for myself, but for our nation,” he said as he signed off with “love and gratitude”. 
Defending champion Chopra, who was returning to the site of his Olympic triumph, has been suffering from similar injury struggles. 
“I don’t know what happened,” Chopra said. “I had a back issue two weeks ago and I didn’t tell anybody. I was thinking I could still throw far — but no.” 
The men’s javelin final was one of several upsets and triumphs of the night. Four new world champions were crowned in events that have belonged so resolutely to a fiercely elite group of athletes. Reigning champions were dethroned and new ones crowned in an evening made dramatic by rain competing with sweat to drench the athletes. 
Will this be the changing of the guards? A final farewell to veteran athletes like Jakub Vadlejch and Julius Yego, who admitted they’re on the older side of sport now? 
That’s a question that the rest of the field can answer at the next major competition, but Walcott answered it tonight. 
He became Olympic champion at 19, an unexpected intruder at the top of the podium at the London 2012 Olympics. It was the first major disruption of the European-dominated event that Yego — who retired from the final with an injury — continued with his world championship win in 2015 
Walcott’s gold and Peters’ silver, secured with an 87.38m effort, on Thursday night snatched javelin supremacy from the South Asians. What happens next season will finally be a global affair spanning four continents.  
Arshad’s season, however, still isn’t over, as he’s set to compete at the Islamic Solidarity Games in November. And the nation will watch and wait with bated breath again to see if Arshad is back to his best by then.

• IHC moved for conjugal rights of Imran Khan and his wife at Adiala Jail; security around ATC beefed up ahead of today’s hearing           
RAWALPINDI: Despite repea­ted attempts by National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to interrogate PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail, officials have been unable to extract any information as he has consistently refused to meet them.
Meanwhile, a petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission for the former prime minister and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to exercise their conjugal rights while confined in the same jail.
According to sources, a three-member NCCIA team, headed by Additional Director Ayaz Khan, visited the Central Jail Adiala on Thursday for the second time during this week to question the PTI founder about his “X” handle.
However, the sources said Mr Khan told the team to bring his lawyers if they wanted to question him on any matter and refused to participate in the investigation.
The team arrived at Adiala Jail at around 3.30pm and left two hours later empty-handed amid ti­­ght security. The NCCIA launched the investigation after tweets were posted from Mr Khan’s account criticising government officials and the establishment.Earlier, on Tuesday, the same team had visited the Adiala Jail to investigate the PTI founder regarding the ope­ration of his social media account. 
Plea for conjugal rights
Separately, A petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court seeking permission for the former premier Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi to exercise their conjugal rights, while confined in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi.
The petition, submitted under Article 199 of the Constitution, was filed by Shahid Yaqoob, a resident of Islamabad and a supporter of Mr Khan.
The respondents named in the petition include the Chief Commis­sioner Islamabad, the Punjab government, the Inspector General of Prisons Punjab, and the Superin­tendent of Central Jail Adiala.
The petitioner argued that denying conjugal rights violates constitutional protections, international conventions, and previous court rulings. The plea referred to the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the European Conv­e­n­­tion on Human Rights, all of which safeguard the right to family life.
It also cited a 2010 notification issued by the Sindh home department following Sup­reme Court directions, which allo­w­­ed convicted inmates conjugal visits every three months. 
It furt­h­­er relied on the Federal Shariat Co­­urt’s landmark judgement that recognised conjugal rights for prisoners as a fundamental entitlement.
It requested the IHC to order the implementation of SC and Federal Shariat Court directives. 
A police spokesperson said that security will be beefed up around the ATC Rawalpindi on Friday during hearing of GHQ attack case, in which the PTI founder is set to attend the proceeding via video link.

Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday.
Talking more about the deal in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ and whether more Arab nations could become part of it, Asif said: “I cannot prematurely answer this, but I will definitely say the doors are not closed.”
Asif said he had always called for a similar arrangement like Nato since there was greater vulnerability for Pakistan, pointing to the history of the region in the last 40-50 years.
“I think it is a fundamental right of the countries and people here, particularly the Muslim population, to together defend their region, countries and nations.”
He said there was no clause in the agreement that ruled out the entry of any other nation or that Pakistan could not sign a similar agreement with anyone else.
 
 

Asked about whether Pakistan’s nuclear assets were also up for use under the agreement, Asif said: “What we have, our capabilities, will absolutely be available under this pact. But let me say, since Pakistan has become a nuclear state, never has anyone challenged our status of being a responsible nuclear power.”
Asif said Pakistan had always offered its nuclear facilities for inspection and never committed any violation. He added that this is in contrast to Israel, which had not allowed any inspection.
Questioned about whether any attack on one country would lead to the involvement of the other and vice versa, the minister said: “Yes, absolutely. There is no doubt in this.”
He said neither Pakistan nor Saudi Arabia had named or conditioned the implementation of the defence deal with any specific country. “It is an umbrella that has been provided by both sides, that, if there is aggression against any side from any side, it will be jointly defended against and responded to.”
Asif clarified it was not an “aggressive pact” but a defensive arrangement, similar to that of Nato.
He added that Pakistan had also been involved in training Saudi forces for quite a while and the recent development was only a formalised “extension” of all that, adding that it was a positive thing.
“If there is aggression, whether against Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, we will jointly defend against it.”
He said Pakistan had always had talks on the issue with Saudi Arabia, saying the former had always had a large military and air force contingent present in the latter for many decades.
“I think that [pre-existing] relationship has been more defined now and that understanding has been given the form of a defence agreement. This is embedded in the history of our military cooperation and our brotherly relationship with Saudi Arabia.”
Asif also said the protection of the holy Islamic sites in Saudi Arabia was also a matter of a “sacred duty” for Pakistan.
 
 

Questioned about whether the United States was taken into confidence on the matter, Asif said he felt there was no ground or justification for any other third party to be involved in the development.
“This agreement will not be a hegemonic arrangement but a defensive arrangement … we don’t have any plans to conquer territory or attack anyone. But our fundamental right can’t be denied to us and we exercised that yesterday.”
He reiterated that Pakistan could also pursue similar arrangements with other countries.
‘Afghanistan is a hostile country’
To a question about terrorist attacks on security forces, Asif reiterated that Afghan soil is being used to stage acts of terrorism in Pakistan.
“We were swept into two wars in Afghanistan. The US, on both occasions, left the region and we are still dealing with the consequences, be it the Taliban, the TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan), the BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) or anyone else,” Asif said, referring to the Soviet-Afghan War of the 1980s and the US-led International Security Assistance Force mission after 2001.
“People embrace martyrdom daily; this liability emerged due to those two wars,” he added. “The Kabul government is not innocent in this, I am being categorical. Through these people, we are being blackmailed by them.
“I say with no ambiguity: Afghanistan is a hostile country.”
The defence minister added that Afghanistan was the last country to recognise Pakistan and that discussions on terrorism went nowhere.
When asked if Arab states would act in response to Afghan aggression, Asif encouraged it.
“I would not be against it, but how many times have we been there? They are involved in our politics as well, with a party I will not name,” he stated. “This party advocates for these people who have our children’s blood on their hands.
“This is a subject Pakistan should be clear on, and we are very clear.”
Defence deal
According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”.
“[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details.
Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries.
The agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades. Cooperation between the two states dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure, when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram.
In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms.
In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In February, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges.
 
 

The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella, though finer details of the agreement were not made public.
For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider.
For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting the Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time.
Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded. Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkiye and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses.
Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represented Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.</p><small>2025-09-18 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624412-pakistans-global-relevance-rising-says-anwar-ul-haq-kakar-in-london' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's global relevance rising, says Anwar ul-Haq Kakar in London</strong></a><br><p>

Trump is on an official state visit to the UK — his second state trip to Britain — where he signed a technology agreement with Starmer earlier today.
“We’re trying to get it back,” Trump said, referring to Bagram. “It’s one of the biggest airbases in the world; we gave it to them for nothing. We’re trying to get it back.
“One of the reasons we want the base, as you know, is it’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.”
 


Bagram Air Base served as the linchpin for US operations in the rugged country, where the long war against the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies was fought with air strikes and resupply missions from the airfield.
 
 

The historic Soviet-built airstrip was the main base for American forces in Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001, attacks, up until their 2021 withdrawal, which led to a takeover by the Afghan Taliban.
In July 2021, all US and Nato troops left Afghanistan’s biggest air base, signalling the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from the country after two decades of war.
A week after the US withdrawal, Bagram buzzed again with activity as Afghan forces settled into the vast premises, complete with its runways, barracks, control towers and hospital.
Trump, Starmer sign tech deal to seal ‘unbreakable bond’
Before the joint presser, Trump and Starmer signed a huge tech deal, which the British PM hailed as “the biggest investment package of its kind in British history by a country mile”.
Britain’s work in wooing the unpredictable Trump on his second state visit seemed to have paid off as he and Starmer signed the partnership, boosting ties in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and nuclear energy.

Trump said the deal was “very big”, and added of US relations with key Nato ally Britain that, “It’s an unbreakable bond we have regardless of what we’re doing today.”
The deal comes on the back of pledges of £150 billion ($205bn) of investment into the UK from American giants, including Microsoft, Google and Blackstone.
Trump disagrees with UK on recognising Palestinian state
Continuing the press conference, Trump said he disagreed with Starmer over recognising a Palestinian state, speaking following their bilateral meeting.
“I have a disagreement with the prime minister on that score, one of our few disagreements, actually,” Trump said in response to a question during the press conference.
Meanwhile, Starmer said he and Trump agreed on the ultimate aim of peace in the region.
“We absolutely agree on the need for peace and a road map, because the situation in Gaza is intolerable,” he said.

When pressed about reports he was waiting for Trump to leave the country before formally recognising a Palestinian state this weekend, Starmer said: “I made my position clear at the end of July as to the timing, which has got nothing to do with this state visit.
“I’ve discussed it with the president, as you would expect, amongst two leaders who respect each other and like each other and want to bring about a better solution in the best way that we can,” he added.</p><small>2025-09-18 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624392-blast-at-chaman-border-taxi-stand-kills-five-injures-three' target='_blank'><strong>Blast at Chaman border taxi stand kills six, injures three</strong></a><br><p>

Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday.
A military confrontation between India and Pakistan recently occurred in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.
In a statement issued on today’s development, the Indian MEA said: “We will study the implications of this development for our national security as well as for regional and global stability. The government remains committed to protecting India’s national interests and ensuring comprehensive national security in all domains.”
It added that the Indian government was already aware that the development, which it said “formalises a long-standing arrangement between the two countries”, was under consideration.
 






Pakistan and India have fought three major wars since the two countries were carved out of British colonial India in 1947.
After they both acquired nuclear weapons in the late 1990s, their conflicts have been more limited in scale because of the danger of nuclear assets coming into play.
According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”.
“[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details.
