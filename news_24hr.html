The development came after a Wednesday incident when the transgender people and participants of a music programme used “abusive language” against the police over the latter’s bid to stop the event.
The police later launched a crackdown, leading to the arrest of 226 people, including two transgender persons.
 
 

The 11-member committee comprises tehsil president of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl Maulana Abdul Samad Haqqani, religious leader Maulana Abdul Hadi, Gul Nabi Khan, president of Islahi Jirga Maneri Payyan, Bakhtiar Khan, general secretary, Bashir Khan, president, Islahi Jirga Maneri Bala, Gul Rehman, general secretary, Yasir Khan, president of Anjuman-i-Dokandaran, Swabi city, Irsalan Khan, senior vice-president, Zamin Shah Bhutto president of traders Link Road Swabi and two transgender.
Maulana Haqqani said: “We don’t want our youth to get involved in wrong activities and wish to create an environment where everyone earn livelihood with dignity and honour.”
Maulana Samad said the committee wanted transgender persons to leave the district peacefully and earn their livelihood elsewhere because as long as they lived here, music shows would be arranged, negatively impacting youth.
Yasir Khan said that in the first phase, transgender persons would ask peacefully to leave the district and if that act didn’t work, then the district police would be involved for the purpose.
 
 

“We are determined to achieve our target,” he said.
Meanwhile, the transgender persons said in a video message that they respected elders and treated everyone with respect and did not speak against anyone but the circumstances forced them to raise their voice.
They said the explusion would never happen.
They warned elders against taking the law into their own hands and said they respected and followed local norms and values while earning livelihood.
They complained that the people blamed them for their children’s act of watching their performances.
The transgender persons said they were aware of the law and the Constitution and if they were given government jobs, they were ready to stop dancing in functions.
They said that none of transgenders was involved in the sale of ice-drug or liquor but various illegal activities continued in the district, needing attention.
They said elders should look at them from the perspective of humanity as they’re part of the Pakhtun society. Meanwhile, members of the committee said that they were expected to meet in the next few days and would also hold a meeting with district police to discuss a strategy for “expelling” transgenders from the district.

Justice Shah and Justice Sattar have often complained that the CJP has avoided addressing institutional concerns raised by them.
Then there’s the Supreme Court’s Justice Athar Minallah, who has been delivering lectures on ‘judicial independence’ and how the current ‘hybrid regime’ in Pakistan is detrimental to democracy.
As far as Justice Shah and, especially, Justice Minallah are concerned, there is enough in their judicial pasts that their detractors often dig out to make the current dispositions of these judges sound contradictory. But this article is not about that. It is about how the ongoing tensions between prominent judges in the country are a culmination of years of ‘judicialisation’. 
 
 

Judicialisation refers to a condition in which the influence of the courts spills into political and policy-making spheres, or when important public and political matters are largely addressed by the courts. Eventually, the courts begin to intervene in matters that are the domain of politicians and administrators. The political weight of the judges and courts grows at the expense of politicians. This erodes the authority of the elected branches of government. 
When the current ‘hybrid set-up’ in Pakistan formed a ‘Constitutional Bench’ through a constitutional amendment, it justified the move as a means to check the encroachment of the courts in political matters. However, some senior judges, opposition parties and segments of the media saw this as a way to curb the influence of ‘independent-minded judges.’ But according to the government, these judges had become ‘politicised’.

Years of ‘judicialisation’ have expanded courts’ role far beyond adjudication in Pakistan. Letters, lectures and public spats among senior judges now expose how judicial activism, once hailed as judicial independence, risks becoming politicisation and self-aggrandisement

According to the researcher Bakht Munir, the most common form of judicialisation in Pakistan has been the “judicialisation of politics.” This is when judicial verdicts begin to have a decisive impact on a country’s politics. According to Munir, judicialisation of politics in Pakistan has often been about the judiciary working closely with the ‘establishment’ against elected governments. 
 
 

For decades, this form of judicialisation has had a history of legitimising martial laws, and dismissing prime ministers. Munir calls this the “judicialisation of regime change.” But he adds that, after the riotous ‘Lawyers’ Movement’ in 2007 — which forced the reinstatement of ‘popular’ CJP Iftikhar Chaudhry who had been dismissed by the dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf — the judicialisation of politics transformed and became the “politicisation of the judiciary.” 
Due to the overtly political nature of the Lawyers’ Movement, the judiciary transmuted its role and began to directly interfere in political matters (without necessarily being encouraged to do so by the establishment). This form of judicialisation often includes ‘judicial activism’ and ‘judicial populism.’ The removal of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani in 2011 by the then CJP Iftikhar Chaudhry, and Chaudhry’s verdicts against certain major government policies, are examples of how judicial activism can override legislation and acts of the chief executive. 
With the rise of populist politics in Pakistan from 2011 onwards, and especially after 2014, the judicial activism of the Chaudhry era mutated and then merged with old-school judicialisation, when the military establishment (ME) began to shape a new political force in the shape of Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). This, allegedly, saw certain senior judges become part of the ‘Imran Khan Project’ and match the project’s populist nature with an increased show of judicial populism. 
 
 

This was most visible during Justice Saqib Nisar’s tenure as CJP (2016-2019). The controversial dismissal of PM Nawaz Sharif in 2017 by the courts can be seen as an outcome of the merger of the politicisation of the judiciary and old-school ME-backed judicialisation of politics. In some cases, right until the tenure of CJP Justice Umer Atta Bandial (2022-2023), the judiciary went beyond the confines of petitions, by allowing its personal views to influence decisions. 
Interestingly, some segments of civil society, the lawyers’ community and the media view the politicisation of the judiciary and judicial activism as expressions of judicial independence. However, their detractors see judges such as Justice Shah, Justice Minallah and Justice Sattar as leftovers of the highly populist variant of judicialisation that mushroomed during the now-receding era of political populism in Pakistan (2011-2022). 
 


It was an era in which the judiciary indulged in political intervention and policy-driven judicial activism. This included the problematic interpretation of Article 63-A of the constitution, surprise judicial hospital visits, the judicial push for the construction of a dam and the regulation of its fund, disqualification of politicians under Article 62 (1) (f), and the conviction of former PMs Gilani and Nawaz Sharif.
This raised questions about the integrity and working mechanisms of the judiciary as an institution. The practice of including ‘like-minded’ judges in the constitution of the benches, too, triggered questions about the judiciary’s institutional structure, giving the impression of partiality and favouritism.
 
 

According to Professor of Law John Ferejohn, judicialisation imposes substantive limits on parliament’s legislative authority, intruding into the formulation of substantive policymaking. To another professor of law, Muhammad Fahd Amin, through judicialisation, the judiciary establishes its authority as a key player in a country’s politics. This is something the former CJP Qazi Faez Isa tried to address, but he was mercilessly pelted with scathing criticism by those who viewed him to be “too technical” and not “empathetic enough.”
According to the framers of the 26th Amendment in Pakistan’s Constitution — through which a Constitutional Bench of ‘neutral judges’ was formed — this was done to curb the politicisation of the judiciary and judicial activism. It is still too early, though, to comment on the validity of this narrative. But some journalists/vloggers, opposition politicians and activists are fixated on viewing judicial activism as a form of judicial independence and a “struggle for democracy.”
Bakht Munir has a rather interesting take on all this. He wrote that the current form of judicialisation in Pakistan among certain judges is neither forced by political circumstances nor compelled by public opinion. According to Munir, the judicial activism of these judges is driven by “self-proclaimed authority on the pretext of matters of national significance, despite increasing criticism from various quarters and weak jurisdictional justifications.” 
During the politicisation of the judiciary and the resultant judicial activism/populism of the last decade, the judiciary desired that its interferences be broadly publicised in the media and celebrated. Munir saw this as “a tool for self-glorification.”

• Expert says rare surgical procedure is carried out by a few centres in US, Canada
KARACHI: Amidst a constant flow of distressing news emerging from their hometown in flood-hit Multan, Sajid Hussain and his wife Samina find some solace when they look at their son Ayan today without feeling a surge of anxiety.
The five-year-old suffering from a potentially life-threatening heart condition has recently undergone a highly specialised surgery, brightening his chances to live a normal life. 
The successful procedure — performed for the first time in Pakistan — was nothing less than a miracle for the family that has lost four children to the same illness before.
“After a long time, my heart is at peace; he hasn’t fallen ill even for once after the operation,” his mother Samina says, recalling that Ayan earlier used to react to any unpleasant thing by holding his breath, turning pale, and then fainting.
Married to her cousin, 30-something Samina had three stillbirths, too. With three surviving children including Ayan, the family is devastated by the ongoing floods that swept away their house and forced all loved ones to take shelter in relief camps.
“In these desperate times, Ayan gives us hope. We are too happy to see him, without a fear of losing him to the sudden illness,” she says.
While Sajid has been working in Karachi as a labourer since 2009, the family finally moved from their village in Multan to the city in 2023 when someone told them that Ayan could be treated for fainting free of cost here.
Ayan was initially treated at a public sector hospital from where he was referred to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD).
Life with disabilities
At the NICVD, Ayan was diagnosed to have a severe type of heart rhythm disorder that causes fast, chaotic heartbeats.
“He presented to us when he was three-and-a-half-year-old with multiple episodes of fainting and seizures. He has a severe type of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), a type of inherited arrhythmia syndrome,” shares Dr Muhammad Mohsin, who initiated and heads the inherited arrhythmia clinic at NICVD, the first of its kind in the country.
He explains that the heart is otherwise normal (in individuals with heartbeat disorders) but the heartbeat at times becomes fast and irregular and presents with either seizures or sudden cardiac death in young healthy individuals less than 30 years old.
“These are rare conditions but not that rare. For instance, the incidence of LQTS is estimated to be 1:2,500 live births. Consanguinity not only increases the risk (for these disorders) but also can cause the most severe phenotypes of disease as is in Ayan’s case. He is deaf and dumb that is part of the severe phenotype of LQTS.”
According to Dr Mohsin, also part of the team that conducted the surgery, the usual treatment of the heartbeat disorders is medication but if patient has cardiac arrest despite medication than implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) — a battery-powered device that detects and corrects abnormal heart rhythm — and/or surgery is needed.
“Initially, we put the device in but he had recurrent shocks every time his heartbeat became life threatening so we decided to proceed for the surgery known as left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD), which was not done before in Pakistan,” he said.
The surgery, Dr Mohsin pointed out, was considered because Ayan had very frequent shocks from ICD (almost every week up to four shocks in a day) and LCSD would help in reducing the frequency of those shocks.
Uniting for a cause
The LCSD, experts say, aims at reducing the overstimulation of the heart by removing specific nerves on the left side of the spine to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death.
The NICVD collaborated with the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) for the specialised minimally invasive heart surgery costing around Rs600,000. The much-needed financial assistance was met through the AKUH’s patients’ welfare programme and a donor’s support, ensuring that the family didn’t bear the burden.
“The operation went very well. It took us 21 minutes to carry out the procedure for which three incisions were made. The biggest one was 5mm and the other two were 3mm each. A camera was inserted through the [5mm] incision and the other two were used to insert the [surgical] equipment,” says Dr Saleem Islam, senior Paediatric Surgeon and Chair, Department of Surgery at Aga Khan University.
Few centres in the US and Canada, he says, carry out the rare surgical procedure and a lot of homework was done prior to the surgery to ensure its success.
Asked about the challenges faced, Dr Islam said: “The most difficult part was the patient selection. We knew we had to have the right family as this was the first time that we were doing the case anywhere.
“After that, it was the organisation with our anaesthesia colleagues because the anaesthesia part was the challenge too. Overall, what this case represents is how complex medical care has to be delivered by teams of experts in this day and age as no physician or surgeon can provide everything for everybody,” he said.

Entire settlements of Ramzan Mallah, Usman Khaskheli, Urs Mallah, Allah Dino Mallah, Haroon Mallah, Ghulam Mallah, Haji Shahdad Khaskheli, Haroon Khaskheli, and Suleman Mallah have been encircled by water, cutting off their road access to nearby towns. The villagers are now using boats to receive food and other essentials.
As the lake swells with Indus waters, reverse flow has begun, inundating vast tracts of the riverine belt. The Ghar Marhu canal, which irrigated hundreds of thousands of acres through Udero Lal Barrage on the river, was blocked near the GBU dyke last week in a desperate attempt to preempt damage from the rising floodwaters.
But preparedness on ground remained questionable. Near Isa Khaskheli village, the irrigation department has set up only a makeshift hut manned by a few junior staffers.
 
 

A bulldozer stationed on-site stands idle for lack of fuel. During a visit by journalists, the dyke was found abandoned, with no senior irrigation officials in sight.
“The bulldozer has just been parked here for show. It has no diesel,” said the machine’s operator, adding that repeated appeals for fuel had been ignored by the officers concerned.
For villagers in Isa Khaskheli, Basar Khaskheli, Ali Muhammad Khaskheli, and Gheel Mori town, anxiety grows by the day. With their homes under water and escape routes severed, they fear the dyke could collapse in the absence of urgent intervention.
 
 

Local communities demanded immediate action against negligent irrigation officials and deployment of trained staff and resources at the Baghar Ochto dyke to prevent what they warned could become a humanitarian disaster.
Irrigation officials busy strengthening dykes
In Larkana, the officials had foc­us­ed on taking maximum possible measures to ensure the deluge safely passed under Sukkur Barrage and flowed down to the sea with minimum and no damage.
Presently, Moria Loop Bund, New/Old Abad Loop Bund and Hakra Loop Bund managed by Northern Dadu division were declared highly sensitive where irrigation officials were vigilant and busy strengthening the existing structures.
Reports from Naudero on Saturday suggested that the Indus was continuously rising at Burira Ferry point forcing villagers in riverine area to shift to the dykes. As soon as water receded they would return to their dwellings.
A number of few families, who had taken shelter on Larkana-Sehwan dyke near Dodo Sanhari village, complained to this reporter about lack of assistance from the district government.
At Larkana-Khairpur bridge alongside the ‘Palija bund’, floodwater was coming close to the dyke while the irrigation department had temporarily built huts manned with staff to keep an eye on the situation.
A large number of dumpers and trucks loaded with stones were being unloaded at Moria Loop dyke where the river was striking with full force and mounting pressure.
MPA Mir Nadir Magsi had on Friday said the New/Old Abad dyke was highly sensitive. Northern Dadu Division’s superintendent engineer Jamil Sangi, assistant engineer Riaz Abbasi and sub-engineer Nadeem Jaffery told journalists at the dyke on Saturday that work was going on to strengthen the dyke.
This dyke was located four kilometers upstream near the structure of Larkana-Khairpur bridge and was part of Larkana-Sehwan dyke, said Mr Sangi.
The river at this point had created an island and shifted its main current about one mile away from the main dyke while stagnant water was also staying there. The irrigation officials said that main current could at any moment shift, as it all depended on the behaviour of the river.
Sources in the irrigation department disclosed that Japan International Coope­ration Agency (JICA) had committed to strengthen the New/Old Abad dyke. The work would only start once the required studies as per JICA’s criteria were completed, said the sources, adding that two years had passed since the commitment.
The sources said that the dyke was not in good shape and a team of experts from JICA was due to arrive on Monday to visit the site along with the irrigation officials concerned.
Almost all depressions close to the dyke were filled with floodwater but surprisingly the dwellers were still reluctant to leave their houses and move up to the dyke or to safer place.
At Hakra Loop dyke six kilometers from Mohenjo Daro irrigation staff were posted in temporarily built huts. Work on apron and stone pitching was under way from 13/0 miles to 22/2 miles where floodwater struck the dyke. Presently 16/1 mile of Hakra dyke was risky, said the irrigation staff stationed there.
There are five spurs to protect the Hakra Loop dyke however it was seen that residents of riverine area were trying to reach the dyke after wading through stagnant water inundating their land, crops and houses.

Speaking at a session on Adopting Digital Currency and Cryptocurrency in Pakistan: Possibilities and Concerns, organised by the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs (PIIA) on Saturday, Mr Zaidi outlined the risks and opportunities surrounding digital currencies.
He said a law enabling cryptocurrency regulation has been passed and is under discussion in parliament. However, he stressed that digital or virtual currencies, by design, are difficult to regulate.
“Cryptocurrencies flourish because they leave no trail. A currency born unregulated cannot be regulated,” he argued. While the US market has seen widespread adoption, he noted, the difference lies in the freer foreign exchange regime. In Pakistan, commercial banks cannot buy and sell dollars without the State Bank’s permission.

Says Pakistan cannot regulate virtual currencies under current system; nearly 9m Pakistanis hold digital assets

Trust and acceptance
Mr Zaidi estimated that around nine million Pakistanis hold or trade virtual currencies, primarily Bitcoin, a decentralised digital asset where transactions are recorded on a blockchain and issuance is independent of any central bank.
 
 

He added that digital currencies are already being used to settle transactions, including under-invoicing in trade with China, in ways similar to the hawala system. “This is not about being too fast or too slow in adoption. The reality is that our system cannot regulate it,” he said.
He emphasised that all currencies are built on trust, pointing to the US dollar today and the British pound in the past. Similarly, a trusted digital currency could emerge as a medium of payment worldwide.
He suggested that asset-backed cryptocurrencies could, in theory, be issued, but demand would remain weak since unregulated digital assets allow holders to convert black money into white.
Citing examples abroad, he noted that India had formally rejected cryptocurrencies, while in the US, they continue to grow in popularity.
He also linked cryptocurrencies to political debates in the US, claiming that former president Donald Trump’s administration supported them after facing resistance from the Federal Reserve. Mr Zaidi quoted a banker as saying the Trump family earned $2.4bn through virtual currencies during their time in office.
Digitisation versus crypto
While acknowledging Pakistan’s progress in digitising its financial system, Mr Zaidi underlined that crypto belongs to a different domain.
“Digitisation is about documentation and traceability. Crypto thrives on the opposite — anonymity and lack of control,” he said.
Experts at the session noted that the use of virtual currencies in Pakistan is likely to continue growing, particularly as tight foreign exchange controls limit other avenues for cross-border payments.

“During Covid-19 we expanded rapidly, launching four verticals in 18 months instead of one in two years,” he recalled. “Impulse purchases defined that period — snacks, cigarettes, small-ticket items.”
Average order sizes have since increased. Grocery baskets have risen from Rs800-900 during the pandemic to Rs2,000-2,200, while food deliveries average Rs1,200. The blended average per order now stands at Rs1,400-1,500.
“The pandemic was about habit creation. Now we’re working to shift customers from impulse buys to weekly grocery missions,” Mr Peracha said, adding that monthly shopping is still largely done offline.

Online orders move from impulse to grocery top-ups

Food delivery continues to generate about 70pc of the platform’s topline, with groceries contributing the remainder.
 
 

The company is active in 35 cities for food deliveries and 12 for groceries, with dark stores operating in seven. Product assortments are tailored by locality.
A subsidiary of Germany’s Delivery Hero, foodpanda entered Pakistan in 2016. An Economic Impact Assessment by Lahore University of Management Sciences estimates its investment at $100m over the past decade, including €2.3m in kitchen infrastructure. Tax contributions in FY24 amounted to Rs9.76bn.
The company plans to double business in three years by scaling up kitchens, expanding marts through owned and franchised outlets, and broadening its shops platform.
Employment & entrepreneurs
foodpanda’s operations rely on 50,000 registered riders, of whom 17,000-18,000 are active daily. Full-time riders earn Rs48,000-50,000 per month, though fuel and maintenance costs are borne by them. Compensation rates adjust with fuel price swings.
 
 

Female riders remain few, but Mr Peracha recounted examples such as a young woman commuting daily from Sheikhupura to Lahore on a 125cc bike.
Women, however, dominate the home-chef segment. The impact report notes over 7,000 home-based entrepreneurs on the platform, 75pc of them women, earning an average of Rs120,000 per month. About half are first-time earners.
Thin margins
Foodpanda charges an average 25pc commission, with variations depending on order volumes. Restaurants also pay sales tax once revenue crosses the legal threshold. Only 15–20pc of eateries on the platform are currently GST-registered.
Provincial governments have reduced service tax rates for home chefs — to 8pc in Sindh and 5pc in Punjab. Even so, commissions and taxes can consume around 30pc of revenue. With food costs at 30pc, about 40pc remains for other expenses and profit.
Dark kitchens, which share facilities, pay commissions plus rent or a revenue share, depending on volumes.
Coping with internet shutdowns
The company faced a sharp setback in May 2023 when mobile internet was suspended for nearly three days. Foodpanda lost 70pc of its gross merchandise value.
“It wasn’t just us — Daraz, Careem, everyone was hit,” the CEO said.
To adapt, foodpanda shared Wi-Fi passwords of partner restaurants with riders in major cities to keep deliveries going, though the absence of Google Maps made navigation difficult.

• Meets CPC leader Li Shulei; conveys commitment to political, economic, and cultural cooperation.
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness to work with China and other natio­­ns to expand cultural exchanges, strengthen creative industries and promote understanding and a culture of tolerance.
He said culture remained a vital bridge to peace, prosperity, and a shared future for humanity.
The president addressed the Second Golden Panda Awards International Culture Forum in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China, where he highlighted the power of art and culture in uniting people and connecting civilisations.
 
 

The forum was attended by senior Chinese leaders, cultural representatives, artists and international delegates, President Secretariat Press Wing said in a press release.
 






President Zardari underlined that the enduring Pakistan-China friendship stood as a model of mutual respect and cooperation.
As the two countries prepare to celebrate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year, he recalled that this partnership remained not only strategic but also a living testimony of the deep bonds of friendship between their peoples.
He reiterated Pakistan’s full support for China’s vision of civilisational exchange and mutual learning. He also emphasised the significance of the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), and the Global Governance Initiative (GGI), noting their focus on sustainable development, regional stability, and inclusive international cooperation.
 
 

The president underscored the importance of the GGI, which promotes respect for the diversity of civilisations, equality among cultures, people-to-people exchan­ges, and cultural dialogue as a counter to narratives of a clash of civilisations.
He observed that the world was undergoing dramatic changes, and praised China under President Xi Jinping for offering a path of cooperation and win-win solutions instead of confrontation.
He said that he was immensely impressed by how these initiatives served the common values of humanity.
President Zardari congratulated the award winners and appreciated their creativity, noting that such artistic endeavours transcend borders and bring people together through shared human values.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari held a meeting with Li Shulei, member of the Political Bureau and Secretariat of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, and Minister of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee in Chengdu, China.
 






During the meeting, the president emphasised the importance of expanding cooperation betw­een Pakistan and China in political, economic and cultural fields, underlining Pakistan’s commitment to deepening people-to-people contacts and public diplomacy.
He thanked the CPC leader for hosting him in Sichuan and felicitated him and the organisers on the successful holding of the Second Golden Panda Awards International Culture Forum.
 
 

Mr Shulei said that President Xi Jinping had sent his best wishes and greetings to President Zardari and recalled their meeting during the president’s visit in February this year.
He also appreciated President Zardari’s recent article in China Daily, underlining the high regard in which Pakistan’s perspectives were held in China.
He further observed that both he and President Xi highly valued the leadership shown by President Zardari in strengthening the Pakistan-China partnership.

Federal Interior Minis­ter Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday instructed officials to identify suitable land for the new headquarters and sought a master plan for the facilities, according to a statement released after a meeting at the Capital Development Authority.
He emphasised that while identifying the land, the requirements for both headquarters and training facilities should be given special consideration.
The meeting was also attended by Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, the federal secretary of interior, the chairman of the CDA and senior police and constabulary officials.
“The Federal Constabu­lary will be developed on modern foundations with the aim of transforming it into a well-structured and highly effective force,” Mr Naqvi said.
The move follows Presi­dent Asif Ali Zardari’s promulgation in July of the Frontier Constabulary Reorganisation Ordinance 2025, which officially renamed the force.
 
 

The ordinance extends the Federal Constabu­la­ry’s jurisdiction across the entire country, including all four provinces, Isla­m­abad, Azad Jammu and Ka­­shmir, and Gilgit-Bal­tis­tan. Under the new fra­mework, the federal government will appoint the inspector general of the Federal Constabulary.
Each division will also have a wing commander, who will hold a rank eq­­uivalent to a deputy ins­pector general. Further­­more, officers from the Police Service of Pakistan will command the force.
The force’s responsibilities will include riot control, internal security, counter-terrorism and protection services. It will also have powers under the Criminal Procedure Code of 1898, the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997 and the Police Order of 2002.
The federal government will control the force and can deploy the constabulary as a reserve force to support Islamabad police, provincial police and other law enforcement agencies.
The effort to reform the force is not new. In 2018, then-interior minister Ahsan Iqbal said the federal government was considering a proposal to upgrade the Frontier Constabulary to bring the force and incentives for its personnel on par with those of other civilian law enforcement agencies.

Addit­ional District and Sessions Judge Nasruminallah Bal­och has ordered the initiation of proclamation proceedings against Bahria Town founder Malik Riaz and his son Ali Riaz Malik in two cases pertaining to alleged money laundering of the housing giant’s funds abroad.
During Saturday’s hearing, the court adjourned further proceedings aga­inst the real estate tycoon and his son until September 30, while moving to formally declare them as absconder in the cases.
Last week, the same court distributed copies of the challan among three other accused, including retired Colonel Khalilur Rehman, personal staff officer of Malik Riaz, along with Mushtaq and Imran.
 
 

According to court proceedings, Mr Rehman received the challan in person. Mushtaq appeared physically, while Imran’s attendance was marked via video link. Both Mushtaq and Imran are expected to appear in person at the next hearing.
The FIA’s money laundering wing registered the case, alleging that the accused illegally transferred large sums abroad to finance Malik Riaz’s Dubai property project.
The court’s move comes at a time when Mr Riaz is facing mounting legal troubles.
Last month, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar revealed that investigators had found “incontrovertible proof of large-scale money laundering and corruption by Mr Riaz and his company.
He disclosed that the FIA raided Safari Hospital in Rawalpindi, which was allegedly used as a “front office” to conceal cash and records.
According to the minister, hospital ambulances were used to transport money and documents to avoid raising suspicion.
The raid unearthed evidence of Rs1.12 billion in money laundering, while investigators expect further amounts to surface as the probe deepens. Mr Tarar also alleged that Bahria Town’s chief financial officer and finance director were linked to hawala and hundi operators engaged in sending funds abroad. He added that Bahria Town staff attempted to destroy documents during the raid, but investigators managed to seize most of the records.
The minister clarified that the government’s inquiry was focused on Mr Riaz, his family, and company officials, and not on residents of Bahria Town.

The move, announced on Friday, is part of efforts to ensure prudent use of public resources and to rationalise security arrangements in line with official entitlements.
The security regime for serving judges has also been regulated suitably, making it rational and aligned with the entitlements under the rules.
In the same spirit, security for retired judges has also been regulated in accordance with applicable rules, established security protocols and entitlements, including the relevant presidential order that provides lifetime security to retired judges, considering the sensitive nature of their past office and continuing security concerns.
In order to operationalise these security protocols, without conferring any extraordinary benefit, added concession or privilege, a circular has been issued to scale down deployment of force in excess of entitlement, reaffirming compliance with rules, and to facilitate coordination between the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Interior and provincial authorities for implementation.

Private finance mobilised by MDBs for climate action also climbed sharply, reaching $134bn in 2024 — a 33pc increase from the previous year.

High-income states got $51.5bn in support

The report, released by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), said climate finance remains central to MDBs’ efforts to advance sustainable development worldwide. By supporting investments in renewable energy, green cities, clean transport, water and food security, MDBs are helping countries move closer to achieving the Sustain­able Development Goals.
Of the total climate finance last year, $85.1bn went to low and middle-income economies. Climate finance to these countries has more than doubled over the past five years and rose 14pc year-on-year. Of this, $58.8bn, or 69pc, was allocated for climate change mitigation, while $26.3bn, or 31pc, was directed to adaptation.
 
 

Mobilised private finance for climate investments in these economies amounted to $33bn.
In high-income countries, MDBs’ climate finance reached $51.5bn in 2024, of which $46.5bn (90pc) supported mitigation and $5bn (10pc) backed adaptation. Mobilised private finance for climate-related inves­t­ments in these countries stood at $101bn.
 
 

The 2024 climate finance data was compiled by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Deve­lo­pment and includes contributions from the Afr­ican Development Bank, Asian Development Bank,  Council of Europe Develo­pment Bank, European Inve­stment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank Group, Islamic Development Bank, New Development Bank and World Bank Group.

• Netanyahu says getting rid of Hamas key to deal on ending war
GAZA CITY: Israeli air strikes hit two UN schools sheltering displaced Palestinians in Gaza City with more than 40 people killed since dawn on Saturday throughout the war-battered Strip, Al Jazeera reported.
Gaza’s Government Media Office says more than 1.3 million Palestinians, including 350,000 children, remain in Gaza City and the north, despite Israel’s relentless bombardment and forced evacuation orders.
Israeli forces fired artillery shells and smoke bombs at the al-Nafaq and Yarmouk areas.
In August, Israel announced plans for a military takeover and occupation of the largest city in the enclave, where about 1.3 million Palestinians are currently sheltering in fear and without water, food and medicine.
Three Israeli air strikes targeted the public prosecution building, southwest of Gaza City, Al Jazeera reported.
Israeli forces destroyed one residential tower, three shelters and more than 20 buildings since the morning.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged on Saturday that getting rid of Hamas chiefs living in Qatar would remove the main obstacle to releasing all prisoners and ending the war in Gaza. Israel on Tuesday targeted the Hamas leadership in Doha.
The Israeli military also said on Saturday that more than 250,000 people had fled Gaza City since it began intensifying operations there, as Palestinian officials reported many had been unable to evacuate south due to overcrowding.
The United Nations estimated in late August that about one million Palestinians lived in and around Gaza’s largest urban centre, where it said a famine was unfolding after months of worsening conditions.
The world body and members of the international community have urged the military to abandon its plans to capture the city, warning the assault and ensuing displacement could worsen the already dire humanitarian situation.
 
 

On Saturday, Arabic-language army spokesman Avichay Adraee said on X that “more than a quarter of a million residents of Gaza City have moved out of the city for their own safety”.
Gaza’s civil defence agency, however, reported a much lower figure, saying fewer than 70,000 had managed to leave.
The Israeli military dropped leaflets on Saturday urging residents in western districts to evacuate, as the civil defence reported continuous air strikes.
“The Israeli army is operating with very intense force in your area and is determined to dismantle and defeat Hamas,” the leaflets read, urging people to evacuate south. “You have been warned.”
Mohammad Abu Salmiya, head of the Al-Shifa medical complex, told AFP that displacement was continuing inside Gaza City, with residents moving from east to west, but “only a small number of people have been able to reach the south”.
“Even those who manage to flee south often find no place to stay, as Al-Mawasi and Deir al-Balah are overcrowded,” the senior official said, adding many had returned to Gaza City.
South ‘not safe either’
“The actual number of displaced people from Gaza to the south is approximately 68,000 only,” civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.
“Many residents are still holding their ground, and many others cannot find space in the south.” Bakri Diab, who fled western Gaza City for the south, said Israeli strikes continued there as well.
“Bombing happens here too — the south isn’t safe either,” said the 35-year-old father of four. “All the occupation has done is force people to crowd into places with no basic services and no safety.”
Israel has come under mounting international pressure to halt its Gaza City offensive, but says it is determined to dismantle what it describes as one of Hamas’s last strongholds.

He knew exactly what to say.
“There’s no such message to the players,” he responded when asked at the Asia Cup captains’ press conference if he had instructed his men to keep their cool against India on Sunday — their first meeting since the brief armed conflict between the two countries in May.
“My players are more than welcome to show aggression whenever they want,” Salman went on. “As far as it remains within the field.”
It was a breath of fresh air for Pakistan cricket fans — both casuals and diehards. Honesty, assertiveness and an unapologetic tone have defined Salman’s early days as Pakistan’s Twenty20 International captain. His arrival has coincided with Mike Hesson’s appointment as white-ball head coach, and together they’ve tried to instil a structure long missing from Pakistan cricket.
“Salman’s appointment as Pakistan’s captain has raised expectations,” Ali Zaki, a 22-year-old fan told Dawn on Saturday. “Although our team is inexperienced, the intent from the players is evident. Before this, I had no expectations from the team.”

The new vibe is fearless, loud, and unapologetic

As many as 15 matches into their partnership, Salman and Hesson may not have perfected their messaging, but both have been clear and consistent. Hesson has taken bold decisions — most notably moving on from Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan — and backed younger talent while stressing squad culture over individual reliance.
 
 

Salman, meanwhile, has spoken with refreshing honesty. “You can’t make the Pakistan team without merit,” he reminded during a podcast recently. “You have to clear tough hurdles and perform consistently at every level.”
The contrast with the timid, hesitant era that preceded them is stark. Pakistan’s last year T20 World Cup campaign ended in a first-round exit, complete with an embarrassing loss to the USA, and exposed the costs of mediocrity. Even during brief spells of stability, there was reluctance to change and an unwillingness to match the approach of top sides.
Now, the signs suggest something different. Emerging names like Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan and Hasan Nawaz are encouraged to take on games without fear.
For Salman, the shift is about resetting Pakistan’s cricketing identity.
“We can’t afford to play with fear anymore,” he said in the same podcast. “Our job is to take the game on, no matter who the opposition is.”
That confidence is trickling into how Pakistan carries itself. Media interactions have grown sharper, less about protecting reputations and more about clarity. The stump mics too, have captured Salman’s slip-field chatter — quips, sledges and the occasional harmless expletive — giving fans a glimpse of a dressing room no longer shy of character.
For once, Pakistan’s “aura,” as the Gen Z fans put it, feels like it belongs to the present, not the past.

Sialkot ranks first with 1,069 Mauzas (villages), including some urban areas, affected by flood and rainstorms. A population of 1.773 million people has been impacted, while 24 people lost their lives. 
Narowal stands second with 908 Mauzas affected, where 180,000 people were hit by floods and four deaths were reported. In Jhang, 313 Mauzas were affected, though no deaths or injuries were reported. 

PDMA report says 4,744 Mauzas across Punjab affected so far; Sialkot tops list with 1,069 villages

In Gujrat, 214 Mauzas, including urban areas, were affected by floods and four people were reported dead. Other affected districts include Gujranwala/Wazirabad (74), Mandi Bahauddin (78), Hafizabad (165), Sargodha (41), Chiniot (144), Khanewal (158), Multan (138), Muzaffar­garh (147), Sheikhupura (96), Lahore (26), Nan­kana Sahib (97), Kasur (163), Okara (141), Toba Tek Singh (80), Fai­sal­abad (41), Sahiwal (91), Pakpattan (77), Lodhran (20), Vehari (103), Bahawalnagar (143) and Bahawalpur (121).
Over 4.5m impacted 
The report states that a total 4,744 Mauzas have been affected so far, inc­l­uding 2,489 by the Che­nab, 1,458 by the Ravi, 701 by the Sutlej, and 96 by the Indus. More than 4.57 million people have been impacted by the floods in the aforementioned rivers. Overall, 101 people have died and eight have been injured. 
However, Lahore Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza clarified that the one death reported in Lahore was incorrect and had been mistakenly recorded by Rescue 1122. “I will get it corrected soon, as no casualty was reported in the entire Lahore district,” he told Dawn.
The report further claims that over 2.5 million people have been evacuated from flood-hit areas, while more than 2 million animals have been shifted to safe pla­ces. 
A total of 392 relief camps have been set up by district administrations, where 81,810 people are currently residing. In addition, 493 med­ical camps have treated 383,976 people, while 422 veterinary camps are also operational.

• Entire union council of 40,000 submerged in Alipur tehsil
• 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts affected; relief and rehabilitation underway
LAHORE: While water levels have begun to recede significantly in some areas of south Punjab, with the Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils of Multan declared safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad, officials said evacuation and relief efforts continued from low-lying areas along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.
As many as 12,427 people were evacuated from low-lying areas along the three rivers in what authorities claimed one of the largest operations in recent history, involving a fleet of 1,517 rescue boats.
According to Punjab Rescue spokesperson Farooq Ahmed, the districts of Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan were among the hardest hit, with 3,274, 2,392 and 414 people rescued, respectively.
Evacuations extended across numerous other districts, including Lodhran, Bahawalpur and Kasur, illustrating the widespread nature of the crisis. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) reported that a staggering 2.5 million people have been evacuated from Punjab so far, with the floods claiming 101 lives and necessitating the rescue of 2.19m cattle heads.
 
 

Officials confirmed that water levels have begun to recede significantly in some areas. The government declared the tehsils of Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad, where water flow dropped dramatically from 684,000 cusecs on Friday night to 492,695 cusecs by Saturday evening, a decrease of nearly 200,000 cusecs in 24 hours.
The PDMA said that flows at most major headworks on all three rivers were “steady”.
Despite the improving situation, the humanitarian crisis remains severe. The entire union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, with a population of 40,000, was completely submerged.
Lati Mari resident Syed Kausar Shah told Dawn that around 15,000 people of his basti Azeem Shah evacuated on their own as the water started approaching their union council.
He said that all their houses and crops were destroyed due to an extremely high flood, and two people from the families who could not evacuate in time were drowned.
He said that a private boat was hired to evacuate the people. “Most of them were living in the houses of their relatives in Alipur city, some were also sitting on the dyke under the sky while others shifted to government relief camps,” he added.
The flood-affected people also suffered losses of cattle heads, as most of them could not evacuate their cattle. He said that six to seven feet of water is still flowing in their union council and they could not take away their belongings and also were not able to check whether it was safe or not.
Multan DC Waseem Hamid Sindhu said that 100,000 people were evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala in the the last three days. He said that efforts were being made to fill the breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala and helicopters and drones were being used to transport medicine and dry food to remote areas.
He said that Jalalpur city was made safe, and the major flood wave of the Chenab and Sutlej rivers was crossing the Head Panjnad. He said that relief and rehabilitation of the flood-affected people had started, and food was being distributed through boats in rural areas of the city.
High-level flooding
Addressing a press conference in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that Panjnad Headworks is facing extremely high flood, with the water flow reaching 575,000 cusecs. He said that 80,000 cusecs of water receded at Panjand in some hours, and a maximum of 700,000 cusecs crossed three days ago.
He said that the Sutlej River had swelled to 385,000 cusecs this season, and all three rivers of the province simultaneously created high-level flooding.
He said that there was no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities and water would also recede in Bahawalpur in the next 24 hours. A “historic” evacuation operation was conducted in Jalalpur Pirwala, and forced evacuation would have been conducted in the district of Multan, he added.
 
 

The DG said that 4,447 mouzas of 28 districts were affected due to flood water and 2.5m people were evacuated from Punjab. He said that 101 people lost their lives in floods and 2.19m cattle heads were also evacuated in the province and shifted to safe places.
Water flow
According to the Flood Forecasting Division’s data released at 9pm on Saturday, the water flow across major rivers was largely normal and steady.
On the Chenab River, flows are steady at all key locations, including Marala Headworks (62,081 cusecs), Khanki Head­works (65,049 cusecs), Qadirabad Headworks (64,588 cusecs) and Tri­mmu Headworks (100,645 cusecs). The flow at Panjnad Headworks was at 492,695 cusecs but was falling. The water level at Rivaz Bridge was 517.20 feet, which was steady and below its maximum level of 525 feet.
On the Ravi River, the water outflow was normal at Jassar (13,797 cusecs), Shahdara (14,906 cusecs) and Balloki Headworks (27,970 cusecs), but it was in low flood at Sidhnai Headworks at 40,809 cusecs.
On the Sutlej River, the water flow was in medium flood at Ganda Singh Wala Headworks (95,000 cusecs) and Islam Headworks (82,155 cusecs), while it was in low flood at Sulemanki Headworks (69,019 cusecs).

The arch-rivals will clash in a geopolitically-charged men’s Asia Cup contest in Dubai on Sunday. It will be the first cricket match between the sides since four days of military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
While reigning T20 world champions India are the firm favourites to retain their title, Pakistan are on a high, having convincingly beaten Afghanistan to win the final of a tri-series and Oman in the lead-up to the contest.
Speaking at the pre-match press conference in Dubai, Saim said: “We are not just looking forward to the Pakistan-India match, but we are looking forward to winning the tournament.”
He added that the current tournament is what matters at this moment.
 


Responding to a question about Pakistan’s new batting approach against the quality of the Indian attack, Saim said:  “The focus is on playing fearless cricket against all opponents”
Speaking on the India match after the Green Shirts’ thumping victory against Oman on Friday, Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha said: “We have been playing good cricket in the last two-three months and we just have to play good cricket.”
“If we can execute our plans for a long enough period, we can beat any team,” he added.
Earlier in the week, Pakistan’s white-ball head coach Mike Hesson dismissed concerns about the national squad’s batting performance on Thursday ahead of the upcoming Asia Cup clash with India.
 
 

Hesson said he was “not quite sure” where the concerns were arising from, saying the team had played against the “best wrist spin attack” in the world and won by over 70 runs against Afghanistan in the tri-series final.
“It’s very much a developing batting lineup. There’s many players who can win you the game on their day, but they don’t have as many good days as you’d like at the moment … the thing for us is that we are more interested in the sum of the parts as a batting group.”
Indian players must move past emotions against Pakistan, says assistant coach
Meanwhile, India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said the players need to put their emotions to one side.
Asked if public sentiment in India weighs on the minds of the players, Ten Doeschate on Saturday said: “Yes, I think it will. It’s a very sensitive issue, and I’ve got no doubt the players share the compassion and feeling of the vast majority of the Indian public.
 


“The Asia Cup was in a limbo for a long period of time and we were just waiting. We didn’t think we were going to be coming at one stage,” said Ten Doeschate, a former Dutch all-rounder.
“Obviously, you know what the Indian government’s stance is on it, and now the team and particularly the players, you have to put those sentiments and the emotions behind, that’s something we addressed in the team meeting,” he added.
Ten Doeschate accepted that India start as favourites.
“Being totally honest, and looking at recent form and how the teams have played, India do start as favourites tomorrow. We will be focused on 120 balls with bat and ball,” Ten Doeschate said.
Ten Doeschate said India have done their homework after Pakistan dropped star batters Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan.
India go into the match after beating the United Arab Emirates by nine wickets after bowling them out for 57 in 13.1 overs before returning to chase down the target in 27 balls on Thursday.
Even before the clashes in May, which nearly escalated into a full-blown war, bilateral cricket ties were suspended. The arch-rivals now play each other only in multi-team tournaments.
Political relations have deteriorated further since the clashes, with several former Indian players urging the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities.
While the threat of a boycott is over, sparks may fly with Salman and his Indian counterpart ruling out dialling down aggression in the much-anticipated Group A fixture.
“Once the BCCI said they are aligned with the government, we are here to play,” India’s batting coach Sitanshu Kotak told reporters on Friday.
“Once we are here to play, I think players are focused on playing cricket. I personally don’t think they have anything in mind apart from playing cricket and that’s what we focus on.”
 
 

The eight-nation T20 tournament began on Tuesday with Afghanistan beating Hong Kong by 94 runs. India crushed the hosts, the UAE, by nine wickets on Wednesday.
Pakistan, India, Oman and UAE are in Group A, while Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Bangladesh form Group B.

Records were smashed and world titles defended, with some surprise wins keeping the night exciting for a sold-out stadium that stood empty during the Covid-hit Olympics four years ago.
The most predictable win of the night went to American Ryan Crouser, who won his third consecutive world title (22.34m) and became the only man to do so in the shot put, where he holds the world and championship record.
Kenya’s Beatrice Chebet claimed her first world title in the women’s 10,000m despite being the world record holder in the event. The two-time Olympic champion powered through the last 200m to win gold in 30:37.61 ahead of Italy’s Nadia Battocletti, who set a national record of 30:38.23. Ethiopia’s Gudaf Tsegay settled for bronze with 30:39.65.
 






The plot twist of the night came in the men’s 100m as world number 28 Gift Leotela of South Africa clocked a personal best 9.87 to lead the semi-finals ranking tomorrow night.
 






Canada’s Evan Dunfee won the first medal of the championships in the men’s 35km race walk to claim his maiden world title at the age of 34 in 2 hours 28 minutes and 22 seconds. Brazil’s Caio Bonfim was second with a 2:28:55 season’s best while Japan’s Hayato Katsuki won the host nation’s first medal in 2:29:16.
Over on the women’s side, world record holder Maria Perez of Spain retained her world title in 2:39:01. Italy’s Antonella Palmisano took home silver in 2:42:24, while Ecuador’s Paula Milena Torres set a national record of 2:42:44.
Up until Saturday morning, defending champion Crouser had not competed all season due to an elbow injury, but he nevertheless won the first gold of the championships for the US. Mexico’s Uziel Munoz had the throw of his life as he set a national record of 21.97m on his final attempt to move up from fifth to second position, and Italy’s Leonardo Fabbri threw a 21.94m to win bronze. New Zealand’s Tom Walsh got fourth despite the same throw since Fabbri had a superior second-best mark.

The mixed 4x400m relay saw the US in a league of their own as they won gold and set a new championship record in 3:08.80. They had a monumental lead in the final leg of the race over the Netherlands (3:09.96) and Belgium in third place (3:10.61), who were ecstatic with their win. The Polish team looked gutted after the race as they missed a podium finish by 0.02 seconds (3:10.63).
In the women’s 1500m, world record holder and reigning champion Faith Kipyegon finished eighth in the heats (4:02.55) to advance to the semi-finals. Just hours earlier, her world record (3:48.68) set at the Eugene Diamond League in July was ratified by World Athletics. Ethiopia’s Freweyni Hailu topped the heats with a 4:01.23 while world number seven Nikki Hiltz of the US came in second with a 4:01.73.
 






Ethiopia’s Diribe Welteji was poised to medal in this event but was barred from competing on the eve of the competition amid a legal dispute over allegedly missing a drug test. She was accused in May of refusing to give a sample for a doping test “without any justification,” according to a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
In the men’s 100m heats, Leotola clocked his personal best, topping the times ahead of world number four Oblique Seville of Jamaica (9.93). World lead Kishane Thompson of Jamaica posted an easy 9.95, as did showman and Olympic champion Noah Lyles of the US.
Olympic champion Julian Alfred is top-ranked headed into the women’s 100m semi-final with a 10.93, while Great Britain’s Daryll Neita comes in second with a 10.94 season’s best. World lead Melissa Jefferson-Wooden of the US was third with a 10.99 to round off the sub-11 times.
Reigning champion and countrywoman Sha’Carri Richardson posted a season’s best of 11.03, blinged out in her signature style of jewellery and long acrylic nails. Jamaican sprint icon Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce — who made her ninth world championship appearance — ran 11.09 behind compatriot Tia Clayton (11.01) and Shericka Jackson (11.04).
Taylor Swift’s Shake it Off echoed in the stadium as the women competed in the long jump qualifiers on one side and the 100m heats on the other, with the men’s pole vault nestled in between.
In the men’s 3,000m Steeplechase, Ethiopia’s Lamecha Girma had a fall on the first barrier that elicited a gasp from the audience. His fall in Paris last year knocked him unconscious, and he had to be carried off the track on a stretcher. Nevertheless, the Ethiopian caught up to the rest of the field at the 2000m mark and finished with a 8:27.79 to qualify for the finals.

The Moroccans are top-ranked going into the final as Soufiane El Bakkali ran 8:26.99 and Salaheddine Ben Yazdide clocked 8:27.21.
American double Olympic discus champion Valarie Allman threw 66.07 metres to qualify comfortably for Sunday’s final, where she will hope to end her frustrating world title drought.
Also advancing to the final — this one for long jump — was Olympic champion Tara Davis-Woodhall, who only needed one jump to move through.
World Athletics President Sebastian Coe, in his opening ceremony speech, hailed the local organising committee for putting together the nine-day event.
“To the athletes, you are everything — thank you for bringing your talents,” he said. “Thank you for writing what I know will be another chapter in the illustrious history of this great sport.”</p><small>2025-09-13 18:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623531-redressal-of-litigants-grievances-must-be-foremost-priority-says-cjp' target='_blank'><strong>Redressal of litigants' grievances must be foremost priority, says CJP</strong></a><br><p>

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) earlier said that 12 soldiers were martyred while security forces killed 13 terrorists during an intense fire exchange in KP’s South Waziristan district. It added that the 13 terrorists were among 35 “khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij” killed in two separate engagements from September 10 to 13. It later said seven more soldiers were martyred and 10 more terrorists were killed on Thursday in Lower Dir.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Radio Pakistan reported that PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir later visited Bannu and attended a high-level meeting on counter-terrorism. It added that they also participated in the funeral prayers of the South Waziristan operation martyrs.
“The prime minister reaffirmed that Pakistan’s response to terrorism will continue with full force and made it clear that no ambiguity or compromise will be tolerated. He said terrorist leaders and facilitators responsible for attacks in Pakistan are operating from Afghan soil with the backing of India.
“The prime minister stated that the Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khwarij or stand with Pakistan. He highlighted the involvement of infiltrated Afghan nationals in terrorist incidents and stressed the urgent need for the repatriation of illegal Afghan residents currently living in Pakistan,” the report stated.
 






The prime minister further said that Pakistan rejected “politicisation and misleading narratives” on the issue of terrorism.
PM Shehbaz warned that “anyone facilitating or advocating” for terrorists or “acting as proxies for India” was essentially their agent and would be “dealt with accordingly”.
The report said the prime minister praised the “unity and resilience” of the nation, particularly the people of KP, for “standing like Banyanum Marsoos (a wall fortified with lead) with the state and armed forces against the Indian proxies”.
The premier affirmed that the government would immediately implement all necessary administrative and legal measures to ensure a more effective response to terrorism.
The report said PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir also visited the injured at Bannu Combined Military Hospital. They also received a detailed briefing on the regional security situation by the Peshawar Corps commander.
 






Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Earlier this month, six soldiers were martyred, while five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters in the Bannu district.
 
 

In response, the military has intensified its counter-terrorism operations. From September 9 to 10, security forces killed 14 “Indian-sponsored khwarij” in KP’s Mohmand district, four in North Waziristan, and one in Bannu district, according to the ISPR.
Yesterday, the ISPR said troops had also killed four “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Balochistan’s Mastung.
Last month, security forces gunned down 50 terrorists over a four-day operation, foiling an attempt by militants to cross over from Afghanistan into Balochistan.
KP operations
In an “encounter that took place in South Waziristan District, 13 more khwarij were neutralised by the security forces. However, during intense fire exchange, twelve brave sons of soil, having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat (martyrdom)”, the ISPR said.
 






The military’s media affairs wing further said that 22 “Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell” in Bajaur after an intense fire exchange during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) conducted by the security forces.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian-sponsored killed khwarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” the statement added.
“Intelligence reports have unequivocally confirmed physical involvement of Afghan nationals in these heinous acts. Besides, [the] use of Afghan soil against Pakistan by Fitna al Khawarij terrorists continues to remain a grave point of concern,” the military further noted.
“Pakistan expects the interim Afghan government to uphold its responsibilities and deny use of its soil for terrorist activities against Pakistan,” it added.
 
 

Pakistan has long maintained that it faces a persistent threat from militant groups operating out of Afghanistan, including the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which was recently designated by the US State Department as a Foreign Terr­­orist Organisation.
The ISPR asserted: “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored khwarji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve.”
PM Shehbaz earlier lauded the security forces for eliminating the 35 terrorists in the two operations and paid tribute to the 12 martyred soldiers who “fought with bravery”, APP reported, citing a press release from the PM Office.
The premier prayed for the martyrs’ high ranks and expressed his condolences to the bereaved families. He said that in the fight against terrorism, the security forces were “standing like a solid rock” and the entire nation paid tribute to them.
The prime minister also reiterated the government’s resolve to eradicate terrorism of all kinds from the country.
The ISPR later said that seven more soldiers were martyred in an operation in Lower Dir on Thursday when security Forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in the general area of Lal Qilla Maidan based on the reported presence of TTP terrorists.
“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, 10 Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell.”
The ISPR said Naik Abdul Jalil, 39, resident of North Waziristan; Naik Gul Jan, 38, resident of Lakki Marwat; Lance Naik Azmat Ullah, 28, resident of Lakki Marwat; Sepoy Abdul Malik, 28, resident of Khyber; Sepoy Muhammad Amjad, 27, resident of Malakand; Sepoy Muhammad Dawood, 23, resident of Swabi and Sepoy Fazal Qayum, 21, resident of Dera Ismail Khan “fought gallantly” and were martyred while “saving precious lives of innocent civilians, who were made hostage by Indian sponsored khawrij”.
The ISPR further said: “Intelligence reports have unequivocally confirmed physical involvement of Afghan nationals in these heinous acts. Pakistan expects the Interim Afghan Government to uphold its responsibilities and deny its soil for terrorist activities against Pakistan.”
It added that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area. “Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve.”</p><small>2025-09-13 17:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/13214947ae57f8f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941738/imf-says-pakistans-flood-spending-budget-agility-to-be-reviewed' target='_blank'><strong>IMF says Pakistan’s flood spending, budget agility to be reviewed</strong></a><br><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed deep condolences on Saturday for the loss of life caused by devastating floods in the country and said its upcoming Extended Fund Facility (EFF) review mission will evaluate whether the government’s fiscal policies and emergency provisions can effectively address the crisis, a senior official of the Washington-based lender said.
“The mission will assess whether the FY26 budget, its spending allocations and emergency provisions remain sufficiently agile to address the spending needs necessitated by the floods,” said Mahir Binici, the IMF’s resident representative in Pakistan.
The flash floods have killed 972 people so far, according to the National Disaster Management Authority.
 
 

The floods have destroyed crops, livestock and homes across Punjab and are now pushing into Sindh, threatening fresh food inflation and deeper hardship.
The State Bank of Pakistan is expected to keep its key rate at 11 per cent on Monday, a Reuters poll showed, as policymakers weigh inflation risks from crop losses against a slowing economy.
An analyst estimated agricultural damage could shave up to 0.2 percentage points off growth this year, with reconstruction-led demand offering only a partial offset.
The IMF board approved a fresh $1.4 billion loan in May to help Pakistan strengthen its economic resilience to climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters.
The disbursement of funds is contingent upon successful completion of reviews under the EFF, the official said.

Qatar said earlier today it would hold the emergency moot in light of the recent developments in the region. Foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said Monday’s meeting would consider “a draft resolution on the Israeli attack on the state of Qatar” to be drafted on Sunday at a ministerial meeting.
Israel targeted Hamas leaders on Tuesday in strikes on the Qatari capital, killing five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer. The attack drew widespread international condemnation, including from Gulf monarchies allied with the United States, Israel’s main backer.
Al-Ansari was quoted as saying by the official QNA news agency that the summit reflected “broad Arab and Islamic solidarity with the State of Qatar in the face of Israel’s cowardly aggression … and the categorical rejection of Israel’s state terrorism”.
Confirming PM Shehbaz’s participation, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement posted on X that Pakistan was a co-sponsor of the summit. It added that the Israeli attempts to occupy Gaza, expand settlement activities in the occupied West Bank and forcibly displace Palestinians were also part of the decision to hold the summit.
“Heads of states and governments and senior officials from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation member countries are expected to participate in the summit. The summit will be preceded by the preparatory meeting of the foreign ministers on September 14, 2025. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar will participate in the preparatory session,” the FO said.
The FO reiterated that ​Pakistan accorded high importance to its relations with Qatar and strongly condemned Israeli aggression against the country and other regional states.
 






Among the leaders attending will be Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also be in Doha, but his presence at the meeting is yet to be confirmed.
Analysts say the summit is meant to send Israel a clear signal.
Qatar, which hosts the largest US base in the region, plays a mediation role in the Gaza war alongside the United States and Egypt.
The Israeli strikes were “seen across the Gulf as an unprecedented violation of sovereignty and an attack on diplomacy itself”, Andreas Krieg of King’s College London said, adding the summit signalled that “such aggression can’t be normalised”.
“The goal is to draw clear red lines and end the sense in Israel that it can act with impunity,” he said. “Expect a sharper stance on Palestine and a harder edge on Israeli actions.”
Trump hosts Qatar’s PM
Earlier, US President Donald Trump held dinner with the Qatari prime minister in New York on Friday.
Separately, Trump expressed annoyance about the strike in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and sought to assure the Qataris that such attacks would not happen again.
Trump and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani were joined by a top Trump adviser, US special envoy Steve Witkoff.
“Great dinner with POTUS. Just ended,” Qatar’s deputy chief of mission, Hamah Al-Muftah, said on X.
 






The White House confirmed the dinner had taken place but offered no details.
The session followed an hour-long meeting that al-Thani had at the White House on Friday with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
A source briefed on the meeting said they discussed Qatar’s future as a mediator in the region and defence cooperation in the wake of the Israeli strikes against Hamas in Doha.
Trump said he was unhappy with Israel’s strike, which he described as a unilateral action that did not advance US or Israeli interests.</p><small>2025-09-13 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/131953578023761.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941730/around-100000-turn-out-for-far-right-rally-in-london' target='_blank'><strong>Around 100,000 turn out for far-right rally in London</strong></a><br><p>More than 100,000 people massed on Saturday in central London for a march and rally organised by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as anti-racism campaigners held a smaller counter-protest.
Huge crowds, many draped in English and British flags, gathered through the morning just south of Westminster for what Robinson, a veteran of UK far-right organising, has branded the country’s “biggest free speech festival”.
His latest ‘Unite the Kingdom’ event saw attendees march over Westminster Bridge before rallying near Downing Street for speeches by far-right figures from across Europe and North America.
“The silent majority will be silent no longer,” Robinson told the crowd. “Today is the spark of a cultural revolution.”

UK police said an estimated 110,000 people attended, noting it used a combination of CCTV and police helicopter footage for its estimate.
Around 5,000 people attended a ‘Stand Up to Racism’ march a mile or so to the north, as police deployed about 1,000 police to keep the rival groups apart.
The duelling demonstrations come amid growing anti-immigration sentiment, as Brexit supporter Nigel Farage’s hard-right Reform UK leads in polls and protesters target hotels used to house asylum seekers.
Robinson, 42, who has a string of criminal convictions and a big online following after years of spearheading a fervent anti-Muslim and anti-migrant agenda, increasingly fuses those themes with claims that Britain is now hostile to free speech.
“Every day in the papers you read things and you’re being left stunned — arresting people because they dared to talk about immigration or gender issues,” Philip Dodge, a retired baker from Sheffield, central England, told AFP.
He had travelled with his wife to the event, which was also being watched by hundreds of thousands of viewers on livestreams.
“I’m very concerned. I never thought I’d see this in this country.”
Far-right speakers
Other attendees, including women and young people, said they were more worried about migration.
“It’s an invasion,” 28-year-old Ritchie, who only gave his first name, said of the record levels of UK immigration in recent years, including tens of thousands of asylum seekers arriving annually on small boats across the Channel.
“They don’t understand we want our country back,” he said of the ruling centre-left Labour government and its Conservative predecessors, calling Robinson “a hero”.

At the anti-racism event, veteran Labour lawmaker Diane Abbott accused Robinson and his allies of spreading “nonsense” and “dangerous” lies that asylum seekers were a threat.
“We need to be in solidarity with asylum seekers, and we need to show that we are united,” she told Sky News.
London police, who drafted in officers from other forces to manage the crowds, have placed conditions on the protest routes and timings, insisting they end at different times and that both conclude by evening.
Some at Robinson’s event attached to their placards photos of Charlie Kirk, the right-wing American activist and ally of United States President Donald Trump, who was gunned down this week. Other signs included slogans like “stop the boats” and derided Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
‘Culture wars’
Planned speakers include French politician Eric Zemmour, controversial Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson and Petr Bystron of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Reports said former White House strategist Steve Bannon would also address the crowds.
The event comes just over a year after anti-immigration riots swept several cities, which Robinson was accused of fuelling with incendiary online posts, and as free speech concerns become more mainstream.

The government has faced widespread criticism after banning the Palestine Action group in July. Police have since arrested under anti-terror laws hundreds of peaceful protesters holding up signs supporting the group.
Meanwhile, the recent arrest of an award-winning comedy writer for allegedly insulting transgender people online prompted widespread derision. After Irish writer Graham Linehan was detained, Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged police to “focus on the most serious issues”.
However, London’s Metropolitan Police chief Mark Rowley said the law needed changing and that he did not believe his officers “should be policing toxic culture wars debates”.
The influence of Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was thought to be waning after various legal and other woes. But his profile has rocketed since his X account was reinstated in November 2023, following billionaire Elon Musk’s purchase of the platform.</p><small>2025-09-13 15:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/131936578f491b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941729/sindh-sees-fifth-fatality-from-brain-eating-amoeba-as-karachi-man-dies-in-hospital' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh sees fifth fatality from brain-eating amoeba as Karachi man dies in hospital</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh health department on Saturday reported the province’s fifth death from Naegleria fowleri.
A 29-year-old from Karachi died on September 11 at a private hospital,
Meeran Yousuf, the media coordinator for the Sindh health minister, told Dawn.com.
“The patient started experiencing symptoms on September 7 and was admitted to the hospital on September 11,”. Yousuf added. “The presence of Naegleria Fowleri was confirmed in the patient on September 12 after the patient had passed away.”
The media coordinator added that upon investigation, it was noted that the patient had not participated in any “water-related activities” and that his only exposure was the regular use of tap water for drinking and bathing.
“This is the fifth death from Naegleria in Sindh in 2025,” Yousuf said.
Commonly known as “brain-eating amoeba”, Naegleria Fowleri, is commonly found in warm fresh water —such as lakes, rivers and hot springs — and soil. Only one species, Naegleria fowleri, infects people.
It infects people when water containing the amoeba enters the body through the nose. This typically happens when people go swimming, diving, or when they put their heads under fresh water, like in lakes and rivers. The amoeba then travels up the nose to the brain, where it destroys the brain tissues and causes Primary Amoebic Meni­ngoencephalitis (PAM).
The first symptoms of the PAM usually start about five days after infection and may include headaches, fever, nausea or vomiting. Later symptoms can include a stiff neck, confusion, a lack of attention to people and surroundings, seizures, hallucinations and comas.
After symptoms start, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within five days. The germ cannot survive in cool, clean and chlorinated water.</p><small>2025-09-13 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/131420182ef6e0d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941690/cjp-afridi-highlights-need-for-cordial-cohesion-between-bench-bars-to-preserve-rule-of-law' target='_blank'><strong>CJP Afridi highlights need for ‘cordial’ cohesion between bench, bars to preserve rule of law</strong></a><br><p>Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi on Saturday highlighted the need for “cordial” cohesion and relations between the bench and bars across the country, to preserve the rule of law.
Speaking at a judicial conference in Muzaffarabad, the CJP said it was heartening to witness the “spirit of judicial fraternity between Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK)” and extended “full constitutional [and] institutional support” from the Supreme Court to the AJK judiciary.
“I earnestly urge my brother judges and my respected bar members of [AJK] to keep three foundational fundamentals in mind in progressing with their future,” CJP Afridi said.
“I earnestly state, firstly, it is neither us sitting on the bench, nor for the worthy, respected bar members standing on the roster, but the litigant whose interest must always remain supreme.”
He added that secondly, the relationship between the bench and the bar “should always be cordial, constructive and considered”.
“Mind you, without this cohesion between the two pillars, there can be no guarantee for preserving the rule of law or ensuring any reform to go forward,” CJP Afridi emphasised.
“Thirdly, and finally … technology has to be integrated in the justice delivery process. Only then can the ultimate aim be achieved,” he added. “What is the ultimate end? [For] justice delivery to become efficient, transparent, and above all, citizen-centric.”
CJP Afridi added that Supreme Court Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar was committed to supporting the AJK judiciary’s automation.
“In any respect that you require, we are there and we stand ready to share experiences, extend technical cooperation and jointly build a future where the quality and accessibility of justice is strengthened across the board,” the CJP stated.
 
 

Earlier this week, the CJP stated that the Supreme Court had plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) to categorise cases for fixation, adding that 61,000 files will be digitally screened under a project that will be completed within six months.
“We all talk about technology, we all talk about AI to be utilised for enhancing the justice delivery system,” Justice Afridi said. “Yes, technology is necessary. Yes, AI has to be utilised. But no, not now. We are not ready for it. We have to prepare ourselves for that.”</p><small>2025-09-13 14:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/131736276afd660.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941720/accused-us-sniper-jailed-in-charlie-kirk-killing-awaits-formal-charges-in-utah' target='_blank'><strong>Accused US sniper jailed in Charlie Kirk killing awaits formal charges in Utah</strong></a><br><p>The Utah trade school student jailed on suspicion of fatally shooting United States conservative activist Charlie Kirk faces formal charges next week, according to the governor, following an act of violence widely seen as a foreboding inflexion point in American politics.
Tyler Robinson, 22, was arrested on Thursday night after relatives and a family friend alerted authorities that he had implicated himself in the crime, Governor Spencer Cox said on Friday, opening a press conference with the words, “We got him.”
The arrest capped a 33-hour manhunt for the lone suspect in Wednesday’s killing, which US President Donald Trump has called a “heinous assassination”.
Kirk, co-founder of the conservative student group Turning Point USA and a staunch Trump ally, was gunned down by a single rifle shot fired from a rooftop during an outdoor event attended by 3,000 people at Utah Valley University in Orem, about 65 kilometres south of Salt Lake City.
The sniper made his getaway in the ensuing pandemonium, captured in graphic detail in video clips that circulated widely on the internet and television news reports.
  @dawn.today US conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an influential ally of President Donald Trump, was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking at Utah University, sparking a manhunt for a lone sniper who the governor said had carried out a political assassination. Authorities said they still had no suspect in custody as of Wednesday night, some eight hours after the midday shooting at Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah, during an event attended by 3,000 people. The lone perpetrator suspected of firing the single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, apparently from a distant rooftop sniper’s nest on campus, remained “at large,” said Beau Mason, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety, at a news conference four hours later. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com  
A bolt-action rifle believed to be the murder weapon was found nearby, and police released images from surveillance cameras showing a “person of interest” wearing dark clothing and sunglasses.
A break in the case came when a relative and a family friend alerted the local sheriff’s office that he had “confessed to them or implied that he had committed” the murder, Cox said.
“I want to thank the family members of Tyler Robinson, who did the right thing in this case and were able to bring him into law enforcement,” the governor said.
Security camera footage and evidence gathered from the suspect’s profile on the chat and streaming platform Discord also helped investigators link him to the crime, Cox added.
  @dawn.today A young Utah man suspected of killing influential United States conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a university in the city of Orem was in custody on Friday, Utah Governor Spencer Cox told reporters. “We got him,” Cox told reporters. The suspect, identified as Tyler Robinson, had confessed to a family friend or “implied that he had committed the murder” to that friend and that person in turn had contacted the Washington County sheriff’s office on Thursday. A family member interviewed by investigators said Robinson had become more political recently and spoke in a disparaging manner about Kirk, Cox told reporters. Robinson was taken into custody on Thursday night, about 33 hours after Kirk’s murder, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel said at the press conference. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com  
‘Watershed in American history’
The killing has stirred outrage among Kirk’s supporters and condemnation of political violence from across the ideological spectrum.
“It is an attack on all of us,” Governor Cox said, calling Kirk’s murder a “watershed in American history” and comparing it to the rash of US political assassinations of the 1960s.
Cox declined to discuss possible motives for the killing. But in describing inscriptions investigators found on ammunition recovered from the scene, he said one of the casings bore the message: “Here fascist! Catch!”
“I think that speaks for itself,” he said in response to reporters’ questions.

State records show Robinson was a registered voter but not affiliated with any political party. But a relative told investigators that Robinson had grown more political in recent years and had once discussed with another family member their dislike for Kirk and his viewpoints, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.
Many Republicans, including Trump, have been quick to lash out at the political left, accusing liberals of fomenting anti-conservative vitriol that would encourage a kindred spirit to cross the line into violence.
Democrats, decrying political violence more generally while calling for stronger gun laws, have countered that Trump himself routinely uses inflammatory rhetoric to demonise his political foes, judges and the mainstream media.
Right, left or crazy?
Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the symbology found on the bullet casings suggests the shooter was part of the so-called Groyper movement, associated with far-right activist and commentator Nick Fuentes.
“It’s an eclectic ideological movement marked by video game memes, anti-gay, Nick Fuentes white supremacy and irony,” she said.
“It certainly leans right, but it is quite eclectic. In a way, the ideological beliefs of the shooter don’t matter,” she said.
“What matters is how they’re taken by society. And if our society chooses to keep pointing fingers, whether the person turns out to be right, left or just unstable, then the violence will grow from the pointing of fingers, regardless of the act itself.”
Kleinfeld said most perpetrators of political violence were not clearly on one ideological side or another, but typically driven by “a hodgepodge of conspiracy beliefs and mental illness”.
“So it wouldn’t be surprising at all if this person was a person of the far right, if this person was a person who held a variety of different beliefs and was sort of unclassifiable,” she added.

Kirk’s murder comes amid the most sustained period of US political violence in decades. Reuters has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts across the ideological spectrum since Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
Trump himself has survived two attempts on his life, one that left him with a grazed ear during a campaign event in July 2024 and another two months later, foiled by federal agents.
Democrats have fallen victim, too. In April, an arsonist broke into Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence and set it on fire while the family was inside.
Earlier this year, a gunman posing as a police officer in Minnesota murdered Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and shot Democratic state Senator John Hoffman and his wife.
In her first public comments since her spouse was slain, Erika Kirk vowed in a tearful but defiant video message on Friday evening that “the movement built by my husband will not die” but grow stronger.
Speaking from the studio of his radio-podcast show, she urged young people to join Turning Point, exalting her husband as a fallen political hero who “now and for all eternity will stand at his saviour’s side wearing the glorious crown of a martyr.”
 


Who is Tyler Robinson?
Eighteen-year-old Robinson seemingly had a bright future ahead of him.
The Utah teen had scored in the top percentile on his college entrance exam and earned himself a four-year scholarship to Utah State University in Logan. His proud mother posted a video on Facebook in which her firstborn son, the oldest of three, read aloud the school’s letter offering him the grant.
“He’s so excited to start his journey and it’s going to be so amazing for him!” she wrote in another post.
Robinson, now 22, was arrested for aggravated murder and other charges over the shooting. He has no criminal history, according to state records reviewed by Reuters.
Investigators are still working to understand what allegedly led Robinson to that rooftop. Officials have not yet identified a precise motive for the shooting, though they offered some clues on Friday morning in announcing his arrest.

He was a registered voter but was not affiliated with a political party, according to voter records. He is listed as an “inactive” voter, which indicates that he did not cast a ballot in last year’s presidential election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris.
At the time of the shooting, Robinson was living at his parents’ house in Washington, a farming and residential community of approximately 28,000 near Zion National Park in southwestern Utah.
Robinson’s grey Dodge Challenger — the vehicle that authorities say he drove to the site of the shooting on Tuesday — was parked on Friday outside the two-story stucco home, in a relatively new housing development built among alfalfa fields.
Dozens of media members were gathered outside, along with half a dozen police cars parked along the street. Officers were stopping reporters from approaching the home.
A neighbour, Steven Green, said he knew the family from attending the same Mormon church down the street.
“Great family, good kids,” he said, though he added he did not know Robinson well.
Canaan Timothy, 21, said he was in the year below Robinson at high school. Robinson, he said, was just a regular student with an interest in music, who hung out with members of the school band.
“I knew him in passing. Just your average kid,” said Timothy, who lives two blocks from the Robinson family. “Tyler, he was quiet, but not too quiet.”
Robinson was arrested late on Thursday without incident after a family friend called authorities and said Robinson had either confessed or implied that he was responsible for Kirk’s murder, officials said.
Robinson graduated in 2021 from Pine View High School in St George, Utah. A video online of the commencement ceremony shows him carrying his diploma on stage as attendees cheer. He briefly attended Utah State University in Logan for one semester that fall, the school confirmed to Reuters.
It was not immediately clear why he left, but Dixie Technical College, part of Utah’s public university system, confirmed that he is a third-year student in the school’s electrical apprenticeship programme.
A Facebook post from his mother said Robinson had earned a score of 34 in high school on the ACT college entrance exam, which would put him in the top one per cent of test takers, according to the Princeton Review test preparation company.

He has two younger brothers, according to his parents’ Facebook posts. His mother listed her job online as a social worker at a non-profit healthcare company, while his father is the principal of a company that makes stone countertops, according to state records.
His mother’s Facebook posts over the years — most of which were deleted on Friday — mostly doted on her family: documenting trips to Alaska, the Caribbean and Disneyland; celebrating school plays, Halloween costumes and adopted pet rabbits; expressing pride as the three boys moved up in school.
None of the posts appeared overtly political.
Other posts show Robinson and his brothers occasionally with guns, though that is not uncommon in a state with permissive firearms laws.</p><small>2025-09-13 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623517-president-zardari-reaffirms-pakistans-full-support-for-chinas-vision-of-mutual-learning' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari reaffirms Pakistan's full support for China's vision of ‘mutual learning'</strong></a><br><p>

The BYC chief is currently in police custody on physical remand, which was extended for 15 more days by an ATC in Quetta on Thursday. Mahrang was arrested on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence” and has been remanded several times.
According to a copy of today’s court order available with Dawn.com, the state prosecutor “vehemently” opposed the court granting bail to the BYC chief because the allegations against Mahrang are of a serious nature and the investigating officer collected sufficient evidence which could be presented in court.
Last October, Mahrang was booked in a terrorism case as a first information report (FIR) was registered by Malir district’s Quaidabad police on the complaint of a local resident who claimed that the BYC leader was inciting violence in his area.
“She (prosecutor) further argued that the accused has incited hatred against state institutions, and spread seditious material with [the] intent to cause public unrest. Therefore, [the] accused is not entitled for the concession of bail,” the order read.
The order added that the complainant in the October FIR did not produce any independent witnesses to corroborate the allegations, nor did he appear in court despite the investigating officer (IO) being instructed to produce him.
“Moreover, during [the] investigation at the time of visiting place of incident, neither [the] IO called any private/independent witness from [the] locality nor made [any] query from area people regarding alleged incident,” the order read.
The order added that the IO submitted a report to declare Mahrang an absconder in the case, but the defence counsel submitted the Quetta ATC’s remand order, which showed that she is in police custody.
“Moreover, FIR regarding alleged incident was registered against the applicant/accused on October 11, 2024, while [the IO] submitted [a report] before [the] … Anti-Terrorism Courts Karachi Division on August 16, after the delay of 10 months and in this regard IO has not furnished reason why he submitted [a report] against the accused after delay of 10 months,” the order read.
“In view of the above, I have come to the conclusion that [the] applicant/accused has made out her case for further enquiry,” it added, quoting the ATC judge. “Therefore, I hereby admit the applicant/accused on bail subject to furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs100,000 in the like amount to the satisfaction of this court.”
Mahrang was taken into custody under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order — and remains in custody.
Following her detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against her and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.
The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.</p><small>2025-09-13 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623479-12-soldiers-martyred-35-indian-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>45 Indian-sponsored terrorists killed, 19 soldiers martyred in KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

In her application to the IHC registrar,which Mazari shared on X, she said: “I write to you today to seek [the] preservation of CCTV footage of the Honourable Chief Justice’s courtroom no.1 from September 11, 2025 between 9am and 11am, as an unfortunate incident took place with the undersigned counsel, as a result of which it is imperative that the exchange recorded on the CCTV footage is preserved.
“I would also request [the] provision of a copy of the CCTV footage from the aforementioned date and time on the USB I have annexed herewith this instant application.”
 






The proceedings that Mazari referred to in her application are from a hearing on Thursday, during which she represented her client — who sought the removal of rights activist Mahrang Baloch’s name from the Exit Control List — in the court of IHC CJ Dogar.
At the hearing, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting hold of her”.
For her part, Mazari had said that she was only fulfilling her professional duty and was prepared to face contempt proceedings if the court deemed it necessary.
A day later at the hearing of another case, Justice Dogar provided a clarification on the matter, saying that his words were presented out of context. He also denied saying anything along the lines of “getting hold of” Mazari — a claim contested by Mazari’s husband Hadi Ali Chattha who also attended Thursday’s hearing.
In his clarification, Justice Dogar also said that Mazari was “like a daughter” to him, and he was only trying to explain things to her the previous day.
“I was explaining to her just as (I would) to a child, but she was not understanding. She was repeatedly mentioning fundamental rights. Does this court not have any fundamental rights,” he said.
His remarks drew criticism from the country’s legal fraternity and Mazari herself, who termed his remarks “sexist”.
A number of lawyers’ bodies and bar associations issued statements condemning the IHC CJ’s behaviour, with some even demanding that he be removed from his office.
The Lahore High Court Bar Association strongly condemned the exchange, saying that lawyers were “officer[s] of the court” and their respect and dignity should be prioritised, just like those of respected judges. It urged the Supreme Judicial Council to remove Justice Dogar from his post.
This demand was echoed by the Balochistan Bar Council as well, while the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) strongly condemned the “highly inappropriate conduct” of Justice Dogar.
The Women’s Action Forum was also outraged by the judge’s reported remarks, and condemned the “highly objectionable patriarchal misogynist anti-women remarks and behaviour … patronising language employed in addressing and instructing the lawyer’s spouse…”.</p><small>2025-09-13 07:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623462-govt-finalising-key-agenda-points-for-sept-26-jcc-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Govt finalising key agenda points for Sept 26 JCC meeting</strong></a><br><p>
