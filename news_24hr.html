The website is not part of, associated with or has any connection to the Dawn Media Group.
The webpage, operating from the URL https://dawn.newspot.live/news/rpshytr/93282/, has shared a ‘news report’ on Defence Minister Khawaja Asif supposedly criticising the Punjab government over poor governance and rising crime.
The text of the ‘news story’ and the headline do not conform to Dawn’s style guide. Further, the date at the top also says January 5 (Monday), not January 6.

Is there a power vacuum after Maduro’s exit? Evidently not. Will the Bolivarian republic crumble before the firepower of America? Unlikely, in view of the fact that too much Russian, Chinese and Iranian investment has gone into buttressing Bolivarian rule for it to be easily scuttled. Remember that Hugo Chávez was also kidnapped in a coup staged by the CIA. But his people rallied and Chávez returned to lead the country until his mysterious early death. Tariq Ali, in his memoirs, You Can’t Please All has a chapter on his meetings with Chávez and Maduro. It’s titled “Was Hugo Chávez murdered?” There’s a distinct possibility his cancer was induced.
The story, however, is about Donald Trump’s fear of Brics and his suspicion of the Bolivarian revolution Chávez launched after his electoral victory in Venezuela in 1998. This has irked the West. In this sense, the story hasn’t really moved forward since the Anglo-American Operation Ajax toppled Mohammad Mosaddegh’s elected government in Iran in 1953. That was about oil. Last week’s kidnapping of Maduro is also about oil even if the Trump administration is rowing back from its claim of running Venezuela.
What role is Brics playing to worry Trump, so much so that two key Brics members, Iran and Venezuela, are in America’s constant crosshairs? They are both heavily sanctioned countries. With Brics becoming a cohesive financial and economic platform, the hold of sanctions as a tool of US coercion would most likely be rendered ineffective, a key worry for the US.
Chávez’s Bolivarian revolution needs to be understood nicely for a good reason. Chávez leaned heavily on Simón Bolívar’s ideals of Latin American unity, sovereignty, and anti-imperialism. Simón Bolívar was the 19th-century liberator who led South America’s independence from Spain. However, dozens of roads and landmarks in the US and other Western countries are named after Bolívar. Chávez plotted something else.

We don’t know how many Venezuelans were killed. But there was resistance.

Nehru inaugurated a Simón Bolívar Road in Delhi’s diplomatic enclave in 1955. Bolívar inspired Nehru’s Non-aligned Movement and Third World solidarity. To the right-wing Narendra Modi government, the road would be an embarrassment. It was evident in the foreign ministry’s tame response to Trump’s attack on a Brics country. “Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation.” Thus spake the Brics host for later this year. In neighbouring Bangladesh, people took to the streets to protest the heist.
Trump has strong reasons to want to oust the Bolivarian republic. Chávez rewrote the constitution that established new rights, strengthened the executive, and allowed for re-election. Funded by oil revenue, he launched vast social programmes targeting poverty. These included free community healthcare, staffed initially by Cuban doctors; a massive literacy campaign; a mission for subsidised food, housing, and university education. A Qadhafi-like irritant but in the Western hemisphere, a challenge to the Monroe Doctrine.

 

In his adventurous attack on Venezuela, Trump looked like a quack dressed as a handyman assigned the task of staunching America’s slide as a Great Power. His bombing raids on seven nations last year defined his view of Pax Americana. His targets were Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria, Nigeria, Somalia and Venezuela. For all that and more, including the supervision of Israeli genocide of Palestinians, he demanded the Nobel Peace Prize, which went instead to a female Venezuelan dissenter who Trump cheered first but has distanced himself from after last week’s removal of Maduro to New York. Seymour Hersh noted that the bombings were inflicted without significant complaint from the Republican-led Congress.
Easily the most significant concern for the US is the Venezuelan state taking control of key sectors of oil, telecommunications, electricity, steel, and cement. The constitution is committed to the redistribution of large, unused estates to peasants. Currency and price controls are implemented to combat capital flight and inflation, though they also contributed to economic distortions. Venezuela under Chávez/Maduro pursued Latin American integration outside US influence, promoting the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America and offering subsidised oil for Caribbean nations. The revolution aimed to fundamentally transform Venezuelan society, moving it away from the neoliberal, two-party system that had dominated since 1958 and towards a model of ‘21st century socialism’.
As usual, the news about the dangerous military intervention was used to highlight American intelligence and military prowess instead. Stories were circulated about the derring-do of the elite Delta Force commandos who seized Maduro and his wife by bombing their way into his heavily guarded palace. However, Cuba is mourning the death of 32 Cuban guards who were protecting the first family. They were killed in the air and ground mission. We don’t know how many Vene­zuelans were killed. But there was resistance, and that resistance is believed to be the signal for a rehearsed plan to turn a swoop on Venezuelan resources into a nightmare for Trump.
Sensing the resistance, Trump threatened Venezuela’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, with the fate of her president. Tapped to take control of the country after Maduro’s removal to the US, Rodríguez has claimed that the operation to arrest him had a “Zionist tinge”. She warned that “the extremists who have promoted armed aggression against our country — history and justice will make them pay”.
What role could Israel have played in the assault on a distant country? Not very different from the role that Iran has as a strategic ally of Bolivarian Venezuela. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar was quick to congratulate Trump, saying the US “acted as the leader of the free world”. But Trump’s ties with Israel have split his MAGA base. As he struggles to keep his majority in both Houses of Congress in polls due in November, Trump may have overplayed his hand in using the military to fix runaway domestic challenges.

The mortals among us — and who have friends to party with — had barely recovered from New Year’s Eve when the US’s Nobel Peace Prize aspirant invaded a country and kidnapped its president.
Hardly new stuff for those who remember Iraq, or Panama, or … the list can be rather long. But it was a wee bit surprising, coming from a president who can’t stop listing the number of wars he has stopped. What stopped journos in their tracks was the president’s failure to invoke either the fruits of democracy or the freedoms of brown oppressed people, especially women. There were no such helpful diversions. The oil will help the US, it was proclaimed. Now where does that leave the likes of us who want to shake their heads in despair and explain the limitations of nation-building exercises? The world and its craziness is forcing commentators out of a job faster than one can say AI.
It is no easier in Pakistan.
How does one make sense of an authoritarian interlude in which no dollars are flowing in? After all, we are trained to analyse the power flowing down the barrel of a gun that has dollar signs painted on it. However, without the dollars, it seems a bit uncertain and unstable (and it has been for quite a few years now), but it is hard to figure out how long it will last. The 10-year pendulum surely doesn’t cut it anymore. But what ready analysis can replace this? No one knows.

It seems as if all the political soap opera plot twists have been done, and talked about, to death.

So the state is hardening and it rules with an iron glove. Yet it has not been able to tame the people entirely. The anger may not be expressed as loudly as it once was, but no one can ignore the simmering. As a result, the PTI is still a force and so is Imran Khan. On top of this, he refuses to go into exile. What a pain he is because if he left for foreign climes, it would be so easy to believe the khatam shud predictions of some of the commentariat.

 

In other words, the nail-biting contest threatens to continue in 2026 and those of us in the business of analysis have little left to say. Truly. There are just so many times one can predict doom and gloom and ask everyone to talk for the greater good. Because frankly, our leadership just isn’t as honest as the chap in the US; our lot claims to worry about the people here and it’s a story that no one buys now and yet they continue to tell it. They know that no one buys it; we know that they know that we know they don’t care and yet the drama continues. And now no one is listening.
It seems as if all the political soap opera plot twists have been done and talked about to death. Take another example. The predictions about the democratic DNA in Nawaz Sharif or Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari coming to the fore are now also becoming less common. It’s been months since anyone has spoken of Sharif senior’s desire to see Imran Khan free and nearly years since anyone has spoken of the tensions between father Zardari and son Bhutto-Zardari and the latter struggling to break free. No one is now expecting the true democrats to say “enough” and hiding their disappointment analysts speak of the choices in Pakistan being limited to authoritarianism and fascism.
No different is all the ‘sane’ talk about talks. It’s about as promising as the MoUs Pakistan signs each time a foreign leader meets a government official or the promises about the economy taking off. No one can even be bothered to argue about it. And neither does anyone think 2026 will bring any change, so great is the ‘paralysis’. Though I have learnt that one can call it jamood on the talk show.
Even the soothsayers or najoomis who were called to talk shows while the rest of us were making New Year plans had nothing new to offer. They seem to sound no different from the political soothsayers who tell us of the greatness that awaits the country in 2026. The king is in his counting house and the prime minister is having bread and honey. And the rest are stuck hanging out clothes in their backyard while the FBR is pecking noses and far more.
The point here is that there is nothing new to say about the state of the nation, the society and what passes for politics. It is now beyond us all, be it the najoomis or the analysts. And don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. But because we too have to pay taxes and then the bills which have more taxes within them, this column has to be written week after week.
So it might just happen that soon this space turns into something rather different. Instead of Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan and others, it might just make sense to write on middle-age challenges such as trying to lose weight or deal with acidity; cooking; the painful watching options on Netflix; or even an agony aunt section. Anything at the moment seems more possible than writing on politics. The latter, even politicians assure me, is done and dusted. Which reminds me, what about a styling column for politicians? Many of them, especially the men, can do with a makeover. What is this love affair with Kala Kola, for instance? Why not go for sophisticated grey streaks?
If there are better ideas out there for what a weekly column can be about, suggestions are welcome. For I have taxes to pay before I sleep. Miles of taxes … with apologies to Robert Frost.

For quite a while, US President Donald Trump had been issuing blunt statements regarding the Venezuelan leadership, framing its policies and even existence as a threat to regional stability. Last weekend, he made good on his implied threats by sending US forces into the Latin American nation to forcibly bring its president to the US.
Nicolás Maduro has since been paraded on US streets, on his way to face US justice: the head of a sovereign nation reduced to a war trophy for the American president. It is an extraordinary development that cannot be viewed merely through the lens of South American politics. Rather, it represents the unapologetic revival of regime-change tactics by a major global power, and raises the question: what remains of the so-called ‘rules-based order’ when the sovereignty of nations has been reduced to a conditional privilege?
The US has a long history of intervention in South America, often driven by the protection of corporate interests rather than any genuine commitment to democratic ideals. During the Cold War era, it used the fear of communism to justify supporting authoritarian regimes that had aligned themselves with US economic priorities.
The rhetoric has shifted since then. Today, in the US leadership’s discourse around Venezuela and its neighbouring states, there is reduced emphasis on ideology and an increased focus on resources, specifically oil and minerals. Regime change has thus been turned into a tool for appropriation and exploitation.
There seems to be no shame in it either. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently declared, “I do not care what the UN says. The UN does not know what they’re talking about.” He had been challenged on the repeated claim that Venezuela was involved in the drug trade. In short, the US will now act as judge, jury and executioner.

 

The silence of the international community has been equally disconcerting. There has been a very muted or fragmented response from the UN and major powers that claim to defend multilateralism. Some have even gone so far as to endorse the overthrow of the Maduro government. Others have issued mealy-mouthed condemnations and meek appeals to adhere to the UN Charter.
This lack of pushback contrasts sharply with the swift condemnations seen from the same nations in other geopolitical contexts, where the aggressor is not the US or one of its allies. This selective outrage will further erode the credibility and moral authority of the global order. The sovereignty of every nation must be respected, regardless of which political system they employ. If this simple principle cannot be honoured in practice, the international order cannot survive long.
Interventions like the one in Venezuela cannot be countenanced. The world must speak up.

During talks in Cairo, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan stressed their countries’ “identical” positions on “reaching peaceful solutions to the region’s crises”, an Egyptian presidency statement said.
They said solutions must “preserve the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of states,” singling out Sudan, Yemen, Somalia and the Gaza Strip.
A recent internal conflict in Yemen involves the internationally recognised government and the separatist Southern Transitional Coun­­cil (STC).

Sisi welcomes Riyadh’s proposal to host ‘inclusive conference’ for southern groups

President Sisi on Monday welcomed Saudi Arabia’s proposal to host an “inclusive conference” for southern Yemeni groups, while Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty called for de-escalation and a Yemeni-led political settlement.
On Sunday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Saudi crown prince in a phone call that his country was ready to help dialogue between Yemen’s factions.
Erdogan told Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman during the phone call that Turkiye “is ready to contribute to efforts aimed at bringing parties together”, according to his office.
The STC has welcomed a call for dialogue by Saudi Arabia to end the recent military escalation. The STC said in a statement on Saturday that the Saudi initiative was a “genuine opportunity for serious dialogue” that could safeguard “the aspirations of the southern people”.
Tarek Saleh, a member of the Yem­en Presidential Council, met Saudi Defence Minister Prince Khaled bin Salman and exchanged viewpoints on Yemen.
They discussed means to bolster joint efforts to support the stability of the country and the region’s security.
Yemen’s government on Sunday accused the separatists of cutting off the city of Aden and warned it would “take all necessary measures” after recapturing territory from them in the east on Saturday.

The announcement was made on Monday by PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh during a press conference at party headquarters, Insaf House, where senior leaders vowed to take Imran Khan’s “clear and unequivocal” message directly to the people.

 

Framing the tour as a turning point, Mr Sheikh said Imran Khan had personally entrusted CM Afridi with the mission of mobilising the masses and challenging what the party described as an assault on the public mandate.
“PTI is not a party of one province or one city. From Karachi to Kashmore, from Hyderabad to Thar, Imran Khan’s message will echo through the streets of Sindh,” he added.

Haleem Adil says KP chief executive will tour Karachi and other cities from Jan 9 to 11

According to the announced schedule, CM Afridi will depart from Islamabad on Jan 9 and arrive in Karachi at around 11am, where he will be received by party workers and supporters. A rally will then accompany him to Insaf House, followed by a series of meetings with party leaders and delegations.
His Karachi engagements include interactions with traders at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a Meet with the Press at the Karachi Press Club, and street movements across districts South, Korangi and Malir.
He is also expected to meet incarcerated PTI workers, which the party says underscores its campaign narrative of resistance and sacrifice.
The momentum will carry into Jan 10 as CM Afridi travels to Hyderabad. On his route, he will be welcomed in Jamshoro by Sindh United Party President Syed Zain Shah.
The Hyderabad leg features street protests in Kotri, addresses to the High Court Bar Association and Press Club, meetings with journalists, intellectuals and farmers, and a gathering at Insaf House Hyderabad.
An ISF convention and city-wide street mobilisation are also planned before CM Afridi returns to Karachi later that night.
On Jan 11, the focus shifts back to Karachi, with organisational meetings, media talks and street movements planned in District Central, Keamari, West and East.
The KP chief minister will also visit Mazar-i-Quaid, where he is expected to address supporters, while the PTI Youth Wing launches a special mobilisation drive.
The PTI Sindh chapter president said that a meeting between the chief ministers of KP and Sindh is expected on Jan 12, pending official confirmation.
He added that senior PTI leaders, including Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja, ministers, and parliamentary leaders, will accompany CM Afridi throughout the tour.
Warning against any obstruction, Mr Sheikh said PTI hoped the Sindh government would avoid “fascist tactics,” stressing that public mobilisation was a constitutional right.
Declaring February 8, 2024 a “black day”, he said the party was united and ready to intensify its struggle for judicial independence and Imran Khan’s release.

PARIS: Iran refused on Monday to offer “rioters” leniency while defending citizens’ right to demonstrate, a defiant stance taken after US President Donald Trump warned Tehran would “get hit very hard” if authorities killed more demonstrators amid deadly unrest.
Judiciary Chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei ordered officials to take a hard line against those causing instability as protests, which erupted over economic stagnation, expanded to include political demands.
“I instruct the attorney general and prosecutors across the country to act in accordance with the law and with resolve against the rioters and those who support them… and to show no leniency or indulgence,” Mohseni Ejei said, according to the judiciary’s Mizan news agency.
He added that Iran “listens to the protesters and their criticism, and distinguishes between them and rioters”.
Demonstrations have taken place in 23 of Iran’s 31 provinces, affecting at least 45 different cities to varying degrees.
The unrest has been concentrated in the west and consists mostly of small or medium-sized gatherings, according to an AFP tally based on official statements and media reports.
At least 12 people, including members of the security forces, have been killed in localised clashes since Dec 30, officials announced.
Since the protests began on Dec 28 — sparked when shopkeepers in the capital of Tehran staged a strike over high prices — officials have struck a conciliatory tone regarding economic demands while vowing to crush destabilisation.
Trump threats
Trump on Sunday told reporters aboard Air Force One that the US was watching the situation “very closely”.
“If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump said.
Iran’s economy has been hit hard by tough international sanctions.
The national currency, the rial, has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year, and inflation is in the double digits.
To alleviate economic pressure, the government announced Sunday a monthly allowance for every citizen equivalent to roughly 3.5 per cent of the average monthly wage.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country stood “in solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people and with their aspirations for freedom.”
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei, speaking at a press conference, accused Israel of trying “to exploit the slightest opportunity to sow division and undermine our national unity.”
Israel fought a 12-day war with Iran in June, which the US briefly joined with limited strikes on Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities.
Explosives seized
Police intelligence officers in Tehran have identified a suspected hideout used by “rioters,” seizing “weapons, ammunition, and materials for making improvised explosive devices,” according to Mizan.
The Fars news agency reported on Monday that “the trend observed on Sun­day night shows a notable decrease in the number of gatherings and their geogra­phic reach compared to previous nights.”
While videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify, local media’s accounting is not exhaustive, and state-run outlets have downplayed coverage of the demonstrations.
Most shops in Tehran were open Monday and residents went about their business. However, riot police were deployed at major intersections and officers were stationed outside some schools. Several universities have resumed classes, though only online.
The reformist newspaper Arman Melli said Monday that authorities had “heard the voices of the protesters”, while the conservative papers Javan and Kayhan accused the United States and Israel of financially supporting rioters.
Protests have also taken place among the Iranian diaspora.
“With each new protest, Iranian men and women gain ground,” Sahar Aghakhani, a 29-year-old French-Iranian translator, said at a demonstration in Paris on Sunday. “Movement by movement, we’re getting closer to the end of the regime.” Iran has experienced several outbreaks of nationwide protests in recent years, most notably in 2022 over the death in custody of Mahsa Amini for an alleged breach of the country’s strict dress laws for women. The current protests have not yet reached the same scale.

A sessions court on Monday granted pre-arrest bail to the qawwal after he was booked in a case for performing a song associated with ex-premier Imran Khan during a government-sponsored cultural event.
In the first information report (FIR), the complainant, Shalimar Gardens in-charge Zameerul Hasan, alleged that qawwal Faraz Amjad Khan gave the event a “political colour” as he sung “Qaidi No. 804” in reference to former prime minister Imran Khan. Additional District and Sessions Judge Shazaib Dar took up the bail application filed by the artist, who appeared before the court along with his lawyer.
Faraz’s counsel submitted that the petitioner had no affiliation with any political party and that he performed the song at the request of participants in the cultural programme.

Qawwal gets pre-arrest bail for singing a song linked to party leader; 7 wedding guests detained for raising slogans for Imran

He requested the court to grant pre-arrest bail to the singer as he wanted to join the investigation to “prove his innocence”.
After preliminary arguments, the judge allowed the bail till Jan 13 and sought the case record from the police.
Baghbanpura police registered an FIR on Sunday night against Faraz for performing the song ‘Nak Da Koka 2 Murshid’ at the “non-political” programme organised by the Walled City of Lahore Authority on Jan 3.
According to the complainant, the qawwal and his band members “deliberately sang an inciting political song without permission.”
The administration then asked the singer to stop, which sparked public unrest and incitement, posing a risk to law and order.
The case invoked Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace), and 505 (1b) (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
In the other incident, the Gujranwala district administration detained seven supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf after they chanted slogans carrying pictures of jailed party founder Imran Khan at a wedding function near Rahwali Cantonment.
Gujranwala Deputy Commissioner Naveed Ahmed, on the basis of a report from the Gujranwala police, issued the detention orders of seven PTI supporters under section 03 of the maintenance of public order (MPO) for the period of 14 days from January 03.
Earlier the local police had arrested the PTI supporters including Istikhar Ahmed of Talwandi Khajoor Wali, Tariq Mehmood of Lambawali, Kareem Bhinder of Rahwali, Zahid of Shareefpura, Imran Beig of Salamat Pura, Zeeshan of Kashmirpura and Ayaz of Tarragari. They were later sent to the Gujranwala district jail.
These detained people had chanted slogans in favour of Imran Khan while carrying his posters at the stage of a wedding ceremony of Hassan Malik in a banquet hall near Rahwali.
The local police reported to the administration that these PTI supporters had planned to stage a protest demonstration by blocking the main GT road in favour of the party leader.

KARACHI: After sealing the entire motorcycle market on Akbar Road, authorities on Monday sealed the automobilespareparts market off M.A.Jinnah Road near Tibet Centre, as well as hundreds of shops in other parts of the metropolis.
The expansion of the drive against encroachments — from owners of roadside eateries to traders who contribute millions in taxes daily — raised many eyebrows.
Officials claimed that as many as 86 shops in the autospareparts market were sealed because vehicles parked in front of the shops for repairs encroached on the main road, causing traffic snarls.
A similar reason was given by the authorities for sealing as many as 115 shops in the Akbar Road motorcycle market, which remained shut on Monday, as well as dozens of other shops in the city’s business district.
Deputy Commissioner South Javed Nabi Khoso said that the shopkeepers at Tibet Centre had been given warning three times to remove encroachments in front of their shops.
He claimed that most mechanics and electricians who worked on the roadside in front of the sealed shops were hired by shop owners, seeking to grow their businesses. “Due to double parking of vehicles, the road had become too congested, affecting the flow of traffic,” he said.
Shopkeepers told to submit affidavit
A meeting held on Monday decided that any shopkeeper who does not submit an affidavit providing written assurance of compliance with the standard operating procedures (SOPs) will not be allowed to open shops.
It was decided that shops which submitted undertakings to the DCs would be reopened in a phased manner and any establishment that violated the SOPs would have its premises sealed for three days.
The DC-South said that after the affidavit was submitted, any further breach of the SOPs would result in arrests and the registration of FIRs against the violators.
Officials said that the authorities had sealed as many as 196 eateries in different parts of the city during the past three days.
Karachi Commissioner SyedHassanNaqvi told Dawn that the city’s antiencroachment campaign would remain in force, and that no shop or eatery would be permitted to place articles or goods on walkways.
He said that the crackdown would continue to curb the growing trend of encroachments and obstructions on footpaths, roads and service lanes.
‘Action may harm economy’
However, traders dismissed the government action as unnecessary, warning that it would harm their businesses and the country’s economy.
Muhammad Sabir Shaikh, a former officebearer of the Motorcycle Dealers Association, said that showcasing automobiles and bikes in front of their outlets is a worldwide practice.
“Authorities should have marked a lane in front of the shops for displaying motorcycles,” he demanded.
“The whole exercise, under the guise of an antiencroachment drive, is simply aimed at raising rates,” alleged another bike dealer, without elaborating.

The meetings are crucial to the administration’s hopes of getting top US oil companies back into the South American nation after its government, nearly two decades ago, took control of US-led energy operations there.
The three biggest US oil companies — Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron — have not yet had any conversations with the administration about Maduro’s ouster, according to four oil industry executives familiar with the matter, contradicting Trump’s statements over the weekend that he had already held meetings with “all” the US oil companies, both before and since Maduro was seized.

 

“Nobody in those three companies has had conversations with the White House about operating in Venezuela, pre-removal or post-removal to this point,” one of the sources said on Monday.
The upcoming meetings will be crucial to the administration’s hopes to boost crude oil production and exports from Venezuela, a former OPEC nation which sits atop the world’s largest reserves and whose barrels can be refined by specially designed US refineries.
Achieving that goal will require years of work and billions of dollars of investment, analysts say.
It is unclear what executives will be attending the upcoming meetings, and whether oil companies will be attending individually or collectively.
The White House did not comment on the meetings but said it believed the US oil industry was ready to move into Venezuela.
“All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.
Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump told NBC News the US may subsidise oil companies to enable them to rebuild Venezuela’s energy infrastructure.
Asked if the administration had briefed any oil companies ahead of the military operation, Trump said, “No. But weve been talking to the concept of, ‘what if we did it?’”
“The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something,” Trump told NBC News.
“But we didn’t tell them we were going to do it.”
He told NBC News it was “too soon” to say whether he had personally spoken to top executives at the three companies.
“I speak to everybody,” he said.
CBS News, citing an unnamed source, said executives from the three were expected to meet on Thursday with Energy Secretary Chris Wright.
One oil industry executive told Reuters the companies would be reluctant to talk about potential Venezuela operations in group settings with the White House, citing anti-trust concerns that limit collective discussions among competitors about investment plans, timing and production levels.
Big plans, big problems
US forces on Saturday conducted a lightning raid on Venezuela’s capital, arresting Maduro in the dead of night and sending him to the United States to face narcoterrorism charges.
Trump said hours after Maduro’s capture he expects the biggest US oil companies to spend billions of dollars boosting Venezuela’s oil production, after it dropped to around a third of its peak over the past two decades due to underinvestment and sanctions.
But those plans will be hindered by lack of infrastructure, along with deep uncertainty over the countrys political future, legal framework and long-term US policy, according to industry analysts.
Chevron is the only American major currently operating in Venezuela’s oil fields.
Exxon and ConocoPhillips, meanwhile, had storied histories in the country before their projects were nationalised by former President Hugo Chavez.
“I don’t think you’re going to see any company other than Chevron, who’s already there, you know, commit to developing this resource,” said one oil industry executive, who asked not to be named discussing the issue.
Conoco has been seeking billions of dollars in restitution for the takeover of three oil projects in Venezuela under Chavez. Exxon was involved in lengthy arbitration cases against Venezuela after it exited the country in 2007.
Chevron, which exports around 150,000 barrels per day of crude from Venezuela to the US Gulf Coast, meanwhile, has had to carefully maneuver with the Trump administration in an effort to maintain its presence in the country in recent years.
Investors were optimistic, betting Washington’s move against Venezuela’s leadership would allow US firms access to the oil reserves.
A US embargo on Venezuelan oil remained in full effect, Trump said.
The S&P 500 energy index rose to its highest since March 2025, with heavyweights Exxon Mobil rising 2.2 per cent and Chevron jumping 5.1pc.</p><small>2026-01-06 03:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0608014981edf1b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965403/despite-risks-most-muslim-states-still-back-gaza-force' target='_blank'><strong>Despite risks, most Muslim states still back Gaza force</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Despite deep reservations and fears of domestic backlash, most Muslim-majority countries associated with the Gaza peace process want the proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to succeed, arguing that only such a force can ensure the security and survival of Palestinians in the besieged enclave, diplomats involved in the discussions told Dawn.
“Israel has already killed [more than] 70,000 people in Gaza, and only an international force with a clear mandate can stop this genocide,” said a diplomat from a Muslim nation, directly associated with the process.
Another diplomat acknowledged that participation in the ISF would place contributing states in an extremely difficult position, but said the alternatives were even bleaker.
“We know we would be pushed into a very difficult situation if we joined the ISF,” he said. “But the alternative is even worse — uninterrupted bloodshed in Gaza, and that’s not acceptable to us.”

Diplomats say the choice is a difficult one; warn that Palestinian blood will continue to flow in the absence of proposed ISF

A third diplomat said governments were under no illusion about the political costs at home. “We realise it will not be a popular war. We will be criticised at home too, but we have to get involved,” he said.
The ISF is a central pillar of a US-backed plan for “Phase 2” in Gaza, aimed at stabilising the territory after a ceasefire, training a Palestinian police force, overseeing demilitarisation, and enabling limited reconstruction.
Several Muslim countries — including Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Azerbaijan and Pakistan — are involved in discussions around the initiative, though most have stopped short of firm troop commitments.
Diplomats say broad conceptual support exists, but final decisions hinge on unresolved questions about the force’s mandate, authority, rules of engagement and command structure.
The ISF is expected to operate under UN Security Council Resolution 2803, which envisages enforcement of demilitarisation and provision of security, but details remain contested. Reports in the Western media have mentioned Indonesia and Azerbaijan as potential contributors, while Pakistan, Turkiye, Malaysia and Morocco have also shown interest.
Egypt and Qatar — both key mediators between Israel and Hamas — are engaged in talks on ISF’s command structure and have helped establish coordination mechanisms.

 

At the same time, resistance remains strong.
Israel has explicitly opposed the participation of Turkish troops, citing Ankara’s past political support for Hamas. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have reportedly declined to contribute forces, though both have attended planning conferences. Pakistan, for its part, has conveyed that disarming Hamas would not be its role.
Against this backdrop, The Washington Institute for Near East Policy shared with the media a series of assessments by its senior fellows, warning that without a credible ISF, Israel would insist on retaining broad freedom of military action in Gaza.
“If the ISF is not given a clear mandate and full enforcement powers, or if Hamas refuses to surrender its weapons, Israel will press for continued freedom of action against renewed rearmament efforts, a freeze on any planned Gaza reconstruction efforts beyond the yellow line, and freedom to remain in its current Gaza deployment zones until these issues are addressed,” said Neomi Neumann, an adjunct fellow at the institute.
Dennis Ross, a former special assistant to ex-president Obama, said demilitarisation would be the decisive test. “In the end, everything will likely hinge on implementing a credible approach to demilitarising Gaza — not only because Israel will demand it, but also because Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have made clear there will be no major Gulf investment in reconstruction so long as Hamas retains access to military weapons and infrastructure,” he said.
Mr Ross argued for a phased approach including the beginning of reconstruction in secured areas.
“Whatever the case, a comprehensive plan is needed that synchronises all of these moving parts,” he added.
Ms Neumann cautioned that many fundamentals were still unresolved.
“Still unknown, however, is which countries will agree to participate, under what conditions they will deploy, and at which specific locations,” she said, warning that the success of Phase 2 and the durability of any ceasefire would depend on “immediate security stabilisation, gradual disarmament, and the transfer of authority to a reformed PA — none of which are possible without a clear definition of the ISF’s mandate.”
Michael Jacobson, a senior fellow at the institute’s counterterrorism programme, said disagreements among US partners were also slowing progress.
“The United States, Jordan, and Egypt have each developed their own training plans, and Israel has yet to back any of them,” he said.
“To move forward, the Trump administration must get all of these governments on board with a consensus plan,” including clarity on command and control, formal authorities, and alignment between mission and capabilities.
Another unresolved issue is the future role of the Palestinian Authority.
Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at the institute, said Washington faced a delicate balancing act. “Allowing for an immediate PA operational role would go against the US plan and signal that Washington’s demands for PA reform are not serious,” he said. “Yet completely excluding the PA would serve Hamas’s goals and may face opposition from Arab states.”
Mr al-Omari suggested a compromise under which the PA initially plays a limited, symbolic role, such as appointing a liaison to a governing body overseeing Gaza’s transition.
For now, diplomats say, Muslim states remain torn between political risk and moral urgency. Yet many privately argue that without an international force on the ground, Gaza faces the prospect of prolonged devastation — a burden they say they are increasingly unwilling to bear.

A decade since China scrapped its stringent one-child policy and implemented a two-child policy in January 2016, the nation is dealing with a looming demographic crisis.
The country’s population has shrunk for three straight years, with the United Nations predicting it could fall from 1.4 billion today to 633 million by 2100.
There were just 9.54 million births in China in 2024 — half the number than in 2016 — and concerns about the shrinking and ageing population have been growing as couples choose to buck traditional Chinese norms.
More young people like Grace, who refers to herself and her husband as DINKs — or “dual income no kids” — have either sworn against having children at all or are putting it off for the next few years.
These couples’ reasons run the gamut from high child-rearing costs to career concerns.
Grace, who asked to be identified by her English name over fears of repercussions, said she needed to have a decent income and “some savings” before starting a family.
Without these conditions, “I wouldn’t even consider having kids”, the content creator added.
The term “DINK” has gone viral on Chinese social media, including Xiaohongshu, where its hashtag has received more than 731 million views, sparking differing views on the subject.
“If I were to widely publicise the fact that I’m a DINK and talk about how comfortable my life is, there would definitely be many people who wouldn’t be happy about it,” Grace said.
Changing attitudes
Chinese authorities have rolled out pronatalist incentives after ending their one-child policy — which had been in place for more than three decades to address poverty and overpopulation.
Top leaders have pledged more childcare relief, including subsidies to parents to the tune of $500 per year for every child under the age of three, state media reported in July.
Beijing also slapped a value-added tax on condoms and other contraceptives in January.
But experts say China, which was overtaken by India as the world’s most populous nation in 2023, still faces significant hurdles in boosting its birth rate.
“The number of people choosing not to marry or not to have children is increasing, and fertility intentions among the younger generation are weak,” He Yafu, an independent Chinese demographer, said.
Cultural constraints have limited the long-term effectiveness of China’s pronatalist measures, said Pan Wang, an associate professor at Australia’s University of New South Wales.
“The one-child policy fundamentally reshaped family norms and also people’s lifestyles, because many people, especially the one-child generation, were used to and often prefer smaller family sizes,” Wang said.

The images and information coming out about the failed attempt are enough to send shivers down the spine — 2,000kg of explosive material, packed into blue plastic drums and faux gas cylinders was found hidden under a pile of clothes on a ready-to-blow vehicle based improvised explosive device (VBIED).
The vehicle in question was a truck — known locally as a ‘Mazda’. Although VBIEDs are not often used by local terror outfits — given the logistical difficulty involved in preparing and transporting them — some of the deadliest attacks in the country’s history were perpetrated using them as a delivery mechanism.
The most obvious parallel can be drawn with the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, one of the deadliest attacks ever perpetrated in the capital.

Security analyst sees possibility of ‘operational synergy’ among groups such as the TTP, BLA and BLF as outfits shift focus back to civilian targets

I covered the aftermath of that bombing, which left a crater 34 feet deep and 59 feet wide at the main entrance to the hotel building.
At the time, I had interviewed a witness who told me that he was standing near the gate when a man started firing and at the same time a dumper appeared at the main gate. “I ran away from the scene to save my life but later heard an explosion.” The dumper caught fire and the security guards started extinguishing the fire. That was when the vehicle exploded.
The explosion had been heard clear across the city; there were casualties in Balochistan House — located across the road — and nearby PTV Headquarters as well.
Follow-up investigations revealed that around 1,000kg of explosive material had been used — a mix of ammonium powder, RDX and TNT, as well as mortar shells and artillery rounds.
Given the scale of that bombing, one can safely assume that if the attack on Karachi had occurred, the potential death and destruction it would have wreaked would have been off the charts.
The fact that the plot was foiled following a tip-off from intelligence agencies — a fact alluded to during the official CTD presser on Monday — is also a heartening development, indicating that security agencies are actively working to keep Karachi safe from terrorists.
In recent years, urban centres such as Karachi and Lahore had been largely spared any major attack on civilian targets, as was the norm in the late 2000s and early 2010s.
Over the past couple of years, terror outfits across the country had seemingly shifted their focus to security forces, targeting their positions rather than softer, civilian targets.
However, the discovery of the Karachi terror plot seems to indicate a return to form for these nefarious groups.
Talking to Dawn, security analyst Imtiaz Gul said that it was quite likely that militants would again start targeting civilians.
“If we believe the official version, that it was the BLA that planned this subversion, it makes things pretty obvious that they have chosen to inflict damage in non-Baloch areas so as to not to annoy their own population.”
This, he recalled, is what happened to the TTP, Ahrarul Hind and similar smaller groups after they targeted both civilians and the security apparatus — it generated widespread resentment and rejection among the masses and they were forced to change their tactics.
Given the scale and ambition of the terror plot, one of the theories doing the rounds alludes to a possible collaboration between multiple terror outfits, since it would be quite a challenge for any one group to assemble a VBIED of this scale and smuggle it into a well-guarded city like Karachi.
When asked about the possibility, Mr Gul said there was “very obvious operational synergy among groups such as the TTP, BLA and BLF who are believed to be the critical links in the externally-driven proxy terrorism that Pakistan is facing”.
This also means these groups and their handlers are imparting training and techniques for subversive activities, he noted.

The order prohibits public gatherings of five or more people. Authorities also banned the operation of unregistered motorcycles and the covering of faces in public using masks or mufflers.

The dispute emerged in November 2020 when the CCP — an independent regulatory body established in 2007 under the Competition Act with an objective to ensure a level-playing field in markets by preventing anti-competitive practices such as cartels, deceptive marketing and mergers that may harm competition — issued identical show-cause notices to the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) and different sugar mills across the country, accusing them of violating Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2010, which bans cartelisation.
A four-member CCP panel after hearing the case had a split decision in August 2021 whereby two members, including then chairperson Rahat Kaunain Hassan, found the mills guilty and the remaining two members sought a fresh inquiry. However, the chairperson cast a deciding vote that resulted in the imposition of Rs44 billion fines on almost 72 sugar mills for alleged manipulative practices.
The sugar mills challenged that decision before the appellate tribunal, which in May 2025 ordered a new hearing by a member who had not signed either opinion. In September, the SC struck down the tribunal’s order and CCP’s casting-vote decision, and while annulling the fines referred the matter back to the ‘tribunal’ for fresh proceedings based on the original 2020 notices.
Instituted by senior counsel Asma Hamid, the review petition sought a clarification on the SC’s decision to remand the matter to the tribunal instead of the CCP for fresh hearing.
The review petition pleaded that the power to make an order on the basis of inquiries/show cause notices vests with the commission in exercise of its powers under Section 30 of the Competition Commission Act, 2010. It is in exercise of powers vested in the commission that the inquiries were conducted and show cause notices were issued, orders made and penalties recovered for the contraventions of the act committed by the parties (sugar mills), it argued.

The US had launched a shock military operation in Venezuela on Saturday, with special forces capturing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in a nighttime raid.
Pakistan’s Acting Permanent Representative Ambassador Usman Jadoon said in his address that at a time when the world was already facing multiple crises, instability in the region “does not augur well for regional and international peace and security”.
He reminded Council members that the UN Charter bound states to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, and to uphold sovereign equality, non-interference in internal affairs and the peaceful settlement of disputes.

Ambassador Jadoon added that unilateral military action contravened these “sacrosanct principles” as well as the doctrine of sovereign immunity, warning that such actions set dangerous precedents and risked eroding the foundations of the global legal framework.
He cautioned that such actions also fuel instability, which, “as history has shown time and again, can lead to unpredictable and uncontrollable outcomes for years to come“.
Calling for de-escalation, the Pakistani envoy said that at this critical juncture, “the path forward must be one of dialogue and diplomacy,” stressing that durable solutions to political differences could only be achieved through peaceful means and with full respect for the will of the Venezuelan people, free from external interference.
He expressed hope that Latin America and the Caribbean, recognised as a ‘Zone of Peace’, would remain free from conflict and confrontation and continue moving towards enhanced regional cooperation and improved prosperity.

Pakistan urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint, de-escalate tensions, refrain from actions that could exacerbate the situation, and engage in dialogue, including by utilising sincere offers of mediation.
Jadoon noted that the offices of the secretary-general remained available for that purpose.
Concluding his remarks, he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to contributing constructively to the Security Council’s primary responsibility for addressing threats to international peace and security by diffusing tensions, promoting pacific settlement and upholding respect for international law and the UN Charter.
“Peace and stability of Venezuela and the welfare and prosperity of its people, with full ownership, must be the overriding objective of all efforts,” he said.
UN chief concerned about instability in Venezuela, legality of US operation
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres raised concerns about a possible intensification of instability in Venezuela after Maduro’s capture.
“I am deeply concerned about the possible intensification of instability in the country, the potential impact on the region, and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted,” Guterres said in a statement delivered to the council by UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo.







Guterres called on all Venezuelan actors to engage in an inclusive and democratic dialogue, adding: “I welcome and am ready to support all efforts aimed at assisting Venezuelans in finding a peaceful way forward.”
He also expressed concern that the US operation to capture Maduro in Caracas on Saturday did not respect the rules of international law.Pakistan urges restraint, dialogue on Venezuela
‘Surgical law enforcement operation’
As UN officials and several UN diplomats sharply criticised Washington’s intervention in Venezuela, US Ambassador Michael G. Waltz defended the action before the Security Council as a justified “surgical law enforcement operation”.
“If the United Nations in this body confers legitimacy on an illegitimate narco-terrorist with the same treatment in this Charter as a democratically elected president or head of state, what kind of organisation is this?” Waltz asked.
The US envoy said Washington had acted to apprehend two indicted fugitives, naming President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Celia Flores, and insisted the operation did not constitute a war against Venezuela or its people.
He described Maduro as a fugitive and the leader of a “vicious foreign terrorist organisation”, alleging links to international drug trafficking networks that use “illegal narcotics as a weapon”.

Waltz compared the action to the 1989 US operation that led to the arrest of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
Citing broader human rights concerns, the ambassador referred to allegations of extra-judicial killings, torture and arbitrary detentions in Venezuela, and said more than eight million Venezuelans had fled the country.
China’s representative said his country was “deeply shocked by, and strongly condemns” what he described as the United States’ “unilateral, illegal and bullying acts” against Venezuela.
He accused Washington of “wantonly trampling upon Venezuela’s sovereignty, security and legitimate rights and interests“, placing power above multilateralism and military action above diplomacy.
Warning of a grave threat to peace in Latin America and beyond, the Chinese envoy urged the United States to heed what he called the “overwhelming voice” of the international community and return to dialogue.
Russian Ambassador Vassily A. Nebenzia condemned the United States for what he called armed aggression against Venezuela in violation of international law, urging Washington to immediately release the “legitimately elected President” and his spouse.
Calling on Council members to abandon double standards, Mr Nebenzia warned against justifying “such an egregious act of aggression” out of fear of what he termed the “American global gendarme”.
He further accused the United States of seeking control over Venezuela’s natural resources, saying its actions were generating “fresh momentum for neocolonialism and imperialism”.
Following Maduro’s capture, US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Washington would govern Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition takes place”.
“We don‘t want to be involved with having somebody else get in and we have the same situation that we had for the last, long period of years,” the US president said. “So we’re going to run the country, until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition. We’re going to run it, essentially.”

The rally was organised by All Parties Kech in collaboration with traders, the Doctors Association and civil society.
Marchers moved through main roads and streets of the district headquarters of Kech district, starting from Officer Bazaar, passing through various routes, reaching the Press Club and then proceeding to Shaheed Fida Chowk, where the march turned into a protest.
“The protection of citizens is the responsibility of the state and its institutions,” National Party President Dr Abdul Malik Baloch said while describing the situation in Kech as “alarming”.

Political leaders warn of district-wide strike

Demonstrators demanded the recovery of two recently abducted youths, Haseeb Haji Yaseen and Shah Nawaz Gul Jan, and called on state institutions to protect citizens.
Mr Malik, while demanding the recovery, warned that attempts were once again being made to push Kech toward instability, but said the people of Kech would resist such efforts.
He urged the district administration to provide protection to citizens and said that for the past month, affected families and political leaders had approached relevant institutions, but each continued to shift responsibility to others.
All Parties Kech Convener Nawab Khan Shambezai announced that a district-wide strike would be observed on Jan 7 if the two youths did not return.
The Kech Bar Association boycotted court proceedings in solidarity with the families of the abducted.
Advocate Syed Majeed Shah, the association’s president, condemned the kidnappings.
Business activities and daily life have been severely disrupted by the recent wave of crime, according to local leaders.
Mir Ghafoor Ahmed Bizenjo, a former minister, said that citizens were “living under a sense of fear” and called on the state to ensure public safety.
Human rights defenders and other speakers at the rally said the insecurity affects the entire Makran region, demanding an end to the kidnappings that have particularly targeted the business community.

In its first of the kind “Fiscal Risk Monitoring Framework for Contingent Liabilities of PPP Projects”, in line with commitments made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the ministry’s Debt Management Office reported a total of Rs472.3bn in such liabilities as of Dec 2025.
More than 71pc (Rs335.6bn) of the total pertained to contingent liabilities of the Sindh government, which has the largest portfolio of 17 PPP projects — almost half of 36 across the country.

Total liabilities exceeded Rs472bn by end of last month

The federal government’s total contingent liabilities against PPP projects amounted to Rs90.6bn, or 19.3pc of the cumulative amount, followed by Punjab at Rs26.5bn (5.6pc) and Rs19.6bn (4.2pc of the total) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government.
Balochistan has no such liabilities, although its five projects were among the 36 total PPP project portfolio across the country.
In its latest written commitment to the IMF, the government had promised to improve the risk monitoring framework of public-private partnerships, including those at the provincial level.
“We will subject PPP-funded projects to the same rigorous selection criteria applied to projects funded through other sources”, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said, adding that Risk Management Unit (RMU) in the Ministry of Finance, in coordination with other stakeholders, was in the process of establishing a monitoring framework for quantifying contingent liabilities related to PPPs for publishing estimates by end-December 2025.
Contingent liabilities are those contractual obligations of the state for which public sector entities have assumed risks against these PPP projects and are calculated in nominal values calculated over the life of the contract.
Of the total liabilities, Rs368.3bn pertain to contingent fiscal responsibilities that may accrue due to minimum revenue guaranteed by the respective governments against a specific project, cost escalation, interest rate fluctuations or terminal liabilities, while another Rs104bn have been pitched as financial guarantees.
Cost escalation
The report suggests Sindh’s direct contingent liabilities because of cost escalation, minimum revenue guarantee and terminal liabilities stand at Rs255.5bn, accounting for close to 70pc of the Rs368.3bn consolidated national amount. Sindh’s largest risk exposure for contingent liabilities stems from cost escalation estimated at Rs146.6bn, followed by Rs61bn for minimum revenue guaranteed by the provincial government to private partners.
This is in addition to about Rs80bn in financial guarantees.
The federal government’s total PPP liabilities of Rs90.6bn include Rs83.7bn on account of termination liabilities and Rs7bn in financial guarantees. Financial guarantees are instruments issued against a financial commitment agreed to be undertaken by the public sector like viability gap financing support.
The report highlighted ‘high’ risk of these contingent liabilities becoming actually due on account of Rs150bn each for cost escalation and termination liabilities, Rs104bn on account of financial guarantees and about Rs66bn for minimum revenue guarantees, led by Sindh with Rs61bn.
IMF stipulation
The framework is required under the IMF programme to establish a consistent system for identifying, quantifying, and reporting contingent liabilities arising from PPP projects at both federal and provincial government levels.
This is because the PPP contracts can create fiscal exposures that do not immediately appear in budget or debt statements, but could materialise later through guarantee calls, revenue support mechanisms, indexation adjustments or termination-related payments.
The framework provides a uniform methodology to classify and quantify both direct and contingent liabilities and to consolidate these into a single national PPP fiscal exposure dataset managed by the RMU of the Ministry of Finance.

A two-member BHC bench comprising Chief Justice Muhammad Kamran Mulakhail and Justice Gul Hassan Tareen ordered the suspension of the provincial government notification during the hearing of a petition filed by senior advocate Rahib Khan Buledi, chairman of executive committee of the Balochistan Bar Council, challenging the provincial government move. 
Advocates Iftikhar Ahmed Langove and Abdul Baseer Kakar also filed similar petitions in the high court. 
In their petitions, the petitioners challenged the notification issued by the Balochistan government on December 30, 2025, under Section 22 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). 
The notification appointed all divisional commissioners, additional commissioners, deputy commissioners, additional deputy commissioners, and assistant commissioners as Justices of Peace within their jurisdiction. 
The notification also authorised them to perform functions under Sections 22-A and 22-B of the CrPC.
Counsel for the petitioners pleaded that the notification was issued unilaterally, without consultation or approval from the Chief Justice of Balochistan High Court, in violation of Articles 175(3), 202, and 203 of the Constitution. 
They pointed out that under existing law, sessions judges and designated additional sessions judges already serve as ex-officio Justices of Peace, and that granting such judicial powers to executive officers undermines the constitutional principle of separation of powers and threatens the independence of the judiciary.
They further contended that although Section 22 of the CrPC allows the government to appoint Justices of Peace in rural areas, such appointments must follow proper rules defining their powers and limitations. They argued that the impu­gned notification has effectively created a parallel judicial system by vesting judicial authority in executive officials.
The BHC bench admitted petitions for hearing and issued notices to respondents, and ordered that the notification would stay suspended until the next hearing of the case. 
It also directed that copies of the court order be sent to respondents and the office of the advocate general for information and compliance. The matter is expected to be taken up again after the winter vacation.

During the proceedings, Rehman refused to comment on previous statements by incumbent ministers and an ex-army official that touched upon the issue of missing persons, negotiations with rights activists and criticism of the military.
The statements were referred to by Chattha, who along with Mazari, cross-examined Rehman during today‘s hearing from the defence’s side.
Chattha and Mazari have been facing legal proceedings in the case on accusations of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
The first information report (FIR) of the case, registered with the NCCIA under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka presided over the hearing of the case today, during which Hadi referred to a Dawn report dated July 31, 2025. The report carried statements by Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb and the Jama­at-i-Islami (JI) Emir in Balochistan Maulana Hidayatur Rehman.
The JI leader also led the Haq Do Balochistan Tehreek, which was the subject of Dawn’s July 31 report and had been carrying out a protest march from Quetta to Islamabad, calling for an end to humiliation in the name of security and the release of rights activist Dr Mahrang Baloch and other detainees, among other demands.
The report said the Haq Do Balochistan had agreed to stage a protest camp outside the Lahore Press Club while a high-level federal government committee would hold talks with Maulana Hidayatur Rehman.
It said the announcement was made by Auragzeb, who assured the JI leaders that the Punjab government fully supported the legitimate demands of the people of Balochistan.
The report also quoted Maulana Hidayatur Rehman as saying that he hoped Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, who had previously raised her voice for Balochistan’s missing persons while in opposition, would continue that commitment as the provincial chief executive.
When Hadi asked prosecution witness Rehman to comment on the matter, he refused and said he would only offer an opinion if such a case came before him.
Chattha then cited statements attributed to Minister of State for Law Barrister Aqeel Malik carried in a report by Arab News regarding negotiations with Mahrang Baloch, who has vocal about the issue of enforced disappearances.
Chattha was apparently referring to a February 2025 report at that instance, which quoted Malik as saying that the government would engage with Mahrang and her Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) movement, provided it did not have an “ulterior motive“.
But, Rehman refused to comment on that as well.
Several videos were also played in the court, including one of Punjab CM Maryam’s speech. Slogans such as “uniform is behind terrorism” and “Bajwa is a thief” could also be heard in the clip.
When asked whether such an event would amount to opposing the state, Rehman said he would comment only after reviewing the video in an official capacity.
He also admitted that he was unaware whether enforced disappearances was a serious issue in Pakistan, whether a commission on missing persons existed, or what the state policy on the matter was.
A video showing an event of the outlawed Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi were also played during the hearing. Police were seen facilitating arrangements in the video.
But the witness also declined to comment on that, maintaining that he would respond only if the matter formally came to him.
He also claimed ignorance about the banned status of the two groups.

 

Then, a statement by former director general of Inter-Services Public Relations Asif Ghafoor regarding missing persons was played, but Rehman refused to comment on that as well.
During cross-examination, Rehman told the court that he had an MPhil degree in computer science, had undergone departmental training and attended workshops on Peca, cybercrime, and the Criminal Procedure Code.
However, he had not received any training or attended workshops related to enforced disappearance cases, the witness said.
When asked to define the term “state”, the witness said to his understanding, it referred to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
He was then asked to identify any X post by Mazari or Chattha containing “explicit anti-state content”. To that, Rehman responded that the posts’ subject “pertains to a narrative” and they had no mention of any “armed struggle” against the state.
Rehman also acknowledged using the term “disinformation vector” in his report regarding the case, but he failed to explain the term when pressed to do so. He said he could not elaborate on it “right now.”
The witness further testified that the content under scrutiny was based on “manipulation” and said that the individuals named in his report were those who had reposted Mazari’s posts.
At a later point in the hearing, he said he had not mentioned any person other than the relevant accused in his report.
He said to his knowledge, all posts under scrutiny supported the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other banned outfits.
However, when a specific post from the case file was read out, the witness conceded that neither the BLA nor the TTP was explicitly named, but insisted that the post was against the state.
The witness also admitted he could not recall the date when “Mahrang was banned”, though he said he had checked the National Counter Terrorism Authority’s website while preparing the report.
He asserted that sharing statements of banned organisations or individuals constituted a crime.
Following the completion of his cross-examination by Mazari and Chattha, the court adjourned the hearing until January 7.</p><small>2026-01-05 16:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643415-invasive-alien-fish-spreading-in-pakistani-waters-threatening-biodiversity' target='_blank'><strong>Invasive 'alien' fish spreading in Pakistani waters, threatening biodiversity</strong></a><br><p>

Sporting a traditional black and white keffiyeh scarf, Zomlot told the ceremony this is “not merely a change of name”, but a “change of direction” towards Palestinian statehood.
“What a way to begin a new year together, marking a profound milestone in the British-Palestinian relations, and in the Palestinian people’s long journey to freedom and self-determination,” Zomlot said, before unveiling the embassy’s new plaque.
“This is a day of hope, a day of steadfastness, and a day that reminds the world that peace is not only possible, it is inevitable … when rooted in justice, dignity, equality and mutual recognition.”
The UK’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an AFP query on whether the UK planned to follow suit by opening a British embassy in the Palestinian territories.

Speaking just after Zomlot at a lectern flanked by Palestinian and British national flags, UK diplomatic representative Alistair Harrison said the occasion represented a “moment of hope”.
“This is the beginning of a step change in our bilateral relationship,” he said. “I wish you ambassador, and your team, a very happy stay in what is now your embassy, and congratulations.”

According to Senior Superintendent of Police (West) Tariq Illahi Mastoi, the water tanker driver was speeding on a street in Manghopir when he hit the boy.
The boy sustained critical injuries and died on the spot, he added.
Police apprehended the driver and impounded the vehicle, according to a statement issued by police.
The body of the minor was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for medicolegal formalities.
Last week, a female motorcyclist was killed after being hit by a trailer. Quaidabad’s Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammad Ali Shah told Dawn that the driver of a 10-wheeler hit the 20-year-old female motorcyclist on the main Mehran Highway near MN Textile in Landhi.
A total of 803 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in Karachi in 2025. The Karachi traffic police, however, maintains that the situation began to improve during the latter half of the year.
In its annual road accident report, the department recorded a noticeable decline in both fatalities and injuries, attributing the improvement to stricter enforcement, data-driven interventions, and closer coordination with transport stakeholders. According to official figures, 477 people lost their lives in traffic accidents during the first six months of the year, compared to 326 fatalities in the second half.</p><small>2026-01-05 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05175829b83e70d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965258/sindh-ctd-says-major-terrorist-plot-in-karachi-foiled-2000kg-of-explosive-material-seized' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh CTD says major terrorist plot in Karachi foiled; 2,000kg of explosive material seized</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Monday that a major terrorist attack had been averted in Karachi.
Addressing a press conference alongside CTD Additional Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Ali Larik in Karachi, CTD Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Ghulam Azfar Mahesar said that law enforcement agencies and the “premier intelligence agency” received information that terrorists were planning an attack to target the city.
Mahesar said that the terrorists were planning to attack specific targets in Karachi to “destabilise” national security. He said that intelligence agencies, the Special Branch, the Intelligence Bureau as well as Sindh and Balochistan CTD designed a strategy to thwart these plans.
He said that intelligence officials were deployed in different locations, while focusing on Karachi’s west region.
Mahesar said that after several days of robust efforts, officials succeeded in getting information on a terrorist hideout in Raees Goth, Karachi, where terrorists had prepared a large amount of explosive material.
He said that upon receiving the information, Sindh CTD and the “premier intelligence agency” conducted a joint raid.
“We captured one terrorist, while three or four of them managed to escape the scene,“ he said. Mahesar affirmed that the agencies had initiated a search operation to ensure their capture.
“The officials recovered a Mazda truck loaded with explosive materials,” he said. He said 30 drums filled with explosives, five cylinders filled with explosives, 2,000kg of explosives and detonators had been seized.

He said that raids were conducted on six sites on the information provided by the terrorist who was arrested, after which another two terrorists were captured, who were also in possession of explosive material.
He said a total of three terrorists had been arrested.
Mahesar said that during the initial interrogation, the terrorists revealed that they were associated with the Bashir Zeb network of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the Majeed Brigade.

The CTD official said that the additional interrogation and investigation was under way, and authorities were conducting raids to make more arrests. He further said that facilitators and handlers of this terrorist network were identified.
“All the planning regarding the attack was done from outside the country,“ he said. The CTD official said that the facilitators and the handlers involved had been identified, adding that several teams were working on their arrest.

He said that the explosive material that was shifted to the metropolis was “ready to go”, adding that this was a major achievement of all agencies that had prevented a major attack in Karachi.
He said that the explosive material seized was “a mix”, saying that some of it was an amalgam of commercial explosives and other items, while some of it was smuggled through Balochistan’s mountainous regions.
The CTD official said that more details on this would be shared at a later date.</p><small>2026-01-05 14:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643387-indian-woman-married-to-pakistani-man-taken-to-wagah-after-visa-expired' target='_blank'><strong>Indian woman married to Pakistani man taken to Wagah after visa expired</strong></a><br><p>

In the first information report (FIR), the complainant, Shalimar Gardens in-charge Zameerul Hasan, alleged that qawwal Faraz Amjad Khan gave the event “political colour” as the song mentioned “Qaidi No. 804” in reference to former prime minister Imran Khan.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Shazaib Dar took up the bail application filed by the artist today, who appeared before the court.
Amjad’s counsel submitted that the petitioner has no affiliation with any political party and that he performed the song at the request of participants at the cultural programme.
He further requested the court to grant pre-arrest bail to the singer as he wanted to join the investigation to “prove his innocence”.
After preliminary arguments, the judge allowed the bail and sought the case record from the police.

 

The Baghbanpura police registered an FIR on Sunday night against Faraz for performing the song ‘Nak Da Koka 2 Murshid’ at the “non-political” programme organised by the Walled City of Lahore Authority on January 3.
According to the complainant, the qawwal and his band members “deliberately sang an inciting political song without permission.”
The administration then asked the singer to stop, which sparked public unrest and incitement, posing a risk to law and order.
The case invoked Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace), and 505 (1b) (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2026-01-05 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0516552338009d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965268/greenland-says-no-more-fantasies-about-annexation-after-trump-remarks' target='_blank'><strong>Greenland says ‘no more fantasies about annexation’ after Trump remarks</strong></a><br><p>Greenland’s leader declared “enough is enough”, and Denmark’s allies in Europe affirmed that the Arctic island’s future must be determined by its people, rebuffing renewed remarks by US President Donald Trump about acquiring the vast territory.
Trump spoke a day after the US special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a stunning raid, with Trump stating that Washington intended to oversee governance of the oil-rich Latin American country. The US operation rekindled concerns in Denmark that Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, might face a similar scenario.
Trump has repeatedly said he wants to take over Greenland, an ambition first voiced in 2019 during his first presidency. On Sunday, he told The Atlantic magazine in an interview: “We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence.”
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early on Monday, Trump said he would revisit the topic in a few weeks.
“Threats, pressure, and talk of annexation have no place between friends,” Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Facebook late on Sunday.
“Enough is enough. […] No more fantasies about annexation.”



On December 21, Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland. Landry has publicly expressed support for incorporating Greenland into the US.
Greenland’s strategic location between Europe and North America makes it a critical site in the US ballistic missile defence system. The island’s significant mineral resources also align with Washington’s ambition to reduce dependence on Chinese exports.
Support for Denmark and Greenland came swiftly from Nordic and Baltic leaders following Trump’s latest remarks.
President Alexander Stubb of Finland posted on X late on Sunday: “No one decides for Greenland and Denmark but Greenland and Denmark themselves. Our Nordic friend Denmark and Statsministeriet (Prime Minister’s Office) have our full support.”







France also expressed solidarity, saying Greenland belonged to the people of Greenland. President Emmanuel Macron said last June during a visit to Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, that the island was threatened by “predatory ambition”.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Sunday that US comments about needing to take over Greenland made “absolutely no sense”.
Protection of Greenland will be discussed within Nato if needed: Germany
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Monday that Greenland belonged to Denmark and that the Nato alliance could discuss strengthening its protection if necessary.
Wadephul was speaking after US President Donald Trump made renewed threats to take over Greenland.
Speaking to reporters in Lithuania, Wadephul said Germany had questions about Maduro’s removal and stressed the Venezuelan people should determine their country’s future in free and fair elections, after Trump said the US would run the country.
On Greenland, Wadephul stressed it was part of Denmark.
“And since Denmark is a member of Nato, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to Nato defence,” he said.
“And if there are further requirements to strengthen defence efforts concerning Greenland, then we will have to discuss this within the framework of the alliance.”

The joint statement came after the conclusion of the 7th round of the Pakistan-China Foreign Mini­sters’ Strategic Dialogue, for which Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar travelled to Beijing.







“The two sides called for more visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan which continue to pose serious threats to regional and global security, and prevent terrorist organisations from using the Afghan territory for terrorism against any other country and to endanger any other country,” the statement said.
“The two sides agreed to keep in close communication and coordination on the Afghan issue, work with the international community to encourage the Afghan government to build an inclusive political framework, adopt moderate policies, focus on development, pursue good-neighbourliness, and play a constructive role in helping Afghanistan achieve stable development and integrate into the international community,” it added.
The statement also said that China commended the measures taken by Islamabad to combat terrorism and protect the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.
“China fully recognised the significant contributions and huge sacrifices that Pakistan made in combating terrorism over the years,” it said.
“The two sides reiterated their commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with zero tolerance, and agreed to further deepen all-round cooperation on counter-terrorism and security, and make concerted efforts to ensure that the China-Pakistan Belt and Road cooperation advances in a secure and smooth manner,” it said.
“Calling on the international community to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation, the two sides expressed their firm opposition to double standards on counterterrorism,” it added.
Both countries also expressed the readiness to continue leveraging the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral foreign ministers’ dialogue and the China-Bangladesh-Pakistan cooperation mechanism to “deliver new outcomes”.
Pak-China agree to enhance communication
According to the communique, during the dialogue in Beijing, the two sides engaged in a “thorough exchange of views on bilateral relations and cooperation in wide-ranging areas, including strategic and political cooperation, as well as cooperation on defence and security, economy, trade, investment, and cultural and people-to-people exchanges”.
Pakistan and China “agreed to enhance strategic communication, deepen strategic mutual trust, jointly safeguard their common interests, promote the economic and social development of the two countries,” it said.
They also called for the safeguarding and advancing “peace, development and prosperity of the region and beyond”.
Pakistan and China also marked the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, with the launch of commemorative activities, the communique said.
It added that the anniversary was an “opportunity to consolidate China-Pakistan friendship and expand new areas of cooperation”.
Pakistan also congratulated China on the “successful conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan” under the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Pakistan also lauded China for its “people-centred development philosophy”, the communique said, adding that Pakistan also believed that the “Chinese path to modernisation provided a new option and practical solution for other developing countries to achieve independent development”.
China also commended Pakistani leadership on “leading the country to achieve macroeconomic stability and to lay a solid foundation for national economic growth centred on Pakistan’s National Economic Transformation Plan (2024-2029) (URAAN Pakistan) and for its people to share the fruits of development and prosperity”.
Pakistan also reiterated its “firm commitment” to the one-China principle, stating that Taiwan is an “inalienable part of China’s territory”, the communique said.
“Pakistan firmly supports every effort of China to achieve national reunification, and opposes any form of ‘Taiwan independence‘ and any attempt to create ’two Chinas’ or ’one China, one Taiwan,” it added.
It also added that “Pakistan firmly supports China on the issues concerning Xinjiang, Xizang, Hong Kong and the South China Sea”.
The statement further added that China also “reiterated its steadfast support for Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity”.
China also renewed its commitment to supporting Pakistan in “pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions and achieving economic prosperity”.
The country also vowed to support “Pakistan in firmly combating terrorism and playing a bigger role in international and regional affairs”.
‘Upgraded version of CPEC’
The communique further said that the two sides also reached an agreement to “build an upgraded version 2.0” of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
They agreed to “further align their development plans and priorities”, the statement said.
According to the communique, the two nations outlined three key sectors: industry, agriculture, and mining.
They also called for pushing for the “building and operation of the Gwadar Port, smooth passage of the Karakoram Highway, and enhancing Pakistan’s capacity for sustainable development”.
The two nations pledged to “deepen cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, information technology, science and technology, cybersecurity, technical and vocational training and education, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges”.
During the course of the dialogue, it was also decided that the two countries will “take the year-round opening of the Khunjerab Pass as an opportunity to deepen two-way trade and people-to-people exchanges”.
They also agreed to “welcome third-party participation in CPEC cooperation that conforms with the modalities set by China and Pakistan”, the statement said.
The two countries also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the financial and banking sectors, including extending mutual support at regional and international multilateral financial forums, the communique added.
“Pakistan appreciated China for providing support for its fiscal and financial sectors,” it said.
On their cooperation in the field of space, the two sides “expressed satisfaction at their expanding space cooperation and for the expected early entrance of Pakistani astronauts into the China Space Station”.
“They agreed to explore space in a peaceful and mutually beneficial manner for greater economic and social development and prosperity,” the statement said.
In October, China announced it was going to arrange for a Pakistani astronaut to perform short-term missions as part of China’s space station missions.
Agree to uphold UN Charter, oppose unilateral actions
The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment towards upholding UN principles and international law, vowing to “oppose the plotted resurgence of fascism and militarism”.
They expressed “support for the postwar international order underpinned by international legal documents such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation and other principles of international law for the maintenance of world peace and security, and protect historical truth and international justice”.
They also underscored the significance of a South Asian “regional order underpinned by the UN Charter, international law, and the basic norms governing international relations”.
Pakistan and China also reiterated their “opposition to any unilateral actions, and reaffirmed the significance of maintaining peace and stability in South Asia and the necessity of resolving all outstanding disputes through dialogue and consultation”.
During the dialogue, Pakistan informed China of the latest developments in occupied Kashmir, with the latter reiterating that the dispute should be resolved “properly and peacefully in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements”.
According to the communique, the two countries “expressed readiness to conduct trans-boundary water resources cooperation under the principle of equality and mutual benefit”.
They also “emphasised the imperative of fulfilling international legal obligations”.
The statement added that the “significance of the maintenance of international and regional security and stability was reiterated”.
Pakistan and China also “reaffirmed their readiness to further enhance cooperation under the frameworks of the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Civilisation Initiative and the Global Governance Initiative”.
The two sides reaffirmed their commitment towards making the “global governance system more just and equitable, and join hands to build a community with a shared future for humanity”.
“Pakistan highly commended China’s efforts to safeguard developing countries’ right to sustainable development,” the joint communique said.
“The two sides expressed satisfaction over their cooperation within multilateral mechanisms such as the UN and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),” the statement read.
On that note, they agreed to “deepen coordination and collaboration to safeguard the common interests of developing countries and international fairness and justice”.
Pakistan and China also renewed their “commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, their support for multilateralism and free trade, and their opposition to hegemonism, bullying behaviours violating national sovereignty of other countries, the forming of ‘small circles’ and bloc confrontation”.
The communique said that China commended Pakistan on its “outstanding performance during its UN Security Council presidency”.
It also voiced “full support for Pakistan to work as the rotating president of the SCO from 2026 to 2027”, the statement said.
Reiterate support for Palestinian state
On the issue of Palestine, Pakistan and China called for an “unconditional, comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza” and stressed the significance of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.
The two countries called for the “implementation of the two-state solution with the establishment of an independent state of Palestine”.
“The two sides also expressed their concern at the situation in the occupied West Bank, and urged the need for urgently addressing it,” the communique said.
It added that Pakistan and China also “expressed willingness to work with the international community to make unremitting efforts for peace and stability in the Middle East”.
During the meeting, Dar thanked his counterpart for the “warm hospitality accorded to him and his delegation”.
“The two sides agreed to hold the next round of Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Islamabad next year on mutually convenient dates,” the communique concluded.
Dar meets mining delegation, visits embassy
During his visit to Beijing, the foreign minister also met with a delegation from China Minmetals Corporation (MCC) led by its Vice President Xu Jiqing, the FO said on Monday.
The FO said that the pair “held productive discussions on MCC’s ongoing and upcoming projects in Pakistan”.
During the meeting, Dar reaffirmed “Pakistan’s strong support for MCC in advancing mining investment and promoting value-added industrial development”.







Separately, Dar also met the Chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), Chen Xiaodong, where the pair “reviewed socio-economic development cooperation”.
During the meeting, they “lauded CIDCA’s contributions to Pakistan’s development”.
The pair also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening cooperation in education, space, livelihoods, IT, and disaster relief, including flagship initiatives to mark the 75th anniversary of Pakistan–China diplomatic relations.

Panjgur Assistant Commissioner Amir Jan said the IED was planted in a motorbike and added that three of the injured are in serious condition. “Two children are also among the injured.“
According to local police officials, a Frontier Corps vehicle, which was the probable target, escaped the attack and all personnel were safe.
A senior official of the local administration, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that the motorbike laden with the IED was parked near a pushcart in the main bazaar.
Another police official elaborated that the blast appeared to have been carried out through remote control.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.</p><small>2026-01-05 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643359-watch-woman-kidnaps-minor-child-from-karachis-civil-hospital' target='_blank'><strong>WATCH: Woman abducts minor from Karachi's Civil Hospital</strong></a><br><p>

The demonstrations began last Sunday in Tehran when shopkeepers staged a strike over high prices and economic stagnation, but they have since spread to other regions and expanded to include political demands.
“I instruct the attorney general and prosecutors across the country to act in accordance with the law and with resolve against the rioters and those who support them… and to show no leniency or indulgence,” Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said, according to the judiciary’s Mizan news agency.
He added that Iran “listens to the protesters and their criticism, and distinguishes between them and rioters”.
Protests have taken place in 25 out of Iran’s 31 provinces and affected, to varying degrees, at least 45 different cities, most of them small or medium-sized and concentrated in the west, according to an AFP tally based on official statements and media reports.
At least 12 people have been killed since December 30 in localised clashes, including members of the security forces, according to a tally based on official announcements, and there have been media reports of episodes of property damage in the west.

 

The Fars news agency said on Monday that “the trend observed on Sunday night shows a notable decrease in the number of gatherings and their geographic reach compared to previous nights”.
Local media’s accounting of the protests is not exhaustive, and state-run outlets have downplayed their coverage of the demonstrations, while videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify.
The national currency, the rial, has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year, while double-digit inflation has been undermining Iranians’ purchasing power for years.
The rial was depreciating again on Monday against the greenback after strengthening in recent days, according to the informal black-market rate, which stands at around 1.4 million rials, compared with about 770,000 a year earlier.

 

Publicly, officials have struck a conciliatory tone when it comes to protesters’ economic demands, while vowing to take a hard line against any chaos and destabilisation.</p><small>2026-01-05 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05162241750d61d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965262/mustafa-amir-murder-case-main-suspect-gets-bail-in-illegal-call-centre-case' target='_blank'><strong>Mustafa Amir murder case: Main suspect gets bail in illegal call centre case</strong></a><br><p>A judicial magistrate in Karachi on Monday granted post-arrest bail to Armaghan Qureshi, the prime suspect in the Mustafa Amir murder case, in a case involving an illegal call centre and credit card data theft.
Amir, 23, was allegedly kidnapped and murdered by his friends — Armaghan and Sheraz — in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Jan 6, 2025. According to the police, the youth’s friends stuffed his body in the trunk of his car and torched it in the Hub area of Balochistan.
A final charge sheet against Armaghan in the murder case was filed in August. Besides multiple other cases, Armaghan had also been implicated in the data theft case in a first information report (FIR) registered with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on April 16, 2025.
Judicial magistrate (South) took up Armaghan’s bail plea today. Advocate Khurram Abbas appeared as his defence counsel and informed the court that the investigation against the suspect had been completed in 2025.
“Not a single shred of evidence was presented against the suspect. Neither is there any complaint nor any private witness against the suspect,” the lawyer argued.
Subsequently, the magistrate approved Armaghan’s bail plea against surety bonds worth Rs100,000.

 

However, Armaghan will remain in jail as multiple cases against him are still pending in court. Besides the murder case, FIRs against Armaghan had also been filed over injuring policemen during a February shoot-out that resulted in his arrest, recovery of imported illegal weapons and money laundering.
In its FIR, the FIA had claimed that Armaghan was allegedly operating an “illegal call centre” in Karachi’s DHA. The FIA further alleged that the call centre was used for harassing people, engaging in fraudulent practices, identity impersonation, cheating, spoofing, phishing, and extortion.
It added that the employees of the said call centre were trained to impersonate officials from international agencies to extract sensitive information such as names, debit or credit details and social security numbers.
The FIA claimed that illegal transactions were carried out on the instructions of Armaghan alias Alex Boss.
Regarding the modus operandi, the agency stated that the suspect obtained financial information and processed it through the website www.oet.com to verify its authenticity. The credit cards were typically charged without any service being rendered, the FIA added.
In July 2025, the investigating officer (IO) of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed a judicial magistrate that Armaghan had rented two properties to set up call centres in Lahore and Islamabad after Amir’s murder.</p><small>2026-01-05 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/05165149e2f2159.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965254/opposition-leaders-appointment-pti-chief-whip-submits-documents-pertaining-to-omar-ayubs-cases-to-na-speaker' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition leader’s appointment: PTI chief whip submits documents pertaining to Omar Ayub’s cases to NA speaker</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar, shared with National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Monday documents pertaining to the withdrawal of cases concerning PTI’s Omar Ayub and again demanded Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party Chairperson Mehmood Khan Achakzai’s appointment as the opposition leader.
The development comes around a month after the NA Secretariat sent a letter to Dogar, seeking details about the status of cases concerning Ayub.
The letter said the provision of the details in writing is necessary for the completion of the process for the appointment of an opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.







According to a post on the NA’s X account, Dogar presented the documents to Sadiq today, and the two also exchanged views on matters related to the appointment of the opposition leader.
Dogar “once again” demanded that the Achakzai be appointed as the opposition leader, the post said, adding that Ayaz gave the assurance that “everything will be done in accordance with the law and the constitution”.
The statement further quoted Ayaz as saying that he would share information with the house on the matter at the next NA session.
“The process for the appointment of the opposition leader will be initiated afresh,” he said, adding that the rules of the NA regarding the appointment of the opposition leader were clear.
The post of the opposition leader in the NA has been vacant since the disqualification in August last year by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in connection with his conviction in the May 9 cases.
The same month, incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan had nominated Achakzai for the post of opposition leader and despite the PTI‘s insistence for his appointment, his notification remains pending.
Meanwhile, Ayub had challenged his disqualification in the Supreme Court (SC). But, he withdrew his plea in October last year.
For his part, Sadiq had maintained regarding the delay in the appointment of a new opposition leader that the matter was “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against his disqualification.
In its letter to Dogar last month, the NA Secretariat stated that the opposition had mentioned in Parliament that Ayub’s cases were not sub judice.
“However, this fact was not conveyed to the secretariat in writing,” the letter said, requesting that the current status of the cases in which the secretariat had been made a party be communicated to it in writing for the completion of the “prescribed process of the declaration of leader of the opposition in the National Assembly”.
‘No formal contact for talks’
Earlier today, NA Speaker Sadiq said that the opposition had not yet made formal contact for initiating talks with the government.
He made the remarks while speaking to the media, according to a handout issued by the NA Secretariat. It quoted him as saying that the “opposition had not yet made any formal contact to initiate a dialogue”.
“My role in the talks is only that of a facilitator,” he said.
Sadiq further stated that the committee system in the lower house of Parliament was fully functional as per constitutional requirements, adding that he was “completely independent” in his position.
On the topic of the appointment of the NA opposition leader, Sadiq said that four letters had been sent to the opposition’s chief whip in this regard. He said that after the fourth letter, the opposition had submitted a certified copy of their decision.







“The constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader will be initiated in the next parliamentary session,” Sadiq said.
He added that the process will move forward “after checking and verification of the signatures of the opposition members”.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
Subsequently, at a recent national conference organised by the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) opposition alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
The same day, political leaders from across the spectrum, including stalwarts from the ruling PML-N, called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.

 

However, the PTI later said that it would not engage in negotiations with the federal government, with the party’s Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram saying the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan.
Last week, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah had stated that “confidence-building measures” between five major players in the country would improve the overall political situation.
Bangladesh visit
The speaker also recalled his recent visit to Bangladesh for the funeral of the former prime minister of the country, Khaleda Zia. Sadiq and India’s External Affairs Minister Subrah­manyam Jaishankar had shaken hands during the visit, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May 2025.
“The Pakistani delegation received an unusually warm welcome from the people of Bangladesh,” Sadiq said.
He said that the Indian minister “came to greet him and shook his hand”.
Sadiq recalled that he also met with the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, terming the meeting “pleasant”.
He said the two “reached an agreement for the promotion of parliamentary and public relations” between the two countries during the meeting.
He further said that “he will always remember the love he received from the people of Bangladesh”.</p><small>2026-01-05 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643315-handshake-with-indian-fm-jaishankar-was-surprising-sadiq-tells-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Handshake with Indian FM Jaishankar was 'surprising', Sadiq tells PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>
