Addressing a press conference in Sialkot, the defence minister said, “A former head of ISI has been convicted in a trial that ran for 15 months; there are still other charges on which legal proceedings will be initiated soon.”
The defence minister assailed the former spymaster, claiming that the former prime minister was ousted through a “conspiracy”.
“The removal of Nawaz, the cases lodged against him, the allegations, and Imran’s coming into power, this whole project was enacted under the supervision of Faiz Hamed,” the defence minister said.
He said that Hameed, along with his “partner” Imran, was responsible for causing “significant damage” to the country. Asif also said that Hameed was “in charge of project Imran”, highlighting the 2018 general elections.
“Faiz was the most important part of that government,” the minister stated.
He recalled that during PTI’s tenure, the ex-spymaster facilitated the “imprisonment of opponents”.
“He used to threaten and imprison political opponents,” he said, stressing that Imran’s “vision” was materialised through Hameed. The minister alleged that Hameed’s main beneficiary was Imran.

At its core, the upgrade will allow the F-16s to operate safely and effectively for at least another decade and a half by extending their service life, strengthening secure communications, enabling real-time sharing of tactical data, and ensuring sustained maintenance through comprehensive parts, training, and support.
Enhanced mission planning and testing tools included in the package will also improve pilot proficiency and overall mission effectiveness. Beyond specific equipment, a substantial portion of the package is devoted to spare parts, maintenance, engineering, and logistics support.
This includes replacement components, repair parts, technical documentation, engineering assistance, and logistics services. Training for pilots and maintenance personnel, along with simulators and technical manuals, is also included to ensure sustained proficiency as systems evolve.
According to analysts, the equipment the US has agreed to provide will make Pakistan’s F-16s fully networked, interoperable, and operationally viable well into 2040.
The Brussels-based International Crisis Group (ICG) has described the package as “a continuation of a long-standing relationship,” highlighting “the need to maintain Pakistan’s F-16 fleet for regional stability, despite India’s concerns over its use against New Delhi”.
ICG analyst Praveen Donthi told Al Jazeera that “extending support for Pakistan’s jets remains a core part of US-Pakistan ties, with continuity from the Biden to the Trump administration”.
He added that the package includes advanced technologies and new avionics to keep the jets combat-ready until 2040 — a move India views as potentially strengthening Pakistan’s offensive capabilities.
According to Janes, a leading global provider of defence and security analysis, “the inclusion of Link-16 in the Fighting Falcons of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) would allow the aircraft to access networked information from command centres and ground units, enhancing their combat capabilities”.
Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia specialist, has said in interviews with several news outlets that while “the optics of the deal might suggest leverage” and could serve as a pressure point in US-India trade and defence negotiations, the package “has a logic of its own,” rooted in long-standing US support for Pakistan’s American-made aircraft.
Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) places the deal in a broader strategic context.
In a report released earlier this year, it said that between 2020 and 2024, more than 80 per cent of Pakistan’s weapons imports came from China, reflecting Islamabad’s growing reliance on Beijing for major defence platforms.
Chinese J-10 fighter jets played a prominent role in the May conflict, and Pakistan continues to diversify its air power in ways that reduce dependence on the United States.
A letter by the US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) sent to Congress on December 8 regarding the sale stated that it “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by allowing Pakistan to retain interoperability with US and partner forces in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and in preparation for future contingency operations”.
The letter noted that it will “maintain Pakistan’s capability to meet current and future threats by updating and refurbishing its Block–52 and Mid Life Upgrade F–16 fleet.”
It added that the updates will provide more “seamless integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force in combat operations, exercises, and training, and refurbishment will extend the aircraft life through 2040 while addressing critical flight safety concerns”.
The letter also emphasised Pakistan’s readiness to absorb the technology, stating that the country “has shown a commitment to maintaining its military forces and will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.” It also addressed regional concerns, asserting that “the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.”</p><small>2025-12-13 08:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/130818091008059.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960720/un-expert-decries-imrans-detention-calls-on-authorities-to-ensure-compliance-with-international-standards' target='_blank'><strong>UN expert decries Imran’s detention, calls on authorities to ensure compliance with international standards</strong></a><br><p>A United Nations’ (UN) special rapporteur warned on Friday that PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, calling on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
In September, his legal team approached the rapporteur to urge the Pakistani government to cease the alleged mistreatment of the couple.
Prime Minister’s Aide Rana Ihsan Afzal, however, dismissed the concerns of the UN rapporteur and said Imran was being kept “according to prison rules and the jail manual”.
“His children have access and he should schedule [a call] and put in the appropriate request. There is no issue or obstacle from the government of Pakistan,” said the premier’s aide.
He added that the PTI founder is being provided facilities “greater than his rights” as a B-class prisoner.
“He has the facilities of exercise available, good food is available and ample space is also available.”
The UN official, Alice Jill Edwards, urged Pakistan to take immediate and effective action to address reports of the 73-year-old’s inhumane and undignified detention conditions.
“I call on Pakistani authorities to ensure that Khan’s conditions of detention fully comply with international norms and standards,” Edwards said in a statement.

 

“Since his transfer to Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi on September 26, 2023, Imran Khan has reportedly been held for excessive periods in solitary confinement, confined for 23 hours a day in his cell, and with highly restricted access to the outside world,” she said. “His cell is reportedly under constant camera surveillance.”
“Khan’s solitary confinement should be lifted without delay,” she said.
UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself.
Imran’s supporters allege that he is being denied prison visits from lawyers and family, prompting multiple protests and sit-ins outside or near the prison.
Jemima says X’s AI confirms content linked to Imran is being throttled
Imran’s ex-wife, Jemimah Goldsmith, took to X and directly addressed platform CEO Elon Musk, informing him that the platform’s algorithm was limiting posts about the PTI founder, including those from her account.
“According to Grok — your own AI — ‘Every time you post anything about Imran’s jail conditions, solitary confinement or your son’s access to their father, the algorithm limits the post … the Pakistani authorities have made criticism from Imran Khan’s immediate circle one of their top online enforcement priorities, and X is quietly complying just enough to keep the platform alive in the country’,” she wrote, quoting the AI tool.
“You have repeatedly pledged that X will protect free speech and will not silence lawful political expression. Yet Grok has examined my X analytics … and concluded my account is subjected to what Grok calls ‘secret throttling’ — the algorithm deliberately hides my posts from almost everyone, even though the account is not suspended.”







Citing Grok, Jemima attached statistics with her post, stating that between 2023 and early 2024, she averaged 400–900 million impressions per month in engagement on her account, which has 3.5m followers.
However, when 2025 came around, impressions plummeted to 28.6m in total — a drop of over 97 per cent to only 3pc of her expected reach.
“The turning point was May 2025: one post spiked to 4m impressions the day Pakistan’s X ban ended — proving my audience was still engaged. Thereafter, impressions were instantly crushed to near zero and stayed there,” she wrote, requesting that Musk remove secret throttling from the platform.
Jemima also wrote that Imran has been imprisoned for 22 months and their sons, Kasim and Suleman, have been unable to meet him, speak with him, or even send letters.
“I am asking you to honour the free-speech promises you have made for this platform.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.</p><small>2025-12-13 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10234104c7d1a18.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959545/what-happens-when-you-let-women-live-alone-pakistan-needs-to-find-out' target='_blank'><strong>What happens when you let women live alone? Pakistan needs to find out</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s prolonged economic downturn is not driven by policy failures alone — it is also fuelled by the systematic underutilisation of its most capable women. Cultural norms that restrict women’s mobility, police their autonomy, and dictate their living arrangements, have become economic barriers, keeping productivity low and growth stagnant.
Pakistan could unlock this economic potential by confronting one of its most rigid social boundaries: women’s freedom to live independently in urban centres.
This article makes a case for a segment already positioned to contribute: urban, educated, skilled, and financially capable women, while recognising that many working-class women also live alone out of necessity or opportunity. Their struggles differ in context but not in significance, facing even harsher structural obstacles. Their participation in the economy is equally critical.
If accelerating growth, reducing brain drain, and closing gender gaps are national priorities, then enabling safe, viable independent living for women in major cities must finally be treated as an economic imperative.
The cost of excluding women
Pakistan’s female labour participation rate sits at a concerning 22.6 per cent for women aged between 15 and 64, which is significantly lower than the world average of 52.6pc, and even lower than the South Asian average of 25.2pc. According to the World Bank, a 10pc increase in female labour participation could increase Pakistan’s GDP growth by 1.5pc annually.
Countries with similar cultural foundations have already demonstrated this. Bangladesh leveraged female-intensive industries to improve GDP and reduce poverty levels. Saudi Arabia, after easing restrictions on women’s mobility and employment, saw an increase in billions to their economy within years. Vietnam attributed significant portions of its growth to educated women entering productive sectors at scale.
In Pakistan, however, even educated women frequently choose to opt out of the workforce or exit early. The reasons being predictable: restricted mobility, lack of safe transport, hostile work environments, and most crucially, a cultural expectation that they must live with their family until marriage, regardless of their professional needs.
“Being brought up in Pakistan, I was always told that I will go from my mother’s house to my husband’s house. The only interim freedom you get is if you go abroad for university,” reflected Elsa Sajjad, who lives with her sister in an apartment in Karachi. “I didn’t go abroad, but those who do, they get a taste of freedom and then it’s snatched back.”
While the decision to migrate abroad for better opportunities is understandable, the loss of these women — artists, academics, designers, lawyers, engineers, doctors — inflicts a drain on human capital Pakistan can no longer afford. Remittances soften the blow, but they do not compensate for the long-term erosion of youthful innovation, research capacity, and domestic talent pipelines.
If women had the option to live independently in city centres, closer to workplaces, training hubs, and universities, they would be less enticed to build their futures abroad.
Benefits of living alone
Ample evidence from across the world suggests that when educated women have control over their time, mobility, and finances, they are more likely to invest in skills development, career advancement, and entrepreneurship. Independent living for women in Pakistan, for those who can afford it, directly supports these outcomes.
“It made me grow up a lot faster than my friends. You’re working, you’re also paying your own electricity and gas bills, and you also have to keep savings aside in case of medical emergencies,” Sajjad pointed out.
Women in joint households shoulder disproportionate unpaid labour. Studies show Pakistani women spend up to 10 times more hours on domestic responsibilities than men. Living independently would allow women to reallocate this time toward networking, internships, freelance work, and degrees and certifications.
“I started my own company, which I could do because of the peace of mind I have. I don’t have to worry about silly things like household tiffs,” added Sajjad.
Women living alone in urban centres can avoid long commutes, unsafe travel, or family-imposed curfews that hinder employment. Living near business districts and transit hubs not only reduces transport costs and safety risks, but also increases workforce reliability, a crucial factor in gaining economic efficiency.
When educated daughters support themselves financially, families experience higher household income, reduced economic burden on parents, greater investment in the education of their younger siblings, and improved social mobility. Independent living also disrupts intergenerational poverty traps, especially for families who struggle to support adult daughters indefinitely.
“Not only am I supporting myself financially, but I can also support my mother,” Sajjad noted.
A rise in independent female tenants would expand rental markets, women-only hostels, co-living spaces, and local services such as laundries, transport, food, and security. This microeconomic ripple will strengthen the service sector, which is already Pakistan’s largest contributor to GDP.
Many women leave Pakistan not because they lack opportunity but because they lack agency over their lives. Facilitating independent living will keep human capital at home.
Living alone also compels women to confront the cycle of fear they have long been conditioned to stay within, ultimately making them more resilient and confident as they navigate the realities of household duties, maintenance issues, tenant rights, and even bribe-hungry police officers who try to take advantage of women driving alone.
“As a woman living alone in Pakistan, the law doesn’t always protect you,” Sajjad emphasised. “It pushed me to do things many women might not consider — like learning the basic laws every Pakistani woman should know. I studied workplace regulations, sexual harassment laws, and driving rules. There have been times when police tried to intimidate me, but now I know my rights and can stand my ground.”
The barriers: Real, serious, and solvable
A meaningful conversation around women’s independence and autonomy must acknowledge the barriers they face in attempting to live alone in Pakistan’s major cities. The most immediate challenge is financial. Even for educated, urban professionals, the cost of rent, utilities, transport, and basic living expenses can be prohibitive without the shared resource of a family household.
“Even the reason I have roommates is economic. I can’t afford rent by myself,” Yusra Amjad remarked, who rents an apartment in Islamabad to be closer to her place of employment.
The economic burden is compounded by discriminatory practices in the housing market, where landlords frequently refuse to rent to single women, demand the involvement of a male guardian, or impose intrusive questioning about marital status and daily activities — requirements less frequently applicable to male tenants.
It is also unconventional for unmarried men in Pakistan to live apart from their families, but the social implications based on gender vary greatly: women are often labelled as dishonourable and shameful, while men are praised as responsible and ambitious for prioritising their careers.
Safety remains an even more pressing concern. In many neighbourhoods across Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and other major cities, urban design offers little consideration for women’s security. Street harassment, break-ins, and the constant threat of gender-based violence dictate where women feel safe to live.
Even when a woman does find suitable housing, navigating the city independently brings its own set of risks. Public transport is often unreliable and unsafe, especially after dark, and ride-hailing services, while widely used, are not immune to harassment or predatory behaviour.
“I would call Careems and they were very unreliable. Some of the cars were very sketchy; I would get in and hope they wouldn’t break down,” recalled Maha Shahid, who once lived alone in her grandmother’s house in Karachi. “I would call them at the end of the street, never to my gate, because you never know who you’d get. I took little precautions like that, and I would always try to get out of the office before dark.”
In most cities, for those without a car, ride sharing is the only option. Trains, buses, and other forms of transport are inaccessible and widely unavailable, especially for women. For example, in Islamabad, a metro system has recently been established, but the stations are situated sparsely, and reaching them is another challenge.
“How am I getting to the metro? Am I calling an Uber to the metro? In New York you can walk to the bus. But here it becomes kind of counterintuitive,” said Amjad.
These constraints make late work hours, night classes, internships, and networking events far less unobtainable to women who rely on safe and reliable mobility to advance their careers.
Social scrutiny adds another layer of deterrence. Neighbours, building guards, and even extended family often view a woman living alone as a challenge to cultural norms, subjecting her to suspicion and moral policing. This informal yet pervasive surveillance fosters a hostile environment, deterring women who have the financial means and professional need to live independently. In an already conservative society, the perceived “impropriety” of a single woman managing her own home can translate into daily stress, reputational risk, and familial pressure to abandon the arrangement altogether.
“Women living alone are much more vulnerable in a country like ours. People are more likely to make judgements about their character,” relayed Amjad.
Yet, crucially, none of these barriers are insurmountable. They are symptoms of structural gaps — unregulated rental markets, insufficient women’s housing, inadequate urban planning, and a lack of gender-conscious transport policies — that can be addressed through both public reforms and private-sector innovation. Other countries with comparable cultural norms have expanded women-only hostels, implemented legal protections for single female tenants, strengthened public transport systems, and introduced safe co-living spaces that blend affordability with security. Pakistan can do the same. The obstacles are real, but so are the solutions.
Reframing the cultural conversation
Independent living for women in Pakistan is still seen as a radical challenge to cultural norms, but viewing it solely as a moral or social issue ignores its broader economic significance.
It is crucial to separate religious doctrine from cultural practice: Islam grants women the right to own property, enter contracts, manage finances, and make independent decisions about their livelihoods. The unease around women living alone, then, is not rooted in faith, but in inherited social norms that no longer align with the country’s economic realities.
At a time when Pakistan is grappling with shrinking productivity, declining competitiveness, and an accelerating brain drain, maintaining restrictive norms around women’s autonomy imposes a measurable financial cost. The issue is not whether tradition should be discarded, but whether our economic future can withstand the continued exclusion of half the population from fully participating in public and professional life.
“To me it’s not about feelings but about rationality. Often, I just wouldn’t understand the why. The why has to make sense to me. If the why is just a feeling you have, to me that’s not rational so I can’t just fall into line with what my mother says,” said Shahid, reflecting on the familial backlash she faced when deciding to live alone.
While this analysis primarily examines the economic case for women’s independent living, it is important to acknowledge that many women have no choice but to live alone due to unstable or controlling households, domestic abuse, divorce, or broader safety concerns
Let the women live
Pakistan still has a long road ahead before its cities are truly safe for women to live, work, and move through without fear or scrutiny. It also has a long way to go before women’s right to choose how they live is seen as acceptable, let alone normal.
In a country so deeply entrenched in culture, tradition, and religious routine, a break from conventions, especially by women, is often considered radical or defiant. Yet acknowledging the economic potential of independent living is a critical step toward unlocking the talent that already exists within our female population.
For the segment of women who are financially capable and professionally ambitious, living alone is a decision grounded in necessity, efficiency, and ambition — qualities any society striving for progress should value rather than resist.
“The two jobs that I had in Pakistan really set me up for success. I moved back to New England and got a six-figure salary job without even networking. My work experience in Pakistan really shaped me,” Shahid explained.
Understanding the benefits of female self-determination and highlighting stories of successful independent women can help normalise these choices. The journey is not easy, but the freedom and mobility it brings make it worthwhile. Challenging tradition is rarely comfortable, but clinging to the status quo no longer serves the country.
If Pakistan hopes to rebuild its economy, retain is skilled professionals, and participate competitively in a global landscape, it must allow its most capable women the freedom to structure their lives in ways that support their productivity.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the surge is driven primarily by influenza A(H3N2) and an emerging subclade known as subclade K, a drifted variant of H3N2 with multiple genetic changes from related viruses.
The WHO confirms that influenza activity has increased globally in recent months, with an early rise in flu activity being observed in several countries.
It is important to note that the current epidemiological data do not show that subclade K causes more severe disease than previous strains. However, its early spread ahead of the typical season curve is important, and vaccination remains one of the most effective public health measures to reduce severe illness and hospitalisation.
WHO emphasises that influenza remains common and continues to evolve seasonally through gradual genetic change, requiring ongoing surveillance and vaccine updates. Vaccination is still expected to offer protection against the range of circulating viruses, including drifted subclades, and is particularly important for high‑risk groups.
Situation in Pakistan
While it has increased hospitalisations in Europe, specialists note that Pakistan’s smaller elderly population and established seasonal patterns mean the local impact is likely to remain less severe, though still significant.
In Islamabad, former Punjab health minister and International Advisor for the Royal College of London, Dr Javed Akram, told Dawn that the virus has undergone mutation, which can increase risk in vulnerable groups.
“Once the flu converts into pneumonia, patients, especially children, aged persons, and those who suffer with comorbidity have more chances to be shifted to ventilators,” he said. “I suggest that people should be vaccinated against influenza before the start of winter.”
Dr Akram, who is also Chairman of the Pakistan Society of Internal Medicine, added that the vaccine, on average, reduces 70 per cent chances of influenza, suggesting that all healthcare staff should be vaccinated as they not only become more vulnerable to the illness but can also become carriers of the virus.
Dr Rana Safdar, an expert in emerging infectious diseases who led Pakistan’s Covid-19 response, said Pakistan was currently in the peak flu transmission window. He explained that while young people drive community spread, severe complications emerge primarily in older individuals and those with chronic illnesses. “Very few elderly Pakistanis get the flu vaccine, leaving them vulnerable each winter,” he said.
He confirmed that the new H3N2 subclade K — responsible for the UK surge — is also being detected in Pakistan. “Although the strain is antigenically different from what the WHO selected for the 2025–26 flu vaccine, vaccination will still reduce the risk of severe disease.”
He warned that dense fog blanketing parts of the country may worsen transmission. “Measures are very much standard with stress on masks, handwashing and distancing from persons with symptoms. When symptomatic, patients shouldn’t rush for antibiotics but take good rest and use hot liquids alongside healthy food,” he suggested.
Microbiologist Professor Javaid Usman said diagnosing flu purely on symptoms was nearly impossible due to the circulation of many respiratory viruses at this time of year, including rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, RSV and SARS-CoV-2. “The best time to get vaccinated — as they call it the ‘Sweet Spot’ — is September to October because it takes at least two weeks to build effective immunity to protect a person,” Dr Usman said.
At the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Chief of Public Health Laboratories Dr Muhammad Salman confirmed that seasonal influenza was widespread globally as well as in Pakistan. “A new vaccine is introduced every year in August, and I suggest that it should be administered to aged people and those who are immunocompromised.”
‘Sharp increase across Punjab’
In Lahore, senior medical experts are reporting a “sharp” rise in super flu cases, particularly in densely populated urban centres. Families living in multi-storey buildings, people frequenting crowded markets, and those attending weddings are among the most exposed due to close physical proximity.
Senior Principal Medical Officer and consultant Dr Masood Akhtar Sheikh said the strain was contributing to “a sharp increase in cases across major Punjab cities, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi and Faisalabad.”
“No deaths linked to the variant have been reported in Pakistan, but the number of patients presenting with flu and chest complications has risen. Children are acting as super-spreaders within households, often transmitting the virus to elderly family members.”
Dr Sheikh noted that the current surge is compounded by routine seasonal flu, Covid-19 and RSV infections, warning that international travel may accelerate spread, as seen in the UK, where this season has been compared to the severe 2017–18 flu wave.
Senior physician Dr Mohammad Arshad, who served as the former head of the emergency department at Lahore’s Shaikh Zayed Hospital, recommended oseltamivir for high-risk patients, saying it can reduce disease duration and severity. It is, however, not needed to treat all patients and must not be taken without a doctor’s oversight.
“The patient should wear an N95 mask, practise frequent handwashing, and maintain proper ventilation of indoor rooms,” he recommended, adding that a patient should maintain good hydration and proper nutrition for early recovery.
He also emphasised that the flu vaccine remains strongly recommended for everyone over six months of age.

The development came as PM Shehbaz was in Ashgabat to attend an international forum. On Friday, the premier met a host of leaders on the sidelines of the gathering, including Turkish Pre­sident Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon, Kyrgyzstan Pres­ident Sadyr Japarov and Putin.
“Great interactions with world leaders. Pakistan shining at the global stage,” said Information Minister Ataullah Tarar on X on Friday night, sharing a video of PM Shehbaz shaking hands with Putin as the two stood in what appeared to be a hallway.
He also termed the meetings with Putin, Erdogan and Pezeshkian “warm and cordial exchanges”.







Prime Minister’s Spokesperson for Foreign Media Mosharraf Zaidi also shared the same video, saying PM Shehbaz had “productive meetings with his peers from all the countries” that attended the forum.
“The customary warmth in relations was in ample evidence as the prime minister shared the day with President Erdogan, President Putin and a host of other key world leaders,” he said.







The same video was also shared by the Russian embassy in Pakistan.







However, RT India, appeared to have shared a different video, which has since been deleted from X.
In a clarification issued late on Friday night, it said, “We deleted an earlier post about Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif waiting to meet Vladimir Putin at the Peace and Trust forum in Turkmenistan. The post may have been a misrepresentation of the events.”
RT India is the newest branch of Russia’s state-funded global media network. Putin had launched the RT India news channel last week during a visit to New Delhi.







According to Indian media, the original RT India post stated that PM Shehbaz waited for Putin for 40 minutes before “growing tired and gate-crashing” the Russian leader’s meeting with Erdogan.
“He left ten minutes later,” Times of India and Hindustan Times quoted the original post as saying.
Meanwhile, Russia’s RIA news agency reported that PM Shehbaz had later joined the talks between Erdogan and Putin, which had lasted 40 minutes behind closed doors.</p><small>2025-12-13 06:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12164644eac738e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960706/senator-alleges-corruption-of-billions-of-rupees-in-attestation-of-documents-at-foreign-office' target='_blank'><strong>Senator alleges ‘corruption of billions of rupees’ in attestation of documents at Foreign Office</strong></a><br><p>After Senator Rana Mahmoodul Hassan alleged on Friday that “corruption of billions of rupees” was being committed daily at the foreign affairs ministry in the attestation of documents, a Senate body decided to raise the matter with the Foreign Office (FO).
The FO did not respond to Dawn’s request for a comment.
The attestation of documents, such as educational and marriage certificates, by the foreign affairs ministry is typically required for recognition by international and foreign entities.
The matter came up during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, where Senator Hassan of the PPP alleged corruption in the process and remarked: “Overseas Pakistanis are either running from post to pillar for a single signature or paying money for corruption.”
He said that people had been complaining about having to spend nights on pavements to get their documents attested.
The attestation process should either be digitised or union councils and deputy commissioners should be authorised to attest documents, he stressed.
Senator Anwaarul Haq Kakar also raised the question of why the process was not being digitised. “Is there a lack of resources?” he said, adding that there should be an app for the FO.
He further stated that the FO should be asked why the issue was not being resolved.
“The higher-up in the Foreign Office does not want to let go of control, and the subordinate is running a shop,” he commented without taking any names and elaborating further. “What is the job of the Foreign Office?” he added.
PML-N Senator Agha Shahzaib Durrani claimed during the meeting that a commander of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) had travelled for Haj and Umrah on a Pakistani passport.
At that, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman asked, “Who allowed the TTP to enter [the country]?”
Senator Kakar responded to that, saying, “We, too, were with those who gave the permission.” He also mentioned that when TTP’s Mullah Mansour died, a Pakistani passport was also found in his possession.
As the Senate standing committee expressed reservations over the attestation process, it decided to raise the matter with the FO.
Earlier in the meeting, Senator Agha Shahzaib Durrani was elected to chairperson of the standing committee.
The body was previously headed by PML-N’s Irfan Siddiqui, who passed away on November 10.</p><small>2025-12-13 06:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/131024594f67f2c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960881/trumps-100000-h-1b-visa-fee-draws-legal-challenge-from-us-states' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee draws legal challenge from US states</strong></a><br><p>A coalition of unions, employers and religious groups filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking to block US President Donald Trump’s bid to impose, open new tab a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for highly-skilled foreign workers.
The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco is the first to challenge a proclamation Trump issued two weeks ago announcing the fee as the Republican president moves to further restrict immigration to the United States.
Plaintiffs include the United Auto Workers union, the American Association of University Professors, a nurse recruitment agency and several religious organisations.
They argued that Trump’s power to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals does not allow him to override the law that created the H-1B visa programme.

 

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement, said Trump’s administration engaged in lawful actions “discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas”.
The programme allows US employers to hire foreign workers in speciality fields, and technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H-1B visas.
Critics of H-1Bs and other work visa programmes say they are often used to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour.
But business groups and major companies have said H-1Bs are a critical means to address a shortage of qualified American workers.
Employers who sponsor H-1B workers currently typically pay between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees, depending on the size of the company and other factors.
Trump’s order opens a new tab and bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made an additional $100,000 payment.
The administration has said the order does not apply to people who already hold H-1B visas or those who submitted applications before September 21.
Trump, in his unprecedented order, invoked his power under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals who would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.
He said that high numbers of lower-wage workers in the H-1B programme have undercut its integrity and that the program threatens national security, including by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology.
He said the “large-scale replacement of American workers” through the H-1B programme threatens the country’s economic and national security.
The plaintiffs argue that Trump has no authority to alter a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the visa programme and cannot, under the US Constitution, unilaterally impose fees, taxes or other mechanisms to generate revenue for the United States, saying that power is reserved for Congress.
“The proclamation transforms the H-1B programme into one where employers must either ‘pay to play’ or seek a ‘national interest’ exemption, which will be doled out at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, a system that opens the door to selective enforcement and corruption,” the lawsuit said.
The groups argue that agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security’s US Citizenship and Immigration Services and US State Department, likewise adopted new policies to implement Trump’s proclamation without following necessary rulemaking processes and without considering how “extorting exorbitant fees will stifle innovation.”
The H-1B programme offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialised fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.
The visas are approved for a period of three to six years.
India was by far the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 per cent of approved visas, while China was a distant second at 11.7pc, according to government data.</p><small>2025-12-13 06:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639107-convicted-ex-spymaster-retained-classified-documents-after-retirement' target='_blank'><strong>Convicted ex-spymaster 'retained classified documents' after retirement</strong></a><br><p>

Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul posted on Facebook that the Southeast Asian nation would “continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people”.
Trump, who brokered a ceasefire in the long-running border dispute in October, spoke to Anutin and Cambodian premier Hun Manet on Friday, and said they had agreed to “cease all shooting”.
Neither of them mentioned any agreement in statements after their calls with Trump, and Anutin said there was no ceasefire.
“I want to make it clear. Our actions this morning already spoke,” Anutin said.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the continued fighting.
Hun Manet, in a statement on Saturday on Facebook, said Cambodia continues to seek a peaceful resolution of disputes in line with the October agreement.
Since Monday, Cambodia and Thailand have been exchanging heavy-weapons fire at multiple points along the 817km (508 mile) border, in some of the heaviest fighting since the five-day clash in July.
Trump halted that fighting, the worst in recent memory, with calls to both leaders.
Trump, who has repeatedly said he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, has been keen to intervene again to rescue the truce.
Thailand suspended it last month after a Thai soldier was maimed by a landmine, one of many that Bangkok says were newly laid by Cambodia.
Cambodia, which nominated Trump for the peace prize in August, rejects the landmine allegations.
On Saturday, a Thai Defence Ministry spokesman, Rear Admiral Surasant Kongsiri, told a press conference that clashes had taken place across seven border provinces and Cambodia had fired heavy weapons, “making it necessary for Thailand to retaliate”.
Cambodia’s Information Ministry said Thai forces had struck bridges and buildings overnight and fired artillery from a naval vessel.
Thai leader Anutin dismissed comments by Trump that a “roadside bomb” that wounded Thai soldiers was accidental, saying the incident was “definitely not a roadside accident”.
Cambodia’s Hun Manet said he had asked the US and Malaysia, which has been a mediator in peace talks, to use their intelligence gathering capabilities to “verify which side fired first” in the latest round of fighting.</p><small>2025-12-13 05:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/130952339795570.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960771/using-official-cavalcade-punjab-minister-travels-700km-to-dine-at-a-wedding' target='_blank'><strong>Using official cavalcade, Punjab minister travels 700km to dine at a wedding</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Punjab Health Minister Khwaja Salman Rafique skipped scheduled visits to public sector health facilities in Multan on Friday and rather attended a wedding ceremony along with his official cavalcade comprising multiple SUVs  and police mobile.
The visit attracted strong criticism from social media after it transpired that the minister had attended the wedding ceremony of a son of a doctor who was recently held guilty of gross negligence in a medicines theft case and was awarded a major penalty under the Peeda Act.
The minister returned to Lahore without discharging official assignments/meetings as announced officially and conveyed to the higher authorities of Multan, including the police.
The issue came to the limelight when pictures of the minister with the doctor went viral on social media where critics accused him of misusing official resources for his private trip. Multan is 340km from Lahore.

Kh Salman defends his visit being a public figure

On Thursday, the office of the minister for the Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Department issued an alert for the Multan commissioner, regional police officer (RPO), deputy commissioner (DC), city police officer (CPO) and the information officer of Multan and intimated them about the official visit of Khwaja Rafique.
“Punjab Health Minister Khwaja Salman Rafique will proceed on an official tour to Multan as per the schedule/programme given in the letter,” reads the notification.
The office of the Punjab Health Department mentioned the official vehicles, including GBK-313 (Fortuner) and GBK- 434 (Double Cabin) in the letter to be noted for the senior officers including the commissioner, RPO and others for protocol.
They were further informed about the busy schedule of  the minister in Multan that would start from Lahore at 8:30am and reach the Circuit House in Multan at 12 noon.
As per the next schedule, the health minister was supposed to visit the Nishtar Medical University at 1pm, Nishtar Hospital at 2pm, Nishtar Hospital-2  at 3pm and would leave for Lahore at 4pm on Friday. 
Some officials in the NMU and the attached government hospitals told this reporter that the minister had not visited the places he was scheduled to visit and rather attended the wedding before his return to Lahore. 
MINISTER: Khwaja Salman Rafique clarified his position saying that being a political figure there was no bar on him to attend private ceremonies.
He said that though he didn’t visit the NMU and attached hospitals in Multan as per the officially announced schedule, he held some meetings at Circuit House which were related to the health issues.
“I spent a busy day in Multan where I attended a private marriage party and met many people being a politician,” the minister said.
“Some elements involved in corrupt practices in the health sector are trying to make my official tour controversial and I will keep hammering them for looting public funds for their vested interests,” he said.

I had just seen the Indian film Dhurandhar, which attempts to connect Karachi’s Lyari gang wars of the 1990s to the Mumbai terrorist attack many years later. My question was simple and legitimate: “Why are Indians so obsessed with Pakistan?” I posed the question out of genuine bafflement. Pakistan has been attacked by India numerous times, yet one would have to look incredibly hard to find Pakistani television or film media focus on proving Indian villainy. India, and Dhurandar is evidence of this, is utterly obsessed with presenting mono-dimensional characters of Pakistanis and of Muslims, all of whom seem to be intent on attacking India.
Unsurprisingly, the second I posed the question, the troll farms set about hurling insults of the worst kind at me. The level of vitriol in these comments was further evidence of nationalist anger. No Pakistani wakes up thinking about insulting random Indian columnists who write for Indian papers — the converse sadly is not true. I had also posed the question for a second reason: as those who have watched the film will notice, the film is well made. Bollywood filmmakers have made advances in cinematography, scriptwriting, the musical score, action sequences and production in general. How then can they be so retrogressive and backward in producing well-rounded characters if they are Muslim?

 

This time it is not Pakistanis alone who are fed up with such long productions of what is essentially Islamophobia. While the film is doing well in India — understandable given the kind of vitriolic anti-Pakistan narrative that is fed by the state to an entire generation — it has already been blocked in a number of Gulf countries. Given that millions of South Asians live in that region, this means that the film’s earnings have now been majorly hit. It appears that the state-driven narrative of animosity in India against Muslims might be getting in the way of the eagerness of many of its citizens to work in the Muslim countries of the Gulf. It is also likely that such actions will be repeated in the future as Pakistan increases its security presence in the Gulf.
How did India, once a secular and admired democracy, fall into such a deep pit of propaganda and historical mistruths? Some clues can be found in a dataset and article released by one of the few remaining esteemed and independent news sources in India. CERI-SciencesPo and The Caravan magazine — whose staff has faced harassment at the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s supporters — released an incredible initiative titled ‘Seeing the Sangh: The RSS Project’. The initiative, which features an eye-opening map reveals how the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which Modi has deceptively called “the largest NGO in the world” is actually “the largest far right network in history”.

How did India, once a secular and admired democracy, fall into such a deep pit of propaganda and historical mistruths?

The RSS along with its nasty propaganda against Muslims and minorities and its constant whetting of religious hatred has managed to become huge. The “RSS formally acknowledges only about three dozen affiliates, even though it is widely understood to coordinate a sprawling network,” ‘Seeing the Sangh’ explains. As is evident from the map, there are in fact a vast number of organisations in India that apparently do what the RSS wants — from organising mobs to lynch Muslims to developing campaigns to destroy mosques, to changing the names of cities and streets, to harassing ordinary Muslims to all manner of other hate-filled actions.
In the words of Christophe Jaffrelot, the research director at Sciences-Po in Paris and an esteemed scholar of South Asian history, “Hindutva is often equated with BJP, the Hindu nationalist party, but this ethno-religious movement has also developed deep roots in civil society since the creation of RSS in 1925. This dataset [on which the project is based], by revealing connections between the RSS, the mother organisation, and a myriad of more or less acknowledged subsidiaries which go much beyond what is known as the ‘Sangh Parivar’ (the RSS family), makes it very clear: extreme Hindu nationalist activists have reached out to almost every social and professional milieu. This network is not confined to India but is expanding globally thanks to the support of the diaspora, something this database captures also in great detail.”
Bollywood films are no exception to the rule. Nothing, it seems, happens in India today without the blessings and accommodation of the Hindutva mindset. It follows that even talented filmmakers who may have wished to make a more evolved film focused on story rather than propaganda have to produce slick and smartly produced garbage. If Dhurandhar did not have to fit into that box it could have competed with the best Hollywood film. But this is the story of India under Modi. Such is the toxic grip of Hindutva that potential and talent are being destroyed. Unfortunately, a large section of the Indian diaspora appears to have embraced Hindutva. This has led major US academic institutions like Rutgers and Stanford to focus on the poison being spread through this far right ideology.
The cost of hatred is that it eats a country whole from the inside. The ‘Seeing the Sangh’ map reveals just how this has happened in India. Even as a large section of Indians may be oblivious to the cost that the Modi regime has incurred, the rest of the world can see the tragedy clearly. Ironically, despite their general eagerness to underscore how awful all Pakistanis are — the Indian audience watching Dhurandar appears to have fallen in love not with the Indian spy character who roams Karachi for RAW but the character of Rehman Dakait. Whether they admit it consciously or not everyone knows a lie when they encounter one.

KARACHI: Indian forces have detained 11 Pakistani fishermen, including two boys, from Pakistani waters near Kajar Creek and confiscated their boat.
However, Indian media reported that their Coast Guard had on Dec 10 apprehended the 11 Pakistani fishermen after their boat was allegedly found inside Indian waters near Jakhau.
According to Kamal Shah of the Coastal Media Centre, all 11 fishermen belonged to Ibrahim Hyderi and they were out on a fishing expedition.
As news of their arrest reached Ibrahim Hyderi, there was utter confusion and panic in their homes. The fishermen, said to be related to each other, live in close vicinity to each other, which created an atmosphere of mourning in their neighbourhood.

All those captured are residents of Ibrahim Hyderi; their families seek govt intervention

The fishermen’s families have urged that the government intervene in retrieving them.
Local residents and area leaders have also demanded that the federal and provincial governments ensure the early return of the fishermen and adopt effective strategies to protect those fishing in the sea.
The held fishermen are Safi Mohammad Tandel (aged 50), Ibraham (52), Ghulam Mustafa (31), Surmirbar (32), Habib Beela (15), Sultan Ahmed (35), Suma (51), Sarfaraz (24), Mehtab Ali (25), Zaheer (12) and Hussain Bogani (56).
‘India urged to release children’
The chairperson of the Sindh Fisheries Department, Fatima Majeed, told Dawn that it is a reality of the seas and poor fishermen that the sea has no visible borders.
“These poor folk don’t realise when they may have crossed over to the other side. The same is the case with Indian fishermen, who accidentally cross over to Pakistani waters,” she said.
Kajar Creek and Sir Creek, a little ahead of Thatta, are marshy areas from where fishermen from both countries are often arrested by the Indian authorities in the case of Pakistani fishermen and by the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency in the case of Indian fishermen crossing here from their Gujarat.
Fatima said that it is unfortunate that the fishermen arrested this time have two children, Zaheer and Habib, aged 12 and 15, respectively. “I urge the Indian authorities to release the children at least, on humanitarian grounds,” she said.
She also added that with the latest arrests, the number of Pakistani fishermen languishing in Indian jails rises to 74.

The film followed an individual who could return to moments in his past to alter his present. Ironically, each time he went back hoping to improve the outcome, his intervention triggered consequences that made everything worse. A single adjustment set off a ripple effect — a chain reaction — where even well-intentioned changes led to monumental and adverse results for the future.
Today, Pakistan seems to be producing a “butterfly effect” of its own. Somewhere, someplace, someone keeps revisiting the past, revising and re-revising the Pakistani Constitution under the belief that these changes will make things better — only to make them exponentially worse. And unlike the character in the film, this someone refuses to learn the lesson: that sometimes improving the future for everyone means stepping back, not interfering — whether in the past, present, or future.

 

On an entirely unrelated note, the 27th Amendment has arrived. Many thought it would be difficult for the government to outdo itself after the 26th Amendment, but once again, it proved everyone wrong.
The 26th Amendment focused on leashing an allegedly unruly judiciary, viewed as an insurmountable obstacle to progress and prosperity. Special benches were created within the Supreme Court to handle “important” cases, sidelining the rest of the judges. Judicial appointments and bench formations were placed firmly under government and legislative control, and the bench was populated with judges perceived as pliant or, at the very least, unlikely to challenge the establishment’s agenda.
Despite this extensive restructuring, the government pressed forward with a new amendment — one that sought to do what even the 26th Amendment seemed too embarrassed to attempt. It was the 26th Amendment on steroids, that is, it created an entirely separate constitutional court, with selections and appointments thereto firmly within the reach and control of the political parties and establishment, whilst unabashedly reserving the right to pick the first set of judges appointed to such court.
At first glance, this must have sounded like an excellent idea to those in power. But in reality, it has inflicted far more harm on the very project they hoped to secure and legitimise. In trying to strengthen their creation, they have unknowingly weakened it.

No number of amendments can grant legitimacy to a system suffering from deep doubts.

First, as members of the Supreme Court — regardless of how they were chosen — the judges still carried a degree of legitimacy earned from their pre-26th Amendment reputations. Call it a ‘legacy’ reputation. One may argue that the legacy wasn’t extraordinary, but it was certainly more substantive than what the Federal Consti­tutional Court is seen to currently enjoy. In part, this is because the government has left no stone unturned to encourage and spread the impression that the adjudicators, whether correct or not, are their frontrunners in a race to the finish line. In doing so, much harm has been seen to have been done to the legitimacy and acceptability of the court, as well as those who occupy it.
Secondly, by directly handpicking judges, the federal government has unfortunately reinforced the rumours and whispers that already make judicial appointments controversial in Pakistan, leaving not even a semblance of impartiality. The 26th Amendment at least offered the smokescreen of a judicial commission — allowing its defenders to claim an “inclusive” appointment mechanism, even if that mechanism was heavily influenced by the executive and legislature. The 27th Amendment allows not even this veneer. It forces its defenders to concede that the first appointments to the new court are, in essence, executive selections.
Thirdly, when a crisis of legitimacy rises to the level we are witnessing nowadays, everything begins to feel unruly, ungovernable, lawless, and hopeless. This impression of neutered oversight becomes even sharper when the very circles that matter are actively perceived to promote it.
Perhaps this is why stories of children lost to manholes, women crushed under the high-handedness of those allegedly born of justice, or motorcyclists run over by dumpers, evoke such intense emotion and frustration. They symbolise a country that seems to care less and less about its people — one driven by everything except the will of the people. And unlike before, the public sees this with painful clarity.
This painful clarity is resulting in a real sense of alienation and disappointment among the people of Pakistan. Democracy may not have been perfect, but it did, along with an independent judiciary, provide different people potent avenues to vent their frustrations, resentment, and even ire. It served as a lightning rod which absorbed the various shocks one can expect in a diverse polity such as Pakistan. However, when you take away that lightning rod, you leave yourself, your country, and your system exposed.
Hence, the government may introduce as many amendments as it wishes, whether it be the 28th, 29th, or even the 50th. But no number of amendments can grant legitimacy to a system already suffering from deep doubts born of its disconnect from the people.
If 78 or so years of Pakistan’s turbulent history proves anything, it is that true legitimacy and stability stem from genuine franchise, free elections, and amendments crafted by a government and legislature that represent the people — their mandate, aspirations, and wishes, rather than their fears, anxieties, and resentments.
Therefore, Pakistan needs to stop trying to alter and re-alter its past to better its future. Change comes through processes, and with the loyalty and respect of its people. The same people who are here to stay, have the most to lose, and yet have the least say in how this country is to be run. And yet they love this country. What is loyalty if not this?

In a statement, the Council of Newspaper Editors (CPNE) said Dawn is among Pakistan’s most respected media outlets, and stopping the release of government ads to the group amounted to financially crippling the organisation. Attributed to CPNE’s president and secretary general, the statement recalls Dawn Media Group has been providing unbiased information since the creation of Pakistan.
The All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) also spoke out against the stoppage of government ads to Dawn Media Group outlets, saying it is ‘dismayed’. “For the last 13 months, Daily Dawn was suffering from [the] curtailment of government advertising, but now the news channel and radio [channel] owned by Dawn Media has also been subjected to denial of government advertising, which is not only unjust but also [an] attack on freedom of expression,” a press release from the body read.
The APNS noted the step has been taken to “force the media group to change its editorial policy” and opined that since these ads were paid for through the treasury, they ‘should not be used as [a] tool to strangle the dissenting voices’. “The APNS expresses its solidarity with [the] Dawn Media Group in this hour of financial stifling and urges … the federal and provincial governments to review their unconstitutional decision and restore government advertising to Dawn Media Group,” it concluded.
The Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) slammed the ban on ads for Dawn outlets as well, saying it had always resisted “using advertising as tools to control media and free expression”.
“In an age when fake news on social media is widespread, the role of traditional media becomes even more critical,” the PBA stated. It urged the government to immediately withdraw the advertising ban “in the interest of free and responsible journalism”.
The Joint Action Co­­mmittee (JAC), comprising re­­presentatives of multiple journalist bodies, also criticised the restriction. The JAC includes office-bearers of Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, APNS, CPNE, Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors and PBA.
In its statement, the JAC said the government is using official advertising as a tool to pressure media organisations. It noted that Dawn Media Group has remained the main target of this ‘undemocratic’ measure.
It said the group had faced the withdrawal of government ads for a long time due to its editorial stance and impartial reporting, and that the same restrictions are now being applied to its TV and radio platforms as well. It demanded that the government immediately restore advertising.

The 14-year sentence handed to retired Lt-Gen Faiz Hameed by a military court this Thursday was, in many ways, both unprecedented and unexpected.
The high-profile case had shone a spotlight on deep-rooted tensions within Pakistan’s civil-military dynamics, Hameed’s alleged relationship with former prime minister Imran Khan and the PTI government, and his role in political engineering and corruption.
The trial began in August 2024 and lasted 15 months. For the longest time, it seemed that Faiz Hameed’s office would protect him; instead, the sentence has made history as the first time that a former ISI chief — considered the second-most powerful position in the military after the army chief under the old hierarchy — has been court-martialled and imprisoned by the military establishment.

 

Hameed’s conviction has been presented as an outcome of the Pakistan Army’s internal mechanisms for self-accountability. It should be commended for the example it attempts to set, but it would have been better if it had done so transparently.
Many critics have argued that this case was a political tool amid the ongoing instability, especially after it was tied to the May 9, 2023 riots that followed Mr Khan’s arrest. It has been implied by the establishment itself that Faiz Hameed may have played a role in precipitating the violence seen that day.
But that is just one of the many wrongs attributed to the former spy chief. Hameed is widely believed to have engineered the 2018 general elections to favour the PTI, and was afterwards seen as the architect of that government’s security and political strategies. He personally oversaw a campaign to control the national media, including multiple attempts to force this paper to capitulate.

 

This is not to mention the controversy that became central to his downfall: his alleged abuse of ISI authority to raid and extort a real estate project near Islamabad, in which he had allegedly demanded a stake. This is what prompted the initial probe against him.
When he was finally sentenced to a 14-year jail term this Thursday, it emerged that he had been convicted on four counts related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority, and causing harm to others. The press handout also notes that he could still face further sentencing for allegations of fomenting political unrest in collusion with politicians.
But the question remains: should this be considered precedent, or an exceptional case? The armed forces’ accountability mechanism must be praised for delivering strict justice; it is also hoped that it will be applied to all equally and that it will be applied consistently.

Last week, incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan dissolved the party’s political committee amid disagreements within the opposition party in his first move after weeks of being incommunicado.
The party’s Central Secretariat issued a notification, signed by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and Additional Secretary General Firdous Shamim Naqvi.
“The secretary general, on the instruction of the party’s founding chairman and in consultation with senior colleagues in the party, hereby reconstitutes the Political Committee of the Party/Alliance,” the notification said.







The newly formed committee, which will come into effect immediately, will serve as the ‘apex decision-making body of the party with respect to all decisions/ functioning, its wings and other committees.’ It will convene at least once a week, and its decisions will be implemented through the Central Secretariat and relevant party structures across the country.
It will also lay down “policies to be followed by the parliamentary parties of PTI in the National Assembly, the Senate and the provincial assemblies, including the assemblies of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu Kashmir.”
“Sub-Committees shall be formed with individuals having relevant experience, including office-bearers of the party’s wings, invited to serve on the sub-committees,” it said.
Members of the Political Committee include PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan; PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja; PTI Additional Secretary General Firdous Shamim Naqvi; PTI Secretary Information Sheikh Waqas Akram; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi; Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas; proposed Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mahmood Khan Achakzai; former Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub; former Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Shibli Faraz; Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Moeen-ud-Din Riaz Qureshi; former Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar; Secretary Overseas (International Chapter) Sajjad Burki; Provincial Presidents/Chief Organisers Aliya Hamza, Junaid Akbar, Haleem Adil and Dawood Kakar; Special Regions (AJK and GB) representatives Khalid Khursheed and Sardar Qayyum Niazi; Secretary General Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan Asad Qaiser; Chief Whip in the NA Amir Dogar; Coordinator for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Fawzia Arshad; President Women’s Wing Kanwal Shauzab; and President Minorities’ Wing Dr Lal Chand Malhi.
The notification further said, “Sub-Committees shall be formed with individuals having relevant experience, including office-bearers of the party’s wings.”
It is worth mentioning that Qaiser had said the proposal for the dissolution of the political committee had been floated many a time by the members. One of the reasons for the dissolution of the previous committee was that the decisions were being leaked, he said, adding that the timing of the announcement did not matter since the proposal was under consideration for some time.
Earlier, an internal memo aimed to centralise control in the office of the secretary general was issued. The move had come under fire, as party insiders said it seemed to be an attempt to “end democracy and silence dissent” in the PTI.
A PTI leader, wishing not to be named, said there were around 40 members in the dissolved political committee due to which decisions were being leaked. “There was a need to include [opposition alliance members] Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mahmood Khan Achakzai in the committee,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-13 03:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/122213012ec7640.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960718/tallal-chaudhry-hopes-ex-isi-chief-faiz-hameeds-fate-will-deter-future-interference' target='_blank'><strong>Tallal Chaudhry hopes ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed’s fate will deter future ‘interference’</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Affairs Tallal Chaudhry on Friday expressed hope that, following the sentencing of former spymaster Faiz Hameed, there would be less “interference” in politics in the future.
The former head of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment by a military court on four charges related to engaging in political activities, violation of the Official Secret Act detrimental to safety and interest of the state, misuse of authority and government resources and causing wrongful loss to persons, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the state minister noted that if such a high-profile official in the armed forces had been court-martialled, it could also happen to others.
“The institution has set a new example and standards in the wake of this case,” he said.
“There will be less interference. People will remember that if you can be punished while in service and even after retirement, then anyone who commits wrongdoing while in service will think about what will happen to them. I believe this will make a significant difference.”
Chaudhry claimed that decisions made by former prime minister Imran Khan “revolved around Faiz Hameed’s recommendations”.
“There are chances that multiple decisions from before, during and after his tenure revolved around Faiz’s recommendations,” the minister said.
“Faisal Vawda and other representatives have given evidence of this before. As a political worker, I have seen this happen.”
Chaudhry further said that the matter is being investigated by “an institution which has set a new standard for transparency in Pakistan” and discouraged speculating about future steps until it is complete.
“We are hopeful that they (investigators) will uncover the truth after performing an investigation on its merits,” he said. “Instead of speculating, we should wait for the investigation.”
The state minister elaborated that the former spymaster was jailed because he “crossed a legal red line” and further said that crossing red lines instead of participating in politics “would come to an end”.
“Any action against whoever has broken the law and damaged Pakistan, its army and its perception, to prevent them from doing it in the future, is the right choice,” he stated.
Hameed, a former lieutenant general, was taken into custody in August 2024, as the military announced the initiation of Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings against him.
The move was prompted by allegations of misconduct levelled by the owner of a private housing society and had shattered the long-standing perception that spy chiefs were untouchable in the country where generals have long wielded unparalleled influence.
In December 2024, a military court indicted Hameed on three counts — engaging in political activities, violating anti-espionage laws, and abusing his authority. The indictment marked the start of the trial of the former intelligence chief before an FGCM.
At the time, the ISPR had said that “events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading to multiple incidents, including, but not limited to May 9, 2023, for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests” were also being investigated.</p><small>2025-12-13 03:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1307311113d10bf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960828/petroleum-prices-likely-to-see-up-to-rs12-per-litre-dip' target='_blank'><strong>Petroleum prices likely to see up to Rs12 per litre dip</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The prices of all petroleum products are estimated to go down by up to Rs12 per litre on Monday for the next fortnight ending Dec 31 in view of variation in the international market.
Based on existing tax rates, the informed sources said the ex-depot price of high speed diesel (HSD) has been estimated to drop by about Rs11.80 per litre (over 4pc) depending on final calculations, while petrol rate may be kept unchanged as the estimated reduction was less than a rupee per litre.
The government may also build about Rs1.28 per litre additional cost to the prices to accommodate 61 paise and 67 paise per litre higher margins to oil companies and their dealers, respectively, as approved earlier this week by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet.
The ex-depot prices of kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) are also estimated to reduce by Rs11.50 (6pc) and Rs10 per litre (6pc), respectively. The kerosene and LDO rates currently stand at Rs192.86 and Rs173.77 per litre, respectively.
The ex-depot petrol price currently stands at Rs263.45 per litre. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle- and lower-middle class. The ex-depot price of HSD stands at Rs279.65 per litre which may drop to Rs268 per litre on Dec 15.
Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Transporters had already increased their fares on the basis of about Rs27 per litre increase between May and August and have not reversed despite Rs9 per litre cut. The government is currently charging about Rs100 per litre on petrol and about Rs96 per litre on diesel.
Although, general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, yet the government is charging Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs82 per litre on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and climate support levy. This also includes Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL)

WASHINGTON: International troops could be deployed in the Gaza Strip as early as next month to form a UN-authorised stabilisation force, two US officials told Reuters, but it remains unclear how Hamas will be disarmed.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) would not fight Hamas. They said lots of countries had expressed interest in contributing and US officials are currently working out the size of the ISF, composition, housing, training and rules of engagement.
An American two-star general is being considered to lead the ISF but no decisions have been made, the officials said.

 

Deployment of the force is a key part of the next phase of US President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan. Under the first phase, a fragile ceasefire in the two-year war began on October 10 and Ham­as has released hostages and Israel has freed detained Palestinians.
“There is a lot of quiet planning that’s going on behind the scenes right now for phase two of the peace deal,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told rep­o­r­ters on Thursday. “We want to ens­ure an enduring and lasting peace.”
Indonesia has said it is prepared to deploy up to 20,000 troops to take on health and construction-related tasks in Gaza.
“It is still in the planning and preparation stages,” said Rico Sirait, spokesperson of Indonesian Defence Ministry. “We are now preparing the organisational structure of the forces to be deployed.”
Demilitarising Gaza
The Security Council authorised the ISF to work alongside newly trained and vetted Palestinian police to stabilise security “by ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip, including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of the military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.” However, it remains unclear exactly how that would work.
US Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz noted on Thursday that the ISF was authorised by the Security Council to demilitarise Gaza by all means necessary - which means use of force. “Obviously that’ll be a conversation with each country,” he told Israel’s Channel 12, adding that discussions on rules of engagement were under way.
Hamas has said the issue of disarmament has not been discussed with them formally by the mediators - the US, Egypt and Qatar - and the group’s stance remains that it will not disarm until a Palestinian state is established.
Support for UNRWA
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of eight Muslim and Arab countries issued a statement of support for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees on Friday.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey and Qatar affirmed “the indispensable role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in protecting the rights of Palestinian refugees and caring for their affairs”.







The statement follows a report by Reuters that the Trump administration has discussed slapping a terror designation on UNRWA.

ISLAMABAD: Turkish Pre­sident Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed Ankara’s readiness to contribute to a mechanism established to maintain stability amid ‘extended ceasefire’ between Pakistan and Afghanistan, after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at an international forum on Friday urged the global community to press the Afghan Taliban to honour their international obligations and curb terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil.
President Erdogan made the offer during a meeting with PM Shehbaz on the sidelines of the international forum held in Turkmenistan, where the premier also held meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon and Kyrgyzstan Pres­ident Sadyr Japarov.







Addressing the event dedicated to the International Year of Peace and Trust 2025, the International Day of Neutrality and the anniversary of Turkmenistan’s permanent neutrality, PM Shehbaz said peaceful dispute resolution was “a cornerstone” of Pakistan’s foreign policy. In this regard, he also cited Pakistan’s support for the Gaza Peace Plan and its subsequent endorsement by the UN Security Council.
Pakistan began the year by taking its seat as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Cou­ncil, where it was working to uphold global peace and security, he said.
“While we persevere in this quest for peace, the scourge of terrorism is, however, raising its head yet again, and this time, unfortunately, from Afghan soil,” he said, urging the international community to press the Taliban government to fulfil its commitments and rein in terrorist elements operating from its territory.
PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude to Qatar, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates for their efforts in brokering a ceasefire between Isla­mabad and Kabul. He noted that the ceasefire still stood though it remained ‘fragile’. He also underscored Pakistan’s commitment to ‘peaceful dispute resolution’.
He also referred to the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2788 earlier this year as an endorsement of Pakistan’s approach to the peaceful settlement of disputes.
The premier said he hoped ongoing peace efforts in the Middle East would help protect Palestinian lives, ensure a lasting ceasefire, enable the flow of humanitarian assistance and support reconstruction in Gaza. He reiterated Pakistan’s support for the right to self-determination of the people of Palestine and Kashmir.
Stressing that lasting peace was intrinsically linked to sustainable development, PM Shehbaz said the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provided a blueprint for a more peaceful world and described socio-economic development as a key government priority. He said Pakistan had made progress in areas including financial inclusion and greater economic participation for women and marginalised groups.
He said Pakistan’s pursuit of sustainable development faced headwinds from climate-induced disasters and inequities in international economic relations, adding that access to advanced technologies, particularly digital technologies, must be equitable and non-discriminatory.
He urged global leaders to treat the forum as a call for urgent action and a new paradigm in international relations, calling for investment in connectivity as “bridges for people, ideas and prosperity”. Earlier, the prime minister congratulated Turkmenistan on the 30th anniversary of its permanent neutrality and on the UN’s designation of 2025 as the International Year of Peace and Trust.
The premier also joined other leaders at the Neutrality Monument, where they attended a wreath-laying ceremony before addressing the forum.
PM meets Iran president
PM Shehbaz later held a bilateral meeting with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the forum, the Prime Minister’s Office said. Both leaders appreciated the support the neighbouring countries provided to each other when they faced external aggression earlier this year, according to the statement.
Referring to the 22nd meeting of the Pakistan-Iran Joint Economic Commission, PM Shehbaz emphasised the need to strengthen bilateral cooperation to expand trade, operationalise border markets, enhance border security and improve connectivity, including through the Isla­mabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail network.







He also reiterated the need to urge the Afghan Taliban to take meaningful action to address Pakistan’s security concerns related to terrorism. The two leaders discussed Gaza as well, the PM Office said.
President Pezeshkian expressed a desire to further strengthen ties with Pakistan, and both sides agreed to maintain regular high-level engagement. Mr Sharif conveyed his regards to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
In his interaction with President Erdogan, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the significance of bilateral ties and discussed cooperation in areas including energy, the economy, defence and investment. He welcomed Turkish interest and investment in petroleum, energy and minerals and underscored the importance of regional connectivity including the revival of the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail link.
President Erdogan thanked the prime minister and expressed a desire to work together to strengthen relations.

• Single Secondary School Certificate proposal still under review                  
ISLAMABAD: The Inter-Board Coordination Commission (IBCC) on Friday notified a new policy allowing students with an arts background in matric to enroll in pre-medical and pre-engineering groups (FSc) at the intermediate level.
The notification, issued by the IBCC, which is the main coordinator for all education boards, stated that arts students could register in these groups starting from the first annual examinations of 2026.
“Consequent upon the recommendation of the Sub-Committee and response received from Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC), Pakistan Medical & Dental Council (PM&DC), Higher Education Commission (HEC), National Curriculum Council (NCC) and Provincial Curriculum Authorities, the IBCC Forum [meeting of all boards] in its 183rd meeting held on Dec 4-5, 2025 has unanimously resolved that the students who have passed the SSC (Arts Group) may be allowed to register for HSSC pre-medical and pre-engineering groups, effective from the [H]SSC 1st annual examination 2026 onwards,” read the notification. 
It added that the forum also recommended that “[the] concerned institutions may take appropriate measures, such as setting minimum marks/merit, threshold, conducting placement or aptitude tests, etc, in order to maintain uniformity across all boards”.
However, it continued that the final decisions for this purpose — related to aptitude test, etc — “shall be taken at the respective board level, subject to obtaining the requisite approval from their boards of governors and other competent forum, where applicable”. 
The notification has been shared with all education boards of the country. 
The meeting also approved a major shift for O/A level students. Those who pass two major subjects in O/A level will now receive equivalence in the science group rather than humanities.
SSC proposal 
The forum further discussed the abolishing of separate science and arts groups at the matriculation level and replacing them with a single Secondary School Certificate (SSC) with flexible elective subject choices. However, this proposal will be further debated in the upcoming meetings before reaching any final decision.
When contacted, IBCC Executive Director Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah elaborated that the change was made by all boards of the country and other stakeholders to serve the wider interests of the students.
He argued that “rigid and narrowed” policies limited opportunities and that any student capable of clearing the FSc (pre-medical and pre-engineering) curriculum should be allowed to sit in the exam. “This is a great decision to open new avenues for students,” he added. 
Asked about notification issued on Friday, he clarified that although it specifically mentioned pre-medical and pre-engineering, arts students could now also opt for any group, including ICS and I.Com. “Actually, the main issue was pre-medical and engineering and that’s why these groups are reflected in the notification.”

Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh issued the ruling on a petition filed by Jameel Ahmad seeking the quashing of an FIR registered at Police Station City Liaqatpur under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prescribes punishment for rape. 
The complainant had alleged that the petitioner lured her into cohabitation and later married her on April 22, 2024. She claimed she later discovered he was already married and, upon her protest, he divorced her on Oct 14, 2024. 
According to the FIR, three days later — on Oct 17 — the petitioner and a co-suspect allegedly entered her home at night, where the petitioner raped her at gunpoint. 
The petitioner, however, denied the allegation of a live-in relationship and contended that the FIR was fabricated as retaliation for the divorce. He admitted issuing a written Talaq deed but argued that he had revoked the divorce on Dec 23, 2024, within the 90-day statutory reconciliation period. 

Court quashes FIR registered against petitioner 

He further submitted that he had filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights, which remained pending. 
In his judgement, announced at the court’s Bahawalpur bench, Justice Sheikh noted that the central question before the court was whether Talaq had legally taken effect by Oct 17, 2024 — the date of the alleged offence. 
The judge undertook a survey of Islamic jurisprudence as well as statutory requirements under Section 7 of the MFLO, observing that although Islamic law recognises multiple forms of Talaq, Pakistani law mandates a specific legal mechanism. 
Section 7 requires a notice of Talaq to be provided to the chairman of the relevant union council, and mandates a 90-day reconciliation period. Talaq does not become effective unless this period expires without revocation. 
The judge noted that the petitioner had dispatched notice of Talaq to the union council but had subsequently revoked it before the expiry of the statutory period. 
Citing Supreme Court precedents, Justice Sheikh reiterated that failure to comply with statutory requirements renders the divorce legally ineffective, even where a Talaqnama exists under Islamic law. 
The judge observed that under Section 7(3) of MFLO, the parties remain husband and wife until either the 90-day period expires or the husband explicitly revokes Talaq, whichever comes first.  
He concluded that on Oct 17, 2024, the date of the alleged incident, the marriage had not dissolved in the eyes of the law. 
Under Shariah, the judge noted, a crime is an act prohibited by divine injunction and punishable by Hadd or Ta’zir penalties. 
In the present case, Justice Sheikh maintained, the marital bond between the parties continued to exist legally at the time of the alleged occurrence. He said the petitioner’s conduct may be considered immoral or inappropriate under religious or social norms, but prosecution under Section 376 of PPC could not be sustained as the essential ingredients of the offence were not made out on the FIR’s own assertions. 
With these observations, the judge allowed the petition and quashed the FIR registered against the petitioner.

The view above contrasted smoothly with the expanse of the deep blue of the astroturf of the venue, located in the midst of the sprawling Gulshan-e-Iqbal.
As buses honked relentlessly at the ever-bustling Nipa after having swished dust off the perpetually under-construction University Road, hockey took centre stage on the other side of the wall.
It was the day when the gold medal winners for the national sport at the National Games were to be decided.

There were no surprises; it were heavyweights Wapda and Army who added to their already stacked medals table to take the honours in the women’s and men’s finals respectively.
Each achievement was celebrated with maximum zeal, as the announcer shouted his heart out even for the silver medal winners Punjab and Navy.
The screams got louder as Wapda and Army received their gold medals.It was a second gold for Wapda’s talisman Sidra Mateen, who scored both their goals in their 2-1 victory over Punjab.

She had already won a gold medal as a basketball player earlier.
“I started with cricket as most girls do but then stayed where my financial needs were met,” Sidra told Dawn after the final.
The 28-year-old lost the hockey final of the previous edition of the National Games in 2023, as a Punjab player was roped in by Wapda later on.
“As a young athlete, you just want to play anything you can, it’s all about passion,” she said. “But when you grow up, survival is the focus and a job with the department really helps.”
After the women’s final ended and the prizes distributed, the announcer requested the players on the field to “hurry up” off it.
“We have to conduct another match,” he would say, and the Navy and Army players would take on to the turf to warm up.
In no time, the whistle was blown, and the big match got underway. As a sparse crowd of spectators and dignitaries looked on, both sides stayed compact and took a counterattacking approach when the chances arrived.

It was hectic for three of the four quarters in both dugouts as coaches shouted instructions in thick Punjabi accents.
The drought was finally broken when Army scored via their third penalty corner through Mohammad Owais. Navy equalised minutes later from open play, thanks to Samad Habib but their dream for gold was shattered when Owais scored the winner in the dying minutes of the game.
As the Army players chanted, sang and danced, the Navy faces were flat and hanging down with disappointment and sadness.
The announcer was back in action, and the medals were distributed.As the sun set, it left behind stunning hues of blue and orange in the sky.
The turf below, was now empty. But it had witnessed being part of the coming together of 11,000 athletes from all over the country in this city — the hustle of which continued as buses still honked and dust still rose at the Nipa stop.

District Emergency Officer 1122 Rawalpindi Sighbatullah, however, expressed fear that the death toll may rise to nine as three occupants of the ill-fated vehicle are still missing after two days of search efforts.
On Thursday, a van carrying around 12 passengers was coming from Hajera in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) when it plunged into the river while navigating a turn near Garari Bridge in the Kahuta area of Rawalpindi. Four bodies were recovered in yesterday’s operation, which had to be halted later in the day due to low light conditions.
A day earlier, low-light conditions did not allow divers to search for the missing. Rescue officials had expressed fear that the river’s current may have carried away the missing passengers.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Rawalpindi, Engineer Amir Khattak, had directed all relevant authorities, including health, Rescue 1122, traffic police and tehsil administration to launch a coordinated operation for the rescue of the passengers.
On August 24 last year, a fatal accident at the same Garari bridge claimed 24 lives after a bus plunged into the river, while in another accident over 14 passengers were seriously injured in a bus accident in the area on the Kahuta- Hajera AJK road in October 2024.
Vehicle fitness regime being enforced: RTA official
The victims’ heirs and other local residents raised questions about the fitness of vehicles and the condition of crash barriers along the road facing the Jhelum River.
Zahid Khan, a commuter who regularly uses this road, said that public vehicles being recklessly driven were a common cause of accidents, while Abdul Wahid Khan said that crash barriers were either missing or fragile at dangerous points, raising the risk of vehicles plunging into the river.
Rawalpindi Regional Transport Authority (RTA) Secretary Syed Abbas Shirazi told Dawn that, as per records, the fitness certificate of the vehicle was valid up to February 4, 2026, and that the route permit was valid until April 28, 2026.
“The RTA is conducting enforcement operations on a daily basis against unfit vehicles and vehicles plying without valid fitness certificates,” he added.
“During the last two months, 151 vehicles were challaned, 124 vehicles were impounded, and fines amounting to Rs753,000 were imposed,” the secretary claimed. “Such enforcement drives are being continued regularly to ensure compliance with the route fitness regime and improve road safety.”
The RTA secretary added, “Yes, it has been reported that the driver fell asleep.”
Asif Raza, the Executive Engineer at the Punjab Highways Department (Rawalpindi–Kahuta), emphasised to Dawn that crash barriers were present along the road.
When asked about allegations of fragile and substandard barriers, the official said that these were checked during the last two fatal accidents.Raza assured that he would re-examine the condition of the barriers and take action accordingly.
The victims’ heirs and locals urged the Punjab chief minister to take serious notice of the frequent accidents and implement foolproof measures to curb the loss of life.
An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that six bodies had been recovered today, based on information provided by the rescue service. The number has since been revised by the rescue service and the story has been updated to reflect the same.</p><small>2025-12-12 17:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/121738329ddda9d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960707/gilgit-baltistan-polls-to-be-held-on-jan-24' target='_blank'><strong>Gilgit-Baltistan polls to be held on Jan 24</strong></a><br><p>Elections in Gilgit-Baltistan will be held on January 24, 2026, after the Assembly completed its five-year tenure last month.
The notification for the poll date was issued today by the GB Council.
“The President of Islamic Republic of Pakistan has announced Saturday 24th January as the poll day for the Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly in terms of article 48-A (1) of the Government of the Gilgit Baltistan Order 2018, read with Section 57 (1) of the Election Act 2017,” it said.
Retired Judge Yar Muhammad was appointed chief minister of GB following the expiry of its elected government tenure.
According to the notification, candidates can submit nomination papers from December 15 to 22, while the list of nominees will be issued on December 23. Returning Officers (ROs) will conduct scrutiny of the papers on December 30, and appeals against their decisions can be filed on January 3, 2026.
The election tribunal will issue its verdict on the appeals on January 10.
The commission will issue the final list of candidates on January 11, and it will allot election symbols on January 13.
In another notification, the election commission stated that it had appointed ROs in 10 districts.
District and Sessions Judge Ameer Hamza will be the RO for Gilgit district; District and Sessions Judge Khursheed Ahmed for Skardu; District and Sessions Judge Suhail Ahmed for Diamer; District and Sessions Judge Luqman Hakeem for Ghizer; District and Sessions Judge Raja Mehnaj for Astore; Deputy Commissioner Nizamuddin for Hunza; District and Sessions Judge Minhas Hussain for Nagar; District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Ishaq for Ganche; District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Sharif for Kharmang; and Deputy Director Education Manzoor Hussain for Shigar.
Under the GB Order 2018, elections must be held within 60 days.
The GB Assembly consists of a total of 33 seats, which include 24 general seats, three reserved for women, and three for technocrats.
Five-year tenure
The GB Assembly elections were held on Nov 15, 2020, across 24 constituencies. The PTI formed the government, and Khalid Khurshid was elected chief minister.
However, in July 2023, the GB Chief Court disqualified Khurshid. Subsequently, a coalition government was formed by members of the PTI disgruntled group, the PPP, and the PML-Nawaz, which elected Haji Gulbar Khan as the new chief minister of the region.
According to Abbas Ali, deputy director of information for the house, the assembly adopted 63 Acts during its five-year tenure, including one pertaining to land reforms as well as six federal ones.
The GB Assembly passed 114 resolutions on various issues, including a demand that the federal government declare Gilgit-Baltistan a provisional province of Pakistan.</p><small>2025-12-12 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/12185023602d1cb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960712/pakistan-to-allow-binance-to-explore-tokenisation-of-up-to-2bn-of-assets' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to allow Binance to explore ‘tokenisation’ of up to $2bn of assets</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has signed a memorandum of understanding with crypto exchange Binance to explore the “tokenisation” of up to $2 billion in sovereign bonds, T-bills and commodity reserves to boost liquidity and attract investors, the finance ministry said on Friday.
Tokenisation is the process of creating a digital version of an asset.
Separately, Pakistan also gave initial clearance for Binance and HTX, a digital-asset platform, to register with regulators to set up local subsidiaries and begin preparations for full exchange licence applications, the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) said.
The ministry said the agreement paved the way to explore a potential collaboration aimed at enabling the tokenisation and blockchain-based distribution of real-world assets, including sovereign bonds, treasury bills, commodity reserves such as oil, gas, metals or other raw materials owned by the government.
“Under the proposed arrangement, Binance and/or its affiliates may provide technical expertise, advisory support, training and capacity building to enable Pakistan to assess modern, compliant blockchain infrastructure,” the ministry said in a press release.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the agreement was a very strong message to both Pakistan and the entire world.
“What we have signed today reflects a long-term partnership. From where we started to moving towards operationalisation, this progress could not have happened without active guidance and leadership,” Aurangzeb was quoted as saying.
“The next step for us is execution, and we are fully committed to delivering results with speed and quality.”







The move comes as other countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, Japan and parts of the European Union, expand formal licensing rules for crypto exchanges amid broader global regulatory tightening.
The ministry also said the initiative could involve assets of up to $2bn, subject to approvals, to improve liquidity, transparency and international market access.
Binance founder Changpeng Zhao said the agreement was “a great signal for the global blockchain industry and for Pakistan”, saying it marked the beginning of a move toward full deployment of the tokenisation initiative.
“This is the beginning … now we can move towards full deployment and execution. We are honoured to work with Pakistan’s leadership and are confident this collaboration will deliver positive and lasting outcomes for the economy,” he was quoted as saying.
Initial clearances for Binance, HTX
The PVARA said it had issued early approvals to Binance and HTX after reviewing their governance and compliance controls. The clearances allow them to register on the Anti-Money Laundering system, set up local units and prepare full applications.
PVARA Chairman Bilal bin Saqib said the clearances kick off Pakistan’s phased licensing process and signalled that compliance strength will determine which exchanges move ahead.
Broader digital-asset initiatives
The initiative comes as Pakistan speeds up a major digital-finance overhaul in just a few months, creating the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) and establishing the PVARA, while drafting a formal licensing regime.
Pakistan ranks as the world’s third-largest crypto market by retail activity, Saqib said at Binance Blockchain Week Dubai 2025 earlier this week.
A central bank digital currency pilot and a Virtual Assets Act are also planned for 2025.
The PCC signed a letter of intent with US-based World Liberty Financial to explore stablecoin use, tokenisation and other digital-asset infrastructure, the finance ministry said in April.</p><small>2025-12-12 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/121759459726274.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960709/azad-kashmir-gilgit-baltistan-must-receive-funding-under-the-nfc-award-nawaz' target='_blank'><strong>Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan must receive funding under the NFC award: Nawaz</strong></a><br><p>PML-N President and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday asked his brother, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, to give funds to Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in accordance with the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award.
Nawaz’s suggestion on including AJK and GB’s share in the NFC is significant, as smaller provinces have previously rejected this federal plea several times. The proposal was formally initiated when NFC talks started under then-prime minister Imran Khan, while current Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had also suggested the same in the past to reduce the financial burden on the Centre.
“Funds should be given to Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan under the NFC award. I will speak to PM Shehbaz Sharif in this regard,“ the PML-N supremo said while talking to party leaders in Lahore.
“A certain amount every year must be given to both provinces — Azad Kashmir and GB. This is very important,” he said, adding that these two provinces must have the capacity to spend this money.



He recalled how both provinces could not properly utilise the funding they received from the federal government in the past.
“They need to know how to spend that money. The way I want such funds utilised did not happen,” he stated.
Nawaz also sought applications for elections in both provinces by December 31.
“We decide who will be awarded the tickets on merit in both provinces, as we do in other provinces,” he announced. “We will not tolerate infighting on tickets. Anyone involved in this will be excluded from the process.”
He added that when the PML-N received applications, he would visit both provinces and meet candidates to listen to their perspectives and reach a better understanding in awarding tickets.
The PML-N supremo also praised his daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, for her performance as the province’s chief executive. He specifically praised initiatives such as building cancer hospitals, model villages and introducing the metro bus system.
During the NFC meeting last week, the federal government proposed mobilising additional consolidated revenues amounting to more than 5 per cent of GDP over the next three years (roughly Rs6.5 trillion per annum at the current exchange rate).
The suggestion came during the much-delayed inaugural meeting, which also sought legal opinion on whether federal expenditure priorities bind provinces.
Participants told journalists outside the Ministry of Finance that there was no demand for reducing the provincial share in the divisible pool from the existing 57.5pc as being speculated, nor any discussion about more or less responsibilities, as they were subjects of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and the National Economic Council (NEC).
Fiscal requirements of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan would also be deliberated at a working-group level.
However, AJK went through a period of political instability between September and November, with the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee’s (JKJAAC) calling a strike over the issue of its unfulfilled charter of demands, including the abolition of 12 seats allocated for refugees in the territory’s legislative assembly.
The strikes turned violent after the administration imposed a communications blackout and rival groups marred the largely peaceful demonstrations with violence, leaving at least 10 dead. Two rounds of talks were held with the federal government — one in September and another in October, where an agreement was reached. The terms included additional funding for the province, a reduction in the cabinet size and a probe into those killed during the protests.
Later, then-prime minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq faced a no-confidence vote in November, with PPP leader Faisal Rathore nominated as his successor. Haq was voted out on November 17, with Rathore being sworn in the next day.</p><small>2025-12-12 13:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638954-after-flood-aid-spat-maryam-and-bilawal-trade-warm-messages' target='_blank'><strong>After flood-aid spat, Maryam and Bilawal trade warm messages</strong></a><br><p>
