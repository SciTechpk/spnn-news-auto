The cases pertain to the arrest of workers belonging to the PTI for their alleged role in attacks on army installations during the riots that followed ex-premier Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, 2023.
The Lahore High Court registrar issued the new amended schedule of the trials of the May 9 cases being conducted at Kot Lakhpat Jail.
 


The hearing of May 9 riot cases will now be heard in jail four days a week — Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The jail trials were earlier being held three days a week but have been extended to speed up their disposal.
The ATCs are hearing the jail trials of 14 cases including the Jinnah House attack.
In December 2024, the Pakistan Army announced that the remainng 60 PTI activists have been convicted by the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) for their involvement in the May 9 violent protests.
“The Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the Inter-Services Public Relations, the military’s media wing, said in a statement.
Those sentenced include Hassaan Khan Niazi, a nephew of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, and two retired armed forces officers. Days earlier, 25 others were sentenced on the same charges.
The accused were sentenced to between two and 10 years of “rigorous imprisonment”, marking the conclusion of trials for those held in military custody over the attacks on army installations. Overall, 16 individuals were sentenced to 10 years, 11 for nine years, two for eight years, six for seven years, 10 for six years, two for five years, 13 for four years, three for three years, and 22 for two years.</p><small>2025-05-14 13:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604469-at-least-13-mn-afghan-refugees-repatriated-from-pakistan-na-told' target='_blank'><strong>At least 1.3m afghan refugees repatriated from Pakistan, NA told</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan has grappled with an unprecedented surge in forest fires in recent years. Provinces, including KP and Balochistan, have seen huge wildfires in the past three years.
Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Usman Munir, while speaking to Dawn.com, shared that a man and his wife were burned to death while they were trying to protect the firewood kept near their home from the fire.
The SDFO of the forest department in Alpuri, Zahid Hussain told Dawn.com that the victims — identified as Hakim Zada and his wife Hajiroon — set fire to the bushes near their house. The fire then quickly got out of control due to intense and gusty winds, engulfing the forest.
The wildfire has now been extinguished, and the bodies of the victims have been recovered from the site.
According to Deputy Commissioner Shangla Mohammad Fawad, compensation will be given to the next of kin of the deceased.
In 2024, over 50 wildfire incidents were reported in Shangla, while in June 2022, four people were killed by a wildfire in the Chakesar area of the district.</p><small>2025-05-14 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/14122158ce6db62.jpg?r=122844' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910966/pakistan-receives-second-tranche-of-1bn-from-imf' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan receives second tranche of $1bn from IMF</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has received the second tranche of special drawing rights (SDR) worth $1.023 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, the central bank said on Wednesday.
The amount will be reflected in its foreign exchange reserves for the week ending on May 16, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in a post on X. It would raise the reserves to $11.355bn.
 






Last week, the IMF had approved the immediate disbursement of about $1bn to Pakistan under the ongoing EFF and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
In a statement issued last Friday, the IMF had said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform programme supported by the EFF arrangement.
“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52bn). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1bn),” it said.
 


It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.
“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP.
“Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”
Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had said PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the approval and “the failure of India’s high-handed tactics” against Pakistan.
“The country’s economic situation has improved and the country is moving towards development. India is plotting a conspiracy to divert attention from our country’s development through unilateral aggression.
“International institutions have responsibly rejected India’s false propaganda. Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,” it quoted the prime minister as saying.</p><small>2025-05-14 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1415172346e83b0.jpg?r=151756' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910984/pakistan-pulled-off-a-macroeconomic-miracle-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan pulled off a ‘macroeconomic miracle’: report</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s market has captured the attention of global investors amid its heightened tensions with India, US publication Barron’s reports.
Over the past two years, the country has seen a “macroeconomic miracle”. While inflation was down from 40 per cent annually to near zero, Eurobonds maturing in 2031 rose from 40 cents on the dollar to 80 cents. The KSE-100 index has also tripled.
The government reached a “stabilisation agreement” with the International Monetary Fund last September with the lender approving a $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Over $2bn has already been disbursed.
“Pakistan is a good story,” Genna Lozovsky, a chief investment officer at Sandglass Capital Management, was quoted by Barron’s as saying. “So good it’s not risky enough for us anymore.”’
The media outlet further stated that the recent conflict with India “won’t likely knock Pakistan’s recovery off course” but the “country’s own shaky underpinnings might”.
“Pakistan has been known for boom-and-bust cycles throughout its history,” according to Khaled Sellami, an emerging markets sovereign debt manager at Barings. He said there are some signs that this time could be different.
Pakistan’s period of stabilisation started with a near-default experience in 2022-23 following Imran Khan’s ouster. Alison Graham, chief investment officer at frontier markets specialist Voltan Capital Management stated, “Everyone thought Pakistan would default along with Sri Lanka in 2023.”
Instead, the State Bank of Pakistan hiked interest rates from 10pc to 22pc, putting the country into recession but wringing out inflation.
Last year, the country gained loans from sovereign creditors China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, while the GDP growth bounced back to 2.5pc. “The current account balance is positive, and they have a primary fiscal surplus [excluding interest payments],” Sellami said. “That’s something we haven’t seen in many years.”
Pakistan remains in “relative stagnation” with cotton, apparel and cereals accounting for two-thirds of exports compared to India’s development in advanced industries like IT and pharmaceuticals. Sellami said, “It is belatedly moving into IT outsourcing, foreign sales rising from near nothing to $3bn annually over the past few years,” adding that India was in the $200bn range.
Without a value-added ladder to climb, fate and free-spending election cycles may continue driving Pakistan’s boom and bust, according to Graham. She continued, “Pakistan remains extremely fragile to external shocks.
“When there is a rally, you need to be in early.”
Sellami was more optimistic, being “constructive” on Pakistani Eurobonds. He said that the country’s foreign friends, China and the Gulf states, made it clear in 2022 that they were not writing blank cheques. “The government knows if they deviate from the tightrope they are walking, they won’t have external finance,” he added.
On Monday, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) gained a record 9pc — the restored calm in the market mirroring that in the region after the recent Pakistan-India ceasefire that boosted investor mood. “The market has reacted jubilantly to the ceasefire announcement after Pakistan established effective deterrence against India,” noted Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.</p><small>2025-05-14 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604461-two-more-soldiers-injured-in-indian-strikes-martyred-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Indian strikes: Security forces' death toll rises to 13 as 2 more martyred</strong></a><br><p>

He made the comments during a summit between the US and Gulf Arab countries. Trump met Syria’s Ahmed al-Sharaa before the summit. Photos posted on Saudi state television showed them shaking hands in the presence of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince.
Trump also urged Sharaa to normalise ties with Israel, a White House spokesperson said.
Despite concerns within sectors of his administration over Syria’s leaders’ former ties to Al Qaeda, Trump said on Tuesday during a speech in Riyadh he would lift sanctions on Syria in a major policy shift.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan joined Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, virtually in the meeting, Anadolu News Agency reported.
MbS told the summit Saudi Arabia commends Trumps decision to lift sanctions on Syria.
The lifting of sanctions came despite deep Israeli suspicion of Sharaa’s administration, worries initially shared by some US officials. Israeli officials have continued to describe Sharaa as a jihadist, though he severed ties with al Qaeda in 2016. Israel’s government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The decision is a major boost for Sharaa, who has been struggling to bring the country under the control of the Damascus government after toppling former President Bashar al-Assad in December.
The challenges were laid bare in March when Assad loyalists attacked government forces, prompting revenge attacks in which Islamist gunmen killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, drawing strong US condemnation.

Trump is on a four-day visit to the oil-rich Gulf states that includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.
Trump’s first day of a four-day swing through the Gulf region was marked by lavish ceremony and business deals, including a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in US arms sales to the kingdom.
Later today, Trump will fly to the Qatari capital Doha, where he will participate in a state visit with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and other officials. Qatar, a key US ally, is expected to announce hundreds of billions of dollars in investments in the US.
US ally Israel has opposed sanctions relief for Syria, but Trump on Tuesday said that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who are both close to the US president, encouraged him to make the move.
Former Al Qaeda commander
Sharaa was for years the leader of al Qaeda’s official wing in the Syrian conflict. He first joined the group in Iraq, where he spent five years in a US prison. The United States removed a $10 million bounty on Sharaa’s head in December.
His interactions with Sharaa, who led rebel forces that toppled former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, will be closely watched as observers gauge how serious Washington is about resetting its relationship with Damascus.

Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafique told Dawn.com, “An IED was planted at the main gate of the MNA’s house and it exploded late at night.” He added that Zeb was not at home at the time of the explosion.
The police reached the site and a search operation was under way to “track down the terrorists”, he said.
Zeb said in a statement that his family and neighbours remained safe in the explosion, but it would not affect their resolve through such tactics. “I would continue my martyred brother Rehan Zeb’s mission,” he added.
National Assembly speaker Ayaz Sadiq condemned the incident, expressing best wishes for Zeb and his family.
He directed KP’s relevant authorities to conduct a transparent investigation into the blast, saying the elements involved in the attack must be brought to justice.
 
 

Zeb was one of the PTI-backed independent candidates that the party decided to take action against after they voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, against their party stance.
Last month, four children were wounded when a mortar shell, fired from an undisclosed location, hit a house in the Lowi Mamund tehsil in Bajaur.

With a reduction of Rs3 to Rs7 per litre in major oil products estimated for the next fortnight, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Tuesday notified a 14pc reduction in the price of RLNG on Tuesday for sales at the transmission stage by the two Sui gas companies for the current month.
The Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL), which serves consumers in Sindh and Balochistan, has seen its system losses at the distribution stage drop from 16.16pc to 10.6pc.
 
 

On the other hand, the Lahore-based SNGPL, which provides gas to consumers in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saw its system losses at the distribution stage drop to 7.47pc from 8.6pc until February this year.
According to a notification, the RLNG’s sale price for SNGPL at the transmission stage has been cut by 12.42pc to $11.026 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for May against $12.59 per mmBtu in April.

Ogra notifies 14pc cut in RLNG price

The sale price at distribution stage for SNGPL was reduced by 12.51pc to $11.79 per mmBtu for the current month, against $13.48 per mmBtu last month.
On the other side, the RLNG sale price for SSGCL has been decreased at transmission stage by 13.62pc to $9.74 per mmBtu for May, against $11.27 per mmBtu in April. The sale price at the distribution stage for the company was also reduced by 13.64pc to $10.87 per mmBtu instead of $12.59 per mmBtu last month.
The Ogra said the reduction in RLNG price was due to a decline in the delivered price on ship for both companies.
The overall decrease in absolute terms for SSGC’s transmission price amounted to $1.53 per mmBtu, while reduction at distribution stage was $1.72 per unit.
The reduction in RLNG price for SNGPL during transmission was reported at $1.56 per mmBtu and $1.69 per unit for distribution.
Ironically, the RLNG distribution prices for SSGCL $10.87 per mmBtu and $11.79 per mmBtu for SNGPL are almost $2.74 and $3.66 per mmBtu higher than the Pakistan State Oil’s $8.13 per mmBtu average delivered price ex-ship (DES), respectively.
This is mainly because of the fact that both LNG importers — PSO and Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL) — and port authorities also charge profit margins on account of retainage and margins at the rate of 3.15pc and 3.1pc of DES price, respectively, on top of 7.4pc losses of SNGPL and 10.6pc losses of SSGCL.
The basket RLNG price was based on a total of 10 cargoes for May, all under two LNG contracts between PSO and Qatar Gas at an average of about $8.13 per mmBtu — six cargoes at $7.24 and four cargos at $9.48 per mmBtu. Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL) did not import any cargo this month as it deferred cargos for the current month owing to demand crash.
Petroleum prices
On the other hand, the prices of petrol and diesel are estimated to fall by about Rs3.5 and Rs7 per litre for the next fortnight ending May 31, owing to a decline in the international market and a slight ease in import premium on petrol. This relief is, however, subject to unchanged tax rates.
Based on existing tax rates, informed sources said, the ex-depot price of petrol was estimated to go down by about Rs3.5, depending on final calculation on May 15, followed by a Rs7 per litre cut in high speed diesel (HSD).
 
 

The estimates for lower petrol price stem from about $1.5 per barrel decline in international price of petrol and about $3 per barrel in HSD over the past two weeks. The ex-depot petrol price currently stands at Rs252.63 per litre. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle and lower-middle class.
The ex-depot price of high speed diesel (HSD) stands at Rs256.64 per litre.
KE petition
In a formal petition, K-Electric has, however, requested the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) not to pass on entire benefit to consumers, and instead, set aside partial benefit to clear its past claims.
The company has already claimed Rs14.6bn past dues on account of partial load, startup costs, plant degradation and open cycle operations for the period between July 2023 and March 2025. Nepra has already set aside Rs9.4bn by disallowing full benefit of fuel cost reduction to consumers between November 2024 and January 2025.
A public hearing is scheduled for May 22.
Meanwhile, the electricity rates for consumers of K-Electric have also become entitled to Rs5.02 per unit refund next month on account of fuel cost adjustment for March, with a total financial benefit of Rs6.8bn.

Balochistan’s largest medical institution, the Bolan Medical College (BMC), has been closed for nearly six months now, with no clarity on when it will reopen.
Initially, the shutdown was attributed to a student dispute that escalated into violence, but later, the explanation expanded to include long-overdue infrastructural repairs. In a notification issued last month, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the college principal stated that academic activities would resume on April 25.
However, the day came and went with no progress — the BMC remains shut. “We are currently completing physical verification of hostel allotments … once that’s complete, classes will resume,” the college administration claimed. A second notification issued on May 11 said the college would now open on Friday, May 16.
For the hundreds of students enrolled at the college, many from remote areas, the closure has caused confusion and frustration. They were asked to vacate hostels and return home with limited information on what comes next.
“The entire academic schedule has been delayed, affecting our studies, exams, and future plans,” said Mujeeb Mengal, a third-year MBBS student at BMC.
In Balochistan, where access to healthcare and education is already a challenge, the prolonged suspension of BMC’s operations has sparked debate. At the centre of this discussion are questions regarding the true cause of the closure — whether it was a necessary step for institutional improvement, or if broader administrative and political factors were at play.
The shutdown
On November 12, a dispute between two student groups escalated into violence, leaving at least seven students injured and prompting a heavy deployment of security personnel. A total of 12 students were arrested.
“The police raided our hostels and forcibly evacuated us at 2am, treating us as if we were terrorists,” said Shabbir Zehri, a first-year MBBS student. “We were left stranded on the streets for the rest of the night,” he recalled, adding that valuable items, including mobile phones, laptops, and books, were stolen from their rooms during the eviction.
“With no other choice, we had to seek accommodation in private hostels, but the fees were exorbitant. Some of us were forced to sell phones, belongings and even goats just to pay rent. The alternative was using that money to travel back home,” he shared.
According to police, the conflict stemmed from a disagreement over hostel allotment. On the same day, the college issued a notification stating that hostels would be closed for two weeks for “renovation work and due to the law and order situation.” A second notification extended the closure indefinitely. Academic activities were also suspended.
Speaking to Dawn.com, BMC admin officer Hamdullah Khan recalled that videos of the incident quickly circulated on social media. Senior administrators who attempted to intervene were also attacked by students, he said.
“The police eventually gained control of the situation. However, concerns about further clashes led to the shutdown during the last 10 days of November,” he added.
A few days later, Hamdullah said, the provincial health minister visited the campus and ordered renovations that had been pending for over a decade.
Meanwhile, students alleged that the BMC administration deliberately attempted to frame the issue through an ethnic lens. “Minor scuffles happen at every institution,” said Kabeer Baloch, zonal president of the Baloch Students Organisation (BSO).
He explained that while the incident involved a few students, it was resolved after intervention by BSO and Pashtun student leaders. “BSO does not encourage ethnic hatred or violence. If any of our members had been involved, they would have been suspended by now,” he said.
 


The Pashtun Students Organisation (PSO) had a similar view. “Claims that the BMC was shut due to PSO students’ violent behaviour are completely baseless. Our students have often been victims of violence, which we’ve repeatedly brought to the administration’s notice,” said Mujtaba Hassan, PSO’s information secretary.
Students also pointed out that the groups involved later held a press conference confirming that they had resolved their issues. “But the government remained adamant about keeping the college closed,” lamented Khursheed Baloch, a member of the Baloch Students Action Committee (BSAC), another student political organisation.
Renovation work — reality or excuse?
Recently, videos showing glimpses of the renovated medical college have been circulating online. However, students remain sceptical about the extent and impact of the repairs.
Khursheed claimed that the renovation work was largely superficial. “All we’ve heard for months are excuses. If any work has been done, it’s either minimal or only exists on paper,” he said.

“On the ground, the campus remains in a deteriorated condition. The academic loss we’ve suffered is immeasurable, and it’s unjust to hide it behind the narrative of renovation,” he added.
While the BSO’s Kabeer Baloch acknowledged that some renovation had taken place, he questioned the approach, citing the example of King Edward Medical University, where construction continued without disrupting classes. “The government could have opted for alternative solutions here, too, but chose not to.”
The PSO’s Mujtaba Hassan agreed. “You cannot gamble with students’ futures for the sake of infrastructure. In other provinces, students complete their MBBS in five years. Here, closures push it to six or seven years,” the group’s spokesperson said.
For its part, the BMC administration says that the sports complex, hostels, lecture halls, laboratories and other facilities had been upgraded, with new amenities such as revamped rooms, replaced doors and windows, improved electricity and water supply, and installation of carpets and curtains.
Yet, despite these claims, students remain unconvinced, arguing that the academic cost of the closure heavily outweighs the infrastructural improvements.
“Fights happen at every college, and that’s normal, but closing the institute for six months isn’t an option … there are ways to tackle them,” said Mohammad Azeem, a third-year medical student. “We are all affected by the closure of the college, and there’s a wave of uncertainty about what will happen next.”
Fear of hyper-securitisation on campus
Alongside the uncertainty, there is a growing unease among students — not just at BMC, but across Balochistan — over fears of the hyper-securitisation of university campuses.
For its part, the BMC administration refuted claims regarding the presence of military personnel, clarifying that private security guards had been hired to ensure safety and prevent unauthorised access.
 
 

However, student groups alleged that educational institutions were being increasingly securitised to suppress dissent and student activism in politically aware academic spaces.
The BSAC criticised the “toxic environment” created under the pretext of security, arguing that educational institutions should be centres of learning and intellectual freedom, not places of fear and surveillance.
“Students should grow under the shade of books, not under the shadow of guns,” Khursheed argued.
Other student organisations echoed this view. “Insecurity is widespread across Balochistan, but why do security concerns only shut down educational institutions?” asked the BSO’s Kabeer. “Students deserve to study in a peaceful environment.”
Dawn.com reached out to the Balochistan government for comment but did not receive a response until the filing of this report.
The resistance
As the days turned into weeks, students grew increasingly apprehensive and even staged a sit-in outside the BMC. They demanded that hostel repairs be carried out without disrupting education, scholarships be disbursed, and welfare funds be allocated transparently.
Dawn.com reached out to the BMC administration as well as the Balochistan government regarding the budget allocated for the renovations but did not receive a response.
 

Students protest outside the Bolan Medical College in Quetta against the institute’s closure.

The sit-in, which lasted several days, eventually led to negotiations between students and the administration. A written assurance was issued, promising that the students’ demands would be met within a specified period.
However, the underlying issues remain unresolved.
According to Dr Maqbool Langove, an associate professor at BMC, the closure has severely impacted the academic year. The five-year MBBS programme often already stretches to six years at the college, but further shutdowns will only prolong it more.
Exam schedules have been thrown into uncertainty, and the course load might now be reduced, he said. “For the faculty too, it’s a problem — the curriculum will have to be made more selective.”
He added that although teachers had recommended shifting classes online, internet availability — especially in peripheral areas — was a major hurdle, compounded by frequent internet shutdowns.
Student politics and BMC administration
The BMC has long been a hub of Baloch nationalist politics. Its rooms echo with the legacy of past leaders who once spearheaded the Baloch National Movement. Over the years, tensions between administration and students have often flared up.
 
 

Currently, the debate revolves around the claim that student politics has shifted from study circles to group-centric politics, focused on hostel allotments and campus conflicts.
“If the administration fulfils its duties properly, PSO will never interfere,” said Mujtaba. “But if students are deprived of facilities and education due to negligence, we will raise our voices.”
Meanwhile, other students called the administration’s claims “negative propaganda.”
“They overlook the fact that students simply want to complete their education and succeed,” said BSO’s Kabeer Baloch. “We have always sought to strengthen institutional frameworks and promote a positive relationship between teachers and students.”
Students also criticised the provincial government’s narrative of sending youth abroad on scholarships to prestigious universities such as Harvard and Oxford, terming it a “hollow slogan” that ignores the collapse of Balochistan’s own education system.
“If there truly was an educational revolution happening, Balochistan’s most important medical institution wouldn’t have remained closed for six months,” said BSAC’s Khursheed.
“These claims feel empty unless backed by tangible change. Real educational revolution is about access to basic academic facilities — something students here are still fighting for.”

During a talk about his research and findings about Tharparkar at the Urban Resource Centre on Tuesday, architect and town planner Arif Hasan said that Tharparkar is a neglected area of Pakistan, and of undivided India before that. Only Mithi, its headquarters, had seen some development due to trade.
Arif Hasan’s research on Tharparkar has also resulted in a book, published a few years ago. He first started documenting the area in 1974 but left it to return to it in 1978. “The people of Thar approached me. They told me to come and see what can be done for their district,” he said. And that was how he found himself heading there in a truck full of goats and other grazing animals.
Strange discoveries were made. No one, except three people, in Tharparkar owned a watch. They determined the time from the stars at night and the shadows cast on the ground by sunlight. Apart from that, there was also the issue of Hindu castes since the area is predominantly Hindu. The scheduled castes, or “untouchables”, were even afraid of letting their shadow fall on anyone.

Says roads built in Musharraf’s time brought some changes in peoples’ lives

They lived on the outskirts of the main cities. The people of Tharparkar lived a simple life. They had goats, buffalo, camels, etc. The milk from such animals was used in producing butter, yogurt and the like. The barter system was used for trading. “Maybe a goat or two in exchange for a watch, and so on. These things and more I figured out slowly,” the senior architect explained.
 
 

“For water assessment, I noticed that the locals stored and used rainwater. When that water finished, they simply migrated to another area where there was water as they not just needed it for themselves but also their animals. There they got busy growing crops and fodder again. It was their culture,” Arif Hasan pointed out.
He said that they also have wells that are 60 to 100 feet deep. “It is all rainwater till that level. Any lower than that the water is brackish, which only the camel can consume. It is useless for humans and plants,” he said.
About the drought and famine in Tharparkar, he said that the rest of the country and the world first heard about it in 1987 as it was only then that the press printed stories about it along with the photographs of starving and dying animals.
But studying the details of the drought then, I realised that it was nothing new, but a common occurrence in Thar. “I wrote that it was actually a drought of social relations with Thar, of the rest of the country’s callousness for the region. For this I was called by the Sindh government as well as the Unicef to prove my claims,” he says.
Land ownership is another issue in Tharparkar. With people migrating so much the land was often left to the peasants, who became de-facto owners though they didn’t really have a 99-year lease of the land.
Still there was big change with the peasants who sold animal produce and agriculture harvests in the market. Suddenly, there was money coming in. But they needed roads to reach the markets or for the market to reach them.
 
 

The building of roads in Tharparkar, during the time of President Musharraf, brought on further changes. Camels were sold off to buy motorcycles. There was also an increase in tourism in Mithi, Islamkot and other cities of Tharparkar. Artisans who used to make clay pots and pans are no longer sought after as plastic containers have come into demand. And the Thar Coal Project has brought on more changes. There has been displacement of more people where mining takes place.
Those areas have also been robbed of vegetation, turning them into arid zones. It can only be speculated what all this means for the district. “But it is a human disaster and a land disaster,” Arif Hasan concluded.

• Dismisses appeal against life term for man who killed his wife
KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has expressed concern over the killing of innocent people in the name of so-called honour and ordered the state to stop this “uncivilised, barbaric and abominable practice” and deal with perpetrators sternly.
Terming honour killing a severe type of domestic violence, a single bench of the SHC said that such practice was unabatedly increasing with every passing day and there was a dire need to stop it immediately “before it gets out of hand and creates total anarchy in society”.
Justice Nisar Ahmed Bhanbhro of the SHC stated that the offence of “karo-kari” had been declared as Fasad fil Arz (mischief on earth), which is a serious offence under Islamic teachings and described as disobedience to God. “Thus to avoid fasad on earth, perpetrators are required to be dealt with iron hands,” the court said.
 
 

“The honour killing has stained the society where the woman is even not given right of defence to prove her innocence against the false charges of developing illicit relations,” it added.
The bench made these observations while dismissing an appeal against life term of a man who killed his wife in the name of so-called honour.
A sessions court had sentenced accused Ghulam Mustafa to life in prison in September last year for killing his wife on the pretext of honour in Kashmore in April 2023.
Besides maintaining the life term of the appellant, the SHC also sentenced him to 14 years in prison for ‘karo-kari’ and ruled that both sentences would run consecutively since the nature of offence was gruesome and cruel.
The bench in its order noted that the motive behind the murder was the so-called practice of “karo kari” and the reason for growing tendency of such offences was the lack of accountability.
 
 

“The practice of taking the law in their hands by citizens is becoming increasingly common these days. In this part of world thousands of innocent people are being killed every year in the name of family honour on the flimsy ground of suspicion of ‘Karo-Kari’,” the judge wrote in the verdict.
It stated: “It is even observed that in order to settle the scores of enmity with rival man, the woman is killed and the said person is also killed without reasons and thereafter the male members of the community sit together and conduct a faisla declaring that since the murder was committed to save the honour, therefore, the perpetrator should not face its consequences through punishment by the court of law.
“Islamic kaw under any Fiqah does not permit any citizen to take the law into his own hands and obligates the State to protect the life and liberty of every citizen and severely punish the person who does so,” the judge stated.
“This uncivilised, barbaric and abominable practice must be stopped immediately before it gets out of hand and creates total anarchy in society. Under Islamic teachings the Fasad Fil Arz has been treated as a serious offence and has been described as disobedience to God, thus to avoid Fasad on earth, perpetrators are required to be dealt with iron hands,” it noted.
Regarding the merits of the appeal, the bench observed that the trial court had convicted the appellant on a single count of murder under Section 302 (b) read with Section 311 (Ta’zir after waiver or compounding of right of qisas in qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code for imprisonment of life as ta’zir.
However, the charge regarding the offence of “karo-i-kari’, which has been declared as Fasad fil Arz, was separately framed since it was an offence in addition to the murder. “Therefore, the conviction for the offence has to be recorded separately and it cannot be compounded or waived,” the bench ruled.
“The sentence of qatl-i-amd was awarded for the charge of murder whereas sentence under Section 311 PPC was awarded for spreading fasad on earth and the prosecution has established the guilt of accused for charge of both the offences in the present case,” it said, convicting the appellant.
“The appellant in the given circumstance is also convicted and sentenced for the charge of offence punishable under Section 311 PPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 14 years and conviction and sentence awarded by the trial court for the charge of offence punishable under section 302 PPC is maintained. Since the nature of offence is gruesome and cruel, therefore both the sentences are ordered to run consecutively,” it concluded.

The home department issued a letter about imposing an immediate ban on the use of rough papers or newspapers containing verses of the Holy Quran for packaging or preserving commodities. 
The order, enacted under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898, aims at preventing potential disturbances to the public peace and tranquility. 
The directive, signed by the home secretary, cites concerns over the misuse of religious texts in everyday trade practices, which could offend religious sentiments. The ban will remain in effect for 90 days across the entire province, starting from May 12. 
The authorities were directed to ensure widespread dissemination of the order through official channels, including the gazette, newspapers and broadcast media. The Punjab Police, divisional commissioners, and deputy commissioners have also been directed to enforce the prohibition strictly.

• Insists ceasefire after face-off between nuclear powers should be celebrated
ISLAMABAD: Amid India’s dangerous war rhetoric, Pakistani lawmakers on Tuesday cautioned that New Delhi could again resort to military misadventure out of political desperation, warning of the grave consequences such an escalation could bring between two nuclear-armed neighbours.
Addressing the National Assembly dur­­­ing a discussion on recent tensions with India, several members lambasted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him a “certified terrorist” and warning that he could go to any extent for political gains as his politics thrived on corpses.
Former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar said that India’s crushing defeat at the hands of Pakistan was nothing to celebrate. “We must all be unapologetic as a country that celebrates a ceasefire. Why not celebrate the ceasefire? Yes, we absolutely will,” she said.
Ms Khar warned that India had continuously crossed red lines, underestim­ating Pakistan’s capability and misreading its restraint as weakness. She said this miscalculation could have led to catastrophic consequences, insisting that Pakistan had proven its defensive and strategic capabilities under pressure.
 


Highlighting the dangers of setting new precedents in international conflict resolution, she challenged India’s narrative of “self-defence” following the Pahal­­gam attack to justify cross-border strikes.
“What are we supposed to do if a terrorism incident takes place in Pakistan?” she asked, questioning whether Pakistan would be equally justified in launching strikes in response to proven Indian involvement in incidents like the Jaffar Express attack. She criticised India for “weaponising terrorism” and flouting international law. “Have you all stepped outside the UN Charter and parameters of international law?” she asked. “Are we no longer signatories to Article 25, which obliges all nations to uphold UN Security Council resolutions?”
She criticised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unilateral declarations regarding held Kashmir, asking whether the world was expected to “pay homage” and bow down to such claims. Citing US President Donald Trump’s acknowledgement of Kashmir as a disputed territory, Ms Khar argued that the Indian narrative had begun to unravel.
“The illusion of India’s conventional warfare supremacy has been broken — not by Pakistan, but by Modi’s own extremist policies,” she remarked.
 
 

She noted that the belief that India could serve as a regional security provider has been undermined by its inability to secure its own borders during confrontations with Pakistan. “Pakistan proved its capabilities through both defensive and calibrated offensive responses,” she asserted.
Ms Khar noted that Pakistan’s military professionalism and operational competence had been underestimated.
“What we all proved was that we don’t just buy high-tech toys; we train ourselves better to use them,” she stressed.
She argued that India’s attempts to detach itself diplomatically from Pakistan — a strategy pursued over the last 15 years — had failed. “By provoking Pakistan into conflict, they re-hyphenated themselves with us in the eyes of the world,” she said. She said that if India was serious in dealing with the problem of terrorism, it must not run away from the dialogue table.
Two bills passed
The House also passed two private me­­mbers’ bills — the International Exa­m­­­ination Board Bill, 2024, and the Ghur­­ki Institute of Science and Technology Bill, 2024 — with majority support. Both bills had previously been reviewed and clea­red by the relevant standing committees.

• Imposes up to Rs100m fine on sale of smuggled petrol
ISLAMABAD: The government has introduced a landmark bill in the National Assembly aimed at digitally tracking petroleum products from import and production to retail sales in a bid to curb smuggling and adulteration, which cause massive revenue losses estimated at Rs300-500 billion annually besides affecting environment and vehicle engines.
The Petroleum (Amend­ment) Act, 2025 — moved by Pet­roleum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik on Monday — seeks to amend the 1934 Petroleum Act. The draft law envisages new clauses for information technology-based tracking of petroleum products to curb smuggling and to initiate strict actions against illegal transportation and decantation of petroleum products, along with actions to be taken against illegal petrol pumps.
All local refineries and major oil marketing companies have been demanding — both individually and from their collective forums — that the government take stringent measures at borders and at domestic locations of production and sale to control smuggling of petroleum products, including LPG, as it negatively affected their businesses and caused substantial revenue losses to the government.
 
 

A 2020 inquiry ordered by the then-prime minister estimated that over Rs250bn worth of petroleum products were being smuggled annually, mostly from Iran. In April 2024, a joint intelligence report revealed that nearly 10 million litres of Iranian petrol and diesel were entering Pakistan daily via land and sea, causing a revenue loss exceeding Rs227bn.
This report entailed complete identities, addresses and contact numbers of 100 black sheep in around a dozen law enforcement agencies, owners and operators of 533 illegal petrol stations across the country, and 105 smugglers of Iranian oil. The report also contained precise information about informal border crossings and routes for trafficking smuggled items throughout Pakistan.
Officials and sources in the oil industry suggest these rep­orts were just the tip of the iceberg and did not cover the business and operations of the adulteration of petroleum products.
The new clauses also empo­wer the government to enable confiscation of petroleum products, equipment, machinery, tra­n­sportation and storage faci­lities by deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners and designated officers under the Customs Act, 1969, before and after conviction to provide for stringent administrative action against illegal activities.
For swift legal proceedings, trial powers for offences under the act will be vested in sessions courts, while administrative enforcement will rest with deputy and assistant commissioners.
Another clause provides a right of appeal in the high court, and yet another binds the Department of Explosives or other respective regulatory authorities to revise, extend, or allow new licences in a given timeframe.
One clause outlines a framework for digital tracking and monitoring of petroleum products using real-time data and coordinated action between government agencies. This includes tracking storage points, petrol stations and transport vehicles using IT-enabled systems.
Under the draft law, any individual found importing, transporting, storing, producing or selling petroleum products illegally would face a fine of Rs1m, rising to Rs5m for repeat offences. Facilities found operating without a valid licence would be sealed, and their machinery, tanks and stock confiscated. The owner would be subject to a Rs10 million fine. Those with expired or cancelled licences would be granted a six-month grace period for renewal. Failure to do so would result in confiscation and a Rs1m fine.
The Department of Explosives will renew the licences within a month upon receiving the required documents and the fee. The owner of a premises or facility involved in the storage or sale of smuggled petroleum products will be liable to closure and all machinery, equipment, mat­er­ials, storage tanks and petroleum products being employed or sold will be confiscated along with a fine of Rs100m. The licence of such facility will also be cancelled. Any means of transportation involved in transporting smuggled petroleum products will also be confiscated.

The drivers were transporting LPG imported from Iran on May 9 when armed men intercepted their trucks in the Ahmedwal area on the Quetta-Taftan highway. The assailants burst the trucks’ tires and abducted the four men at gunpoint before security forces arrived at the scene, according to authorities.
Local residents informed the administration about the bodies, prompting Levies and other law-enforcement agencies to rush to the site. The bodies were taken to the district hospital in Noshki.
Hospital officials confirmed all four men died from multiple bullet injuries after being shot from a close range.
The deceased were identified as Moin and Huzaifa, residents of Pakpattan, and brothers Imran Ali and Irfan Ali, residents of Rahimyar Khan. 
Their bodies were sent to respective hometowns after legal formalities were completed.
An investigation has been launched, officials said. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the killings.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind strongly condemned the killings. “Those behind such heinous acts — enemies of peace — will not be spared,” Mr Rind said in a statement, describing the incident as “barbaric and deeply tragic.” 
“The provincial government is utilising all available resources to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice.”
Mr Rind extended condolences to the victims’ families and assured them that justice would be served. He noted the victims were from Punjab and said the incident “appeared to be an attempt by terrorist elements to disrupt interprovincial harmony”.
“The Balochistan government is committed to conducting a transparent and thorough investigation. Those responsible will soon be apprehended and dealt with an iron hand,” Mr Rind affirmed. He reiterated the government’s determination to uphold law and order, asserting that “such cowardly acts would not shake the state’s resolve”.

The Wire said that Indian opposition parties asked whether the ceasefire was a result of US mediation, marking a clear departure from India’s longstanding policy of ‘no third-party mediation’.
Opposition parties have demanded to know why Modi remained silent on Trump’s claims, whether India has changed its longtime policy of no third-party mediation and if the US president’s claims of trade being used to end the conflict is true.
In a statement, Congress MP Jai­r­am Ramesh said Modi’s “much-delayed address to the nation was upstaged by President Trump’s revelations”.
“The prime minister was completely silent on them. Has India agreed to US mediation? Has India agreed to a ‘neutral site’ for a dialogue with Pakistan? The prime minister should immediately have a meeting with leaders of all political parties — something he has studiously avoided in the last 20 days,” he said.
Mr Ramesh said the coming months would ‘demand both painstaking diplomacy and a collective resolve’. “One-liners and dialogue-baazi are poor substitutes,” he said, “.
Congress MP Randeep Singh Surjewala earlier also sought to know if the ceasefire with Pakistan was on the basis of mediation by the US.
“Isn’t the Modi government aware that the US president, Mr Donald Trump has issued a statement expressing mediation to solve the Kashmir issue? Is the Modi government going to allow a third-party mediation in Kashmir in absolute derogation of India’s stated policy? If not, why has PM Modi not controverted the same?”
Special session of parliament
Also, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary M.A. Baby reiterated the opposition’s call for a special session of parliament and said the ceasefire announcement by Trump before any Indian official could declare it “has raised serious concerns”.
“It is an avowedly accepted policy of our country that we settle our disputes bilaterally, without allowing any third-party intervention. Therefore, this situation requires clear and authoritative clarification from the highest levels,” he wrote.
Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Manoj Kumar Jha demanded that Modi government make a statement for the US about not undermining India’s stated policy as well as denying Trump’s claim about the mention of trade being stopped.
“The kind of language he [Trump] chose, hits us Indians. I would request the prime minister that you have the country’s mandate, you should give a stern message to the US.”
All India Majlis-i-Ittehadul Musli­meen MP Asaduddin Owaisi said, “We have always been opposed to third party intervention since Simla (1972). Why have we now accepted it? I hope the Kashmir issue will not be internationalised, as it is our internal matter. Why are we agreeing to talk on neutral territory? What will be the agenda of these talks?” He also asked if Indian government’s goal was to get a Trump-brokered ceasefire.

• FO says will closely monitor Indian actions, take necessary measures to preserve rights under Indus treaty
• Security forces jam, seize ‘Indian surveillance drone’ in Lahore
ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan on Tuesday said it rem­ai­ned committed to the current ceasefire understanding with India, but any fut­ure aggression will be met with full resolve, as the Foreign Office lambasted a provocative spe­ech delivered by the Indian prime minister on May 12.
A statement issued by the Foreign Office said that Pakistan rejected “the provocative and infla­mmatory assertions” made by the Indian premier, and the remarks were “a dangerous escalation rooted in misinformation, political opportunism, and a blatant disregard for international law”.
In his speech, PM Modi had accused Pakistan of retaliating with strikes on Indian military and civilian targets, claiming that India’s air defence systems repelled the attacks and inflicted significant losses on Pakistan. He also said Pakistan requested a ceasefire through military channels on May 10 after its ‘failed’ retaliation. India accepted the ceasefire conditionally, PM Modi said, warning that future Indian responses would depend on Pakistan’s behaviour.
Pakistan dismissed this portrayal as “yet another blatant lie” and said that the ceasefire was achieved “as a result of the facilitation of several friendly countries” and any claim to the contrary was “misinformation and propaganda”.
 
 

In light of the ceasefire, the two sides are hammering out its operational details. The first post-ceasefire contact between the heads of military operations from the two countries resulted in an understanding that the two sides would uphold the truce and reduce troop deployment along the international border. Another round is expected soon.
The FO said the Pahal­gam incident was used as a pretext to attack Pakis­tan, “justify military adv­e­n­turism, serve domestic political objectives… and reinforce a manufactured narrative of a perpetual external threat”.
“After the unlawful and unprovoked Indian aggression…India recklessly provoked the situation further by targeting Pakistan’s military bases, risking an uncontrollable escalatory spiral,” the statement said, adding that the Indian actions brought the entire region to the brink of disaster. Pakistan accused India of “justifying the cold-blooded murder of innocent civilians… as the ‘new normal’ for the region”.
According to the statement, Pakistan will monitor Indian actions in the coming days and it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty. “Make no mistake, we will closely monitor India’s actions and behaviour in this regard in the coming days. We also urge the international community to do the same,” it said.
In response to India’s allegations of terrorism sponsorship, Pakistan said, “We are a victim of terrorism, being directly sponsored by India. … Our contributions and sacrifices in the global fight against terrorism are well known.”
The statement also condemned India’s unilateral actions, citing New Delhi’s violation of the Indus Waters Treaty. “Pakistan will take all necessary measures to preserve its rights under the treaty,” it said.
While alluding to the unilateral suspension of Indus Waters Treaty, the Indian premier had said, “India’s stand is very clear… Terror and talks cannot go together… Terror and trade cannot go together…. Water and blood cannot flow together.”
PM Modi, in his speech, declared that India would not tolerate “nuclear blackmail or state-sponsored terrorism,” announcing a new policy that rules out dialogue with Pakistan outside the context of terrorism and Azad Kashmir.
 
 

The Foreign Office countered, saying, “Peace is the true strength. The world is not served by theatrical militarism and grandstanding but by mature leadership, regional cooperation, and respect for international norms.”
The statement reaffirmed Islamabad’s support for a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.
“Pakistan is a sovereign nation with resilient institutions, a committed populace, and a globally recognized role in maintaining peace and security,” the Foreign Office said. “Our commitment to peace must never be mistaken for weakness. Any future aggression will also be met with full resolve.”
Indian Ministry of External Affairs, in its reaction to FO statement, said, “The terrorist infrastructure sites that India destroyed were responsible not only for the deaths of Indians but of many other innocents around the world. There is now a new normal. The sooner Pakistan gets used to it, the better.”
Meanwhile, an Indian drone was spotted in Lahore by the security forces, who brought it down near the Lahore airport by using the GPS jamming technology.  Sources in the law enforcement agencies said it was an “Indian surveillance drone” which was launched by the neighbouring country after the ceasefire agreement.

IHC Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas issued the order on Mr Hasan’s petition challenging the government’s move to place him on the  PCL. The judgement highlighted loopholes in the current mechanism of adding citizens to travel restriction lists like the Provisional National Immigration List (PNIL) and Passport Control List (PCL) and Exit Control List (ECL).
The court found the decision to restrict Mr Hasan’s movement was made without the requisite approval from the cabinet, as mandated by the Supreme Court.
The decision was made solely by the Immigration & Passports director general, allegedly based on an FIA report. The court noted such unilateral decisions without the cabinet’s involvement or judicial scrutiny were a “recipe for abuse, especially in politically sensitive cases”.
Under the law, the “government” means the cabinet, not individual officials or departments. “This oversight rendered the restriction legally void.”
Mr Hasan’s name was placed on the no-fly list “without giving him a notice or opportunity to be heard”, violating the principles of justice and due process.
The government justified its action, saying an FIR was pending against Mr Hasan under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016. However, the court ruled that the criminal case does not warrant inclusion on the no-fly list, particularly when the accused is on bail and cooperating with the legal process.
In an identical judgement, IHC’s Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro also directed the removal of PTI leader Imran Khan’s sister’s name from the PCL and the PNIL.
Ms Khan had approached the court to challenge the inclusion of her name in the travel ban lists.
The court allowed Ms Khan to seek permission to travel abroad by approaching the relevant trial court handling the cases registered against her.

Speaking at the Saudi-US investment forum in Riyadh, President Trump highlighted his role in brokering the weekend ceasefire between the two South Asian rivals and urged them to build on this breakthrough.
“I said, ‘fellas, come on, let’s make a deal. Let’s do some trading. Let’s not trade nuclear missiles, let’s trade the things that you make so beautifully’,” Trump said, without clarifying which Indian or Pakistani leaders he had spoken to or when.
“They’re actually getting along. Maybe we can even get them together, Marco, where they go out and have a nice dinner together,” he said while addressing his Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who accompanied him to Saudi Arabia.

Development comes hours after Trump urges both nations to ‘go out to dinner’ together to resolve their disputes

In Washington, the State Department’s Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Piggott told reporters that the United States was now focused on encouraging direct engagement between the two countries.
“We welcome the ceasefire reached between India and Pakistan this weekend and we commend both prime ministers for choosing the path of peace,” said Piggott. “We also want to encourage direct communication between the parties.”
 
 

When asked whether Pakistan had given any commitments on ‘stopping terrorist activities’ that India accuses it of indulging in, Piggott declined to comment, but reiterated Washington’s support for dialogue.
Islamabad categorically rejects such allegations as unfounded and blames India for using them as an excuse to justify its aggression against Pakistan.
“We have been clear on that. We continue to encourage that direct communication,” Piggott said. “The president has been clear on that and the president has also been in praising both prime ministers for choosing the path for peace and wisdom.”
Responding to a question about the US reaction to India’s refusal to accept a US role in the peace process, Piggott said: “I am not going to speculate on that. What I can say is that we encourage direct communication.”
Asked if the US had sent a team to Pakistan following media reports about radiation leaks from some secure nuclear facilities in Pakistan, Piggott replied, “I have nothing to preview on that this time.”
When pressed on whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attitude was disappointing for Washington, the spokesperson avoided criticism. “What we are happy to see is a ceasefire. That’s what we are happy to see. That’s where our focus remains. We want to see the ceasefire maintained and we want to encourage direct communication,” he said.
“Our focus is the ceasefire. Our focus is on encouraging direct communication. That’s where our focus is going to remain. The president has spoken on this.”
Piggott was also asked whether President Trump would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if he helped resolve the Kashmir dispute.
“The president is a peacemaker. He values peace. He is also a dealmaker. And he has shown that again, and again, and again,” Piggott responded. “When it comes to solving conflicts, the president wants to solve the conflicts where he can. Stands ready to help.”

• Israeli strike kills another journalist
CAIRO: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military would enter the besieged enclave “with full force” in the coming days, vowing not to stop the war.
A statement from the office of Israeli PM Netanyahu on Tuesday said, “In the very coming days, we are going in with full force to complete the operation.”
“Completing the operation means defeating Hamas. It means destroying Hamas,” Netanyahu said during a meeting with injured reserve soldiers in his office late Monday.
“There will be no situation where we stop the war. A temporary ceasefire might happen, but we are going all the way,” he added.
Israel resumed major operations across Gaza on March 18 amid a deadlock over how to proceed with a January 19 ceasefire that had largely halted the war with Hamas.
Earlier this month, Israel’s government approved plans to expand its Gaza offensive, with officials talking of retaining a long-term presence there.
During the meeting with soldiers, Netanyahu said Israel was working to find countries that may be willing to take in Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.
“We’ve set up an administration that will allow them (Gaza residents) to leave but… we need countries willing to take them in. That’s what we’re working on right now,” he said.
Journalist killed
An Israeli airstrike on the Gaza Strip on Tuesday killed a well-known Palestinian journalist who it accused of working with Hamas and was recovering in hospital from an earlier strike, the territory’s health ministry said.
Israel accused the journalist, Hassan Aslih, who has hundreds of thousands of followers on social media platforms, of taking part in the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas.
It said Aslih had documented and uploaded footage of “looting, arson and murder” during the incursion into Israel.
Ahmed Siyyam, a Gaza civil emergency service member, told Reuters the attack hit the third floor of a Nasser Hospital building in the southern city of Khan Younis. Dozens of patients and injured were also being treated at the hospital.
Two patients, including Aslih, were killed and several others were wounded, the health ministry said.
Israel’s military said in a statement it struck Hamas members operating from within a “command and control centre” located at the hospital. It didn’t name them.
Reuters footage showed heavy damage to one of the hospital buildings, including the medical equipment and beds inside.
According to the International Federation of Journalists, at least 160 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since October 2023.
Officials in Gaza put the number at 215, and accuse Israel of deliberately targeting journalists. Israel denies targeting journalists and says it tries to avoid harm to civilians.
Aslih headed the Alam24 news outlet and worked as a freelance photojournalist. He was wounded last month in a deadly strike on a tent in the Nasser hospital compound.
Some 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken prisoner in the October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel’s response has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and destroyed much of the enclave. A blockade on aid supplies since March 2 has left the population at critical risk of famine, according to a UN-backed monitor.
A senior World Health Organisation official warned on Tuesday that hunger and malnutrition could have a lasting impact on “an entire generation”.

The deputy prime minister, in an interview with CNN, said Pakistan had no choice but to launch strikes in self-defence following cross-border stri­kes by India on May 7.
Terming India’s strikes “war and a wishful attempt to establish its hegemony in Kashmir,” Mr Dar said Pakistan was “very sure that our conventional capa­city and capabilities are str­ong enough” to beat Ind­ian ground and air forces.
Deputy PM Dar said there was no direct contact between Indian and Pakistani officials before US intervention, contradicting a previous assertion made by India that Pakistan’s director general of military operations contacted his counterpart with an offer for talks.
When asked how the cea­sefire deal was rea­ched, the foreign minister said Pakistan’s “counter-escalation” brought world powers into the picture.
 
 

After Pakistan’s strikes on May 10, Mr Dar said, “[C]ertain capitals, particularly the  US, realised it could be a really filthy next move.”
He claimed to have received a call from Mr Rubio, who had talked to India’s external affairs minister, S. Jaishankar.
“[Mr Rubio] said India is ready to stop it now … Would you be willing? I said of course …  if India does not restart [escalations] we would not do it.”
“[The Indians] had seen what happened in the sky. They could see how serious the damage was,” he said while talking about possible reasons for India’s agreement for ceasfire.
Negotiations
Mr Dar said Pakistan was looking forward to establishing a path for long-term peace and security that would provide dignity for both sides.
Calling Kashmir the root cause of this regional instability, Mr Dar called for granting the self-determination right to the Kashmir people. He reiterated that Pakistan was not behind last month’s attack in Pahalgam, saying, “We condemn terrorism in all forms and all manifestations”.
On negotiations with India to resolve longstanding issues, Mr Dar said talks between the countries were yet to begin. “We still hope sense will prevail,” he said, adding it was in the “interest of everybody” not to delay or to leave such issues “beyond a certain reasonable time”.
He warned the cease­fire could be threatened if the water issue was not resolved. “Failure to resolve the water issue will amount to an act of war.”
Separately, Information Minister  Attaullah Tarar told Sky News that India had not yet stopped the flow of water to Pakistan after New Delhi unilaterally held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance after the Pahalgam attack .
He said India lacked the capacity to stop the water from flowing in three western rivers given to Pakistan as part of the treaty.
“At present, the flow of water was continuing as usual,” the minister said in the interview aired on Tuesday.
Strategic success
He remarked that the ceasefire between Pakistan and India was a result of the diplomatic efforts of various countries.
He said the ceasefire was not a weakness of Pakistan but a “strategic success”. “India was not in a position to bear further tension.”
Mr Tarar welcomed President Trump’s desire to resolve the Kashmir dispute, calling it a “good sign”. He said India accused Pakistan of being invovled in the Pahalgam attack without evidence. However, India “failed miserably” in linking the attack to Pakistan.
The attack, which took place in the presence of “around 700,000 Indian troops” in occupied Kashmir, was a “security and intelligence failure”, he added.
Mr Tarar reiterated Pakistan’s sacrifices in the war against terrorism, saying operations against terrorists were still ongoing on the western borders.
The minister denied any “safe havens” for terrorist groups inside Pakistan.

The diplomatic tit-for-tat began with India declaring a Pakistani official posted at its High Commission in New Delhi persona non grata, accusing him of engaging in activities “not in keeping with his official status”. The official was ordered to leave the country within 24 hours, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a brief statement.
India’s move followed the arrest of two individuals in Indian Punjab on Sunday, who were allegedly involved in leaking sensitive military information to a purported Pakistani handler. According to Punjab Police, one of the suspects had been passing details about Indian Army movements,  reportedly under the direction of an official linked to the Pakistani mission in Delhi.
The chargé d’affaires of the Pakistan High Commission was summoned and handed a formal demarche regarding the expulsion. Later the same evening, Pakistan responded in kind by expelling an Indian High Commission official,  identified as Shankar Reddy Chintala. The Foreign Office stated that the official had been “found involved in espionage in violation of his privileged status”.
In its statement, the Foreign Office said the  Indian diplomat had been declared persona non grata and was instructed —  along with his family — to leave Pakistan within 24 hours. The Indian  chargé d’affaires was summoned and handed a demarche expressing  Pakistan’s strong protest against what it called “undesirable  activities”.
The FO also reminded the Indian mission to ensure  that its staff adheres to diplomatic norms and does not engage in  conduct incompatible with their diplomatic status. The expulsions mark a  sharp deterioration in already fraught relations, coming on the heels of  military clashes and accusations of ceasefire violations and  cross-border strikes.

Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.
 
 

This is the first time the two have publicly talked about their father’s incarceration. They were allowed by a court in November 2023 to contact him every week, but these talks, according to them, have not always been facilitated.
In an interview with X influencer Mario Nawfal on why they chose to speak out now, Qasim said: “We’ve gone through the legal routes. We’ve gone through every route that we thought would potentially get him out. We never thought he would be in there a fraction of how long he’s been in there. And it’s only getting worse. And, so, we’ve somewhat run out of those options. And now we’ve decided the only route of taking action is to come and speak publicly.”
He added: “What we want is international pressure on Pakistan right now, because currently he’s living in inhumane conditions. They’re not giving him basic human rights … They’re not really doing anywhere near enough. And what we want is global pressure.”
On the topic of a lack of success so far through legal channels, Suleman said: “We’ve exhausted other options [and] legal avenues and it’s gone very quiet. It seems, in the international media, it seems to have gone very quiet.”
 


The PTI has frequently complained about Imran’s facilities and has filed several petitions in the Islamabad High Court regarding the issue. On the other hand, the jail administration has refuted the claims.
Questioned about the calls by US official Richard Grenell for their father’s release, Suleman said the two had not had any contact with him so far but were grateful for “all the support he’s shown”.
Regarding a message they had for the Trump administration on the topic, Suleman said: “We’d call for any government that supports free speech and proper democracy to join the call for our father’s release.”
Qasim similarly said he wanted the international community to “look at what’s going and hopefully take action and who better than Trump to gain the attention of.
“We’d love to speak to Trump or try and figure out a way where he would be able to help out in some way. Because, at the end of the day, all we’re trying to do is free our father, bring democracy in Pakistan and just ensure his basic human rights.”
Talking about the toll the situation had had on them, Qasim said “it’s been pretty brutal”.
The brothers claimed their phone calls were set up with their father at odd times with limited duration, adding that the failure to miss the calls “meant going a long time before they could talk to him again.”
They further claimed they spoke to Imran only once every two or three months.
The brothers said they did not want to participate in politics, adding that they had taken permission from Imran before speaking out in the interview.
The two have stayed away from the limelight, with their mother, British journalist and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith, stressing that her sons had nothing to do with Pakistani politics.
In 2022, after anti-PTI protests were held outside her UK residence, she wrote on the former Twitter platform, “[…] I have got nothing to do with Pakistani politics and neither have my children. They are low-key private individuals who are not even on social media.”
The following year, Jemima expressed her disappointment with X owner Elon Musk for taking away the previous blue-tick verification from accounts after trolls made fake accounts of her sons.
“Fake accounts pretending to be my children, created by imposters with a political agenda in Pakistan. This is exactly what I feared would happen when you took away Twitter’s verification blue ticks. FYI my children are not on social media & have no plans to be,” she said.</p><small>2025-05-13 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604370-pakistani-communities-in-texas-celebrate-victory-over-india' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani communities in Texas celebrate victory over India</strong></a><br><p>
