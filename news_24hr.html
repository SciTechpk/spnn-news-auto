According to the Foreign Office (FO), the two leaders “reviewed the evolving situation in Iran and the wider region”.







The statement said Dar “strongly condemned the unwarranted attacks against Iran” and called for an immediate halt to escalation through “urgent resumption of diplomacy to achieve a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis”.
The development comes after the United States and Israel launched strikes on Iran on Saturday, plunging the region into a renewed military confrontation.
Subsequently, several Gulf Arab states said they were targeted by Iranian missiles after Tehran pledged to retaliate against strikes by US and Israel.
Meanwhile, Dar also spoke to Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Faisal in Farhan Al Saud.
“Both leaders expressed deep concern over the unfolding regional developments, and agreed to remain in close contact on the evolving situation,” the FO said.







Travel advisory for Pakistani nationals
Separately, the FO also issued a travel advisory for Pakistani nationals.
“For their safety and security, Pakistani nationals are advised to avoid all non-mandatory travel to the Islamic Republic of Iran,” it said.
“Pakistani nationals currently residing in Iran must exercise caution, remain vigilant, minimize non-essential travel, and stay in regular contact with the Pakistani Missions,” it said.

The ministry’s fact check account on X attributed the claims to Afghan Taliban officials that were “amplified by Indian media”.
“The Ministry of Defence of the so-called Islamic Emirate claimed that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani fighter jet in Nangarhar and captured its pilot alive. The claim was widely amplified by Indian media and Afghan propaganda outlets,” it said.







The ministry further said Pakistan’s armed forces had not reported any aircraft loss and stated that no “independent international media outlet or defence monitoring agency” had verified the claim.
“The story relies solely on statements from Afghan officials and selective media amplification,” it said.
It further stated that there was no visual proof of crash debris, the wreckage site or the captured pilot. “No geolocated imagery or satellite evidence supports the claim,” it said, adding that “in modern conflict environments, verified crashes are rapidly documented — none exists in this case”.
It said that viral footage being shared as “jet crash evidence” was from an unrelated panic situation in Afghanistan.
“Multiple videos used in the narrative are old clips being recycled to fit the false claim,” the ministry said.
It also pointed to a “misleading image” shared by TOLO News, saying: “he image corresponds to a Russian aircraft incident in Turkey in 2021”.
“Reusing unrelated foreign crash imagery is a deliberate attempt to construct a false narrative,” the ministry said.
It said that the past two days, “hundreds of fake or misleading videos linked to the India–Afghan propaganda ecosystem have been debunked”.
“The current jet claim fits into the same coordinated disinformation cycle. No credible defence analysis suggests Afghan forces possess the operational capability demonstrated in the claim,” it said.
Meanwhile, Foreign Office Spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said that Afghan claims of downing a Pakistani jet and capturing a pilot were “totally untrue”.
“That’s a false claim. Totally untrue,” Andrabi told AFP.</p><small>2026-02-28 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/281657237114f58.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976454/bombing-a-sovereign-country-is-not-preemptive-politicians-analysts-react-as-us-and-israel-strike-iran' target='_blank'><strong>‘Bombing a sovereign country is not preemptive’: Politicians, analysts react as US and Israel strike Iran</strong></a><br><p>The United States and Israel launched a wave of strikes against targets in Iran on Saturday, triggering explosions in the capital Tehran and an escalation across the region.
“We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally — again — obliterated. We’re going to annihilate their navy,” said US President Donald Trump in an address from his Florida home posted to his Truth Social platform.
On the other hand, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation aimed to “remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran”, and urged Iranians to overthrow the Islamic Republic’s clerical leadership.
In response to the Israel-US aggression, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran later in the day confirmed the launch of the “first wave” of missile and drone attacks against Israel in response to the strikes on its territory.
Political figures and analysts in Pakistan have condemned the recent developments, particularly criticising US President Donald Trump, and warned that the escalation could have grave consequences for the region.
In a statement issued by the PPP Media Cell, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari condemned the Israeli attack on Iran, calling it a “matter of serious concern” for peace in the region. He further stated that the “cowardly attack” by Israel was an attempt to cover its atrocities in Gaza.
The PPP chairman also called on the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to take all possible measures to stop the Israeli aggression. The international community should take notice of Israel’s open violation of Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added.







Author and journalist Zahid Hussain noted in a post on social media platform X that “predictably, the US and Israel have attacked Iran”.
“The so-called ‘peace time president’ has invaded two countries and attacked several others in the first year of his term,” he added, seemingly referring to Trump, who has repeatedly claimed that he has played a role in stopping multiple wars.
Hussain also warned that the “latest US aggression will have serious consequences for Pakistan and the entire region”.







Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, UK and United Nations Maleeha Lodhi called on Pakistan to condemn the US-Israeli aggression against Iran “without delay”.
“The people of Pakistan expect no less than to stand in solidarity with Iran,” she said in a post on X.







Meanwhile, former senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed pointed out that the Israeli-American aggression against Iran has “grave implications” for the region and Pakistan.
“If God forbid, Iran loses, then Israel’s de facto border will be at Taftan on the Pakistan border […] India-Israeli axis will tighten the squeeze on Pakistan, creating a nutcracker situation.
“Balochistan and Pakistan’s nuclear program could then also be targeted! Hence, urgent need for Pakistan to defuse tensions with Afghanistan as well as give a healing touch at home to defuse political polarisation,” he said.







Lawyer and human rights professional Reema Omer noted that “preventative” or “preemptive” attacks had no basis in international law.
“They are mere euphemisms for the crime of aggression, i.e. the use of force against another state without legal justification,”she wrote on X.
“The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg described the crime of aggression as the ‘supreme international crime’ as it ‘contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole’,” she added.







Jamaat-i-Islami Pakistan former emir Sirajul Haq termed the attack on Iran “state terrorism” and urged Muslims to unite instead of “merely condemning it and waiting for their turn”.
“Following Israeli aggression, Muslim countries should announce their withdrawal from Trump’s so-called peace board,” he said.







Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari said: “Terrorist Israel has launched multiple attacks against Iran just as Iran and the US were supposedly near an agreement.
“Given the lack of support within the US to attack Iran, Trump most likely sought an attack by Israel, knowing Iran would respond, which would allow the US to ‘justifiably’ attack Iran.”







Separately, journalist Iftikhar Firdous said that with Iran being attacked during an active conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the entire Western border strip “is now under fire”.
“The dynamics that emerge out of this conflict will shape global and regional geopolitics for the decades to come,” he wrote in a post on X.







Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief and Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas condemned the “reckless and unlawful military attacks launched” against Iran.
“This timing makes it clear that the talks were used as cover for a pre-planned aggression. Diplomacy was sabotaged deliberately. Who can trust any negotiation process now when advances in talks lead straight to bombardment? The Israeli claim of a ‘preemptive’ strike is absurd. There was no evidence Iran planned any attack on Israel,” he said.
“Such actions by the US under Trump and Israel under Netanyahu are a grave violation of international law, including the UN Charter. They risk turning the Persian Gulf and the wider Middle East into a catastrophe. The entire prospering region is now on fire because of this madness,” he said.
He added that Iran’s response was a “legitimate act of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter”.
“I call on the government of Pakistan to categorically and unequivocally condemn this aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he said.







Author and activist Fatima Bhutto said, “If they succeed in Iran, Israel will turn to Pakistan next. They are the greatest threat to the world — a rogue terror state.”







She further stated, “Bombing a sovereign country is not preemptive. The only state that has a right to defend itself now is Iran. May they do it, they would acting on behalf of the world.”







Former federal minister Khawaja Saad Rafique said that the Israeli attack on Iran with American backing was “state terrorism”.
“It is the fundamental right of the Iranian people to determine Iran’s national security priorities. The US and Israel cannot dictate this,” he said.
“Attacks on Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear energy are nothing but global tyranny,” he said.







Former federal finance minister and Awam Pakistan Party leader Miftah Ismail said the party condemned the “unwarranted attack” by Israel and the US on Iran.
“It has sharply escalated tensions and risks far-reaching consequences across the region. It is particularly regrettable that this attack has come in the midst of negotiations being facilitated by Oman,” he said.
“We call on Israel and the United States to immediately end this bombing campaign against Iran, so that dialogue can resume and peace can return to the Middle East,” he said.
“We are also concerned about reports of missiles being fired on other Gulf States and call for this bombing to be stopped forthwith,” he added.

According to a statement by the PIA spokesperson, flights have been suspended to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Doha, and Kuwait.
“These flights will not operate until tomorrow evening or until the restoration of airspace, whichever comes later,” the spokesperson said.
“PIA flights to Saudi Arabia will continue; however, their routes have been changed,” he added.
“Flights have been shifted to Boeing 777 aircraft and will reach their destinations via longer routes,” the spokesperson added.

Trump: ‘annihilate’
US President Donald Trump vowed that the strikes would cripple Iran’s military and urged Iranians to rise up against the Islamic republic.
“We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally — again — obliterated. We’re going to annihilate their navy,” Trump said in the address from his Florida home posted to his Truth Social platform.

 


Calling on Iranians to stand up to their government, Trump added: “The hour of your freedom is at hand.” But he also warned that “the lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties”.
Netanyahu ‘cast off the yoke’
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation aimed to “remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran”, and urged Iranians to overthrow the Islamic republic’s clerical leadership.







“Our joint action will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands,” Netanyahu added. “The time has come for all the people of Iran… to cast off the yoke of tyranny and bring about a free and peace-seeking Iran.”
Russia: Talks a ‘cover’
Russia called on its citizens to leave Iran, with former president Dmitry Medvedev saying that talks with the United States had just been a “cover”.
“The peacekeeper is at it again,” Medvedev, now the chair of Russia’s security council, said in a post on X.







“The talks with Iran were just a cover. Everyone knew that. So who has more patience to wait for the enemy’s sorry end now?” he added.
Qatar: ‘secure’
Qatar, which hosts a US military base, initially said it was secure after the US and Israeli attacks on neighbouring Iran but was monitoring developments closely.
“The situation inside the State of Qatar is stable and secure,” an interior ministry statement said.
An official later told AFP that Qatari defence systems had intercepted an Iranian missile, and the defence ministry said it had repelled “a number of attacks.”
Shah’s son: ‘final victory’ near - Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah and a leading critic of Tehran, said that “we are very close to final victory” following the strikes.
“I want to be by your side as soon as possible so that together we can take back and rebuild Iran,” said Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the Washington area and had repeatedly urged Trump to intervene.







Jordan: protect skies
Jordan’s military said its air force was at work on Saturday to protect the kingdom and its people while the strikes were ongoing.
“These sorties are part of aerial reconnaissance and inspection operations aimed at maintaining the safety of Jordanian airspace and ensuring that it is free from any attempts at infiltration or illegal activities,” a military source said, after sirens were reported in Amman.
France: safety a priority
France, which has several military bases in the Middle East, notably in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, said that Paris’s priority was the safety of its citizens.
“Obviously our priority in these sort of cases is the protection of our nationals, the protection of our forces in the region and the monitoring of the situation in real time, which we are doing,” Alice Rufo, minister-delegate to the Armed Forces and Veterans’ Affairs ministry, told France 2 television.
African Union: stability at risk
The African Union called “for restraint, urgent de-escalation and sustained dialogue” after the strikes, warning that conflict could risk harming people on the continent.
“Further escalation risks worsening global instability, with serious implications for energy markets, food security, and economic resilience —  particularly in Africa, where conflict and economic pressures remain acute,” said the pan-African body’s head, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf.
Poland ‘prepared’
Polish staff at its embassy in Tehran were “safe” but the country is “prepared for various scenarios,” Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X.







Netherlands: ‘restraint’
In a post on X, Dutch Foreign Minister Tom Berendsen said: “The Netherlands calls on all parties to exercise restraint and prevent further escalation.
Stability in the region is essential.

“In view of the prevailing sensitive national situation, PTA urges all citizens to be responsible while using social media and digital platforms,” the body said, advising citizens not to “share, disseminate, forward or upload information/content which is authentic and based upon official sources and to refrain from spreading rumours and fake news”.







PTA cautioned against sharing fake news or information “liable to legal action in accordance with applicable laws”.
“PTA calls upon all citizens to act with caution, maturity, and a strong sense of national responsibility to help, maintain stability and public confidence,” the statement added.
The statement comes against the backdrop of escalating geopolitical tension in the Middle East, as Israel and the United States launched an attack on Iran on Saturday.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s armed forces continue to counter the Afghan Taliban regime’s aggression on its western border as part of Operation Ghazab lil-Haq, which was launched against the Afghan Taliban after “unprovoked firing” from across the border.</p><small>2026-02-28 10:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2817285840bc39e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976305/misinformation-and-memes-run-amok-amidst-pak-afghan-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Misinformation and memes run amok amidst Pak-Afghan conflict</strong></a><br><p>The moment reports of a military confrontation break, newsrooms gear up for sleepless nights, social media erupts with all sorts of “information” and memes (the latter is Pakistan-specific), and fact-checkers know they will have their hands full in the coming days.
The latest clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which began late Thursday night and continued into early Saturday morning, was no different.
Within the first 12 hours, the fact-checking team at iVerify Pakistan had spotted more than a dozen claims circulating on social media, ranging from the names of Taliban commanders allegedly killed and footage of Pakistani jets crashing to visuals of chaos following an attack on the Kakul military academy and soldiers from both sides purportedly being captured. Local journalists and social media commentators all fed into this cycle of mis- and disinformation, along with propaganda accounts from India and Afghanistan.

 

When war turns into content
In the midst of the late-night action on Thursday, as Pakistan launched ‘Operation Ghazab lil-Haq’ and both sides reported mounting damages inflicted on each other, UK’s Sky News ran a news bulletin in which the anchor says, “ …Afghanistan’s military authorities say they have begun carrying out air strikes against Pakistan”.
The clip, which was posted on X and started receiving backlash within minutes — since Afghanistan has no real air force to speak of — was deleted after a while, but not before the meme brigade had a field day with it.
But as mentioned above, Pakistanis’ memes are always at the ready; scrolling through X on Friday night, I saw as many people posting memes, mostly about Pakistan’s military supremacy compared to its neighbour’s, as I did people sharing updates about the ongoing military engagement at the time.
That Pakistanis turn to humour in moments of crisis, from cricket to war, is not new information – and we are, undoubtedly, exceptionally good at it – but that we do so as an immediate reaction to a situation that could lead to more civilian casualties on both sides is a concern worth pondering over. For netizens of a country all too familiar with turmoil, humour may be a somewhat natural coping mechanism, as this article from the India-Pakistan meme-war of 2025 observes, but when it comes at the expense of those living in your own country, you know it is no longer harmless.
To elaborate, the Prime Minister’s Media Coordinator Badar Shahbaz, at 3:13 a.m. on Friday night, shared a video of a group of people with the caption: “Youth of Pakistan expressing their feelings for their armed forces in the wake of the Afghanistan situation. Pakistan Hamesha Zindabad.”







Six minutes later at 3:19am, in the middle of providing important updates on the skirmishes, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar – or his team – re-shared it with this caption: “The youth of Pakistan have a distinct sense of patriotism; they find humour in every situation.”
Laughter that lands on the vulnerable
Setting aside the government co-opting the nation’s tried-and-tested coping mechanism, let’s talk about how they didn’t even do it right. The video features a group of men and women, with one person delivering lines like, “You’re Afghani, and you’re going to attack Pakistan?” and a young woman popping in to say, “acha jee”, which can only be translated as “oh really”. One could have ignored the cringe-inducing script, but not when one of the lines goes: “Apart from running tandoors, you also fight wars?”
The line perpetuates stereotypes, looks down upon the livelihoods of many, and brings the war within our own borders. As of December 2025, according to UNHCR, 1,021,562 registered Afghan refugees live in Pakistan. This figure comes after the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan, which began in November 2023 and did not exempt even those with proper documentation, such as Proof of Registration (PoR) cards, or those born in Pakistan.
This publication has already addressed the flaws in the repatriation policy in many articles, including this one by former parliamentarian Ghazan Jamal, so I won’t delve into that here. However, I will emphasise that Pakistan has witnessed multiple waves of Afghan refugee influx, spanning the period from the Soviet Union’s invasion in 1979 to the Taliban’s recapture of Afghanistan in 2021.
Over the years, millions of Afghans have lived in Pakistan and become part of its society. The “tandoor” that is referred to so derogatorily in this video is available and appreciated across the country. You will find an eatery named Afghan Tandoor, or some iteration of it, in most of our major cities. Our capital boasts some of the best Afghan cuisine. Whether these establishments are run by Afghans or employ them is a moot point; the video reduces them to “tandoor walas” without taking into account the racist slurs and comments that already exist in our society.
From being linked to rising crime waves and violence without clear data to being labelled a ‘tattered Afghan refugee’ who is perceived as a burden on the government — regardless of education and economic background — the Afghans in Pakistan have struggled for acceptance in Pakistan for decades.
On its own, this video — and particularly this one line — is in poor taste; but when it is endorsed by government officials and lumped together with patriotism, it becomes extremely problematic and poses a danger to a community that has made Pakistan its home.
Our government would be among the first — and rightly so — to speak about the safety of Pakistan-origin migrants in other countries when they are targeted. For example, back in January 2025, Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) condemned the “increasingly racist and Islamophobic” comments directed at Pakistanis in the UK following the disturbing revelations of the Rochdale grooming gang. Most of the perpetrators were indeed British-Pakistanis, but as the FO noted “the increasingly racist and Islamophobic political and media commentary in the UK … aimed at conflating the reprehensible actions of a few individuals with the entire 1.7 million British Pakistani diaspora” was deeply concerning.
So shouldn’t the same principles apply to the people who live alongside us?
In military escalations, it’s a given that misinformation and mockery can run amok – but is one more dangerous than the other?
The answer is that they can overlap and cause even more damage when combined.
The stakes of speech in escalating tensions
When we speak of false information, there is a third category apart from misinformation (spreading inaccurate information) and disinformation (deliberately spreading inaccurate information): malinformation. This refers to information that is based on truth — though it may be exaggerated or presented out of context — but is shared with the intent to attack an idea, individual, organisation, group, country, or other entity.
This is the trickiest category for fact-checkers, much like hate speech, which often falls under it, as you cannot always verify social commentary or provide evidence (something fact-checking is meant to do) to demonstrate how a notion is preposterous and harmful. As identified in the iVerify report, based on data from the claims it reviewed over two years, these narratives exploit historical grievances, deepen mistrust, and pose tangible risks to social cohesion and public safety.
The comments under both government officials’ posts show many people criticising the crassness of the video. But — lest they (or I) be labelled anti-state for critiquing it — they are not unpatriotic; Pakistanis believe the country has the full right to defend itself resolutely and ensure that no armed actors violate its territory. However, we also expect better from our leaders, who represent all those who live in the country, regardless of where they come from, and are tasked with ensuring their safety.
In situations of conflict and battle, nationalism and emotions are at their peak, so the words and actions of leaders carry even greater weight and implications. Leave the humour to the people; keep your focus on the facts.</p><small>2026-02-28 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/28111622fcc9ddf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976376/iftar-sehri-timings-for-ramazan-1011' target='_blank'><strong>Iftar, Sehri timings for Ramazan 10/11</strong></a><br><p>Times for today’s Iftar (Ramazan 10) and tomorrow’s Sehri (Ramazan 11) for the federal and provincial capitals are listed below:

While the Group 1 match between toppers South Africa and Zimbabwe in Delhi will be inconsequential, India’s game against West Indies of the same group in Kolkata will be a virtual quarter-final.
Prior to the Sunday double-header, calculators will be on the moment today’s last Group 2 contest between Pakistan and Sri Lanka explodes into action in Pallekele under lights.
As usual, Pakistan cricket fans, including the disgruntled ones, remain in their typical fanciful mode — waiting for something extraordinary to happen in a global competition. The beleaguered Green-shirts under Salman Ali Agha face a monumental task: beating the Islanders in their backyard and winning it big, to qualify for the semi-finals. Having already exited the event, the co-hosts have nothing to lose, and so expect some instinctive fireworks from them.
The real puzzle is faced by Pakistan, who — according to the stats — are required to win today’s game by 64 runs or achieve the winning target in 13.1 overs in order to improve their net run-rate to overtake New Zealand’s overall scoring rate. Indeed, a mighty ask in the shortest slam-bang format.
But it’s not impossible, stats suggest. The highest T20 International score in Pallekele is 263-3, courtesy Glen Maxwell’s thunderous 65-ball 145, posted by Australia some 10 years ago; Sri Lanka amassed 225-5 at the same venue against Oman in the ongoing event earlier this month; the co-hosts successfully chased down 182 in 18 overs at this venue against Australia earlier in this tournament, thanks to a 52-ball 100 by opener Pathum Nissanka.
The same venue has produced low totals as well, including Sri Lanka’s 95 that resulted in their 51-run loss to England in a Super Eights encounter less than a week ago as spinner Will Jacks (3-22) led the charge; and the hosts’ 116 all out while chasing a modest 129 against the same country, as Jacob Bethell (4-11) and Jacks (3-14) stood out, just before the ongoing World Cup.
Mammoth targets become achievable only if one scales their degree and requirements in time, and accordingly embraces the horses-for-courses stance.
However, Pakistan cricket works differently and has remained wobbly in cut-throat International Cricket Council (ICC) events for years owing to a myriad of erroneous decisions in team selection.
But wait here. This is not merely a problem of poor selection in Pakistan cricket. It runs deep. Inappropriate selection is just a prominent symptom. Though there are numerous complex causes for the alarming decline of Pakistan cricket that are difficult to address, one strongly feels stardom — and that too imagined, not proven fully — is one of the prime factors that has badly damaged the country’s cricket in recent years.
Professional players around the world gradually make themselves stars through rigorous training, development and consistent performance in top-notch contests, of course with a proper system in place. Whereas in Pakistan the topsy-turvy system pushes a player to stardom.
When individuals are preferred over prime collective goals for reasons best known to the decision-makers, the system starts to erode. Besides rusting the system, this decline quietly damages the individuals too. For this reason, comparing Babar, who has now spent over a decade in international cricket, to the great Virat Kohli now sounds humorous. Some may still disagree.
Maxwell, Nissanka, Bethell and Jacks, or for that matter any other cricketer, are judged purely on the basis of their timely contributions in key contests —not due to their individual records that do not furnish victories for the team.
Stats do not lie, particularly in T20 cricket in the contemporary era dominated by technology-based analysis. Sometimes they may be wrongly perceived and analysed due to various reasons, but figures do show a player’s overall utility for the team.
Babar, who otherwise boasts a pretty decent T20 International batting stats, has not been able to justify his selection in the national team for World Cups — since he started representing Pakistan in the shortest format in 2021 — where he has managed just 640 runs so far in 21 innings at an average of 33.68 with a strike-rate of 111 which is regarded as below ordinary in modern-day T20 clashes.
His 145-match T20 International career strike-rate is 128 which goes on to show that the batter has failed to meet the challenge specifically in high-pressure World Cup games.
In the ongoing World Cup, the 31-year-old’s show with the bat, simple figures signify, has been way too ordinary. Scores of 15, 46 (against the USA), 5 and 25 plainly do not portray anything exceptional. In the Super Eights match against England, the batter consumed 24 balls for his 25, which slowed Pakistan down in the crucial middle overs.
And it is not just stats that raise questions over Babar’s visibly sluggish willow work in top-level T20 World Cup clashes.
Does he have anything special in his stroke-making, any unorthodox-cum-beneficial batting style that can catch the opposition off guard? And how in this world can one deny his frailties against good-quality spinners? On what grounds can he be included in the playing XI for today’s outing that in all probability will demand brisk scoring? Can the profile of a player is bigger than the team’s fundamental needs on a given day?
Due to Babar’s inclusion in the playing XI of a T20 match, aggressive top-order stroke-player Fakhar Zaman has to be dropped down the order which at times simply kills the left-hander’s game and eventually dents Pakistan in high-quality games of narrow margins.
While considering the entire scenario, one strongly feels it will be a wise move by the team management if Babar is axed for today’s match.
The way he was cleaned up in the present World Cup, both against India and England, very much shows frustration and lack of concentration and application in a player who otherwise is a classy shot-maker.

 

In this situation, dropping him for today’s game will benefit Babar too who definitely needs a break — to recuperate and analyse himself.
In this way, on one hand, the team management can give a chance to belligerent wicket-keeper/batter Khawaja Nafay or all-rounder Faheem Ashraf in the playing XI.
Being pragmatic, the target for Pakistan today looks massive, and may well not be achieved even with Babar in the XI.
Conversely, if a Babar-less Pakistan side manage to win today’s match against Sri Lanka and make the semi-finals, it will be considered a courageous move by the team management to earn the desired collective result. Subsequently, this will also create a significantly positive impact on the youngsters in the Green-shirts’ camp, and reduce pressure on Babar as well.
The focus of the entire exercise in Pallekele today must be Pakistan cricket team’s progress and advancement, not that of any individual, let alone Babar. After all, this is a team sport, and currently the only one from which the nation has some hopes, though slim.</p><small>2026-02-28 06:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/281029214f42378.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976371/trump-directs-us-agencies-to-toss-anthropics-ai-as-pentagon-calls-startup-a-supply-risk' target='_blank'><strong>Trump directs US agencies to toss Anthropic’s AI as Pentagon calls startup a supply risk</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Friday he is directing the government to stop work with Anthropic, and the Pentagon said it would declare the start-up a supply-chain risk, dealing a major blow to the artificial intelligence lab after a showdown about technology guardrails.
Trump added there would be a six-month phase-out for the Defence Department and other agencies that use the company’s products. If Anthropic does not help with the transition, Trump said, he would use “the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow”.







The actions mark an extraordinary rebuke by the United States against one of the premier companies that has kept it in the lead on national security-critical AI, threatening to give Anthropic a pariah status that Washington until now had reserved for enemy suppliers. Google and Amazon are among Anthropic’s financial backers.
The moves further set a precedent that US law alone would constrain how AI is deployed on the battlefield, with the Pentagon seeking to preserve all flexibility in defence and not be limited by warnings from the technology’s creators against powering weapons with unreliable AI.
In a statement, Anthropic said it would challenge any risk designation in court by the Department of Defence, which the Trump administration has renamed the Department of War.
“We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government,” the company said.
“No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons.”
Late on Friday, rival OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, Amazon and others, announced its own deal to deploy technology in the Defence Department’s classified network.
CEO Sam Altman on X said the Pentagon shared its principles for human responsibility over weapon systems and for having no mass US surveillance.







“We put them into our agreement,” Altman said of the points. “We also will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the DoW also wanted.”
It was not immediately clear whether these contractual details differed from the red lines proposed by Anthropic. The Pentagon and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
‘Nuclear War’
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said Anthropic would be designated a supply-chain risk, following an impasse in months of talks on whether the company’s policies could constrain military action.
Meeting with Hegseth this week, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei argued for weapons and surveillance limits and irked Pentagon officials. The Pentagon said US law, not a private company, would determine how to defend the country.
The designation could bar tens of thousands of contractors from using Anthropic’s AI when working for the Pentagon. That represents an existential threat to its business with the government and could harm its private-sector relationships, said Franklin Turner, an attorney who specialises in government contracts.
“Blacklisting Anthropic is the contractual equivalent of nuclear war,” he said.
Similar US action was taken to remove Chinese tech giant Huawei from the Pentagon’s supply chains. Starting in 2017, the US restricted Defence Department use of Huawei equipment, prohibited federal agencies from purchasing its technology, and halted federal grant and loan funds for Huawei equipment.
Anthropic has raced to win fierce competition to sell novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of a widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalised an IPO decision.
Saif Khan, who served in the National Security Council in former President Joe Biden’s White House, said the Defence Department’s action “may be the most draconian domestic AI regulation any government has ever issued.” “The Department is arguably treating Anthropic as a greater national security threat than any Chinese AI companies, none of whom they’ve designated supply-chain risks,” Khan said.
‘Killer Robots’
Tech companies and the Pentagon have repeatedly locked horns since at least 2018, when employees at Google protested against the Pentagon’s use of its AI to analyse drone footage. A rapprochement ensued with companies including Amazon and Microsoft jousting for defence business, while several big-tech CEOs pledged co-operation last year with the Trump administration.
But theoretical “killer robots” have worried human-rights and technology activists as wars in Ukraine and Gaza showcased increasingly automated systems.
Bolder US military action in the past year has added to these concerns, said Jack Shanahan, who had directed the Pentagon’s algorithmic warfare effort Project Maven.
“People might be a little bit more nervous about no restrictions,” Shanahan said. The White House’s legal sign-off could be “top cover for anybody that does anything that would potentially result in lack of due process, civilian casualties, collateral damage.”
The Pentagon signed agreements worth up to $200 million each with major AI labs in the past year, including Anthropic, OpenAI and Google.
Anthropic, negotiating for awards under that ceiling, had flagged concerns about the legal system’s ability to keep up with AI progress. At present, for instance, US laws do not prevent the use of technology to compile seemingly innocuous data to reveal information about people’s private lives, its CEO Amodei has said.
Anthropic’s AI has been in use across the intelligence community and armed services, and it was first among peer AI companies to work with classified information, through a supply deal via cloud provider Amazon.</p><small>2026-02-28 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653340-ecc-extends-loan-limit-to-rs10m-for-mera-ghar-mera-aashiana-applicants' target='_blank'><strong>ECC extends loan limit to Rs10m for Mera Ghar Mera Aashiana applicants</strong></a><br><p>

A SCREENSHOT from the Greens’ Urdu language campaign video.

LONDON: The Green Party of England and Wales secured a landmark victory in the Gorton and Denton by-election, overturning Labour’s 13,000-vote majority in a result that comes as a significant setback to Keir Starmer.
Hannah Spencer, a local plumber and Green councillor, was elected as the party’s first MP in northern England after winning 14,980 votes in a tightly contested race.
Reform UK came second with 10,578 votes, while Labour slumped to third place, finishing 5,616 votes behind the Greens, a dramatic 25.3 per cent drop in its vote share compared with 2024.
Starmer, facing mounting questions over Labour’s campaign strategy, vowed to “keep on fighting” after what party insiders described as a humiliating defeat in a constituency long considered a Labour stronghold.
Multilingual campaign
Central to Spencer’s campaign was an unprecedented multilingual outreach effort aimed at engaging Gorton and Denton’s diverse electorate. The Greens released campaign pamphlets and a video in Urdu, and later in Bangla, highlighting issues such as inflation, unemployment and the housing crisis.

Councillor Hannah Spencer wins on the back of unique campaign which used Urdu and Bangla to spread her message

In the Urdu language video, Spencer is seen visiting local businesses and addressing voters directly in Urdu. Over images of Starmer shaking hands with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Foreign Secretary David Lammy meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Spencer says: “Politicians aren’t working for us.”
The references were widely interpreted as an attempt to appeal to Muslim voters, who make up 28.4pc of the constituency, while 26.6pc of residents identify as Asian. Although there is no official breakdown of Urdu speakers in the constituency, it is considered one of the more diverse areas in England.
Spencer defended the strategy, saying it reflected the constituency’s linguistic diversity.
“Gorton and Denton is a beautifully diverse constituency, with thousands of residents who speak languages other than English,” she said.
“I’m proud of our campaign, and of this video, which has been positive, inclusive and focused on the issues that matter most to local people: bringing down rents and bills, proper investment in public services, and rebuilding our NHS.”
Rivals cry foul
The multilingual materials triggered sharp criticism from Labour and Reform UK.
Deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell accused the Greens of a “shameful attempt to manipulate the respected Muslim community,” while a senior Cabinet minister told The Times that the party was “deliberately raising the salience of Gaza” to erode Labour’s support.
Reform UK candidate Matt Goodwin described the Urdu language video as “blatant sectarianism,” and Reform MP Sarah Pochin released a video condemning the move.
The Greens rejected the accusations and doubled down by issuing a similar campaign advert in Bangla, the national language of Bangladesh. Spencer accused Labour of resorting to “racist dog whistles” and insisted that providing materials in languages other than English was about inclusion, not division.
“I will be an MP for the whole of Gorton and Denton,” she said, “and I’m proud that we’re demonstrating that by speaking to constituents in the languages they speak.”
Landmark win
The by-election result marks one of the most significant Green breakthroughs outside London and Brighton, raising questions about Labour’s grip on urban, ethnically diverse constituencies.
For Starmer, who had pledged to rebuild Labour’s electoral coalition, the loss is a stark warning that disaffection among key voter groups could reshape the political landscape ahead of the next general election.
For the Greens, meanwhile, the victory signals a new phase of ambition and a willingness to adopt bold and targeted campaigning in pursuit of it.
Columnist Taj Ali, writing for Hyphen noted that the Green victory in Gorton and Denton proves working-class and Muslim voters have options.

Addressing the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Volker Turk slammed “social systems that silence women and girls” and allow powerful men to abuse them with impunity.
“Violence against women, including femicide, is a global emergency,” the High Commissioner for Human Rights told the UN’s top rights body.
He highlighted the extreme situation in Afghanistan, warning that the “system of segregation imposed on women is reminiscent of apartheid, based on gender rather than race”.
He also pointed to two cases that have recently caused shock waves around the world: those of convicted Epstein and of French rape survivor Gisele Pelicot.
Both cases “show the extent of the exploitation and abuse of women and girls”, Turk said, asking: “does anyone think there are not many more men like Dominique Pelicot or Jeffrey Epstein?”
Epstein associated with the world’s rich, famous and powerful despite his conviction in 2008 to procuring a child for prostitution.
He died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while facing trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.
Gisele Pelicot gave the public insight into her shocking case when she waived her right to anonymity during the 2024 trial in France of her ex-husband Dominique and dozens of strangers who he brought in to rape her while she was unconscious.
“Such horrific abuse is enabled by social systems that silence women and girls, and insulate powerful men from accountability,” Turk charged.
“States must investigate all alleged crimes, protect survivors, and ensure justice without fear or favour,” he insisted.­

ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Friday adjourned the hearing of applications seeking suspension of sentence filed by lawyer and rights activists Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chat­tha in the controversial tweets case, as the defence pressed for an early date before Eid.
Justice Muhammad Asif took up the matter amid a request from the state to transfer the appeal to another bench.
During the proceedings, the assistant attorney general submitted that a case of similar nature had earlier been heard by Justice Azam Khan and reques­ted that the present appeal also be placed before his court.
He argued that it would be appropriate for the same bench to hear related matters.

Rights activists granted bail by anti-terrorism court in two other cases

However, the counsel for the appellants, Advocate Riasat Ali Azad, opposed the request, maintaining that no such case was pending before any other court of the country.
He pointed out that the present appeal had been heard by Jus­tice Muhammad Asif since its inception and questioned how the government could raise objections to the bench at this stage.

 

Expressing full confidence in the court, Mr Azad urged the ju­­dge to fix the matter for hearing before Eid, saying an early date would bring relief to his clients.
Justice Asif asked the state to clarify which case was pending before Justice Azam Khan. Observers present in the courtroom noted that while other cases involving the accused might be pending elsewhere, the instant appeal had consistently remained before the same bench.
The judge later rose and proceeded to his chambers after re­­marking, “Let’s see,” in response to the request for an early date. The state counsel informed the court that it had no objection if a date was fixed. Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned without immediate scheduling of the suspension pleas.
Bail granted
In a separate development, Anti-Terrorism Court Judge Abul Hasanat Muhammad Zulqarnain granted bail to Ms Mazari and Mr Chattha in two other cases.
The bail was allowed against surety bonds of Rs5,000 each in cases related to an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court and a protest outside the National Press Club.
In the case concerning the al­­leged altercation outside the high court, an affidavit submitted by the complainant and Islamabad High Court Bar Association president Syed Wajid Ali Gillani was made part of the record.
However, in the controversial tweets case — in which both rights activists have been convicted — bail has yet to be granted. Owing to the absence of relief in that matter, their release remains subject to the outcome of the pending suspension of sentence applications before the high court.

CAIRO: Relentless Israeli attacks killed at least seven Palestinians in Gaza on Friday, medics said, adding to a death toll of at least 600 people killed by Israeli fire since a US-brokered ceasefire agreement came into effect last October.
Gaza’s health officials reported that in southern Gaza, five people were killed and several others were injured, some critically, in Israeli drone strikes. The strikes targeted two police checkpoints in Khan Yunis and in the Abu Hujair area northwest of the Bureij refugee camp later in the day, medics said.
Separately, an Israeli airstrike against a group of Palestinians in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood in northern Gaza killed two people and wounded several others.
Ban on NGOs frozen
Meanwhile, Israel’s Supreme Court decided in a ruling published on Friday to freeze a government ban on 37 foreign NGOs working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank pending a final decision.
“Without taking any position, a temporary interim order is hereby issued,” the court said in a ruling responding to a petition from more than a dozen NGOs, seeking to reverse the ban after Israel’s government revoked their status in Israel.
The decision theoretically allows the NGOs to work in Gaza and the West Bank until a final ruling, but aid groups are unsure about the freeze’s implementation.
Organisations like MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and CARE were informed on Dec 30, 2025, that their Israeli registrations expired and they had 60 days to renew them by providing Palestinian staff lists.
If they failed to do so, they would have to cease operations in Gaza and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, from March 1.
The NGOs, through AIDA, petitioned the Supreme Court after losing their charity registration in Israel, following a year-long refusal to disclose their Palestinian employees to Israeli authorities.
The court said in its ruling that there existed a “genuine legal dispute” due to the foreign NGOs’ responsibilities to their employees’ privacy under European law.
“We are still waiting to see how the injunction will be interpreted by the state and whether or not this will mean an increase in our ability to operate”, Athena Rayburn, AIDA director, told AFP, calling it “a step in the right direction”.
Sympathy shifts to Palestinians
Separately, a fresh Gallup poll shows that for the first time, Americans sympathise more with Palestinians than with Israelis in their decades-long conflict.
The poll, released on Friday, found that 41 per cent of Americans sympathise more with the Palestinians and 36pc sided with Israel, a sharp reversal from just a year ago when Israel led in sympathies 46 to 33pc.
For the first time in over two decades, Israel is not leading in Gallup’s poll, though the gap is not significant.
Partisan views on the Middle East show more independents shifting towards Palestinians, with an 11-point preference over Israel in the past year.
Democrats overwhelmingly support Palestinians, with 65pc sympathising with them versus 17pc for Israel.
Democrats blame ex-president Joe Biden for insufficient action to curb Israel’s offensive in Gaza after October 7,2023, escalation.
Gallup surveyed 1,001 US adults by telephone from February 2 to 16.

UNMARKED boxes can be used to violate rules on safe charity.—Dawn

• Experts warn unregulated funds being channelled through anonymous collection boxes undermine NAP objectives• Official says ‘owners’ will be identified once seminaries registered with home department
LAHORE: Despite the Punjab home department’s crackdown on illicit charities and the listing of 89 banned organisations, so-called “nameless donation boxes” continue to proliferate on street corners and electric poles, with their anonymous collectors leaving donors wondering who is really behind the appeals.
These “nameless donation boxes”, physically secured with heavy chains and locks, can be spotted at road intersections, markets, shopping malls and banks across Punjab.
Experts say billions of rupees in unregulated funds are being siphoned off under the guise of piety. They warn that this system has bypassed the core objectives of the National Action Plan, which was intended to dismantle the financial networks that fuel instability.
When contacted, a senior home department officer acknowledged that the “nameless donation boxes” were still in place, adding that the department would identify the ownership of such boxes once madaris (seminaries) were registered with the home department.
Identifying the network of “nameless donation boxes” as silent routes of funding, founder of the Civil Services Legacy Guide and former civil servant Yawar Mehdi called upon the federal and provincial governments to dismantle what he described as a dangerous network operating across Pakistan.
‘Silent routes’
Acknowledging the Punjab government’s recent notification banning extremist and illegal organisations from collecting funds, Mr Mehdi warned that the “silent crime” of anonymous donation boxes remained hidden in plain sight, effectively blinding the administration and bypassing the law.
He said funding collected through these boxes was undermining the core objectives of NAP aimed at dismantling destabilising financial networks. “The blood of martyrs and the loss of thousands of lives to domestic unrest will remain a grave concern for the state as long as these silent routes of funding stay open,” he warned.
State intervention sought
To reclaim the state writ, Mr Mehdi proposed that the prime minister issue emergency directives to the interior minister and all chief ministers, ordering that all illegal and anonymous donation boxes be taken into state custody under the direct supervision of divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners and district police officers. He said this should be accompanied by a transparent official record of every rupee collected.
“If the state does not close these unregulated financial channels today, future generations will never forgive the silence of those in power, as the haunting question remains: where do those who spread unrest get their fuel?” he said.
Registration key to tracing owners
A senior home department officer said the department had “completely squeezed” illicit and unregistered charities and was actively working on the registration of all madaris. Admitting that some “nameless donation boxes” were still present, the officer said the department would identify the ownership of such boxes once madaris were registered with the home department.
He said the home department had held several meetings with ulema from various madaris and had developed a proforma for madaris registration.
“Once the madaris are registered with the home department, they will be asked to identify their donation boxes installed at different locations across the province,” the officer said.
However, he said the existing donation boxes belonging to registered organisations and NGOs already carry complete information, including the organisation’s name, registration code and contact numbers.

An official statement said members of the Tax Bar Associations apprised the chairman of the challenges being faced by taxpayers, particularly in relation to the super tax and SRO 350(I)/2024.
Mr Langrial assured participants that the FBR remains fully committed to facilitating taxpayers and addressing all genuine concerns on a priority basis. To ensure timely resolution, he announced the formation of a committee to examine the issues raised by the tax bar associations and propose practical solutions for their early redress.
Operations, policy and legal members of FBR’s Inland Revenue wing also attended the meeting and took part in detailed deliberations.
Appreciating the consultative role of the tax bar associations, the chair­man said their in-depth understanding of Pakistan’s taxation framework makes their input valuable for policy refinement, system imp­rovement and the promotion of voluntary compliance.
The meeting was atte­n­ded by prominent representatives of the tax bar associations, including Pak­istan Tax Bar Association Patron Rana Munir Hus­sain, Pakistan Tax Bar Association President Shei­­kh Ahsanul Haq, Lahore Tax Bar Association Presi­dent Muhammad Asif Rana, former president of Lahore Tax Bar Association Chaudhary Qamaruz Zam­an, Senior Vice President of Pakistan Tax Bar Associa­tion Sheikh Muhammad Yasin Pakistan Tax Bar As­­sociation General Secretary Tahir Mahmood Butt Lahore Tax Bar Association General Secretary Mian Asad Hanif, Pakistan Tax Bar Association Senior Vice President Faraz Fazal Sheikh, and Karachi Tax Bar Association President Muhammad Mahmood Bikiya.

LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has ruled that immigration authorities must record and communicate written reasons in every case where a passenger is offloaded from an international flight, holding that such action, though preventive, must comply with constitutional safeguards of due process.
Justice Raheel Kamran announced the judgment while deciding two identical petitions filed by Muhammad Soban and Ali Raza against the federal government.
The petitioners were off­loaded on Dec 24, 2025, from the Allama Iqbal Inter­national Airport, Lahore, while attempting to travel to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on valid visit visas. They contended that they possessed valid passports, return tickets, confirmed hotel bookings, and that no criminal case, blacklist order or placement on the Exit Control List (ECL) existed against them.

 

Through their counsel, they argued that the offloading was arbitrary, unlawful and violative of their fundamental rights protected under various articles of the Constitution.
On behalf of the federal government, an additional attorney general maintained that the petitioners were neither blacklisted nor permanently barred from travelling. However, he said, immigration authorities claimed that the passengers failed to satisfactorily explain the purpose of their visit. He said the passengers had insufficient funds and doubtful hotel bookings.
The law officer argued that the action was taken under the Emigration Ordi­nance, 1979 and Standing Order No.31/2005, which empower immigration offici­als to scrutinise travel documents and prevent unlawful emigration. He further contended that the petitioners’ own pleadings referred to travelling “to earn bread and butter,” suggesting possible intent to seek employment abroad under the guise of visit visas.

 

In his judgement, Justice Kamran held that while the state possesses statutory authority under the Emigration Ordinance to regulate and prevent unlawful emigration, such authority is not unfettered.
He observed that the right to travel abroad is a valuable civil right protected under Article 15 of the Constitution.
The judge said administrative discretion must meet standards of reasonableness, transparency and proportionality.
“Even preventive measures must comply with due process requirements under Article 10-A of the Constitution,” he ruled.
Justice Kamran noted that although immigration officers may legitimately examine financial capacity, documentation, and travel purpose, no written order stating reasons for offloading was furnished to the petitioners at the time of restraint.
The absence of recorded and communicated reasons, the judge held, undermines transparency, prevents meaningful legal challenge and opens the door to arbitrariness.
While upholding the authority of immigration officials to regulate emigration, the judge issued a prospective direction, requiring the officer concerned to record brief but specific reasons in writing and provide a copy to the offloaded passenger at the earliest opportunity.
The judge observed that the petitioners may travel in the future on valid visit visas, subject to lawful scrutiny and compliance with documentary and financial requirements.
The additional attorney general assured the court that the ministry of interior would consider establishing a structured administrative review mechanism for offloading decisions to reduce unnecessary constitutional litigation.

ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers said on Friday they were willing to negotiate after Pakistan unleashed air strikes on major Afghan cities, killing dozens in the most serious clashes between the allies-turned-foes, which Defence Minister Khawaja Asif described as an “open war”.
The Afghan Taliban, who claimed to have launched “retaliatory attacks” over strikes against terrorists’ hideouts last weekend, said on Friday that they were “ready for dialogue”.
“Afghanistan… has always preferred to reso­lve issues based on mutual understanding and respect,” the Afghan foreign ministry quoted Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi as telling Qatar’s junior Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khalifi by telephone.
Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid echoed that sentiment, saying “now also we want to resolve this matter through dialogue”.
Key regional powers are also quickly mobilising to prevent the conflict from spiralling.
Iran, which borders both nations, offered to mediate. “The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready to provide any assistance necessary to facilitate dialogue and to enhance understanding and cooperation between the two countries,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X.







Saudi Arabia and Qatar were also engaged in a diplomatic drive to halt the hostilities, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP.
“Saudi Arabia, in coordination with Qatar, is making efforts to reduce tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” the source said, adding the goal is to “de-escalate the situation and prevent it from spiralling out of control”.
Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, in a phone call with his Afghan counterpart Muttaqi, expressed concern over the recent situation.
Meanwhile, during a phone call with Paki­stan’s Ishaq Dar, the Saudi foreign minister agreed to stay closely engaged.







Similarly, Turkish Fore­ign Minister Hakan Fidan held separate calls with his counterparts from Paki­stan, Afghanistan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia to discuss the conflict, a Turkish diplomatic source said.
From Moscow to Beijing, international powers also issued urgent calls for de-escalation.
China, a neighbour and major investor in the region, expressed deep concern over the violence.
“China supports combating all forms of terrorism and calls on both parties to remain calm and exercise restraint, properly resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation, achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible, and avoid further loss of life,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.
She confirmed that China was mediating through its own channels and had requested both sides ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and projects.
Moscow urged an immediate halt to the attacks and a return to diplomacy. Russia, which is the only country to officially recognise the Taliban government and also maintains good relations with Pakistan, said the clashes were a dangerous development.
“We call on our friends Afghanistan and Pakistan to abandon this dangerous confrontation and return to the negotiating table to resolve all differences through political and diplomatic means,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov added that Moscow was “closely monitoring this situation.”
From Europe, Britain expressed grave concern. “We are deeply concerned by the significant escalation in tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan,” UK Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper said on X. “We urge both sides to take immediate steps toward de-escalation, avoid further harm to civilians, and re-engage in mediated dialogue.”







Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump, known for his enthusiasm in mediating conflicts and a strong desire for a Nobel Peace Prize, offered a stance that diverged from his usual eagerness to resolve disputes.
In Washington, Trump suggested he would not be willing to step in, highlighting his strong ties with Pakistan’s leadership. Spe­aking to reporters before heading to Texas, Trump was asked about Pakistan’s retaliation to unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban.
Asked whether someone had asked for him to intervene, Trump said, “Well, I would but I get along with Pakistan, as you know, very well. Very, very well.
“[They] have a great prime minister, a great general there … two of the people I really respect a lot,” he said.
“And I think that Pakistan is doing terrifically well,” he said.
The United Nations added its voice to the global chorus for peace. UN Secretary-General Ant­onio Guterres “is deeply concerned by the escalation of violence we’re seeing,” his spokesman Step­hane Dujarric said.
“He calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and he reiterates his call on the parties to resolve any differences through diplomacy.”
The International Comm­­ittee of the Red Cross also echoed calls to protect civilians. The organisation’s president has called for a de-escalation of hostilities between Afghanistan and Pakistan, AFP reports.
ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement that her organisation was “preparing an operational response to humanitarian needs on the ground”.

The development comes as the ordinance was set to lapse in early March.
The rules were suspended in the Senate to take up the bill, which was moved by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, for immediate consideration.
The preamble of the bill, a copy of which is available with Dawn, stated that it was expedient to establish a dedicated virtual assets regulatory authority to licence, regulate and supervise virtual assets and virtual asset service providers to “ensure investor protection, transparency and market integrity in Pakistan”.
It further stated that it was necessary to provide a comprehensive legal framework to empower the said authority to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing and other illicit activities involving virtual assets, in accordance with international standards.
Regulatory authority
The bill provides for the establishment of the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, envisioning it as an autonomous corporate body empowered to licence, regulate and supervise virtual asset service providers and issuers in the country.
Elaborating on the body’s functions, the legislation says it will “protect customers and investors and the integrity of Pakistan’s virtual asset markets by establishing and enforcing appropriate safeguards and conduct of business requirements, prudential and operational-resilience, risk-management standards, and measures to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit use of virtual assets”.
It shall also attract investment and encourage companies operating in the field of virtual assets to base their businesses in Pakistan.
Moreover, PVARA shall “promote responsible innovation, digital financial inclusion and the development of compliant virtual asset markets within a framework that manages risks and supports financial stability and market integrity”.
The body shall promote, develop, govern, and regulate the adoption, deployment, and scalable use of blockchain technology and distributed ledger technology across Pakistan, the bill further states.
The legislation also states that PVARA will coordinate with the Financial Monitoring Unit, National Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Authority and other relevant authorities, as well as law enforcement agencies, to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities associated with virtual assets, in accordance with the Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2010, other applicable laws and international standards.
The regulatory body will also advise the government on “regulatory, supervisory, technical or emerging-risk matters relating to virtual assets, digital asset markets, tokenisation, stablecoin structures, blockchain, distributed ledger technology, cyber-risks or any matter connected with its mandate”.
The bill also authorises PVARA to devise “regulations, standards, directives, guidelines, handbooks and circulars, or any other instrument”, consistent with the objectives of the legislation and other applicable laws.
It will also be authorised to set risk-management, cybersecurity, data protection and technical standards and “issue, vary, suspend or revoke licences, approvals or directives under this Act and prescribe conditions for such actions”.
The bill further states that it may prescribe licencing conditions, eligibility criteria, renewal requirements and any additional obligations for those issued licences under the yet to be formalised PVARA law.
It will also be authorised to conduct on-site inspections and off-site monitoring of licencees and other entities to ensure compliance with this PVARA law and other relevant rules and regulations.
Moreover, the bill states, the body may also ensure compliance with “data protection, data governance and cyber security obligations by virtual asset service providers subject to supervisory follow-up”.
It will also be empowered to impose administrative sanctions in accordance with the provisions of the PVARA law and “levy such fees, charges and penalties as may be prescribed by rules” devised under this law.
PVARA will also operate regulatory sandboxes in a “transparent and accountable manner” and “enter into cooperation or mutual assistance arrangements with domestic and foreign regulators and law enforcement agencies to facilitate information sharing and coordinated action, including mutual recognition of regulations and licences”, the bill states.
It further details that the body will comprise a chairperson — who will be appointed by the federal government — two secretaries, from the law and finance ministries each, State Bank of Pakistan’s governor, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan chairperson, National Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Authority chairman, Pakistan Digital Authority chairperson and two independent directors “with proven expertise and a strong track record possessing expertise relevant to virtual asset markets, digital technology and digital finance”.
The directors will also be appointed by the federal government.
“The members of the authority, other than ex-officio members, shall hold office for a term of three years and shall be eligible for one further term of three years,” the bill states.
Penalties
The bill states that “whoever, willfully, provides an unlicenced virtual asset service shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term up to five years, or with fine up to Rs50 million, or both”.
It adds that whoever conducts an initial virtual asset offering in contravention” of the rules and regulations established under the PVARA law shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term up to three years or with fine up to Rs25m or with both.
The bill also penalises market manipulation and insider trading.
It further states that “a virtual assets appellate tribunal shall be established and no court shall take cognisance of a legal dispute under this Act or the rules or regulations made thereunder to which the jurisdiction of the Virtual Assets Appellate Tribunal extends”.
The tribunal’s jurisdiction has been described as: “Any virtual asset service provider, licencee, or any other person aggrieved by an order of the PVARA may prefer an appeal before the Virtual Assets Appellate Tribunal within 30 days of the date on which the order was communicated.”
In July last year, the government had announced that President Asif Ali Zardari had approved the ‘Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025’ to establish an independent regulator for virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.
However, an official statement from the office of the state minister referred to it as the ‘Virtual Assets Act, 2025’, leading to confusion and concerns about why the draft law had not been moved to the National Assembly or Senate, as required for a bill to become an act of parliament.
The confusion was clarified later when the authorities confirmed to Dawn that the regulation was not an act of parliament but rather an ordinance, issued under Article 89 of the Constitution. The provision allows the president to issue an ordinance in urgent matters when both houses are not in session; such ordinances remain in effect for 120 days and do not require passage through the National Assembly and Senate.
In November last year, the Senate extended the Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025, for another 120 days.</p><small>2026-02-27 19:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/27223151625ed4c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976209/unmanned-aerial-vehicles-banned-countrywide-amid-escalating-tensions-with-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Unmanned aerial vehicles banned countrywide amid escalating tensions with Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: After Afghan Taliban forces used “rudimentary drones” to target various parts of the country, a ban has been imposed on flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of any kind across the country.
The development comes as several ‘drone attacks’ were reported from across part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Subsequently, during his press briefing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) chief Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry stated that Afghan forces attempted to use “rudimentary drones” to attack areas like Swabi and Abbottabad.
“However, the anti-drone system over there and the effective deployment took them out,” he said.
According to local reports, at least six people were injured in three drone attacks in Bannu, Swabi and Abbotabad.
In Bannu, a mosque in the Mirbaz Barkazai area was targeted by a quadcopter around Iftar, leaving five worshippers injured. The attack occurred in the evening, while people were inside the mosque breaking their fast.
The incident in Swabi, which occurred near a girls’ school, was one of the first reported incidents of a drone attack in the area. According to Assistant Superintendent of Police Muhammad (ASP) Numan, at least one schoolgirl was injured, while other children narrowly escaped.
The incident occurred in Pabbini, a village located in the mountainous region of Gadoon Amazai, when children were playing near the school. The school had closed early on account of Friday, and the injured girl, identified as Amna, had just stepped out when the drone struck.
ASP Numan said that the injured girl was taken to the hospital for treatment, while residents of the village gathered in large numbers at the site of the attack.
“It was a self-made drone that also contained explosives,” he told Dawn.
Meanwhile, in Abbotabad, no loss of life or property was reported when a drone flying over the cantonment area was brought down by forces around 1pm, the local DPO confirmed.
Ban on drone flying
In view of drones being used, ostensibly by Afghan Taliban forces, to stage attacks inside Pakistani territory, drone-flying has been banned across the country.
In a letter addressed to the chief secretaries of Punjab, Karachi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan as well as the Islamabad chief commissioner, the interior ministry said, “It has been decided to impose an immediate ban on outdoor flying of quadcopters/ UAVs with immediate effect and until further orders.”
It added: “In this regard, the provincial governments are requested to ensure strict enforcement of said ban.”
Subsequently, the administrations of Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Sindh and Balochistan notified a comprehensive ban on flying UAVs of any sort, for different periods of time.
Punjab had already banned the flying of drones and UAVs in its jurisdiction for 30 days, starting on Wednesday.
The Islamabad administration banned the use of drones, phantoms and camcopters in the federal capital for a period of two months under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which can be extended for another two months.
The ban applies to everyone, except law enforcement agencies and the Islamabad administration.
A spokesperson for Gilgit-Baltistan police told Dawn that flying drones had been banned in all districts with immediate effect, on the orders of the interior ministry.
The region witnessed demonstrations in favour of the Pakistan Army, and security checking was also heightened following the skirmishes between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Home and Tribal Affairs Department issued a notification banning the use of drones, quadcopters and UAVs for one month, classifying it as a “direct or indirect threat and … potential risk to the lives and properties of citizens as well as infrastructure of the government”.
In a separate notification, the additional chief secretary of Sindh also imposed a similar restriction on the use of helicams, drones, UAVs and quadcopters for two months.
The ban, however, would not apply to law enforcement or intelligence agencies and would be enforced by local police.
The Balochistan home department also imposed an immediate and complete ban on the use, possession, and operation of drones, UAVs, quadcopters, camcopters, and other remote-controlled aerial devices across the province.
According to an official notification, the decision was taken in view of security concerns, including the potential use of such devices for surveillance, espionage, transportation of prohibited items and explosives, spreading fear and panic, and disrupting law and order.
The measure was described as necessary to safeguard public safety and protect sensitive installations, public gatherings, key personalities, and official convoys.

Syed Irfan Raza and Iftikhar A. Khan in Islamabad, Jamil Nagri in Gilgit, Manzoor Ali in Peshawar, Rashid Javed in Abbottabad, Muqaddam Ali Khan in Swabi and Muhammad Waseem Khan in Bannu contributed to this report.

New Zealand would have joined England in the knockouts with a win in their final Super Eights match and they scored 159-6 after opting to bat.
England lost wickets early and looked like they would be squeezed out at 117-6, needing 43 from the last three overs.
But Ahmed and Jacks took 22 off the 18th over from Glenn Phillips to turn the match on its head.
Ahmed blasted 19 off seven balls in his first T20 World Cup match alongside Jacks, who made an unbeaten 32 off 18, to see England to 161-6 with three balls to spare.
England will move on to a semi-final in Mumbai on Thursday against either India or the West Indies, who clash on Sunday to decide the final semi-final berth.
New Zealand now have to wait on the outcome of Saturday’s clash between Sri Lanka and Pakistan in Kandy to know if they have qualified for a semi-final in Kolkata against South Africa.
Pakistan have an inferior run rate so they need to win by 64 runs or inside 13 overs to overtake the Kiwis and deny them a place in the final four. If Pakistan qualify, then the semi-final would be played in Colombo.







England used five spinners to bowl 16 of the 20 overs on a turning track.
The 2010 and 2022 champions had never bowled so many overs of spin before in a T20 international.
Jacks returned the best figures with 2-23, while Adil Rashid picked up 2-28 and is now England’s leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 11.
Rashid was complemented by fellow wrist spinner Ahmed, who was called up in place of Jamie Overton, and took a wicket with his first ball before finishing with 2-28 from three overs.
Glenn Phillips top scored with 39 off 28, including four fours and a six, while opener Tim Seifert scored 35.
Liam Dawson (1-32) and Jacob Bethell (0-13) were the other spinners employed by England.</p><small>2026-02-27 17:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653279-six-nation-conference-in-warsaw-applauds-pakistans-crackdown-on-illegal-migration' target='_blank'><strong>Six-nation conference in Warsaw applauds Pakistan's crackdown on illegal migration</strong></a><br><p>

“I want to make one thing clear: the oppressive Afghan Taliban regime has to make a clear choice. The choice is to choose between Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Baloch Liberation Army, Daesh, Al Qaeda, the terrorists and terrorist organisations and Pakistan,” he said while giving a briefing on security forces’ response to unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban on Thursday.
“They have to make this choice. It has been made clear by the government of Pakistan. It is not something new I am saying … They have to make this choice. Whether they choose terrorists and terrorism or Pakistan. We are clear … Let it be known that our choice is absolutely clear. It will always be Pakistan over everything,” he said.

 


“The Pakistan Army and the people of Pakistan have never hesitated in making any sacrifice for this choice and they never will,” he asserted.
At the outset of the briefing, the DG ISPR gave a breakdown of the security forces’ response.
“The Afghan Taliban regime, which is the master proxy of all these terrorist proxies operating from Afghanistan … that master proxy … came into action last night … along with the terrorists of Fitna al Khawarij,” he said.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term that the state used for banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The DG ISPR said that Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khawarij opened fire and carried out physical raids on 53 locations along the Pak-Afghan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“This aggression was done by this master proxy in coordination, in collusion and in support of a terrorist organisation. That’s what happened last night,” he said.
Talking about Pakistan’s response to the aggression, he said: “We were ready.”
He said that Pakistan’s armed forces responded “immediately and effectively”, adding that the attack was repulsed at all 53 locations.
“They came with armed quadcopters [and] big and small weapons. We shot down their quadcopters and silenced their weapons,” he said.
He added that not only were the attacks effectively repulsed, but Pakistan, exercising self-defence, responded and gave a “befitting reply”.
Giving details of Operation Ghazab lil-Haq — which was launched in response to the attacks by Afghan Taliban — he said so far 274 Taliban regime personnel and khawarij had been killed and more than 400 were injured.
“Seventy-three posts of the Afghan Taliban along the Pak-Afghan border have been totally destroyed. Eighteen posts have been captured,” he said.
As per conservative estimates, 115 tanks, armoured vehicles, and artillery pieces of the Afghan Taliban forces had been destroyed, he said.
He further said that the headquarters and military installations — which were providing support to terrorist organisations and helped them plan — were targeted and hit.
In these airstrikes, 22 locations in Kabul, Kandahar, Paktia, Nangarhar, Khost, and Paktika were targeted, he said.
“All these targets were very carefully selected based on intelligence. They are military targets, and great care was exercised so that there is no civilian collateral damage,” he asserted.
He said that these targets included corps headquarters, brigade headquarters, battalion headquarters, sector headquarters, ammunition depots, logistics bases, and places providing shelter to terrorists and their supporters.
He further said that at several places, the “cowardly Afghan Taliban forces and the khawarij with them” not only fled but also abandoned the dead bodies of their accomplices, which had been “secured” in accordance with the Geneva protocols.
He said that 12 Pakistan Army soldiers had been martyred, while 27 were injured and one soldier was missing in action. He then played several video clips of the action undertaken against the Afghan Taliban.
He further stated that Afghan media and their proxies were floating lies on social media regarding the targeting of civilians.
“At no place was any civilian infrastructure targeted. These are all military targets. These are all the infrastructure from where Pakistan was attacked,” he asserted.

 


He also played a clip showing Pakistan Army soldiers taking down the Afghan flag and hoisting Pakistan’s flag at a checkpost along the Pak-Afghan border.
“The nation is proud of these soldiers who have rendered their lives, their sweat and their blood for the protection of the land and the honour of the people of Pakistan,” he said.
“Whether on ground or in the air, the armed forces of Pakistan gave an effective, immediate and brutal response; a well-deserved response to the terrorists and their facilitators,” he said.
He went on to say that the Afghan Taliban were threatening that they would respond to Pakistan.
“We saw that they also tried to use some rudimentary sort of drones for attacking Abbottabad and Nowshera. However, the anti-drone system over there and the effective deployment took them out,” he said.

 


He added that this “again showed” how Afghan Taliban had become a “master proxy”.
“It is difficult to distinguish where the Taliban regime ends and where the terrorism starts. The lines have blurred. Therefore, it is necessary to make it clear that if anyone tries to carry out any terrorist activity in Pakistan … its response will be given to terrorists, their guardians, and those who protect them. No place will be safe for them as we also have equal rights,” he said.
During the question-answer portion, the DG ISPR was asked about credible information pointing to India’s involvement in the recent attack.
“It is absolutely clear that Indian sponsorship, abettment and design are behind any terrorist incident in Pakistan. The base of the operation is… they use the area that is under the oppressive regime of the Afghan Taliban. So that is how they work.”
He further said: “Pakistan armed forces … are always vigilant.”
In response to another question, the DG ISPR said that the Afghan Taliban regime had signed the Doha accord and had made certain promises “while presenting a different face to the world”.
“They made promises in writing. They promised an inclusive government. Is there an inclusive government there? That women’s rights will be respected. Are women’s rights being respected there? Do they get equal opportunity?”
He said that the Afghan Taliban had also vowed that its territory would not be used for terrorism.
He said that while “clarity” regarding the Afghan Taliban did not exist before, it did now.
“We now have supreme clarity. Your civil leadership, your military leadership, your intelligentsia, your media, the children of this country; there is absolute clarity about what the Afghan Taliban regime is,” he said.
He said that the whole world was also saying the same.
“We are the bulwark state which is standing against this terrorism. It is not only Pakistan; the threat is to the whole region. Not to the whole region [but] to the whole world,” he said.
The DG ISPR said that “everyone understands” that the actions taken by Pakistan last night were in self-defence and for the safety of the people.
“Everyone understands that,” he said. He recalled clashes with Afghanistan in October last year, saying friendly countries had understood Pakistan’s stance at that time.
He further stated that the whole nation was united in the war against terrorism.
“Let there be no doubt — whatever political divisions we may have, whatever different political perspectives we may have; all political parties, all political leaderships are absolutely clear that no place can be given to terrorism and its facilitation in Pakistan,” he said.
He recalled the National Action Plan of 2014, saying that political parties were behind it.
“Since then, all political parties … have always respected, followed, and said yes to this revised NAP, which is now called vision Azm-i-Istehkam,” he said.
He also talked about Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, paying tribute to the province’s police force.
“Is there anyone who denies their sacrifices and martyrdom. [Is there anyone who] … is not standing with them. No one. The whole nation is together,” he said.
“I must take this opportunity to give our biggest homage to the very brave and proud police of KP, which are on the frontline,” he said, adding: “We are proud of them. The nation salutes them.”
In response to another question, the DG ISPR said that the number of Afghan Taliban operatives and terrorists killed was 274 as of now, but was “much higher”.
“I have said it earlier, that the distinction between the master proxy and terrorists … it has blurred,” he said, adding that they were acting “more or less” the same.
He further said that the operation against the Taliban regime was ongoing.
“The operation is continuing. It is under the instructions of the prime minister of Pakistan, the civil leadership. And we are achieving the desired results,” he said.
He reiterated that the Afghan Taliban regime “has to make a choice”.
“They have to choose between Pakistan, and the terrorists and terrorism. Our choice is absolutely clear.

The statement came in the aftermath of Pakistan launching Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban after “unprovoked firing” from across the border overnight.
In its statement, the FO said that Pakistan’s actions came in response to “repeated terrorist attacks by Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan against Pakistan emanating from Afghan soil, as well as the latest unwarranted and provocative actions by the Taliban regime”.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Fitna al Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.







It said that the armed forces carried out “precise operations, inflicting heavy losses on terrorist outfits and targeting their logistical support bases in Afghanistan” on the night of February 26.
The statement maintained that the actions taken by Pakistan were “in exercise of its right to self-defence and to ensure the safety and security of its citizens, as well as that of the wider region and beyond”.
It warned the Afghan Taliban regime and terrorist groups against “any further provocations” in attempts to “undermine the security and welfare of the people of Pakistan”, stating that they will be met with “a measured, decisive and befitting response”.
The FO reiterated Pakistan’s desire for “peace and stability” in the region, adding that the country had “remained patiently engaged in political and diplomatic efforts aimed at addressing the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil”.
“However, it is unfortunate that Pakistan’s numerous goodwill gestures and highly responsible approach were misconstrued, resulting in increased terrorist attacks from Afghan soil, with the active support and backing of the Taliban regime, as well as India,” the statement read.
The FO reaffirmed Pakistan’s “strong resolve and determination” towards eliminating terrorism emanating from the Afghan soil.
It also called upon the “Afghan regime to end the impunity with which Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan continue to operate from Afghan soil”.
It expressed the faith that the international community will “play its role in sending a clear message to the Taliban regime that it must not continue to renege on its obligation to take concrete and verifiable action against these terrorist outfits and end its support for them”.
The statement reiterated that Pakistan held the right to “take all appropriate actions in its self-defence and to protect its citizens in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter”.</p><small>2026-02-27 14:56</small></div><hr>
