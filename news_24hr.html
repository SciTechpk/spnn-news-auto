He made these remarks during a press briefing on Saturday, during which he was asked whether India had raised any concerns about the “stronger relationship” between the US and Pakistan.
“They really haven’t — I mean, we know they’re concerned for obvious reasons because of the tensions that have existed between Pakistan and India historically.  But, I think they have to understand, we have to have relations with a lot of different countries,” he said, according to a transcript of the briefing on the State Department’s website.
He continued, “We see an opportunity to expand our strategic relationship with Pakistan, and I think we’ve made — that’s our job, is to try to figure out how many countries we can find how we can work with on things of common interest.
“So, I think the Indians are very mature when it comes to diplomacy and things of that nature.  Look, they have some relationships with countries that we don’t have relationships with.  So, it’s part of a mature, pragmatic foreign policy.  I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India, which is deep, historic, and important.”
Rubio was also asked whether the recent improvement in ties between the US and Pakistan was based on Islamabad’s “recognition of the US role and President [Donald Trump’s] role in resolving and in avoiding potential war between India and Pakistan?”
“What do you think was the turning point?” a reporter asked him, according to the transcript on the State Department’s website.
To that, Rubio began his response with, “I think they appreciated.”
He then went on to say that “anytime you work with someone, you get to know them and you interact with them, and so I do think there was some sense of happiness about it.  But even before that conflict had started, I had already reached out to them and said look, we are interested in rebuilding an alliance, a strategic partnership with you.  We think there are things we can work together with them on”.
The secretary of state reiterated that the US was “fully aware of the challenges with regards to India and everything else, but our job is to try to create opportunities for partnerships with countries where it’s possible.  And we’ve had a long history of partnering with Pakistan on counterterror and things of that nature.  We’d like to expand it beyond that, if possible, understanding that there’ll be some difficulties and some challenges”.
“But I think it’s a very encouraging thing that that relationship has strengthened the way that it has, and I don’t think it comes at the expense, or instead of a good relationship with India, or anybody else for that matter,” he added.
Earlier this month, a Dawn report highlighted that Pakistan was entering a new phase in its economic and strategic partnership with the US, as the two allies move closer to implementing a deal for the export of rare earth minerals.
The improvement in ties and newfound partnership between the two sides was particularly seen after Pakistan acknowledged US President Donald Trump’s role in resolving a four-day escalation between nuclear powers Islamabad and New Delhi.
Following the development, Pakistan’s chief of army staff, Field Marshal Asim Munir, had gone to Washington on a five-day official visit in June. During the visit, he had met with President Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
During a subsequent visit to the US in August, Field Marshal Munir had termed his second trip to the US in a span of just a month and a half a “new dimension” in ties between Washington and Islamabad.
In September, he accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in August, during which regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism, among other matters, were discussed.
Meanwhile, Trump has thanked both PM Shehbaz and “my favourite” Field Marshal Munir for their efforts in securing the ceasefire deal in Gaza.
Earlier today, he called PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir “great people” while stating that he would get the recent conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan “solved very quickly”.
Separately, American metals company US Strategic Metals (USSM) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Pakistan in September to invest rou­ghly $500 million to establish mineral processing and development facilities in the country. It rece­ntly dispatched its first consignment of mineral samples to the US to advance the deal.
The sample shipment, prepared locally in collaboration with the Frontier Works Organisation, includes antimony, copper concentrate, and rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium.
In a statement, USSM described the delivery as “a milestone in the Pakistan–US strategic partnership,” noting that the MoU “establishes a roadmap for cooperation across the entire mineral value chain — from exploration and processing to the establishment of refineries inside Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-10-26 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26171453453b1cf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951365/security-forces-kill-25-terrorists-in-two-separate-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 25 terrorists in two separate KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces foiled two major terrorist infiltration attempts from Afghanistan on 24-25 October 2025, killing 25 militants, including four suicide bombers, and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives in separate operations in North Waziristan and Kurram districts, the military’s media wing said on Sunday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), on 24-25 October 2025, security forces detected movements of two large groups of khwarij attempting to infiltrate Pakistan from Afghanistan near Ghaki in Kurram District and Spinwam in North Waziristan District.
“Own troops effectively engaged these groups of khwarij [and] as a result of precise and skilful engagements, fifteen khwarij, including four suicide bombers belonging to [the] Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in Spinwam, North Waziristan District,” the statement said.
It added that another ten infiltrating khwarij were killed in Ghaki, Kurram District, and a large cache of weapons, ammunition, and explosives was recovered from the slain militants.
Fitna al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement added that despite successfully thwarting the infiltration attempt, five soldiers sacrificed their lives during the intense firefights.
The fallen included Havildar Manzoor Hussain (35, District Ghizar), Sepoy Nauman Ilyas Kiyani (23, District Poonch), Sepoy Muhammad Adil (24, District Kasur), Sepoy Shah Jehan (25, District Vehari), and Sepoy Ali Asghar (25, District Pak Pattan), who embraced martyrdom while fighting gallantly.
“It is significant to point out that these infiltration attempts by Fitna al Khwarij are being carried out at a time when delegations of Pakistan and Afghanistan are engaged in talks in Türkiye; casting doubts on the intentions of the Interim Afghan Government with regards to addressing the issue of terrorism emanating from its soil,” the statement said.
It added that Pakistan had consistently been asking the Interim Afghan Government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border and is expected to fulfil its obligations of the Doha Agreement and deny the use of Afghan soil by Khwarij against Pakistan.
“The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” it said.
Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country, it said.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned TTP’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Last week, security forces neutralised 34 “India-ba­cked” terrorists during multiple operations across KP.</p><small>2025-10-26 12:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630593-25-terrorists-killed-in-cross-border-infiltration-bids-amid-pak-afghan-talks' target='_blank'><strong>25 terrorists killed in cross-border infiltration bids amid Pak-Afghan talks</strong></a><br><p>

The meetings underlined Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen ties with both the United Kingdom and the United States.
Relations with the UK have been revitalised through the resumption of flight operations after a five-year gap and initiatives like the newly inaugurated Centre of Excellence in Islamabad, a joint project enhancing Pakistan’s capacity to tackle transnational crime and streamline mutual legal assistance and extradition processes. At the same time, engagement with the US reflects growing collaboration on security and counterterrorism.
According to a post on the Interior Ministry’s X account, during the discussions, both sides emphasised enhancing cooperation in counter-narcotics, human trafficking, and security.
“Naqvi expressed gratitude to the British government and High Commissioner Marriott for resuming flight operations to the UK after a five-year hiatus,” the post said.
 






The Pakistan International Airlines operated its inaugural flight from Islamabad to Manchester on Saturday. The national flag carrier launched its flights to the United Kingdom after receiving the Third Country Operator (TCO) approval for flight operations. In the second phase, the flight operation will be extended to Birmingham and London.
Both envoys also lauded the Pakistan Navy’s recent anti-narcotics operation.
On October 23, Pakistan Navy ship Yarmook seized narcotics worth more than $972 million from sailboats in the Arabian Sea. According to the Com­bined Maritime Force (CMF) — a naval partnership that includes the US Navy — the Pakistani naval vessel intercepted two different ‘dhow’ sailing boats within 48 hours last week.
Marriott briefed the minister on the upcoming visit of the Director General of the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) next month. “During the visit, memorandums of understanding will be signed in the fields of immigration and counter-narcotics,” the post said.
Minister Naqvi highlighted projects like the Centre of Excellence, supported by the British High Commission, as crucial for enhancing the capacity of Pakistani institutions. “The initiative will further strengthen cooperation between Pakistan and the UK on mutual legal assistance and extradition matters,” the statement quoted him as saying.
The British High Commissioner reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to its ties with Pakistan, while Naqvi reiterated Pakistan’s determination to work with the international community to eliminate terrorism.
Meanwhile, Chargé d’Affaires Baker described Pakistan’s efforts against terrorism and extremism as commendable and pledged continued cooperation in security and counterterrorism.
In August, Acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism Gregory LoGerfo and Baker participated in the US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue, advancing their shared resolve to combat the global threat.
According to a statement from the Foreign Office, the dialogue was co-chaired by Special Secretary (UN) Ambassador Nabeel Munir and LoGerfo, adding that the two delegations underscored the critical importance of developing effective approaches to terrorist threats, including those posed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p><small>2025-10-26 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26150104e68c1c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951357/mother-of-slain-journalist-arshad-sharif-passes-away' target='_blank'><strong>Mother of slain journalist Arshad Sharif passes away</strong></a><br><p>Riffat Ara Alvi, the mother of slain journalist Arshad Sharif, passed away on Sunday, according to her family.
Arshad, a prominent journalist who was awarded the Pride of Performance in 2023 by then-President Arif Alvi, was shot dead in Kenya on October 24, 2022. Politicians and media bodies demanded a probe into his death, but the lack of progress in the investigation has been decried by the Supreme Court and media.
“Arshad Sharif’s mother, who was demanding justice for her son, has passed away,” the deceased journalist’s wife, Javeria Siddique, posted on X today.
 






In a subsequent post, she said Alvi’s funeral prayers would be held today at the “H-11 graveyard [in] Islamabad at 9pm”.
 






Siddique, herself a journalist, in 2023 published a piece for Dawn.com on her husband’s death in which she called for an “independent, impartial, and immediate investigation” to ensure justice for Sharif.
“Everyone is watching, and yet, justice only seems to become more and more elusive,” she said in the article.
Condolences pour in
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed grief over the passing of Alvi.
“I am saddened by the passing of Arshad Sharif’s mother and pray for the forgiveness of the deceased,” a post on PPP Media Cell’s X account quoted Bilawal as saying.
 






Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari rued that Alvi “kept asking for justice till the very end but to no avail”.
“Cruel apathy of the judiciary,” she commented in a post on X.

Lahore has ranked as the world’s most polluted city for the past three days, with air quality plummeting to hazardous levels as smog blanketed the city and the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) hitting 412, prompting health warnings and a province-wide crackdown on pollution sources.
The Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a high alert across the eastern districts of the province, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Nankana Sahib, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Khanpur. According to Director General PDMA Irfan Ali Kathia, the intensity of smog is expected to increase from November to mid-December, citing forecasts from the Meteorological Department.
The announcement was made by Punjab Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat on his X account, in light of the current smog situation.
“Winter school timing — 8:45am to 1:30pm”, the minister announced.
 






Separately, commenting on the smog situation, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said during a media briefing that the province now had a comprehensive digital and AI-based forecasting system in place.
She said it had been developed using data from previous years, adding that it was accessible to the public through the air quality portal and was released a day in advance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Reflecting on opinions regarding the smog situation, she said, “First of all, all those who have suddenly become environmental experts these days and issue reports or make statements as they please, I want to clarify that smog is a seasonal phenomenon.”
She said the seasons last for only three months, when the easterly corridor from east to west causes temperature inversions and cold air forms a lid over the atmosphere.
“Within that lid, particulate pollutants become trapped because the air above is cold. That lid, together with atmospheric pressure, creates a haze that we call smog,” she explained.
Marriyum emphasised that the people of Lahore and Punjab must realise that “it cannot be that yesterday the AQI was 160 and today, because of local pollutants, it has suddenly jumped to 380.”
She explained that it is common for pollution levels to rise early in the morning due to colder temperatures, but as the day warms and upper-air conditions shift, the air becomes denser and “particulate matter starts to disperse.”
The minister said that smog guns were being used only as an artificial and temporary measure.
“Previously, smog was managed during the season by shutting schools, restaurants and imposing lockdown-style restrictions. But for the first time, we are not only managing smog in the season without resorting to closures; we are also improving Lahore’s Air Quality Index,” she added.
Marriyum said the government’s work extended beyond the smog season. “We are not only active during these three months,” she said, “but carrying out smog mitigation efforts throughout the year.”</p><small>2025-10-26 10:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26140120e4ca667.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951352/trump-says-will-get-pak-afghan-conflict-solved-very-quickly' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says will get Pak-Afghan conflict ‘solved very quickly’</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he would get the conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan “solved very quickly”, calling Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and COAS Field Marshal Asim Munir “great people”.
Tensions between Islamabad and Kabul flared up earlier this month over accusations of terrorism, as border clashes killed 23 Pakistani troops as well as 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists after an attack by Kabul, which it claimed was retaliation for Islamabad conducting air strikes in its territory. A first round of talks in Doha last weekend led to a ceasefire agreement, with both governments seeking to firm up the agreement in more talks yesterday.
Trump, who was previously involved in brokering a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in May of this year as well as a peace deal between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas, arrived today in Malaysia to attend a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Kuala Lumpur, while also co-signing a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia.
Addressing the border dispute on the sidelines of an Asean summit today, Trump referred to it as “one of eight wars that my administration has ended in just eight months”.
“We’re averaging one a month. There’s only one left,” he said. “Although I heard that Pakistan and Afghanistan have started up, but I’ll get that solved very quickly.”

He added, “I know them both … the Pakistan field marshal and the prime minister are great people, and I know we’re gonna get that done quickly. That one started up a few days ago.”
Referring to his own role in halting wars around the world, the US president said, “I just feel it’s something I can do. I do it nicely.
“I don’t need to do it, I guess,” he added. “But if I can take time and save millions of lives, that’s really a great thing. I can’t think of anything better to do.”
Trump had previously thanked both Shehbaz and “my favourite” Munir for their efforts in securing the ceasefire deal in Gaza, while Shehbaz praised Trump’s “exemplary [and] visionary leadership” and reconfirmed Pakistan’s plan to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize 2026.
When the fighting broke out between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the US president was quick to express interest in assisting with establishing peace, although he was at the time occupied with overseeing a hostage exchange between Hamas and Israel.
“I said, ‘I’ll have to wait till I get back. I am doing another one,’” he told reporters at the time. “Because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace, and it is an honour to do it.”</p><small>2025-10-26 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/261258009ec5485.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951349/trump-co-signs-thailand-cambodia-ceasefire-agreement' target='_blank'><strong>Trump co-signs Thailand-Cambodia ceasefire agreement</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump co-signed a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia in Malaysia during the first stop on his Asia tour, which is expected to culminate in talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
The ceasefire, following a bloody border dispute, was signed by Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, as well as Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
The agreement will see the release of 18 Cambodian prisoners of war, a statement from Cambodia’s foreign ministry said.
 


Clashes between Thailand and Cambodia erupted in July, killing more than 40 people and forcing around 300,000 to flee their homes.
While the neighbours agreed an initial ceasefire in late July, they have since traded accusations of violations.
In their joint declaration witnessed by Trump, Anutin and Hun Manet reiterated their “firm commitment to refrain from the threat or use of force”.
“We reaffirm the unwavering commitment to peace and security between our two countries,” reads the deal, signed by both, who shared a strong handshake.
Trump congratulated the premiers.
“This is a momentous day for all of the people of Southeast Asia, as we sign a historic agreement to end the military conflict between Cambodia and Thailand,” he said.
The US president added that he had also struck “a major trade deal with Cambodia and a very important critical minerals agreement with Thailand”.
A final comprehensive peace pact between the Southeast Asian neighbours remains outstanding, analysts have said.
Malaysia’s Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan, who has been closely involved in the talks on behalf of Asean, has said the latest agreement centred around establishing regional observers in the conflict areas.
“We want there to be no more ceasefire violations because after July 28, although the ceasefire was in place, there were… minor violations,” Mohamad said.
“Both countries must withdraw their respective heavy weapons from the relevant areas, and secondly, both countries must make efforts to demine or remove and destroy the mines that have been planted in borders of both countries,” he added.</p><small>2025-10-26 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26150232c5f9bb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951355/sindh-records-439-dengue-cases-in-october-karachi-tops-with-188-health-dept' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh records 439 dengue cases in October, Karachi tops with 188: health dept</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Health Department has released its latest report on confirmed dengue cases across the province, revealing that 439 new cases have been reported so far in October, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in 2025 to 1,083.
Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, remains a recurring health concern in Sindh — particularly during the monsoon season when stagnant water and poor sanitation accelerate its spread. The illness causes high fever and, in severe cases, can lead to life-threatening complications.
While the provincial health department puts the total number of dengue cases in Sindh this year at 1,083, figures from Oct 1 to 16 obtained from three major Karachi hospitals and a public sector laboratory with branches in Hyderabad suggested an outbreak-like situation, with the actual number exceeding 12,000 in just six weeks.
A statement issued by the Health Department, quoting Sindh Minister for Health and Population Welfare Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, said, “Karachi Division remains the most affected, with 188 cases reported this month, followed by Hyderabad Division with 154, Mirpurkhas with 83, Sukkur with 10, Shaheed Benazirabad with three, and Larkana Division with one case.”
Dr Pechuho clarified that the Health Department maintained complete records of all confirmed dengue cases received from government hospitals. “If a patient undergoes testing at a private laboratory, that report is not included in our official data,” she said, emphasising that the figures released by the department were verified and authentic.
She urged the public “not to believe unverified information or rumours circulating on social media,” adding that data of all patients admitted to hospitals or treated in outpatient departments (OPDs) is properly maintained by the department.
Dr Pechuho said the Sindh government was working seriously to curb dengue across the province.
“Anti-dengue measures, including fumigation, spraying, and drainage improvement, have been intensified in all districts,” the statement quoted her as saying. “Deputy commissioners and district health officers have been instructed to ensure that no stagnant water remains, as it serves as a breeding ground for mosquitoes.”
She added that equal attention is being given to both urban and rural areas, and separate dengue units have been established in all government hospitals where free treatment and testing facilities are being provided.
Grim situation in Karachi, Hyderabad
Last week, figures collected from three hospitals in Karachi — Indus Hospital (IH), Liaquat National Hospital (LNH) and the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital and Research Centre (SIDHRC) — showed that a total of 2,972 cases of dengue have been reported from Sept 1 to Oct 16. The fourth hospital — the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre — alone recorded 1,062 dengue cases from July to date.
The situation was no different at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) as sources confirmed a high number of dengue cases, comparatively larger than last year’s, and a few deaths.
Hyderabad was also facing an alarming situation as the figures obtained from the Diagnostic and Research Laboratory (DRL) of the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS), Jamshoro, and its branches showed 9,075 dengue confirmed cases from Sept 1 to Oct 14.
Questions raised over credibility of govt data
PMA-Sindh President Dr Bashir Ahmed Khaskheli had described the situation as “far more serious than what’s depicted by official data and said that official figures did not represent the ground reality.”
“There is no official mechanism in place to get feedback from private clinics operating in every nook and corner of a locality, as well as private hospitals, quacks and even hakeems. Many people constrained by their financial resources don’t even opt for laboratory tests,” he told Dawn.
Dr Faisal Mahmood, professor of infectious diseases and associate chief medical officer at the AKUH, also confirmed the surge in dengue cases, emphasising that the end of October was classically the season when most dengue cases were seen.
“It is important to note that dengue rates do vary from year to year, and this cyclic pattern of dengue peaks is something we have seen over the last decade or so. There are several reasons for this, including weather patterns and changes in the strains. What is driving this year is hard to say, though I would think the [rains] floods have played a part,“ he said.
Ineffective fumigation
Health experts have attributed the surge in dengue cases to a lack of fumigation and timely drainage of water accumulated after the heavy spells of monsoon rains.
“If rainwater remains accumulated, it has the potential to become a breeding ground for vectors,” Dr Mirza Ali Azhar of the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) told Dawn.
“Entire rainwater doesn’t go into drains, and in many areas, water stands in the shape of ponds, only to serve as a home for mosquitoes,” he said.
Dr Khaskheli, the incumbent PMA-Sindh president, regretted that the high number of cases due to mosquito-borne illnesses could be easily prevented through effective vector control measures.
“It all has to do with the poor sewerage and drainage system. One could see pools of standing rainwater or sewage and heaps of garbage everywhere, providing breeding grounds of all kinds of germs and insects,” he said, pointing out that there were few government fumigation campaigns to effectively address the menace of vector-borne diseases.</p><small>2025-10-26 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26151647511f2ab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951358/brooks-defiant-ton-in-vain-as-new-zealand-beat-england-by-four-wickets-in-first-odi' target='_blank'><strong>Brook’s defiant ton in vain as New Zealand beat England by four wickets in first ODI</strong></a><br><p>New Zealand overcame a blitz from centurion Harry Brook to beat England by four wickets on Sunday in the opening game of their three-match one-day international series, with Daryl Mitchell and Michael Bracewell scoring half-centuries.
The hosts wobbled chasing 224, losing four quick wickets, including former captain Kane Williamson for a first-ball duck in his first match for the side since March, but Mitchell took them home with an unbeaten 78 after being dropped on 33.
Bracewell also earned a reprieve early on and ran himself out for 51 to open the door for England after the initial burst from Brydon Carse (3-45), but New Zealand got back on track thanks to Mitch Santner’s 27 and prevailed in 36.4 overs.
 






“There was still a lot in the wicket,” skipper Santner said.
“We lost a couple more than we would have liked in the chase but the intent was great … Daryl and Michael’s partnership was massive for us.”
England recovered from a disastrous start as captain Brook bludgeoned 135 from 101 balls and Jamie Overton made 46 to help their side finish on 223 all out in 35.2 overs for a fighting chance in the contest.
Asked to bat first at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui, England were rocked early by New Zealand’s seamers as Zak Foulkes (4-41) and Matt Henry (2-53) reduced the tourists to 56-6 within 12 devastating overs in helpful conditions.
‘Great start’
“Yeah it was tough work in the end, but I think the way we started off, with wickets in the powerplay, it’s always a great start,” Santner said.
“We know Matt can do that and then Zak was outstanding, the way he swung it.
It looks like a nightmare facing him. Obviously long spells, but we knew wickets were massive because even when they’re four or five down they’ve got (batsmen).
“Getting Brook earlier would have been nice but he was outstanding today.”
Brook went into attack mode despite the carnage around him and brought up his fifty in 36 balls with a top-edged six off Nathan Smith, before Overton took his team’s total to three figures with another big hit off Jacob Duffy (3-55).
Overton shrugged off being hit on the helmet by Smith and closed in on his own half-century, but departed four runs short after a fine catch on the second attempt by Mitchell that ended the 87-run seventh-wicket partnership.
Consecutive sixes
Duffy removed Carse with the very next ball to leave England teetering again on 143-8, but Brook took control following Adil Rashid’s fall shortly afterwards, reaching his ton with three consecutive sixes and taking his side past 200 runs.
A belligerent Brook continued to deal in big shots, swelling his tally of sixes to 11, but was snared trying to sweep Santner out of the park as New Zealand stopped the bleeding to stay on top in the series opener.
“I felt I was in good touch,” man of the match Brook said.
“Obviously we didn’t get off to a great start and I tried to take it up on myself to have a counter-punch. Thankfully it came off today.
“I’ve done it a few times actually, it’s a do-or-die moment. I managed to get us a decent score to defend. We started nicely with the ball, but we just struggled to take wickets throughout the middle.”
The second game takes place in Hamilton on Wednesday, with New Zealand seeking another victory after losing the preceding rain-hit Twenty20 series between the teams 1-0.</p><small>2025-10-26 10:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26131737894db64.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951351/three-armed-men-killed-in-quetta-encounter-identified-as-kidnappers-say-police' target='_blank'><strong>Three armed men killed in Quetta encounter identified as ‘kidnappers’, say police</strong></a><br><p>Three armed men shot dead in a police encounter on the outskirts of Quetta were identified as members of a kidnapping gang, police said on Sunday, adding that weapons and a vehicle used in the abductions were recovered from the scene.
The incident occurred on Saturday in Quetta’s Killi Khali area, within the jurisdiction of the Brewery Police Station, where the suspects were killed during a shootout with police.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Serious Crimes Investigation Wing, Imran Qureshi, told Dawn.com that after identifying the men killed in yesterday’s encounter, an investigation was launched, which revealed that all three were involved in kidnappings.
“Two accomplices of the kidnappers managed to escape during the exchange of fire, while a police constable sustained injuries,” SSP Qureshi said.
“Two of the slain suspects were identified as Nawab Ali and Ahmed Sultan, while efforts are underway with the help of NADRA (National Database and Registration Authority) to find out the identity of the third suspect.”
According to the SSP, Police records and investigations showed that the suspects killed were wanted in several abduction cases by Quetta police and were part of a ransom-for-kidnapping gang.
Qureshi said the group had kidnapped Abdul Razzaq, the driver of the Gwadar University vice chancellor, releasing him after receiving Rs1.6 million in ransom. He added that Bashir Ahmed, a trader from Qila Abdullah, was freed after paying Rs8m, while Quetta resident Irfan Baig was released following a Rs10m ransom payment.
“The slain suspects were wanted in two cases registered at the Sadar Police Station, three at Jinnah Town Police Station, and one at Industrial Police Station.
“The Serious Crimes Investigation Wing is conducting further investigations into the case,” the SSP added.
Kidnapping for ransom in Balochistan remains a serious security challenge amid the broader insurgency and weak law-enforcement reach. In January, seven people, including an 11-year-old, were kidnapped from a picnic spot in the province, with Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti confirming that the victims were believed to have been taken for ransom and that efforts were underway to recover them.
In July, another incident occurred in the Sardhaka area, where passengers were abducted, prompting a large-scale rescue operation by provincial authorities.</p><small>2025-10-26 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630573-president-zardari-pm-shehbaz-discuss-ajk-govt-formation' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari, PM Shehbaz 'discuss AJK govt formation'</strong></a><br><p>

A political phoenix, Netanyahu is the country’s longest-serving prime minister, has been its dominant political figure for decades and heads one of the most right-wing coalitions in Israel’s history.
But he does not hold an absolute parliamentary majority after an ultra-Orthodox party quit in July, protesting against the government’s failure to pass a law to exempt its community from military service.
The summer parliamentary recess came at just the right time to shield the government, which now holds just 60 of 120 seats, from motions of no confidence.
But the resumption of the Knesset’s work on October 20 heralded the return of transactional politics and potential threats for the government.
Under pressure from US President Donald Trump, Netanyahu agreed to a ceasefire with Hamas that came into effect on October 10 after more than two years of Israeli assault on Gaza.
His far-right allies vehemently denounced the agreement, arguing that the military should retain control of the entire Gaza Strip and crush the Palestinian movement for good.
And while they are not abandoning the ship of government, they are raising the price to keep them on board.
June 2026 election?
“The coalition has been weakened by the ceasefire agreement,” said independent analyst Michael Horowitz. “For Netanyahu, the issue is no longer so much about preserving his coalition until the end as it is about positioning himself to win the next elections — even if they are brought forward,” he told AFP.
In a televised interview on October 18, Netanyahu said that he would run for office in the next elections and that he expected to win.
Those polls are required to take place by late October 2026, but Netanyahu, who has just turned 76, may call early elections or be forced into a fresh vote if another of his allied parties abandons the ruling coalition.
Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir has already threatened to stop voting with the coalition if his bill calling for “the death penalty for terrorists” is not put to a parliamentary vote by November 9.
Netanyahu must grapple with ideological differences from his far-right partners, who favour resuming the war on Gaza with a view to taking over the territory, from which Israel unilaterally withdrew in 2005.
He must also contend with pressure from his allies in the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Shas party, which has 11 lawmakers and has distanced itself from the government.
Without formally leaving the coalition, Shas ministers resigned from the cabinet in July over the issue of military service exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jews.
The coalition’s other ultra-Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism, quit both the government and the coalition.
Several Israeli journalists, including the high-profile Amit Segal, who is known to be close to Netanyahu, have suggested the premier would opt for June 2026 for early elections.
For now, Netanyahu must overcome several obstacles to remain in power, most notably the issue of conscription for ultra-Orthodox Jews.
Shas says it will pull its support unless military service exemption is enshrined in law, while the far-right and many in Netanyahu’s Likud party want to force ultra-Orthodox conscription.
Likud in front
If the fragile ceasefire holds, Netanyahu will also have to find post-war solutions for Gaza that will satisfy his far-right partners.
They are demanding a vote on at least partial annexation of the occupied West Bank in return for what they see as the relinquishing of Gaza.
The Trump administration has repeatedly expressed its opposition to such a move.
Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist said that in a bid to shore up its unity, the coalition planned to swiftly pass laws that would give it a better chance of election victory.
Among them would be the lowering of the threshold of votes needed to be represented in parliament – an apparent gift to Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, whose far-right Religious Zionism party would not reach the required limit under current rules, according to several polls.
Another measure would be to lower the voting age to 17, which would give a demographic advantage to the ultra-Orthodox parties.
Netanyahu, who is on trial in several corruption cases, is assured of being re-elected as head of Likud at the end of November, as there are no other candidates.
And despite strong popular discontent with the government, his party remains the frontrunner according to all polls.</p><small>2025-10-26 08:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630572-punjab-revises-school-timings-amid-worsening-smog' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab revises school timings amid worsening smog</strong></a><br><p>

They, however, expect the situation to improve with supplies arriving from Swat and Sindh in the coming days.
 
 

“Although the rate of tomatoes has dropped slightly from Rs600 to Rs370–400 per kg, it is still unaffordable for the common man as it is a daily-use item,” said Rawalpindi Fruit and Vegetable Market Association President Ghulam Qadir Mir while speaking to Dawn.
Explaining the reasons behind the price hike, he said that floods during the monsoon season, the closure of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and the government’s negligence in bridging the demand-supply gap were the main factors.
 
 

He added that most of the tomato supply usually comes from Central Asia and Afghanistan, but border tensions had disrupted the trade. Meanwhile, local supplies from Punjab were also affected due to floods.
“Iranian tomatoes reached the market, but in limited quantities. Over the last two days, some supplies from Swat and Sindh have arrived, and we hope that the demand-supply gap will narrow, stabilising prices by next week,” he said.
Mr Mir urged the government to take immediate measures to import tomatoes to stabilise prices.
A senior official of the Punjab Agriculture Department said that tomato shortages typically begin in the winter season.
However, the Punjab government had launched a project last year to grow tomatoes in the off-season in some parts of the province.
He added that the devastating floods destroyed many of these areas, but farmers were expected to resume cultivation soon.
Meanwhile, the district administration has failed to enforce the official price list issued by the District Market Committee, as food items are being sold at inflated rates across the garrison city.
Price magistrates and other concerned departments appear helpless in implementing the directives.
 
 

According to market data, tomatoes are being sold at Rs370–400 per kg against the official price of Rs180 per kg. Ginger is available at Rs600 per kg (official rate Rs520), garlic at Rs380 per kg (official rate Rs350), potatoes at Rs90 per kg (official rate Rs78), onions at Rs95 per kg (official rate Rs88), eggs at Rs350 per dozen (official rate Rs333), and chicken at Rs350 per kg (official rate Rs313).
Residents of Rawalpindi have expressed anger over the unchecked price hike, particularly of tomatoes.
“The shopkeepers are charging excessively, and no one stops them. Who can afford to buy tomatoes at Rs370–400 per kg? Most people have stopped buying them,” said Niaz Ahmed, a resident of Mohanpura.
Muhammad Ayaz, a resident of Gawalmandi, said that the district administration had completely failed to control food prices. “People are struggling to buy sugar, wheat, meat, vegetables, and lentils,” he said.
He lamented that the common man’s income has not increased for years, while prices of essential commodities have multiplied. “There’s no one in the government to control this inflation,” he said.
Abrar Ahmed, a resident of Dhoke Khabba, said that managing a household budget has become nearly impossible. “With limited income, we can’t bear the inflation anymore. I now work two jobs just to make ends meet,” he said.
Shopkeepers, however, defended themselves, saying they too were affected by high wholesale rates. “We purchase goods at higher prices from the wholesale market, so it’s impossible to sell them cheaply,” one shopkeeper said.

Trump is set to meet Xi in South Korea on the last day of his regional swing in a bid to seal a deal to end the bruising trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
As he left Washington, Trump added to speculation that he could meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time since 2019 while on the Korean peninsula, saying he was “open to it”.
The US president will also visit Japan on his first trip to Asia since returning to the White House in January in a blaze of tariffs and international dealmaking.

Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he hoped for a
“comprehensive deal” with Xi, adding that he expected China to make a deal to avoid further 100 per cent tariffs that are due to come into effect on November 1.
In Malaysia on Sunday, Trump is due to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit — a meeting he skipped several times in his first term.
He is also set to sign a trade deal with Malaysia, and will witness the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia.
“We will be signing the Peace Deal immediately upon arrival,” Trump said on social media of the truce he helped broker after the deadliest clashes between Thailand and Cambodia in decades.
Trump said he expected to meet Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on the sidelines of the Asean summit to improve ties with the leftist leader after months of bad blood.
During a refuelling stop in Qatar on the way from Washington, the US president met with leaders of the Gulf emirate, which is among the guarantors of the Gaza ceasefire deal spearheaded by Trump.
Tariff talks
After Malaysia, Trump is expected in Tokyo on Monday, where the following day he will meet Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.
The US leader said he had heard “great things about her” and hailed the fact that she was an acolyte of assassinated former premier Shinzo Abe, with whom he had close ties.
Takaichi said she told Trump in a phone call on Saturday that “strengthening the Japan-US alliance is my administration’s top priority on the diplomatic and security front”.
Japan has escaped the worst of the tariffs Trump slapped on countries around the world to end what he calls unfair trade balances that are “ripping off the United States”.
The highlight of the trip is expected to be South Korea, where Trump will meet Xi for the first time since his return to office.
Trump is due to land in the southern port city of Busan on Wednesday ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, and will meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.
On Thursday, global markets will be watching closely to see if the meeting with Xi can halt the trade war sparked by Trump’s sweeping tariffs, especially after a recent dispute over Beijing’s rare-earth curbs.
Trump initially threatened to cancel the meeting and announced the fresh 100pc tariffs during that row, before saying he would go ahead after all.
South Korea’s reunification minister has said there is a “considerable” chance that Trump and North Korea’s Kim will also meet.
The two leaders last met in the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas during Trump’s first term.
Kim has said he would also be open to meeting the US president if Washington drops its demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal.</p><small>2025-10-26 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2612175230ed16c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951344/pm-shehbaz-to-lead-high-level-delegation-to-riyadh-from-oct-27-to-29-for-investment-talks' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to lead high-level delegation to Riyadh from Oct 27 to 29 for investment talks</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will travel to Riyadh from 27 to 29 October to attend the Ninth Future Investment Initiative (FII9), leading a high-level delegation to explore avenues for strengthening economic and investment cooperation with Saudi Arabia, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.
The FII9 will convene global leaders, investors, policymakers, and innovators to explore the theme, “The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth”. Thematic discussions will address global challenges and opportunities, focusing on key topics such as innovation, sustainability, economic inclusion, and geopolitical shifts.
“At the invitation of His Royal Highness Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman, Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif will lead a high-level delegation, including Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, as well as senior Cabinet Ministers — to Riyadh from 27 to 29 October 2025 to participate in the Ninth Edition of the Future Investment Initiative (FII9),” the FO statement said.
“During his stay, the prime minister will engage with the Saudi leadership to explore avenues for enhanced cooperation in the trade, investment, energy, and human resource sectors. The discussions will also cover regional and global issues of mutual interest and concern.”
It added that on the sidelines of FII9, PM Shehbaz will also interact with leaders from other participating countries and heads of international organisations.
“These exchanges will highlight Pakistan’s investment potential and its readiness to pursue collaborations in sustainable development, in line with the ‘Think, Exchange, and Act’ model.”
According to the FO, the visit will underscore Pakistan’s commitment to advancing economic diplomacy and fostering strategic partnerships in investment, technology, and sustainable development.
Islamabad and Riyadh have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
Last month, the two countries signed a defence agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
In 2024, they signed 34 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) worth $2.8 billion, following an earlier deal of 27 MoUs valued at $2.2bn.</p><small>2025-10-26 07:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26120906279083b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951202/ihc-to-hear-plea-seeking-closure-of-imrans-x-account' target='_blank'><strong>IHC to hear plea seeking closure of Imran’s X account</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has fixed for hearing a petition seeking the closure of former prime minister Imran Khan’s X (formerly Twitter) account.
Meanwhile, a district court in the capital extended the interim bail of the PTI founder’s wife, Bushra Bibi, in a protest case.
 
 

According to the cause list issued by the IHC registrar’s office, the petition will be taken up on November 4 by Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir. The court has already issued notices to the PTI founder, the National Cyber Crime Agency, the superintendent of prisons and other relevant officials seeking written responses.
The petition filed by a citizen, Ghulam Murtaza, through Barrister Zafarullah contended that the PTI founder was allegedly broadcasting illegal and provocative messages from his X account while in prison. The petitioner maintained that such an online activity could incite public unrest and undermine law and order. It requested the court to order the removal of all unlawful or disruptive posts and to restrain any future dissemination of similar material.
 
 

Meanwhile, the district and sessions court extended the interim bail granted to Bushra Bibi in a case linked to a protest held on November 26. The hearing, scheduled before Judge Chaudhry Amir Zia, was postponed due to his unavailability.
The case, registered at the Ramna police station under multiple sections including the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act, accuses the PTI leadership of organising an unlawful assembly and inciting unrest. The court adjourned the hearing until November 15 and summoned the parties to present their arguments.
 
 

Imaan Mazari tweet case
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka on Saturday dismissed the objections raised by the defence to the supplementary challan submitted by the prosecution in the controversial tweet case against Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatta.
The court also rejected the prosecution’s miscellaneous application seeking voice matching of the accused and fixed October 29 for framing of charges.
During the hearing at the district and sessions court, the assistant counsel for defence lawyer Qaiser Imam informed the court that the lead counsel was engaged in other cases and would appear shortly.
The judge adjourned proceedings for a short break and resumed the hearing at 9:30am.
Upon resumption, Advocate Qaiser Imam appeared on behalf of Imaan Mazari, while Advocate Kifayat Wazir represented co-accused Hadi Ali Chatta.
Prosecutor Muhammad Usman Rana appeared on behalf of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which had registered the case.
Advocate Qaiser Imam presented detailed arguments opposing the supplementary challan, contending that a final challan had already been submitted earlier in the case, leaving no legal ground for an additional submission. He argued that the supplementary challan was “legally inadmissible” since the investigation was considered complete once the final report was filed.
The court had reserved its decision on both the defence’s objections and the prosecution’s voice-matching application earlier in the day.
Later, Judge Majoka announced the verdict, dismissing both requests and scheduling October 29 as the date for the formal indictment of the accused.
The case pertains to a controversial tweet allegedly posted by Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatta, which led the NCCIA to initiate proceedings under cybercrime and related laws.

What began as a dispute over critical comments has now spiralled into a test of the league’s governance framework, laying bare the fragile relationship between the PCB and franchise owners as the PSL approaches the end of its first 10-year commercial cycle.
On Thursday, the PCB issued a suspension notice to the Multan Sultans, citing “breach of contractual obligations” after Tareen’s repeated public criticism of the board and PSL management. Sources told Dawn that a formal termination notice had also been prepared “after completing necessary legal procedures,” in what officials described as an effort to “protect the league’s integrity and reputation.”
The Multan franchise, however, framed the move as punitive and reactionary. “The PCB’s notice threatens termination of our franchise agreement and a lifetime blacklist of Mr Tareen,” a team statement said. “Every statement he has made has been in the best interest of the PSL, urging the league to aim higher and do better. Silencing honest feedback is not how great leagues are built.”
A VIRAL REBELLION
The confrontation escalated dramatically on Thursday night when Tareen released a video on X, holding what appeared to be the PCB’s legal notice. He said he “wanted to apologise but demanded better” of the league organisers, before tearing the document apart on camera.
 






His act, both defiant and performative, electrified social media, dividing fans and stakeholders alike. Some hailed it as a stand for transparency; others criticised it as unprofessional.
The dispute flared again on Saturday when Tareen posted another pointed remark on X, taking aim at the board’s media messaging.
“Someone please remind the folks making very important and crucial podcast content,” he wrote, “that franchises still haven’t received their full distributions for PSL9 and PSL10. Content is great, but clear your dues first and then interview yourself.”
The post came hours before the PCB issued a press release announcing “preparations underway for PSL franchise team renewals for another 10 years.”
According to the statement, an important meeting chaired by PSL CEO Salman Naseer at PCB headquarters reviewed progress on franchise valuations. Representatives from Middle Eastern chartered firm EY MENA, including partner Mohsin Iqbal, presented parts of their valuation report, which will determine the fair market values of both existing and proposed new teams
“Existing franchise teams who are in compliance of the terms of their franchise agreement will be offered the right to renew for a period of 10 years,” the statement read. EY MENA is expected to submit final valuations “within a few days.”
The timing of the PCB’s announcement — just as the Multan dispute dominated headlines — was read by many as a signal that the board intends to proceed with its renewal and expansion plans undeterred by ongoing friction.
GOVERNANCE ON SHAKY GROUND
At the heart of the controversy lies a structural flaw that has long plagued the PSL: its lack of independent governance. Despite becoming Pakistan’s most valuable sports brand since its 2016 inception, the league remains fully under PCB control, with no autonomous body representing franchise interests.
Several owners, including Quetta Gladiators’ Nadeem Omar, have called for a separate PSL governing council to “resolve issues faster” and ensure commercial sustainability.
With the first 10-year franchise contracts due to expire in December, there still remains uncertainty over valuations, expansion, and revenue-sharing has eroded confidence. The PCB’s engagement of EY MENA was meant to restore trust, but Tareen’s tweet accusing the board of withholding distributions for the last two seasons adds a fresh layer of mistrust to already fraught relations.
For its part, the board has sought to project business as usual. In a podcast released on Friday — the very one Tareen’s tweet alluded to — PSL CEO Salman Naseer spoke confidently about expansion plans, calling PSL 11 “the biggest yet.”
“We are seriously considering moving on to six venues this time,” Salman said, confirming plans to include two new franchises and the long-delayed Imran Khan Stadium in Peshawar. “The stadium is almost ready; we are trying to prepare it for international-standard matches.”
While such optimism signals ambition, critics say it ignores unresolved fundamentals, unsettled payments, delayed audits, and tense relations with investors.
BEYOND ONE MAN’S PROTEST
The PCB–Tareen saga encapsulates wider discontent among PSL stakeholders. Since 2020, the league has grappled with overlapping scheduling windows, declining foreign player participation, and dwindling television ratings.
PSL 10 was overshadowed by scheduling clashes with rival tournaments and a slump in fan turnout, particularly in Karachi, where poor marketing and low attendance dented revenues. The PCB’s celebratory post-season video prompted Tareen’s sharp retort in July: “Applause? You must be kidding. TV ratings down, attendance plummeting — yet we’re celebrating?”
Such criticism, viewed as “brand damage” by the PCB, has now transformed into open confrontation — and potentially, precedent-setting disciplinary action.
As the PSL franchises edge toward renewal, the question looming over the league’s its 10-year milestone remains unresolved: who truly owns the league — the PCB that administers it, or the investors who built its commercial base?
For now, the board insists that rules must be upheld and decorum maintained. Tareen, on the other hand, maintains that “honest feedback is not a crime.” Between those two positions lies the uncertain future of Pakistan’s most ambitious sporting venture — one that risks mistaking control for credibility at a time when it needs both.

The Sahiwal coal-fired power plant, they told residents, would be Pakistan’s flagship energy project — a 1,320 megawatt giant that would end electricity shortages and bring prosperity to central Punjab’s fertile heartland. They promised jobs, schools, hospitals and a brighter future.
In Village 76-5R, the local member of the provincial assembly and member of the National Assembly told farmers this was a “once-in-a-generation opportunity”. China was investing billions in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), they said, and Sahiwal would be at its centre. There would be 3,700 construction jobs and 1,600 permanent positions. Technical training centres would teach youth valuable skills. Girls’ schools would be built. A hospital with seven to 10 beds would serve the community. Roads connecting villages to markets would be paved. The three most-affected villages would receive free electricity.
What officials didn’t tell communities — what they conveniently left out — was that none of this would come to pass.
What they didn’t say was that fertile fields, cultivated since the British built the Canal Colonies in the 1800s, would become a wasteland of coal ash and contaminated water. They didn’t mention that families would watch their children struggle to breathe, their orchards wither and their groundwater sink deeper into the earth year after year.

Promised as a beacon of progress and development, the decade-old Sahiwal coal-fired power plant was meant not just to address Pakistan’s crushing energy shortages but to bring prosperity
to Punjab’s heartland. Instead, its bright lights have darkened the lives of those who gave up
their land for it, leading to displacement, disease, environmental disaster and despair…

“ANOTHER 1947”
Muhammad Siddique’s family had worked their six murabbas [one murabba is equivalent to 25 acres] of land for generations. “We had been cultivating this land since our grandfathers’ time,” he says, his voice breaking. “Suddenly, without any real consultation, it was taken from us.”
The acquisition happened fast — too fast for most families to fathom what was happening. District officials didn’t come to negotiate. They came to inform. Through politically aligned local leaders, word spread that the land was being taken for a development project that would both serve the communities and the national interest by increasing energy production. When Siddique hesitated to accept the compensation — approximately Rs 2.07 million per acre for land worth far more — a district education official threatened him with disciplinary action.
What the government did next was particularly cunning. Instead of negotiating with family patriarchs who controlled large holdings, they unilaterally processed hereditary divisions. Compensation checks were issued directly to individual heirs, including women. A female assistant commissioner was brought in specifically to encourage women to claim their shares. While this appeared progressive on paper, it served a backhanded purpose: it atomised large landholdings into hundreds of small claims, fracturing families and preventing unified resistance.
Najam, another landowner, acknowledges bitterly that they’d failed to challenge the acquisition within the legal timeframe required by the Land Acquisition Act. By the time they mobilised, it was too late. When legal action was eventually pursued, it met a swift and decisive end. The Multan bench of the Lahore High Court dismissed the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant case, with the government’s point of view on such cases being that the land was acquired in the larger public interest, to keep the lights on nationally. According to a community elder, “This act illustrates a clear alignment of the judiciary with the executive’s interests and priorities. It left us with the widespread sentiment that institutional mechanisms were rigged against us, prioritising national-scale infrastructure over the rights and grievances of the citizens.”
One villager describes the loss as “another 1947” — invoking the trauma of Partition, when millions were stripped of their homes and lands. The comparison isn’t hyperbolic. For farming families whose identity, livelihood and generational continuity were rooted in that soil, the displacement was indeed a rupture comparable to a historical catastrophe.

The promise of jobs turned out to be perhaps the cruellest deception, if only because the plant jeopardised the existing farmland livelihoods. While officials claimed the plant would create thousands of positions, the reality is starkly different. Only 67 per cent of residents say the plant generated more than 50 jobs. A striking 27 per cent believed no jobs were created at all.

A MANUFACTURED WASTELAND
Walking through Village 76-5R, one hears the same refrain: “Not a single promise was fulfilled.”
Before the plant, farmers in the area relied on three moghas [canal water outlets] for irrigation. Now, only one functions. The Irrigation Department shut down the other two to divert water to the coal plant’s massive cooling systems. Despite repeated complaints to the executive engineer of the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC), nothing has been done.
The numbers tell a grim tale. Groundwater levels have plummeted from an average depth of 68 feet to 172 feet. In Village 62-4R, the worst-affected area, water that once flowed at 100 feet now requires drilling to 250 feet. Over 80 percent of surveyed residents reported deteriorating water quality. The water that remains is often contaminated, unfit for drinking or irrigation.
Farmers have been forced to turn to expensive tube wells powered by diesel or solar. Muhammad from Village 75-5R calculated that his irrigation costs have tripled. “We tried to build our own mogha through collective effort,” he says, “but without departmental approval, it remains non-functional. They’ve left us to fend for ourselves.”
Furthermore, the air quality deterioration in the neighbourhoods around the plant is too palpable to ignore. When asked about environmental changes, 89 percent of residents say the air has grown noticeably worse since the plant began operations.
 
 

“Black soot settles over clothes left outside overnight, especially during summer,” one woman shares. Rickshaw drivers state that winter air has become increasingly polluted, making it difficult to breathe — a problem they never experienced before. One elderly resident of Village 64-5L put it simply: “This has been the hottest summer I’ve experienced in 40 years.”
Coal dust from the plant’s open-air storage and transportation doesn’t just pollute the air, it coats crops, blocking sunlight and disrupting growth cycles. The 4.4 million tonnes of imported coal arriving annually from Indonesia, South Africa and Australia leaves its mark on every surface, every lung and every leaf.
As per our findings, the health crisis is perhaps the most heartbreaking reality. Local clinics report that respiratory illnesses now dominate their workload, accounting for 47 per cent of all cases. Chronic coughing, shortness of breath, asthma and lung infections have become endemic in villages surrounding the plant.
A doctor in Village 76-5R couldn’t have put it more plainly: “We are seeing more patients with lung issues than ever before.” But it’s not just respiratory problems. Eye irritation, recurring fevers, skin allergies, hepatitis, liver dysfunction — the catalogue of ailments grows longer each year. According to the doctor, there have even been “unexplained sudden deaths.”
The crisis extends beyond humans. A veterinarian notes rising livestock illnesses, particularly among buffaloes. A farmer from 76-5R explains: “Foot-and-mouth disease has increased dramatically since the plant was built. Our animals drool, stop eating fodder and their milk production decreases. We don’t know if it’s the air or the water, but this situation didn’t exist before.”
Community members say the villages, in what was once known as Punjab’s ‘fruit basket’, is dying. Orchards that produced abundant guava and black plums for generations are withering. “The trees don’t grow like before, and fruits have disappeared,” farmers state repeatedly. Vegetables such as bitter gourd, pumpkin and onions — once commonly grown — are now difficult to cultivate. Even wheat yields are declining.
Ali, a lawyer from Village 76-5R, has become one of the plant’s most vocal critics. He has documented his dying orchards through videos on TikTok and Facebook, showing guava trees that failed to survive despite repeated replanting efforts. Several of his videos were later removed from both platforms without explanation — an act he believes was intended to silence dissent.
The plant generates approximately 3,000 kilogrammes of coal ash daily. This waste contaminates both land and water. Wastewater from the plant is channelled through pipelines into the Ravi River via the Seem Nala drainage channel. Farmers such as Siddique report that this polluted water, when reused for agriculture through solar-powered pumps, damages soil fertility and reduces crop productivity.
A rather alarming number of farmers say that agricultural productivity has declined. The ash that settles on fields chokes crops and diminishes fertility. Some farmers even point to the plant’s intense floodlights as an additional factor disrupting natural growth cycles.

THE ILLUSION OF OPPORTUNITY
The promise of jobs turned out to be perhaps the cruellest deception, if only because the plant jeopardised the existing farmland livelihoods. While officials claimed the plant would create thousands of positions, the reality is starkly different. Only 67 percent of residents say the plant generated more than 50 jobs. A striking 27 percent believed no jobs were created at all.
Sunny Shah of Village 76 says, “Sepco [Southern Electric Power Company], one of the plant’s key contractors, pays local workers just Rs 25,000 per month. No one from my village earns more than that.” Most locals were hired only during construction. The few who secured operational jobs work as labourers, cooks or electricians — low-paid positions with no career advancement.
High-paying technical and managerial positions went to Chinese staff or workers brought in from other cities. The promised technical training centre either doesn’t exist or remains irrelevant to local needs. Young people who expected career opportunities found themselves relegated to cleaning, construction support or cooking.
The pay disparities are particularly galling. Some cooks reportedly earn up to Rs 100,000 per month — nearly four times more than plant labourers — mainly because they prepare food for Chinese staff. This creates not just economic inequality but social resentment.
The disruption to local mobility has also been catastrophic. Before the plant’s construction, residents of Villages 75-4R, 76-5R and 77-5R could reach Yousafwala market — their lifeline for trade and supplies — in 10-15 minutes via a railway crossing. That crossing is now permanently closed. Today, the same trip requires a 12-15 kilometre detour through an incomplete road that adds six to eight extra km to their daily commute. Nearly a decade after construction began, the roadwork remains unfinished. What was once a routine journey has become a daily grind that increases transport costs, reduces productivity and weighs heavily on families.
The alternate route, nestled between the railway line and the LBDC, has become dangerous. Residents report frequent incidents of robbery and snatching. Farmers and traders transporting goods have become routine targets. With poor lighting and no security, the road has turned into a corridor of fear, especially at dusk and dawn.
Meanwhile, the Yousafwala railway station — though close by — remains inaccessible to locals. It has been configured exclusively for the plant’s coal logistics, reinforcing the bitter reality that infrastructure now serves coal, not communities.
UNKEPT PROMISES
Of the many promises made by the authorities as listed below, few have come to fruition.
Promised: Higher secondary schools for boys and girls.
Delivered: Nothing. The existing high school was supposed to be upgraded. Ten years later, it hasn’t been.
Promised: A seven to 10-bed hospital.
Delivered: Nothing. Villagers must travel hours to Sahiwal city for medical care.
Promised: Improved roads connecting villages to markets and highways.
Delivered: Incomplete, dangerous routes that have worsened mobility.
Promised: Free electricity to the three most-affected villages.
Delivered: Nothing. The irony of living in darkness beside a power plant is not lost on anyone.
Promised: Technical training centre for the youth.
Delivered: Either non-existent or irrelevant to community needs.
Promised: Clean water schemes.
Delivered: Nothing. Water quality has deteriorated and groundwater continues to deplete.
Promised: Improvements to irrigation and sewerage.
Delivered: Nothing. Canal outlets were shut down and no sewerage improvements were made.
Even the symbolic gestures ring hollow. A girls’ school was established within the plant premises, but it remains inaccessible to the local community. It’s widely seen as a box-ticking exercise in corporate social responsibility rather than genuine investment in local education.

THE SURVEILLANCE
Perhaps nothing symbolises the plant’s antagonistic relationship with the community more starkly than the security regime. Residents of Villages 75-5R, 76-5R and 77-5R report frequent visits from police and elite force personnel who check national identity cards — including those of guests — and enter homes without notice or female officers present.
The absence of female constables during searches violates cultural norms and leaves families feeling vulnerable and humiliated. Women in Village 76-5R repeatedly requested that Yousafwala police station provide female officers during inspections. Their appeals were consistently ignored.
The plant’s private security teams enter villages in convoys at least once a month. Surveillance cameras around the plant trigger alerts whenever villagers approach the boundary wall, prompting rapid deployment of elite police — even when there’s no threat. “It’s as if our voices don’t matter,” one villager says. “They treat us like criminals in our own homes.”
The intimidation intensified after security incidents around the Diamer-Basha dam. Punjab’s special police unit and suspected military personnel were deployed in the area. Though the threat was unrelated to Sahiwal, it became justification for tightening control over the local population.
ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT PIPEDREAM
Time and again, the government or company officials, including the Chinese, have painted a rosy picture of the project. However, given the human and ecological cost of the project, it has turned out to be a pipedream, as is often the case with most development projects the state continues to pursue in isolation and at the cost of public interest.
Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy (Pvt.) Limited is responsible for the operating of the Sahiwal power plant and is the Pakistani counterpart of the project’s Chinese patrons. We reached out to an official from Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy (Pvt.) Limited, who declined to comment on our questions regarding the promises that locals say were not fulfilled.
Government officials were also contacted for their responses, but none were willing to come on the record for this Eos story. Two officials did, however, speak with us on the condition of anonymity.
Sources in a government institution affiliated with the federal power ministry say that the social and economic situation in Pakistan when the Sahiwal coal power plant was envisioned was very different from what it is now. A highly placed official of the institution reveals, on the condition of anonymity, “Between 2013 and 2015, our biggest challenge was to keep the lights on. We were running all over the world, seeking investments in power plants that could help us overcome more than 12 hours of electricity outages every day and in every part of the country. We were more concerned about adding sufficient electricity to our system than being worried about the environment.”
When asked why the government decided to set up a coal power plant in Sahiwal, the veritable food basket of the country, he says, “We needed a large power plant close to our biggest electricity load centres of Lahore and Faisalabad [which lie within a 150 kilometres radius from Sahiwal].”
He explains that the plant could not be set up on the coast because “our transmission system was incapable of transmitting electricity efficiently and smoothly from the south” of the country to its centre. “Karachi’s coastline was dotted with several power projects and we knew that setting up another power plant there would totally choke our south to centre transmission system,” he says.
One of his immediate subordinates acknowledges that, in today’s circumstances, the Sahiwal coal power plant would never have been built where it has been built. “Importing, transporting and burning coal for power generation has serious environmental costs,” he says. Though he emphasises that the machinery used in the Sahiwal coal power plant is based upon ‘super critical technology’ and thus, according to him, emits much less pollutants than other power plants, he understands why the communities living in its shadow should be worried.
According to him, “Coal power plants all over the world are known to have serious impacts on water resources and air quality in their vicinity. That is why they are being phased out from most of the European countries and that is why the government should immediately pay heed if people in and around Sahiwal have any complaints about the plant.”
But he also adds: “Pakistan does not have the luxury to phase out its coal power plants immediately, mainly because we don’t have the money required for that. Also, our coal power fleet is much smaller compared to the coal power fleets of India and China, both still getting more than 50 percent of their electricity from coal. So, even if we shut down our coal power plants tomorrow, we’ll still be feeling the climatic impacts of coal being burned in the power plants of our two big neighbours.”
THE RESISTANCE
On September 10, 2025, farmers gathered outside the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant for the Asia Day of Action Against Coal. Organised by the Pakistan Kissan Rabita Committee, in collaboration with the Asian Peoples Movement on Debt and Development, the protest highlighted coal’s impacts, such as increased flooding, erratic rainfall, heat waves and economic losses.
Protesters rejected government and corporate narratives of ‘clean coal’ and ‘transition fuels’. Their message was clear: “There is no such thing as clean coal.” They called for a just, fully funded phase-out plan that safeguards workers, communities and the planet.
But resistance comes at a cost. Several research participants shared accounts of being threatened when they tried to raise concerns. Villages such as 76-5R, 77-5R, and 75-4R remain under close surveillance. Police continue to question guests, conduct random ID checks and monitor daily life.
When asked whether the plant should continue operating, 64.6 per cent of the local respondents opposed its continuation. Only 20.2 per cent supported keeping it running. Some respondents chose to remain silent about their views due to security concerns — a silence that speaks volumes.
THE LARGER PICTURE
When China, capitalising on its solar energy achievements, proposed a $62 billion investment package for CPEC, many Pakistanis held optimistic expectations for the development of a clean energy future. However, such hopes were dashed as CPEC’s $34 billion “clean energy portfolio” was substantially compromised by the incorporation of at least nine coal-fired power facilities.
Consequently, CPEC’s operational projects continue to rely heavily on coal. Thirty-eight percent of the total generation capacity of active CPEC projects comes from coal, with wind and solar contributing only eight percent and hydro-electric power accounting for 54 per cent. This dependency persists despite coal’s severe public health impacts. Air pollution causes annually an estimated 128,000 deaths, with Pakistan home to three of the world’s most polluted cities.
The Sahiwal plant isn’t just one failed development project — it’s a symptom of Pakistan’s broken development model. Constructed as part of CPEC’s $34 billion energy portfolio, it represents the contradiction at the heart of the China-Pakistan partnership: while the world moves away from coal, Pakistan has doubled down on it.
The project has also been plagued by procurement scandals. A National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) fact-finding committee in 2024 uncovered serious irregularities: limited competition, inflated prices and procedural changes that restricted fair bidding. Coal was reportedly contracted at Rs 75,000 per tonne, while other industries paid Rs 45,000 rupees for comparable quality.
Payment disputes have strained Pakistan-China relations. By mid-2024, the Sahiwal plant alone was owed Rs 87 billion. Chinese Independent Power Producers under CPEC face total overdue payments of Rs 500 billion. China has linked future investments to Pakistan’s ability to settle these dues.
Moreover, the plant’s performance has deteriorated sharply. According to a 2024 report by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), energy output dropped from 7,500 GWh in 2021 to 2,000 GWh in 2024. Utilisation fell from 99 percent (2020-2022) to 41 percent. Capacity factors declined from 54-63 percent to just 19 per cent by 2024.
THE WAY FORWARD
Listening to farmers, doctors, lawyers, teachers and ordinary villagers, one comes away with the impression that their demand, their resistance, is not just clear but reasonable. However, local communities must strengthen their bargaining power by forming village-level committees or coalitions that represent farmers, women and the youth collectively in order to avoid fragmentation and ensure that their voices are heard in negotiations.
Rather than relying on sporadic protests, communities should insist on formalised dialogue mechanisms with project operators and government departments, as structured engagement through public hearings, grievance committees and participatory monitoring can yield more sustained benefits.
Where collective action becomes necessary, mobilisation should remain strategic, lawful and safety-conscious, avoiding confrontations that could invite repression. Legal aid groups can assist communities in filing cases on compensation disputes, land rights and environmental non-compliance.
Communities should prioritise achievable demands that can bring immediate relief, including improved access to healthcare, provision of clean drinking water, restoration of canal water, reopening of the blocked bridge at Qadirabad, and employment guarantees for local youth. Focusing on such tangible needs proves more practical in the short term than solely pressing for the closure of the coal plant, which remains unlikely in the immediate future.
Young people should harness social media, local networks and people assemblies’ gatherings to raise their voices and mobilise around shared concerns, while also drawing on lived experiences of village elders. Communities should convene an awami akath [a community meeting] or other collective forums to develop a unified stance, ensuring that village-wise demands are clearly documented and communicated to the authorities.
Legal recourse should also be considered, even though approaching courts proves time-consuming and exhausting. Communities can seek help from civil society organisations, legal aid groups or sympathetic lawyers to navigate these processes and strengthen their chances of achieving justice.
People should reach out to courts regarding remaining land issues and must not compromise on the impacts causing harm, such as water depletion, increased agricultural costs, health concerns, mobility challenges and business losses. They can invoke environmental laws and connect with the right people who will help them speak up and defend their rights.
A FINAL WORD
The elderly farmer Rana Ali Hassan’s orchard in Village 76-5 R is now dilapidated and filled with dying trees surrounded by air heavy with coal dust. “They called this development,” he says as he looks out over fields his grandfather had cultivated. “They said we were building Pakistan’s future. But whose future? Not ours. Not our children’s.” After a pause he says, “If development means destroying the land that feeds us, poisoning the air we breathe and stealing the water we need to survive — what kind of development is that?”
There is no easy answer to this. But one thing is for certain: these countless stories of loss and betrayal demand more than sympathy. They demand justice. They demand accountability. They demand that we redefine what development means and for whom.
Until that happens, the coal will keep burning, the ash will keep falling and communities will keep bearing costs they never agreed to pay. The megawatts will flow to distant cities, while the people who sacrificed their land, their health and their futures will remain in darkness.
That is the real story of Sahiwal. Not a success story of energy security, but a tragedy of broken promises and betrayed communities. Not a model for development, but a warning of what happens when profit trumps people, when national interest erases local lives and when the costs of progress are borne by those who benefit least.
Adapted from the study ‘Megawatts of Betrayal: Sahiwal’s Broken Social Contract’, undertaken by the independent public interest think tank Policy Research Institute for Equitable Development (PRIED). The study involved field research conducted in 12 villages surrounding the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant between June and September 2025, surveying nearly a 100 respondents, and holding focus group discussions with directly affected residents, farmers, teachers, lawyers and community leaders

Addressing a press conference at the party’s city office, Insaf House, Karachi, Sindh chapter president Haleem Adil Sheikh said that state institutions in the province had “ceased to function effectively”.
 
 

“Sindh is the land of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai and hospitality, but today, oppression and lawlessness prevail,” he lame­nted, holding the PPP government responsible for the province’s deteriorating situation.
Citing a recent case of “pol­ice brutality,” he referred to the case of a young labourer, Irfan Baloch, who had come from Uch Sharif, Punjab, to Karachi for work, and was allegedly abduc­ted and tortured to death by the CIA police.

Haleem Adil says over 50 citizens killed by robbers this year

“No FIR has been registered yet,” he said, warning that if jus­t­ice was denied, it would pro­ve that “the police institution itself is complicit in this brutality.”
 
 

Accompanied by PTI Sindh leaders Jamal Siddiqui, Farukh Khan and others, the PTI provincial chief also highlighted the alarming rise in street crimes in the metropolis.
“In September alone, 199 cars, 3,698 motorcycles, and 1,542 mobile phones were snatched, while 51 citizens were killed resisting robberies this year,” he said.
Mr Sheikh questioned why the authorities had failed to take action against the patrons of 72 dacoits who recently surrendered in Shikarpur’s Katcha area, noting that “no hostages had been recovered”.
 
 

“The Katcha areas have tur­ned into no-go zones. Law and order in Sindh has collapsed, and police excesses are rampant,” he said.
Referring to the Auditor General of Pakistan’s 2024-25 report, the PTI provincial chief said that “financial irregularities worth Rs836 billion” had been unearthed in Sindh government departments.
“Seventeen years of PPP rule have pushed Sindh to the brink of destruction. Corruption has infested every institution,” he said.
He said the citizens were being “crushed under rising inflation” and that “corruption” had become routine.
 
 

“Flour, sugar, vegetables, pulses, ghee, electricity, and gas have all become unaffordable. People must break their silence, as remaining quiet now means abetting crime,” he warned.
Mr Sheikh also deplored the dismal state of education and healthcare in Sindh, saying that “more than six million children are out of school,” hospitals lack basic facilities, and dengue cases are surging.
He criticised the provincial government for “denying” citizens access to the Sehat Card and “exploiting” farmers who were not getting fair prices for their crops.
He further alleged large-scale corruption in the Sindh Solar Energy Programme, which is a Rs28 billion World Bank-funded project.
“Fake import documents were used, and the actual price of solar fans was $23.4 per unit, but the Sindh government contracted them for $151 per unit. On top of that, Rs127 million in fake tax claims were filed,” he claimed.

Judge Arif Khan Niazi had reserved the verdict on Sept 27 and scheduled its announcement for Oct 25. However, the judge has now rescheduled the announcement of the decision for Nov 8.
During the hearing, the court also accepted a request for a one-time exemption from personal appearance on behalf of Mr Elahi, after his counsel informed the judge that the former chief minister could not appear due to the death of a close relative.
According to the FIA, the sons and the daughters-in-law of the former chief minister allegedly committed money laundering through a low cadre employee of the Punjab Assembly. It claimed the suspects used the bank accounts of Qaiser Iqbal Bhatti, a peon of the assembly, to launder money.
The FIA stated that unexplained transactions amounting to millions of rupees were traced in the accounts of both the peon and the children of Mr Elahi. It alleged that the assets of the peon were found beyond his known sources of income. The agency clarified that the inquiry in question was independent and unrelated to any previous investigation, as it had been initiated against a government employee and the assembly’s peon.

“PPP remains committed to respecting, empowering, and reviving the ag­­ricultural sector for a pr­­o­s­­perous Pakistan,” said the party’s Central Informa­tion Secretary Shazia Ma­­rri. She quoted PPP Chair­man Bilawal Bhutto-Zar­d­ari as saying that no economy can be strong if its farmers are weak.
“Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari believes that strengthening the farmer means strengthening Pakistan itself,” Ms Marri said in a statement issued on Saturday.
Ms Marri said that Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s vision was clear — the true measure of progress lies in the prosperity of farmers. She recalled that during the PPP government, Pakistan had moved from wheat shortage to becoming a wheat-exporting country, owing to farmer-friendly policies.
She said that the PPP chairman had always stood by the farmers, advocating for timely procurement and fair prices.
Highlighting the impact of climate change, the PPP leader said that it posed a serious threat to every Pakistani farmer. She added that Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari emphasised the need for investment in sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture, envisioning a modern agricultural economy where small farmers could progress through technology and access to fair markets.
She said the PPP believed that insurance, credit access, and transparent governance were essential to protect farmers from the adverse effects of climate change.
Ms Marri appreciated the government’s decision to allow wheat procurement, terming it a longstanding demand of the PPP. She added that approving the support price for wheat was also a PPP demand; however, she noted that fixing the price at Rs4,000 instead of Rs3,500 per 40kg would have been more beneficial for farmers. She further said that reducing the income tax from 45 per cent to 15pc was an important relief measure for the farming community.

The understanding was reached during a meeting between Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry and Iran’s Minister for Roads and Urban Development, Farzaneh Sadegh. Both sides underlined the importance of regional connectivity for expanding trade, investment and transport links.
The ministers discussed initiatives to enhance maritime trade, develop port infrastructure and improve logistical routes connecting the two countries by sea, land and rail.

Ferry service proposed to facilitate pilgrims, promote religious tourism

Mr Chaudhry proposed launching a ferry service between Pakistan and Iran to provide an affordable and efficient transport option for traders and pilgrims. He said Pakistani authorities would welcome Iranian companies interested in operating such a service, noting that Iran’s lower fuel prices could help reduce fares.
 
 

He added that in 2025, about 60,000 to 70,000 Pakistani pilgrims travelled to Iran and Iraq by air, and a ferry service could significantly increase those numbers. The minister also said a centralised pilgrim management policy would be introduced next year, requiring all pilgrims to travel through registered tour operators to improve safety and coordination.
Mr Chaudhry noted that expanding religious tourism could bring economic benefits to both countries and called for cooperation to develop the necessary infrastructure.
The Iranian minister welcomed Pakistan’s proposals and said both countries’ ports could serve as gateways for regional commerce. She reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to enhancing port-to-port cooperation and exploring trade routes in the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.
“The ports of both countries are key economic assets,” Ms Sadegh said. “By improving maritime and transport connectivity, we can open new opportunities for regional trade and economic cooperation.” Both sides reiterated their commitment to deepening collaboration in the maritime and transport sectors as part of broader efforts to promote the blue economy and strengthen bilateral relations.

Separately, a station house officer (SHO) was injured in Hangu during follow-up action after a bomb attack on Friday evening that killed SP Asad Zubair and two police guards.
In the Jhallar area of North Waziristan, security forces killed three militants and averted a “potential catastrophic attack” by destroying a vehicle being prepared for a suicide attack, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Acting on intelligence about the presence of “Khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al-Khawarij”, troops “effectively engaged” the militants’ location and destroyed the vehicle besides killing three militants.

The state uses the term Fitna al-Khawarij to refer to militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“A sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored Kharji found in the area as a relentless counterterrorism campaign … by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the ISPR said.
Separately, security officials said a targeted operation in War Mamund tehsil of Bajaur left five militants dead and several injured.
The operation, conducted on intelligence reports about the presence of militants in the Badan area, continued over two days, according to residents who confirmed sustained movement by security forces.
 
 

Local sources claimed the militants were using a mosque built for refugees as a hideout. The ISPR did not immediately issue a statement on the Bajaur operation.
Leaders of the Bajaur Aman Jirga staged a demonstration in the Umary area on Saturday evening, demanding that authorities avoid harm to civilians during operations.
In Hangu, four militants were killed in an exchange of fire in the rugged mountains on Friday evening. The operation was launched after an improvised explosive device (IED) attack that martyred SP (Operations) Asad Zubair and two guards. The SHO of the Doaba police station was injured in the ensuing action.
The area has witnessed repeated attacks attributed to the banned TTP in recent months.

Several institutions are organising the test, including the Uni­ver­sity of Health Sciences in Lahore, Suk­kur IBA University, Khyber Medical Uni­versity in Peshawar, Bolan Uni­versity of Medical and Health Scie­nces in Quetta, and Shaheed Zulfi­qar Ali Bhutto Medical University in Islamabad.
Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) President Dr Rizwan Taj said that all participating universities had assured him that the necessary arrangements for the test have been made.
“All universities conducting the MDCAT were advised to thoroughly review and implement all required arrangements to ensure the fair, tr­­a­­­nsparent, and secure conduct of the examination,” Mr Taj said. He added that security measures in­­­­­c­l­u­­de the installation of jammers to blo­­­ck unauthorised electronic devices.

Over 140,000 hopefuls compete for 22,000 spots

“Examination venues will be eq­­u­ipped with proper seating arra­ngements and adequate facilities to ac­­commodate all candidates co­­mfortably,” he said.
“Furthermore, universities are instructed to make ap­­­propriate arrangements for heating or cooling of the examination halls according to weather conditions and to ensure that drinking water is readily available to all candidates,” he added.
To ensure transparency and proper record-keeping, specific protocols have been established for the exam materials.
“Universities shall provide bubble sheets with carbon copies to the candidates and must ensure complete secrecy and confidentiality of all question papers,” Mr Taj stated.
“Question papers shall be ope­n­­ed only in the presence of witnesses to maintain transparency. After the conclusion of the examination, all bubble sheets must be collected promptly and kept in a safe and secured location”, he added
He also mentioned that the original examination papers of the MDCAT would be retained by the respective universities for a minimum period of 12 months from the date of the result declaration.
Mr Taj emphasised a swift and tra­­nsparent process for releasing results. The official answer key will be uploaded to university websites immediately after the exam, with full results expected within one week.
Mr Taj said that a comprehensive post-hoc analysis report had to be prepared and submitted within 10 days of the announcement of the final results. He further mentioned that universities were required to provide a facility for the re-checking of marks within three days following the announcement of the results.

• Plea alleges officials implicated woman in criminal case
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court has ordered the constitution of a joint investigation team (JIT) to investigate into the alleged abduction of a woman and her three minor children, an episode now linked to a multimillion-rupee Naval Farms land scam recently unearthed by a joint enquiry committee (JEC).
Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the IHC issued the directives while hearing a petition filed by Muhammad Waqas and others.
 
 

The petition alleged that police officials, acting on behalf of unidentified people, abducted Sana Sohail, wife of Aleem Sohail, who worked in a private farm, along with her daughters — 12-year-old Harim, seven-year-old Laiba, and three-year-old Nimra — from Lahore on Sept 17.
It added that the officials later implicated the woman in a fabricated criminal case at the Tarnol police station in Islamabad.
According to the court order, CCTV footage dated Sept 17 confirmed that the woman and her children were taken into custody at around 7am with the assistance of the Punjab police and transported to Islamabad.
They were later shown as arrested in an FIR, which was registered three days later under various provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Arms Ordinance.
The judge observed that the incident occurred prior to the filing of the FIR, raising “serious questions about the legality of the police action”.
The investigation officer (IO) failed to identify those who had ordered the operation or to justify the presence of two Suzuki Alto cars and other vehicles recovered at the CIA centre in Islamabad.
The IHC directed the Islamabad police chief to appear in person on Oct 28 and explain the conduct of the Tarnol SHO and the IO.
The CIA centre SP was instructed to produce the vehicles and submit a detailed report describing how they were taken into custody.
Justice Kayani also summoned the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) director general and ordered the creation of a JIT to investigate into the alleged abduction, trespassing, and fabrication of criminal charges. The FIA DG was told to supervise the inquiry.
The order pointed out that Duty Jud­ic­ial Magistrate Yasir Mehmood Chaudhry had sent Ms Sohail to judicial custody and placed her children with the Child Pro­t­e­ction Bureau without the inquiry required under law concerning their welfare.
The member inspection team of the high court was directed to summon the magistrate for an explanation.
Land scam
The IHC proceedings are closely connected to a separate high-level probe by the JEC, comprising high ranking officials including Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon, director generals of the Inter-Services Intelligence and Intelligence Bureau, a senior superintendent of Islamabad police as well as a naval commander, which earlier uncovered a sophisticated land scam involving 136 kanals of property in Mera Begwal, Islamabad.
The JEC found that the land had been illegally transferred through a manipulated general power of attorney (GPA) and fraudulent documents.
According to the JEC report, the GPA used for the transfer bore genuine signatures and thumb impressions of the landowner, Musharraf Rasool Cyan, but the sale clause was inserted later.
The inquiry also discovered fake stamp papers and affidavits and traced financial transactions exceeding Rs383.8 million.
Muhammad Waqas, the petitioner in the IHC case, was identified as Mr Cyan’s farm employee, who had received the funds from land provider Faisal Mumtaz and the Pakistan Navy Benevolent Association. Mr Waqas, who earned Rs50,000 a month, withdrew or transferred Rs326.95m.
Another employee, Aleem Sohail, and his wife Ms Sohail — the woman allegedly abducted — were also found to have received large unexplained deposits.
The JEC expressed astonishment that the PNBA and Mr Mumtaz paid such huge sums to a farm worker without verifying ownership or contacting the actual landowner.
It recommended the cancellation of the fraudulent mutation, legal action against those involved, freezing of assets, as well as reforms in property registration and biometric verification systems.

Once a political outsider, Mamdani’s campaign has surged, powered by young progressive volunteers and growing frustration over the city’s soaring cost of living.
His pledge to freeze rents for two million New Yorkers in rent-stabilised properties has resonated in a city where affordable housing is increasingly out of reach.
If elected, Mamdani would be New York’s first Muslim mayor — a historic milestone. Observers, however, note that his popularity stems primarily from his progressive and socialist positions rather than his faith.

Mamdani champions labour unions, wealth taxation, expanded public transit, and climate-friendly housing.  He also emphasises social inclusion, protecting undocumented immigrants through sanctuary city policies, defending LGBTQ rights, and ensuring equitable access to healthcare and education.
These stances earned him strong support from younger and diverse voters, including African American and Hispanic communities.
“Mamdani has energised people who feel shut out of traditional politics,” said Moviz Siddiqui of Queens. “He talks about fairness and affordability in a way that connects with everyone — Muslims, Jews, Hindus, atheists — it doesn’t matter.”
Opponents have sought to make his faith an issue. Responding, Mr Mamdani pledged to embrace his Muslim identity more openly, calling such attacks “racist and baseless”.
“The dream of every Muslim is simply to be treated the same as any other New Yorker,” he told a Muslim gathering outside a Brooklyn mosque on Friday.
Mamdani, who has denounced Israel’s military actions in Gaza as “genocide,” has faced online abuse and political backlash. Yet a Victory Insights poll from October 22-23 shows him leading former Governor Andrew Cuomo by 18 points, with 47 per cent support. Republican Curtis Sliwa stands at 16 pc.
After a long hesitation, Dem­ocratic leaders like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have also endorsed Mamdani, signalling party unity ahead of the November 4 election.
 
 

Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and committed to being a Mayor for all New Yorkers,” Mr Jeffries said.
Mr Schumer added, “He ran an impressive campaign that connected with New Yorkers about affordability, fairness, and opportunity,” defending him against conservative calls to denaturalise him.
Born in Kampala, Uganda, Mr Mamdani moved to New York as a child. His father is a Ugandan Mus­lim scholar, and his mother, Mira Nair, is a Hindu Indian filmmaker.
This diverse heritage has resonated across New York’s South Asian community, uniting voters from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.
Muslim leaders, however, remain divided. Councilwoman Shahana Hanif called Mamdani “a bridge-builder”, noting their shared work to heal post-9/11 divides. Meanwhile, New Jersey-based Nasir Qayyum Khan cautioned that Mamdani’s progressive stances may conflict with more conservative Muslim values.
Early voting in New York has grown steadily since 2019. In June’s mayoral primary, about 35 percent of ballots were cast early. This year, early voting runs through November 2, with Election Day on November 4. The winner will take office in January.

• Citizens urged to wear masks, avoid unnecessary outdoor activity
• PDMA says smog intensity expected to rise from Nov to mid-Dec
• Govt imposes blanket ban on stubble, solid waste, plastic burning
LAHORE: Lahore has ranked as the world’s most polluted city for the past three days, with air quality plummeting to hazardous levels as smog blanketed the city and the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) hitting 412, prompting health warnings and a province-wide crackdown on pollution sources.
Data revealed that Lower Mall was the worst-affected neighbourhood, with an AQI of 680, followed by Iqbal Town (577), Syed Maratib Ali Road (543), Shadman (507), the Punjab University area (506), and Shalimar (495).
Environmental experts have urged residents to avoid unnecessary outdoor activity, particularly in the morning and evening, and to wear masks when outside. PM2.5 concentrations in Lahore’s air are multiple times above global safety thresholds, raising risks of respiratory and cardiovascular illness among other serious health issues, especially for children and the elderly.
The Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a high alert across eastern districts of the province, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Nankana Sahib, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Khanpur.
“The intensity of smog is expected to increase from November to mid-December,” warned DG PDMA Irfan Ali Kathia, citing forecasts from the Meteorological Department. The PDMA has directed all commissioners and deputy commissioners to ensure the implementation of government measures to combat smog.
The authorities have announced a strict, multi-pronged strategy to tackle the pollution at its source. A comprehensive ban has been imposed on the burning of crop residues, solid waste, tires, plastic and rubber.
Mr Kathia stated that a case would be registered for any violation, including the burning of crop stubble and garbage.
Simultaneously, the Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA) has intensified its anti-smog operations, using advanced drone cameras to monitor industrial zones, agricultural land, and urban areas.
In the last 24 hours, this tech-driven initiative identified over 460 smog-related violations. More than 200 e-challans were issued to smoke-emitting vehicles, with real-time data shared with departments for immediate action.
While enforcement is critical, the government is also pushing for long-term, sustainable solutions. At a seminar in the Kabirwala town of Khanewal district, the Department of Environmental Protection and Climate Change educated farmers on using modern machinery to manage crop residue, particularly rice stubble, without burning.
Officials and experts highlighted that this waste can be repurposed in biomass plants to generate steam and energy, turning an environmental problem into an economic opportunity.
“Smog is a serious environmental and public health issue, requiring collective and coordinated efforts to address it,” said Project Coordinator Dr Younus Zahid.
As the government leverages technology for enforcement and promotes alternative farming practices, the public has been urged to play its part.
Citizens have been asked to report smog-inducing activities on the emergency helpline 15, with authorities emphasising that only a collective effort can clear the hazardous air and protect public health.
Earlier, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said that nine departments were conducting large-scale operations against smog.
The minister said that the environmental protection force and the department were fully mobilised, that all sectoral squads were present in the field, and that brick kilns were being monitored through drones, in addition to issuing a live report.
She added that anti-smog cannons and air-quality monitors are deployed and that AQI forecasting, which she said has been introduced for the first time in Punjab, has enabled earlier interventions to curb pollution spikes.

• Insiders say decision ‘almost finalised’, incumbent premier may be given choice of ‘honourable exit’
ISLAMABAD: As the PPP plans to install its own prime minister in Azad Jammu Kashmir, the party lawmakers from the region separately met party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and President Asif Ali Zardari to mull options for the removal of the incumbent PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq.
Only a picture of Mr Zardari’s meeting with the lawmakers was issued by Saturday night, while a handout issued by the PPP regarding the meeting with Mr Bhutto-Zardari also did not mention the possibility of a no-confidence motion against the AJK premier. The party leaders discussed the AJK’s “political situation” in the meeting, said the official statement.
 
 

Sources, however, claimed the party meeting considered names for Mr Haq’s successor. They said the PPP had “almost finalised” the decision to oust the AJK prime minister through a no-trust motion. A formal decision, according to sources, is likely in a day or two.
The insiders said the party leaders deliberated upon all possible options, including giving some time to the AJK prime minister for “an honourable exit”, before making any move to remove the premier through a no-trust vote.
According to the sources, the meeting also explored potential successors, with Chaudhry Yaseen, Chaudhry Latif Akbar and Sardar Yaqoob emerging as strong contenders for the coveted post. In the AJK assembly, the PPP, with the support of the PML-N, has the support of more than 27 lawmakers — a magic number required to form the government. The PPP has 17 members in the house, 10 of whom are ministers and two are advisers, while AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar also hails from the PPP.
It may be noted that the PPP had already decided it would not remain a part of the government, but it remained undecided about whether to sit on the opposition benches or form its own government in the region.
Meanwhile, the official statement by the party said that Mr Bhutto-Zardari presided over the PPP AJK Parliamentary group meeting and “discussed the political situation” in AJK.
The statement added that the PPP leaders of the AJK chapter discussed improving the organisational structure of the party in the region and the current political situation in AJK.
The meeting was also attended by former prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and former Kashmir affairs minister Qamar Zaman Kaira, who had recently led a federal government delegation to talk to the protesters in AJK and remained successful in ending the protest after an agreement was signed in the first week of October. At least 10 had been killed while scores were injured in clashes between the law enforcers and the protesters that lasted for days. PPP Women Wing’s Central President Faryal Talpur was also present in the meeting.
Others who attended the meeting included Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, Faisal Mumtaz, Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Sardar Javed Ayub, Sardar Muhammad Yaqub Khan, Mian Abdul Waheed, Javed Iqbal Bandhanvi, Syed Bazil Naqvi, Syed Zia Qamar, Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, Chaudhry Aamir Yasin, Aamir Ghaffar Lone, Javed Butt, Rafiq Nayyar, Nabila Ayub, Chaudhry Muhammad Riaz, and Sardar Tanveer Ilyas.

They said that Brewery area police were conducting snap checking at Western Bypass when they signalled a suspected car to stop. However, the occupants opened fire on the police and tried to flee from the scene. 
Police retaliated and chased the vehicle, which was later intercepted in Killi Khali, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta. A heavy exchange of fire ensued between the police and the suspects, continuing for some time.
As a result, three armed men in the car were killed, while a police constable was injured.

“The suspected armed men were killed in the exchange of fire,” confirmed Deputy Superintendent of Police, Saddar Division, Shoukat Jadoon, adding that the injured constable was shifted to a hospital for treatment. 
The bodies of the three suspects were taken to Bolan Medical College Hospital for medico-legal formalities.
Initial investigation suggested that the suspects were involved in serious criminal activities, including robberies and kidnapping for ransom. “They were in the area with the intent to commit a robbery or another crime,” a senior police officer said.
He said that arms and ammunition were also recovered from the possession of suspects. 
Police have launched an investigation and are conducting raids to arrest other members of the gang. 
Two militants killed
Meanwhile, two alleged militants were killed and another injured in a landmine blast in the Sui area of Dera Bugti district on Saturday.
Officials said that the incident occurred when suspected militants were planting a landmine along the roadside in the Lanjoo-Saghari area of tehsil Sui.
“The landmine exploded while suspects were planting it to target security personnel and other people,” Levies officials said, adding that two of the three suspects were killed on the spot while the third sustained serious injuries.
Security personnel and Levies officials rushed to the site soon after the explosion and shifted the bodies and the injured to the Sui hospital.
The victims have not yet been identified, while Levies have launched an investigation into the incident.

“​The restrictions are effective from Tuesday, October 28, 2025, at 5:01am Pakistan Standard Time (PKT) and will remain in place until Wednesday, October 29, 2025, at 9am PKT,” said a NOTAM (notice to airmen) issued by the PAA today.
​
“This is a routine operational safety matter. The measure is being implemented for ‘operational reasons’ to ensure the continued safety and effective management of air traffic.”
In a separate development, open source tracker Damien Symon, also quoted by Reuters in earlier news reports, said Indian aviation authorities issued a NOTAM a day earlier “possibly for a military exercise/weapons test as India prepares for its Tri-Services Exercise across the border”.
 






The open source tracker stated that India had also issued a NOTAM for a tri-services exercise along its western border with Pakistan from October 30 to November 10, saying the “chosen area and scale of activity are unusual”.
A map he shared showed that the exercise area extends from around the Indian city of Jaisalmer in Rajasthan to the disputed Sir Creek marsh area.
The creek area has been a point of contention for decades between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, and talks on the maritime boundary dispute have remained inconclusive thus far.
 






Indian news outlet Firstpost also reported that NOTAM was for a “large-scale tri-services exercise” along the Pakistan border “amid rising tensions following Operation Sindoor”.
It added that the exercise will involve the three branches of the Indian military and is aimed at demonstrating the country’s “growing joint operational capabilities, self-reliance and innovation”.
It quoted the Indian defence ministry as saying that “troops from Southern Command will actively participate to validate joint operations across diverse and challenging terrains, including offensive manoeuvres in the creek and desert sectors, amphibious operations off the Saurashtra coast, and joint multi-domain operational exercises encompassing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Electronic Warfare (EW), and Cyber capabilities.“
CNBC-TV18 reported that as per officials, the exercise underscores India’s commitment to enhancing interoperability among its armed forces while “strengthening preparedness for future combat scenarios”.
Firstpost reported that Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had visited soldiers in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, on Thursday and claimed Operation Sindoor had “sent a strong warning to Pakistan, which would now ‘think twice before attempting any misadventure against India’”.
 






India Today reported that he had also visited the Bhuj Military Station in Gujarat the same day and warned Pakistan against any action in the disputed Sir Creek area.
“If Pakistan dares to act in the Sir Creek sector, the reply will be so strong that it will change both history and geography,” the outlet quoted him as saying.
We know how to defend every inch of our maritime frontiers: Naval chief
Separately, a press release from the Pakistan Navy said Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf visited forward posts in the creek areas to review operational preparedness and combat readiness.
The naval chief said sea lines of communication (SLOCs) and maritime security were not just a military requirement but a “cornerstone” of the nation’s sovereignty and a “vital pillar” of economic prosperity and stability.
 






He emphasised that the navy PN was the “vanguard of peace and stability” in the Indian Ocean and a “significant stakeholder” in regional maritime security.
“We know how to defend our sovereignty and every inch of our maritime frontiers from Sir Creek to Jiwani,” he added.
He also reaffirmed to the nation that the navy’s defence capabilities stood “as strong as our unwavering morale, from the shores to the sea”.
During the visit, three state-of-the-art 2400 TD Hovercraft were also inducted into the Pak Marines, marking a “significant stride” in modernising the navy’s operational capabilities.
“The newly inducted hovercraft are capable of simultaneously operating over a variety of surfaces, including shallow waters, sand dunes, marshy and boggy littoral zones, and can ply in areas where traditional craft are neither suitable nor designed to operate. This unique capability of undertaking simultaneous operations over land and sea provides an edge to Pak Marines in the performance of their assigned tasks. It will also strengthen PN’s capabilities for an effective and decisive response against all adversaries.
“While addressing officers and men on the occasion, naval chief highlighted that the induction of these new platforms symbolizes PN’s vision to modernise and reaffirm unwavering resolve in bolstering defence of the country’s maritime frontiers, coastal belt particularly the creeks area.”
Pakistan-India tensions
Earlier in the week, United States President Donald Trump stated that he and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a phone call where they talked about having “no wars with Pakistan”.
The US president has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May. India has denied the claim that the US president was responsible for brokering the ceasefire via trade threats. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has praised Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping the two neighbours achieve peace in the region.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties.
India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.
Since then, Indian political and military leadership, including chiefs of the military branches, have continued to make aggressive statements, repeating terrorism allegations that Pakistan has repeatedly refuted and also warning of “geographical changes” in the course of any future conflict.
Singh had also said on May 30 that India would use the firepower of its navy in response to any future aggression by Pakistan, Reuters reported.
The Pakistani military has dismissed the statements as India attempting to “mould history to its liking by inventing outlandish, Bollywood-style scripts” in the aftermath of the May conflict while also issuing warnings of its own that any “imaginary new normal” the Indian leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”.
“In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,“ the military had said earlier in October.</p><small>2025-10-25 18:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2519073025fd8bb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951176/cm-afridi-demands-centre-pay-rs550bn-to-kp-calls-for-immediate-nfc-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi demands Centre pay Rs550bn to KP, calls for immediate NFC meeting</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Saturday claimed the federal government owed the province Rs550 billion, calling for the National Finance Commission (NFC) meeting to be convened immediately.
He made these remarks while addressing a jirga in the province’s Khyber district today. Last week, CM Afridi had called for a grand peace jirga in a bid to discuss avenues for “establishment of peace” in the province.
“After 9/11, Pakistan entered a foreign war without our consent,” CM Afridi said, referring to the attacks of Sept 11, 2001, when deadly plane hijackings claimed almost 3,000 lives.
“It was said that Pakistan needs sacrifices. For Pakistan, we left our houses. Drone strikes and military operations started here,” Afridi said.
“We were made the scapegoats,” he told the crowd. “Our homes, markets, and mosques were destroyed, yet we gave sacrifices for Pakistan.”
 






The chief minister warned against the launching of any new military operation in the province’s tribal districts, saying the people will “not be made into scapegoats again”.
Afridi added that despite the claims of security forces in 2018 that Khyber district and other tribal areas had been cleared [of militants], “preparations are again being made for new military operations”.
The newly elected provincial chief executive said KP stands with the state when it comes to peace, but “under no circumstance will we support collateral damage”.
“If any innocent life is lost this time, there will be accountability,” Afridi said.
He also demanded that any future decisions regarding the region “must include the provincial government and parliamentarians from KP,” rejecting decisions made behind “closed doors”.
PTI leadership meet at CM House
Prior to the jirga, a meeting of PTI’s senior leadership took place at CM House in Peshawar, according to a statement by press secretary to CM Sahibzada Hassan.
Chairman PTI Barrister Gohar, CM Sohail Afridi, PTI Provincial President Junaid Akbar, Asad Qaiser and other leaders participated in the meeting, per the statement. The law and order situation of the province was discussed in detail during the meeting.
 






It was decided to convene a peace jirga in the KP Assembly, with former CMs, governors, scholars, jirga leaders, civil society, lawyers and important personalities to be invited.
“The aim of the peace jirga is to eliminate terrorism and formulate a unified strategy for sustainable peace,” said the statement. “Participants of the meeting paid tribute to the sacrifices of the police.’
“Provincial government stands by the police force,” CM Afridi was quoted as saying. “Providing modern equipment, training and resources to the police is the top priority of the government.”
Rise in terrorist incidents
Pakistan has witnessed a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) personnel.
Earlier this week, Afridi claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.
The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations, which are also resisted by tribal people as they often lead to displacements.
Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan. A military operation looms over the Kurram district, where people have started leaving their homes, while a targeted action is planned in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil.</p><small>2025-10-25 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630499-security-forces-foil-terror-plot-kill-three-terrorists-in-n-waziristan-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces foil terror plot, kill three terrorists in North Waziristan: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>
