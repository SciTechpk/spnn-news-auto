“At 1am this morning, a heavily armed raiding party of ICT police from Secretariat thana (police station) surrounded my home and asked for Imaan and Hadi. They were not there, and we informed them of the same. Cops said they had an FIR (first information report) against them and they should report to the thana. Eventually they left,” she posted on X.
 






In a subsequent post, she referred to a protest at the Islamabad High Court yesterday, where Imaan — who is a lawyer and rights activist — and others had raised slogans in support of judicial independence.
The lawyers had staged a protest on the premises of the IHC to oppose the suspension of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from judicial work.
Isl­a­mabad Bar Council member Ale­­em Abbasi, ex-president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) Riasat Ali and Imaan were prominent among the demonstrators.
However, tensions flared when — after the demonstration — PTI-affiliated lawyers, including Intizar Hussain Panjotha, Naeem Panjotha, and Fatehullah Barki, confronted IHCBA President Wa­­j­id Ali Gilani. Witnesses reported the PTI lawyers pushed Gilani, leading to an altercation, before IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jaja and other lawyers intervened.
 






The IHCBA president, accompanied by the secretary and bar council Vice Chairman Naseer Ahmed Kayani, later condemned the incident and announced that a reference would be sent to the bar council seeking the registration of a terrorism case against the lawyers concerned, as well as the cancellation of their licences.
He alleged that a group of lawyers, including Imaan, physically assaulted him, dragged him, and branded him a traitor. Gilani further claimed that they were armed and pressured him to support demands for filing cases against PTI foun­der Imran Khan, which he refu­sed. Jaja also claimed that the protest had been held without a formal requisition to the bar, in violation of due procedure.
Subsequently, police booked Imaan, Hadi and several PTI-linked lawyers under anti-terror laws.
Referring to the episode, Shireen Mazari posted on X that “all videos of the IHC protest yesterday show clearly the FIR charges are absolutely false. Eye witness accounts reveal the same. But persecution of Imaan and Hadi has become a daily routine by the state.”
 






Imaan, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, recently also approached inquiry committees of the IHC and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against IHC Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar.
The lawyer announced the development on X, saying that she had filed a complaint against the judge before the IHC’s workplace harassment committee and a reference for misconduct before the SJC.
This followed her altercation with Justice Dogar during a hearing earlier this month and his subsequent remarks over the exchange, which Imaan described as “sexist”.
Meanwhile, she and husband Hadi also face charges of alleged anti-state activities on social media.
Imaan was also among the voices calling for a probe into the allegations made by six IHC judges against interference in judicial affairs by the country’s intelligence apparatus in March.
The same month, an Islamabad court had issued arrest warrants for Mazari and Pashtun Tahaffuz Move­ment leaders Ali Wazir and Manzoor Pash­teen due to their repeated failure to appear in a case concerning an alleged anti-state march.</p><small>2025-09-20 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/201046448a15cd9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943398/trumps-100000-fee-for-h-1b-visas-a-tech-industry-favourite-concerns-india' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, a tech industry favourite, concerns India</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Friday ordered an annual $100,000 fee be added to H-1B skilled worker visas, creating potentially major repercussions for the tech industry where such permits are prolific.
The new measure, which could likely face legal challenges, was announced alongside the introduction of a $1 million “gold card“ residency programme that Trump had previewed months earlier.
“The main thing is, we’re going to have great people coming in, and they’re going to be paying,” Trump told reporters as he signed the orders in the Oval Office.
H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills — such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers — to work in the United States, initially for three years, but extendable to six years.
The United States awards 85,000 H-1B visas per year on a lottery system, with India accounting for around three-quarters of the recipients.
Large technology firms rely on Indian workers who either relocate to the United States or come and go between the two countries.
Tech entrepreneurs — including Trump’s former ally Elon Musk — have warned against targeting H-1B visas, saying that the United States does not have enough homegrown talent to fill important tech sector job vacancies.
“All the big companies are on board,” said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who joined Trump in the Oval Office.
Trump has had the H-1B programme in his sights since his first term in office, but faced court challenges to his earlier approach, which targeted the types of jobs that qualify. The current iteration has become the latest move in the major immigration crackdown of his second term.
According to Trump’s order, the fee will be required for those seeking to enter the country beginning Sunday, with the Homeland Security secretary able to exempt individuals, entire companies, or entire industries.
The order expires in a year, though Trump can extend it.
The number of H-1B visa applications has risen sharply in recent years, with a peak in approvals in 2022 under then-president Joe Biden.
In contrast, the peak in rejections was recorded in 2018, during Trump’s first term in the White House.
The United States approved approximately 400,000 H-1B visas in 2024, two-thirds of which were renewals.
Trump also signed an order creating a new expedited pathway to US residency for people who pay $1 million, or for corporate sponsors to pay $2 million.
“I think it’s going to be tremendously successful,” Trump added.
India says visa fee hike could disrupt families
India’s foreign ministry has said that the Trump administration’s move to increase H1-B visa fees was likely to have humanitarian consequences, warning of potential disruptions for families affected by the policy.
 






Meanwhile, India’s leading trade body Nasscom has said the timeline for implementing the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas for high-tech workers in the United States was a “concern”.
“A one-day deadline creates considerable uncertainty for businesses, professionals, and students across the world,” it said in a statement after President Donald Trump announced the fee which comes into force from Sunday.
It added that policy changes of this scale were best “introduced with adequate transition periods, allowing organisations and individuals to plan effectively and minimise disruption.”
India’s oppositon leader Rahul Gandhi shared clippings of previous developments as well as the current one on X to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“I repeated, India has a weak PM,” he wrote.

“There will be seven seats on the board that controls the app in the United States, and six of those seats will be Americans,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.
She said a deal could be signed “in the coming days.”
 


The United States has forcefully sought to take TikTok’s US operations out of the hands of Chinese parent company ByteDance for national security reasons. Under President Donald Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, the US Congress passed a law to force ByteDance to sell its US operations or face a ban on the app.
US policymakers, including in Trump’s first term, have warned that China could use TikTok to mine data from Americans or exert influence on what they see on social media.
But Trump turned to the platform, which is hugely popular with young Americans, to garner support during his ultimately successful 2024 presidential campaign. The Republican president has repeatedly pushed off implementation of the ban while a deal has been sought.
Investors reportedly being eyed to take over the app include Oracle, the tech firm owned by Larry Ellison — one of the world’s richest people — and a major Trump supporter.
Leavitt seemed to confirm Oracle’s participation.
“The data and privacy will be led by one of America’s greatest tech companies, Oracle, and the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well,” she told Fox News. “So all of those details have already been agreed upon. Now we just need this deal to be signed.”
Earlier, China stuck to its stance on the future of TikTok in the United States, a day after  Trump said a deal to switch ownership was progressing.
“China’s position on TikTok is clear: The Chinese government respects the wishes of the enterprise, and welcomes it to carry out commercial negotiations in accordance with market rules to reach a solution compliant with China’s laws and regulations, and strikes a balance of interests,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement, reiterating a position it has maintained over the past week.
Questions remain, including the precise ownership structure of TikTok, how much control China will retain over the app’s inner workings, and what Beijing gets from backing down and letting the US muscle in on one of China’s most successful companies.
Progress over the future of the social media app, which has 170 million US users, is seen as key to unlocking concessions in other areas — from aeroplanes to soybeans — as the world’s two largest economies chart a path beyond their current tariff truce.
“It is hoped that the US side will work towards the same goal as China, earnestly fulfil its corresponding commitments, and provide an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory business environment for the continued operation of Chinese enterprises in the US, including TikTok,” the Commerce Ministry statement added.
Since a framework deal was struck in Madrid earlier this week, Chinese officials and state media have called it a “win-win”, promising to review TikTok’s technology exports and intellectual property licensing.
The framework deal was one hurdle Trump needed to clear to keep TikTok open. The US Congress had originally ordered the app to be shut down for US users by January 2025 if its US assets were not sold by Chinese owner ByteDance.
He Yadong, a spokesperson for China’s Commerce Ministry, reiterated China’s hope that the US reduce the barriers to trade facing Chinese firms, when asked what Beijing had got out of the Madrid deal during a news conference on Thursday.</p><small>2025-09-20 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/201519276c98f0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943421/female-camel-tortured-after-destroying-crops-in-sukkur-handed-over-to-karachi-shelter' target='_blank'><strong>Female camel tortured after ‘destroying crops’ in Sukkur handed over to Karachi shelter</strong></a><br><p>A female camel, tortured allegedly by a landowner in Sukkur, was handed over to a private animal shelter in Karachi on Saturday, officials said.
A first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Sukkur’s Kandhra police station under sections 114 (abettor present), 428 (mischief by killing or maiming animal with value of Rs10 or more), 429 (killing or maiming cattle, etc, of any value), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on the complaint of Ghulam Mustafa.
The incident took place at 2pm yesterday, according to the FIR, wherein three suspects were nominated.
According to the complainant, when his camels were returning after drinking water from a pond on the land, one of the suspects hit one of them with an axe, breaking its leg. Then he dragged the camel with his tractor.
The complainant said he kept pleading with the suspects to spare the camel, but they did not listen.
According to the FIR, the suspects reacted angrily, saying that the camel had destroyed crops.
Sukkur Senior Superintendent of Police Azhar Mughal said while speaking to the media that police had arrested two of the suspects.
This was also confirmed in a post on X by the  Sindh Chief Minister House’s official account. It said that police had so far arrested two suspects and the hunt for a third suspect was under way.
 






The statement also condemned the “the gruesome” attack, adding that the CM had ordered strict action against the culprits.
On the CM Murad Ali Shah’s directive, Sukkur District Council Chairman Syed Kumail Hyder Shah was “supervising” the injured camel’s treatment, it added.
 






Kumail Shah also posted about the incident on X, saying: “Heartbreaking to witness such cruelty against a helpless camel in Rohri.
“I’ve personally spoken to the owner, the wounded camel has been shifted to Karachi for immediate treatment. No animal should ever suffer such cruelty, every life, human or voiceless, deserves compassion and care.”
 






Separately, Sukkur Commissioner Abid Saleem told Dawn.com on the phone that the camel was shifted to Karachi after coordination with a private sector organisation that deals with such cases of injuries.
He said the camel would undergo surgery on its leg, adding that she had also sustained injuries on her jaw.
 
 

Meanwhile, the Comprehensive Disaster Response Services (CDRS) Benji Project for Animal Welfare in Karachi, which had helped another mutilated camel stand back with a prosthetic leg, said earlier today that its veterinary doctors would examine the camel.
“On Friday, September 19, a two-year-old female camel suffered unspeakable abuse in Sukkur. She had wandered onto land in search of water, where the landowner viciously broke her leg and then dragged her with a tractor,” the CDRS project wrote in a post on Instagram.
The organisation said it “immediately began coordinating with the Government of Sindh to rescue her”, adding that it was extremely grateful to Faryal Talpur, Sukkur MPA Awaiz Shah and MPA Sumeta Syed “for their efforts in helping us secure this camel […] and for so vehemently taking action”.
“Once our vets have examined her properly, we will share an update,” CDRS said, affirming that its team will try its “very best to give her love, comfort, and some semblance of peace”.

“There are no words left to explain the cruelty we continue to see. It is unimaginably painful to witness these beautiful, voiceless beings — created in such perfection and innocence — suffering at the hands of humans who were meant to protect them. All we can do is keep standing up for them and take one day at a time,” CDRS wrote.
A statement from CM Shah’s office said the camel was moved to the CDRS shelter and named “Sumi”.
It added that as per the shelter administration, her leg was crushed, jaw was broken, tongue was burnt and there were serious injuries on her body. The chief minister was told that she could not eat and was being administered intravenous fluids.
“On the instructions of the Sindh CM, Livestock Secretary Kazim Jatoi has been entrusted with the responsibility of providing the best treatment for Sumi,” the statement said.
The shelter posted various videos on its Facebook page of the treatment being provided to her.
The recent incident bears similarity to that of Cammie, a camel who had her front leg chopped off allegedly by a landlord in June 2024 as punishment for foraging in his field for fodder. She was taken in by the CDRS Benji Project, where she got her prosthetic leg in July and is still in care.

The new guidelines, laid out in a lengthy memo distributed to reporters on Friday, require them to sign an affidavit promising to comply, or risk losing their media credentials.
The move is the latest by the administration of President Donald Trump to control media coverage of his policies, after he suggested that negative stories could be “illegal.”
The Pentagon “remains committed to transparency to promote accountability and public trust,” the memo says.
But it adds: “Information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorising official before it is released, even if it is unclassified”, effectively barring material sourced to unnamed officials.
This new restriction would apply to both classified and “controlled unclassified information.”
The memo also details sweeping new restrictions on where Pentagon reporters can actually go without official escorts within the military’s vast headquarters just outside Washington.
“The ‘press’ does not run the Pentagon — the people do,” Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. “The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility. Wear a badge and follow the rules — or go home.”
 






The new rules come months after Hegseth faced stark criticism for revealing timings of US air strikes on Yemen’s Houthis in a Signal group chat that inadvertently included a reporter.
Hegseth, a former Fox News co-host and Army National Guard veteran, was also reported to have shared those details in a separate Signal group chain that included his wife.
A spokesperson for The New York Times — a frequent target of Trump’s ire — called the new rules “yet another step in a concerning pattern of reducing access to what the US military is undertaking at taxpayer expense.”
National Press Club President Mike Balsamo hit out at the new rules, and called on the Pentagon to quickly rescind them.
“If the news about our military must first be approved by the government, then the public is no longer getting independent reporting,” Balsamo said in a statement. “It is getting only what officials want them to see. That should alarm every American.”</p><small>2025-09-20 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2017522255a9a9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943435/five-children-among-7-killed-in-punjabs-hafizabad-district-roof-collapse-police' target='_blank'><strong>Five children among 7 killed in Punjab’s Hafizabad district roof collapse: police</strong></a><br><p>Seven people, including five children, died when the roof of a room in a house collapsed in the Farooq Azam neighbourhood of Punjab’s Hafizabad district on Saturday, according to police.
Hafizabad District Police Officer (DPO) Atif Nazir Kadhar said in a statement that a woman and her son were holding tuition classes in the affected house when the room’s roof collapsed. “As a result, the woman, her son and five children who were taking tuition classes died.”
The statement said DPO Kadhar reached the site after receiving information about the incident and oversaw the rescue work.
According to data shared by the Rescue 1122, one child also suffered a critical head injury in the incident.
 


Last month, three members of a family died after the roof of their under-construction house caved-in in the Islampura locality of Nankana Sahib in Punjab.
Earlier in July, two children had died and two other were injured when the roof of a house collapsed in Lahore’s Badami Bagh.

“Pakistan will not be holding their pre-match press conference today,” ACC said in a short statement.
Andy Pycroft will be officiating the match as the referee again after last week’s controversy.
A senior Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official confirmed to Dawn.com that the board had moved on after Pycroft’s ‘apology’ and had no issue with his appointment for the Pakistan-India match.
The Group A clash between the fierce rivals last Sunday ended on a bitter note when Indian players refused to shake hands with their opponents.
It was the first meeting between the regional neighbours since a four-day conflict in May left more than 70 people dead.
While the match itself passed without incident, there was no shaking of hands between the captains at the toss or among the players at the end.
Then, at the post-match ceremony, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav seemingly ‘politicised’ the victory by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country.
PCB called for match referee Andy Pycroft’s immediate removal for a code of conduct “violation” and considered withdrawing from the tournament before going ahead with Wednesday’s match. The board alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Yadav before the match.
Pakistan’s last group game — which they won easily against the United Arab Emirates — was delayed for an hour due to the stand-off before the matter was resolved with Pycroft’s apology.
Indian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for Sunday’s clash.
India won all three of their group games, narrowly edging out a brave Oman by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi on Friday, as well as beating Pakistan by seven and the UAE by nine wickets respectively.
Last Sunday’s match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to boycott the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands, as is customary, at the toss and after the match.
A potential third India-Pakistan showdown looms if both sides qualify for the final on September 28 in Dubai.
India lifted the Asia Cup in its last, 50-over edition and are the favourites to retain the crown.
Pakistan and India advanced to the next stage from Group ‘A’, while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh qualified from Group ‘B’.
Along with regional bragging rights, the Asia Cup serves as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka.</p><small>2025-09-20 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/20192357b4f4eed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943439/pakistan-will-have-to-adapt-to-floods-as-the-new-normal-says-expert' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan will have to adapt to floods as the new normal, says expert</strong></a><br><p>With millions displaced and close to a thousand people dead, the Pakistan floods that have been ongoing since June are worryingly reminiscent of the floods that devastated the country in 2022.
As the country fights to keep its head above the rising floodwaters, many questions abound. Could the damage so far have been contained? How has climate change contributed? Has India’s release of floodwater — which it had warned about — exacerbated the loss and damage of its lower riparian neighbour? Have the floods been down to bad governance, or a lack of preparedness?
To understand these matters, Dialogue Earth spoke to Muhammad Ehsan Leghari, an expert on water resource management and member for the Sindh province at the Pakistani water regulator, the Indus River System Authority. He discussed the factors that have contributed to the unprecedented floods in Pakistan, what has and hasn’t worked for flood control, and how the country can manage future floods effectively. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What are the main natural and human-made factors that cause recurrent floods along the Indus River and its tributaries, particularly the massive inflows in the Punjab rivers?
As the geographer Gilbert F. White noted in 1942, “Floods are ‘acts of God’, but flood losses are largely acts of man”. Human choices in building and managing floodplains can turn natural hazards into disasters. The world, including Pakistan, has been slow to adopt behavioural adjustments alongside engineering, often implementing solutions poorly or unnecessarily.
There are some key factors, generally, regarding the exacerbation of flood impacts. Weak governance turns emergencies into disasters, as seen in recent deaths from floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other parts of Pakistan. Lack of rational spatial or land-use planning exacerbates urban and riverine flooding. Top-down planning ignores real issues and experiences for most Pakistanis. Political and bureaucratic elites prioritise “brick-and-mortar” development that increases flood and hazard impacts.
 


Intense monsoons with 200 to 300mm rainfall that had been forecasted, glacial melt and storms, predicted amid northern heatwaves, are natural factors that caused the floods. But human-made factors cannot be ignored: deforestation increases runoff, and urbanisation and encroachments block natural flows. Similarly, the Ravi Urban Development Authority’s paving of floodplains along the Ravi River in Punjab turned absorbent areas into concrete, inviting devastation by turning them into river paths.
Reports like Pakistan’s 2025 Monsoon Prediction, the National Adaptation Plan and the updated Climate Change Policy highlight reduced river capacity from bridges and encroachments. They’ve urged resilience through wetlands and habitat restoration, but have been ignored.
The 2025 inflows have been a result of exceptional upstream rains, Himalayan melt, and India’s dam releases amid heavy rainfall that overwhelmed Punjab’s flatlands, displacing over 2m people and impacting more 3.6m, with millions more at risk as waters reach Sindh. This exposes systemic issues: encroached plains displace water onto communities, costing billions. Enforced zoning is needed to break the cycle.
How do glacial melt and changing monsoon patterns contribute to flooding in Pakistan?
They drive unpredictability. Accelerated melting in the Himalayan, Hindu Kush and Karakoram mountain ranges due to warming heightens during heatwaves, synchronising with erratic, concentrated rains that overload the Chenab and Sutlej rivers in Punjab. The province faces riverine overflows, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh see flash and urban floods.
With Pakistan contributing to less than one per cent of global emissions, it’s an unjust hit when the country suffers from climate extremes, and in turn, $2 billion in losses. Pakistan will have to adapt to this new normal via basin monitoring, integrating it into development paradigms.
How effective are barrages, embankments and canals in managing floods? Do they worsen downstream flooding?
Controlled systems often increase downstream floods and droughts. Punjab mostly managed its headworks (structures at waterway diversion points) and barrages well during 2025 peaks, ensuring safely passing overflows. But Head Panjnad, a barrage where five rivers converge, faced aggressive flood waves, as forecasts by the Flood Forecasting Division had forewarned us. Punjab has rehabilitated most of its barrages; Sindh is upgrading its Guddu and Sukkur barrages.
However, these hydraulic structures can cause bottlenecks, blocking river paths and causing breaches, shifting burdens without adequate warning. Our infrastructure is old and inadequate, fostering a false sense of security for nearby developments. The solution is to shift strategy: live with floods, remove bottlenecks, let rivers flow and nourish floodplains. In addition, we must combine nature-based solutions — such as restoring floodplains — and controlling overflows with modern technology like automated barrage gates and AI forecasting.
What role does silt and sediment buildup in rivers and barrages play in increasing flood risks?
It raises riverbeds. Sediment buildup has elevated the River Indus riverbed, reducing the river’s flood handling capacity by 17.75pc. Research has shown that over a 24-year period, this issue, combined with diminished water flow, has decreased the river’s capacity to manage high water levels by nearly half. Without management, sediment buildup causes spills, erosion, breaches and waterlogging.
It’s a cyclical issue: earlier deforestation upstream caused more soil to wash into the river, and the continued failure to manage this sediment has made recent floods, such as those in 2025, much worse, costing billions and impacting thousands of people. We need basin-wide sediment strategies such as integrated watershed management for the Indus, involving India and Afghanistan.
How is climate change expected to alter the intensity and frequency of floods in the Indus River basin over the next 20–30 years?
Climate change will increase the intensity and frequency of floods in the basin over the next few decades. This will mainly be caused by more intense monsoon rains, surging glacier melt and rising sea levels that block drainage in Sindh. It will lead to a new normal of more severe flooding, such as that seen in the 2010, 2022 and 2025 events. That means increased losses and vulnerability, with models predicting even more economic and human damage. Research from the World Weather Attribution supports the overall trend of rising flood vulnerability.
To counter this, a combination of nature-based solutions like restoring wetlands to help absorb floodwaters and engineering solutions are needed, along with improved governance across the entire river basin.
Which groups or regions in Punjab have been most vulnerable to floods, and what local strategies could reduce their risk?
In my opinion, with around 4m people affected, the low-lying districts along the Sutlej, Chenab, Ravi and Indus rivers, especially Multan, Jhang, Layyah, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Bahawalnagar, have borne the brunt of recent floods. Urban risk zones include cities like Sialkot, Rawalpindi, Chakwal and Lahore; they face serious flood threats due to drainage and planning challenges.
If we seriously want to safeguard these regions, several measures will have to be taken, such as rebuilding and maintaining concrete embankments, in addition to offering seasonal relocation incentives for local people, deploying mobile and veterinary health units, and mobilising elder-led evacuation plans that draw on ancestral knowledge. Also, empowering communities through bridging skills gaps [in disaster preparedness] can lower risks drastically.
Are flood warning systems in Pakistan good enough, and if not, how can they be improved?
While flood warning systems have gotten better since 2010, they still need improvement. There is a definite lack of preparedness. Currently, one of the main problems is poor communication. Warnings don’t always reach rural areas, and sometimes they aren’t broadcast in local languages or communication channels. We also have accuracy issues: the information is not always reliable or delivered in real time. This is occasionally made worse by a lack of shared data between countries, as seen in the 2025 events involving India, particularly the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty in April.
To improve these systems, we need to take steps such as using 24/7 monitoring and expanding communication through community radio and text message alerts, and ensure better coordination between all groups involved, especially at the community level. Most importantly, we need to shift from a top-down, reactive approach, to a bottom-up, community-driven one that empowers local people, especially the most vulnerable.
Did India release water that caused Punjab’s floods, and if so, was Pakistan warned?
India released excess dam water — including from the Bhakra dam upstream of Pakistan’s Punjab province — worsening monsoon surges. Under the Indus Water Treaty, India should have restored effective communications mechanisms. Pakistan implies that India may have used water as a weapon; however, warnings came earlier through diplomatic channels — the first since the Indus Waters Treaty suspension — on humanitarian grounds.
What should Pakistan prioritise in order to mitigate floods?
Pakistan should prioritise rainwater harvesting, urban water reuse, developing green building codes, restoring its wetlands and floodplains, watershed management and forestation, which together can cut flood peaks by 10-20pc. A 2023 Dutch white paper also stresses integrated resilience through three methods: water “reuse” (spreading so as to recharge groundwater) and “retention/reduction” (via cross-drainage and flood channels), as well as the concept of “removing”, or making space for the river through bridge redesign and bund removals, rather than resort to mega-dam projects.
Dams are not the solution. They bring high costs, ecological damage, displacement, and can even worsen floods. We saw this in 2025, when water was released from India’s full dams on the Ravi and Sutlej rivers into encroached plains, and the part of the Chenab river without dams surged to 1m cusecs (cubic flow per second). Dams are widely seen as anti-poor, anti-environment and unjust.
Which province has suffered the most in the floods of 2025?
Nationwide, since late-June, there have been over 900 monsoon-related deaths, and as of September 11, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has had the most fatalities (504) from flash floods, landslides and cloudbursts. From August 14 to 16, cloudbursts triggered flash floods in the province. Buner, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was worst hit, with at least 380 deaths. Shangla, Swat and Swabi, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saw similar destruction. Intense rain, deforestation, valley blockages and unregulated construction turned debris deadly, showing an urgent need for mountain-area planning and regulation.
Punjab faces the biggest infrastructure and agricultural losses. Sindh has suffered the longest inundation and displacement due to its flat [and poorly draining] terrain. The terrain drives impacts; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s slopes are deadly, while Punjab and Sindh bear economic and geographically spread-out damage [due to being relatively flat]. The whole country is in need of multidimensional recovery.
What are the risks to Sindh, as the lower riparian province?
Sindh’s lower riparian status exposes it to unmanaged upstream floods. But despite that, it lacks input on water releases or land use. In the province, rains amplify to become disasters due to its flat terrain with no flood escape routes, forcing river flows to reclaim floodplains through devastating breaches and prolonged inundation.
What are the biggest governance or policy gaps preventing effective flood management in Pakistan?
The main obstacle is weak governance. More than 400 flood path obstructions were identified in 2011 in a government report I worked on, which mapped over 350 coordinates. Flood responses are often fragmented and reactive, while agencies like the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and its provincial counterparts remain disconnected from communities.
Irrigation departments are under-resourced and politicised, and the 10-year Flood Plan IV has stalled. Spatial planning rules are poorly enforced, and elite development projects by the Ravi Urban Development Authority tend to overshadow public safety. Mandates remain unclear, with overlapping institutions and unresolved inter-provincial disputes. To move forward, Pakistan needs clearly defined roles — who is responsible, when, how and at what cost.

The Group A clash between the fierce rivals last Sunday ended on a bitter note when Indian players refused to shake hands with their opponents.
It was the first meeting between the regional neighbours since a four-day conflict in May left more than 70 people dead.
While the match itself passed without incident, there was no shaking of hands between the captains at the toss or among the players at the end.
Then, at the post-match ceremony, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav seemingly ‘politicised’ the victory by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) called for match referee Andy Pycroft’s immediate removal for a code of conduct “violation” and considered withdrawing from the tournament before going ahead with Wednesday’s match. The board alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Yadav before the match.
Yadav changed the subject when asked about the handshake issue and Pycroft’s presence, saying, “It will be a good contest between the ball and the bat”.
He added: “Close your room, switch off your phone and sleep. I think that’s the best thing to shut the noise. It’s easy to say, but sometimes it is difficult.”
 
 

The matter was settled after the PCB said ahead of yesterday’s match that Pycroft had apologised to the manager and captain of the Green Shirts over a controversy during the recent Pakistan-India match.
Pakistan’s last group game — which they won easily against the United Arab Emirates — was delayed for an hour due to the stand-off before the matter was resolved with Pycroft’s apology.
Pycroft remained the match referee for Wednesday’s game and is still scheduled to officiate on Sunday.
Indian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for Sunday’s clash.
India won all three of their group games, narrowly edging out a brave Oman by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi on Friday, as well as beating Pakistan by seven and the UAE by nine wickets respectively.
Suryakumar praised minnows Oman, appearing in the Asia Cup for the first time, for putting up a good fight.
“I feel they played a good brand of cricket,” he said of a team who ended on 167-4 in reply to India’s 188-8.
“They batted very well, but we also managed to give a good outing to our players.”
Last Sunday’s match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to ‘boycott’ the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands, as is customary, at the toss and after the match.
A potential third India-Pakistan showdown looms if both sides qualify for the final on September 28 in Dubai.
India lifted the Asia Cup in its last, 50-over edition and are the favourites to retain the crown.
India and Pakistan advanced to the next stage from Group A, while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh qualified from Group B.
Along with regional bragging rights, the Asia Cup serves as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka.</p><small>2025-09-20 13:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/201549284bf017e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943407/judiciary-under-siege-rule-of-law-or-rule-of-men' target='_blank'><strong>Judiciary under siege: Rule of law or rule of men?</strong></a><br><p>History has a strange way of rhyming. Sometimes it repeats as farce, sometimes as tragedy — and sometimes, in Pakistan, it comes back wearing the same last name.
The last time a Justice Dogar was in the news, the country was under military rule. When Musharraf imposed an emergency in November 2007, Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar took oath under a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) and validated his actions. After the judiciary was restored, contempt proceedings were initiated against Justice Dogar for endorsing the dictator’s actions and violating an order of the court. In Abdul Hameed Dogar vs Federation (2011), Justice Dogar claimed that his actions were, “under confusion, misconception and misunderstanding” He pleaded that he was “really sorry”. Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar, who had supported a military dictator, was ultimately required to place himself at the mercy of the post-restoration judiciary.
Nearly a decade later, the judiciary faces another crisis. This time, with Justice Sarfraz Dogar at the centre. On September 16, an Islamabad High Court (IHC) bench led by Justice Dogar restrained his fellow judge, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, from holding court and performing judicial functions. For context, Justice Jahangiri is a signatory to the six judges’ letter alleging executive interference in the judiciary, and was one of the petitioners challenging Justice Dogar’s transfer to the IHC.
Yesterday, five brave judges of the IHC fought back. The judges approached the highest court pleading that this was “a desperate measure of the last resort”, and that “there hangs a big question mark over whether we are being governed by rule of law or rule of men”. There is a powerful visual of the five judges entering the Supreme Court (SC) for justice. Justice Jahangiri appealed Justice Dogar’s order restraining him from holding court. The other judges challenged various administrative decisions taken by Justice Dogar, and questioned the ability of one High Court judge to restrain another from exercising judicial functions.
It bears mentioning that the present situation would not have been possible without the consent of the Chief Justice Yahya Afridi. It was CJP Afridi who gave his consent for the transfer of judges from other provinces to the IHC. There is, however, still time to reverse part of the damage that has been caused and stop further erosion of judicial independence.
Sidelining independent judges
When General Yahya Khan sought to restrain a judge from exercising judicial functions, the President’s Order No. 27 of 1970 was passed. As per Yahya Khan’s law, if the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) was inquiring into the conduct of a judge, the president could require the judge to go on leave.
When the Supreme Court was hearing Chaudhary Iftikhar’s case, it held: “Even General Yahya Khan, as the President and the Chief Martial Law Administrator of the country never claimed any divine rights in the matter of suspending a Superior Court Judge or in the matter of restraining him from exercising his judicial powers and enacted a law for the purpose … whether it was during the constitutional and the democratic rule or whether it was during the days when martial law stood clamped in the country and the Constitution stood abrogated, the executive, including the head of the state never asserted any inherent powers to suspend judges or to send them on forced leave or even to restrain them from acting as such judges. Even during the martial law regimes when no constitutional security existed for the Judges guaranteeing them their tenure in office, the Presidents/the Chief Martial Law Administrators made specific legislative provisions for such a purpose.”
The law was eventually struck down.
Crucially, the SC, in Chaudhary Iftikhar’s case, went so far as to hold that a judge cannot be restrained from judicial work. Per this case, even the SJC did not have the power to order a judge to go on “leave”; the SJC can only render a report to the president that a judge be removed from office. The court ruled that even a temporary bar on a judge in the matter of discharging his constitutional duties amounts to removal, which is not permissible.
The order by Justice Dogar “restraining” Justice Jahangiri from holding court cites no legal provision in its support; he does not even attempt to explain the legal basis on which one high court judge could prevent another from exercising judicial functions, even on an interim basis. This is because there is no such authority. General Yahya Khan passed a law to shield his unconstitutional actions. Justice Dogar’s order mentions no law or authority.
The five IHC judges assert that the judges are being punished for decisions that members of the executive found disagreeable. When Justice Jahangiri was appointed head of the election tribunal for Islamabad constituencies, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) sought to replace him with a retired judge. Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani has been passing orders against the executive in cases of enforced disappearances. Justice Babar Sattar’s ruling that ordered the removal of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Chairman was suspended the very next day by a divisional bench. He was also prevented from proceeding in a case where he held that there is a mass surveillance system capable of monitoring millions of citizens.
Courageous decisions are being suspended, independent judges are being sidelined, and judicial independence itself is under siege.
Criminalising opposition
Lawyers at the IHC staged a protest on Friday against Justice Dogar’s actions. In the aftermath, Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) President Wajid Gilani registered an FIR against several lawyers. Instead of resisting executive interference in the judiciary, the IHCBA president chose to target lawyers who were standing up for judicial independence. The FIR includes provisions from anti-terrorism laws. This case joins the long list of cases in our regrettable history where terrorism laws have been misused to stifle opposition. The videos of the protest are widely available online for all to see what is being labelled as ‘terrorism’.
An independent bar association is vital to safeguard the judiciary from external pressures and to provide a collective voice for the legal community. A compromised bar association, on the other hand, enables and emboldens the executive. 
Under this president, the IHCBA withdrew its support for the five judges who had challenged Justice Dogar’s transfer and seniority. In another remarkable press conference, the IHCBA president expressed his support and welcomed a 27th amendment to the Constitution; an amendment that has still not been made public was being eagerly supported. To date, the IHCBA has issued no statement condemning Justice Dogar’s recent actions. In this silence, and in the positions it has chosen instead, the association has revealed exactly where it stands.
The office of the President of the Bar carries trust, responsibility, and the duty to represent and defend the legal fraternity. By initiating criminal proceedings against fellow lawyers, those very values have been betrayed.
Approaching the Supreme Court
As the judiciary faces a moment of crisis, it falls to the SC and the chief justice to determine their course.
The independence of the courts is not an abstract principle — it is the foundation of every citizen’s right to justice. When that independence is undermined, so too is the protection of constitutional rights. An attack on independent judges is an attack on the very access to justice.
The time to act was when the 26th Amendment was passed. The Supreme Court did not. As we approach a year to the date the 26th Amendment was passed, the credibility of the judiciary has suffered considerably, and the destruction of judicial independence is evident. If the SC and the chief justice are to preserve what remains of institutional integrity, continued inaction can no longer be an option.</p><small>2025-09-20 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/20125752b4e5265.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943409/islamabad-court-indicts-accused-in-teenage-social-media-influencer-sana-yousafs-murder-case' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court indicts accused in teenage social media influencer Sana Yousaf’s murder case</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad court indicted accused Umar Hayat in the murder case of 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf on Saturday.
The accused pled not guilty to murdering Yousaf, who was shot dead at her house in June.
During the hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Mohammad Afzal Majoka enquired whether Hayat had killed Sana.
“I did not commit any such crime,” the accused replied.
The judge then asked him whether he was falsely accused in the case.
“Is this all a lie?” the judge remarked. He also pointed out that Hayat had also been accused of snatching Yousaf’s mobile phone.
At that, the accused maintained that all allegations levelled against him were “based on falsehood”.
The court then adjourned the hearing until September 25.
Islamabad police had arrested Hayat on June 3, a day after Yousaf was killed at her house in Islamabad.
Preceding his arrest, a first information report (FIR) of the murder was registered at Islamabad’s Sumbal police station against an unidentified man on the complaint of Sana’s mother, Farzana Yousaf, invoking Section 302 (intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
In the FIR, Yousaf’s mother said that a man with a pistol in his hand had entered their house suddenly at around 5pm and “shot straight at my daughter with the intention to kill”.
Later, Islamabad Inspector General (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi had said during a press conference the police had arrested a suspect, who was a was a 22-year-old man, from Faisalabad.
He said Hayat had tried to contact Yousaf repeatedly and was being “rejected by her again and again”, adding that the accused had taken Yousaf’s mobile phone in a bid to wipe out the evidence but it had been recovered along with the weapon of offence.
On July 25, police had formally submitted the challan against Hayat to the prosecution branch of the district and sessions courts. It also included Hayat’s confessional statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
In his statement, Hayat — son of a retired government official and a TikToker himself — said he had developed a one-sided infatuation with Sana after connecting with her through social media. He had confessed that suspicion and jealousy drove him to kill her.
 
 

Hayat revealed that he had travelled from Jaranwala to Islamabad on May 28 to wish Sana on her birthday. When she did not meet him, he became convinced she was deliberately avoiding him, he said, adding that On June 2, he returned to the capital after renting a Toyota Fortuner and carrying a 30-bore pistol, intending to confront her.
According to his account, when Sana did not respond to his repeated calls, he went to her home in G-13 sector of the capital, forced his way inside, and fatally shot her in front of her mother and maternal aunt. He then took Sana’s mobile phone to erase their conversations and fled.
Hayat said he directed the driver to drive fast and later hid the murder weapon near a railway bridge before returning to Jaranwala.
 


Following the last hearing of the case on September 13, Dawn reported that Hayat had expressed remorse for his actions, telling the magistrate that he felt deeply ashamed for having taken the life of an innocent teenage girl.
“I feel deeply ashamed for committing such a cruel act,” he had reportedly said, adding that his confession was voluntary and not made under pressure.</p><small>2025-09-20 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624676-karachi-child-abuse-suspect-confesses-before-magistrate' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi child abuse suspect confesses before magistrate</strong></a><br><p>

Collins Aerospace, which provides systems for several airlines at airports globally, is experiencing a technical issue that may cause delays for departing passengers, Heathrow Airport said, having warned of delays.
Brussels Airport and Berlin Airport were also affected by the attack, they said in separate statements.
RTX, Collins Aerospace’s parent company, said it had become aware of a “cyber-related disruption” to its software at selected airports, without naming them.
Electronic check-in affected
“The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations,” RTX said in an e-mailed statement, adding that it was working to fix the issue as quickly as possible.
The attack has rendered automated systems inoperable, allowing only manual check-in and boarding procedures, Brussels Airport said on its website, adding the incident had occurred on Friday night.
“This has a large impact on the flight schedule and will unfortunately cause delays and cancellations of flights…The service provider is actively working on the issue and trying to resolve the problem as quickly as possible.”
Passengers with a flight scheduled for Saturday were advised by the affected airports to confirm their travel with airlines before heading to the airport.
Frankfurt Airport not impacted
“Due to a technical issue at a system provider … there are longer waiting times at check-in. We are working on a quick solution,” Berlin Airport said in a banner on its website.
Frankfurt Airport, Germany’s largest, was not affected, a spokesperson said. An official from the operations control centre at Zurich Airport also said it had not been impacted.
EasyJet, among Europe’s biggest airlines, said it was currently operating as normal and did not expect the issue to impact its flights for the rest of the day.
Other major airlines Ryanair and British Airways owner IAG did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
There were no indications of threats to Polish airports, Deputy Prime Minister and Digital Affairs Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said.</p><small>2025-09-20 10:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/201517418a8ce64.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943423/ukraine-president-zelensky-says-will-meet-trump-next-week-as-russia-intensifies-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine President Zelensky says will meet Trump next week as Russia intensifies attacks</strong></a><br><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would meet US counterpart Donald Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly next week as Russia intensified attacks across his country.
Russia carried out one of its largest aerial attacks overnight, firing 40 missiles and some 580 drones at Ukraine in a barrage that killed at least three people and wounded dozens, Zelensky said on Saturday.
Zelensky said he would hold “a meeting with the President of the United States”, adding he would discuss security guarantees for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia during the talks with Trump.
Ukraine has insisted on Western-backed security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks. Russian President Vladimir Putin has meanwhile warned that any Western troops in Ukraine would be unacceptable and legitimate targets.
A US-led push for a quick end to the war has stalled and Russia effectively ruled out a meeting between Putin and Zelensky — something that Kyiv says is the only way towards peace.
“We expect sanctions if there is no meeting between the leaders or, for example, no ceasefire,” Zelensky said in comments released by the Ukrainian presidency on Saturday.
“We are ready for a meeting with Putin. I have spoken about this. Both bilateral and trilateral. He is not ready,” Zelensky added.
In Russia’s latest aerial assault of Ukraine, “a missile with cluster munitions directly struck an apartment building” in the central city of Dnipro, Zelensky said earlier on social media.
He posted pictures of cars and a building on fire and rescuers carrying a person to safety amid rubble scattered nearby.
In the Dnipropetrovsk region, the strikes killed one person and wounded 26, with one man in a serious condition, Sergiy Lysak, the head of regional military administration, said.
‘Intense’ fighting
The strikes come a day after three Russian fighter jets violated the airspace of Estonia — a Nato member on the alliance’s eastern flank — an allegation Moscow denied.
But it triggered fears in the West of a dangerous new provocation from Moscow after Poland last week complained that around 20 Russian drones overflew its territory.
Zelensky repeated the call for “joint solutions” to shoot down drones over Ukraine “together with other countries”.
Russia, which has been chipping away at Ukrainian territory for months, announced on Saturday its troops had captured the village of Berezove in the Dnipropetrovsk region.
In the northeastern Kharkiv region, “intense actions” were ongoing in the key area of Kupiansk, Zelensky said, referring to a rail hub Ukraine recaptured in its 2022 offensive.
Russian officials meanwhile said their forces had repelled “massive” Ukrainian attacks in the Volgograd and Rostov regions, while one person was wounded in the nearby region of Saratov.
The governor of Russia’s Samara region said “fuel and energy facilities” were targeted, without specifying the damage.
The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday its air defence alert systems “intercepted and destroyed” 149 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 27 over the Saratov region and 15 over the Samara region.
Three rounds of direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul have failed to yield anything more than large-scale prisoner exchanges.
Russia has maintained a series of hardline demands, including that Ukraine fully cedes the eastern Donbas region — parts of which it still controls.
Kyiv has rejected territorial concessions and wants European troops to be deployed to Ukraine as a peacekeeping force, something Moscow sees as unacceptable.</p><small>2025-09-20 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624669-jaffar-express-attack-mastermind-killed-in-afghanistan-say-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Jaffar Express attack mastermind killed in Afghanistan, say sources</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return flight to Washington, Trump branded Khan as “one of the worst mayors in the world”, accusing him of failing on crime and immigration.
“I asked that he not be there. He wanted to be there, as I understand. I didn’t want him,” the president said.
The mayor did not attend the banquet and was not expecting an invitation, according to British media.
A source close to Sadiq Khan dismissed Mr Trump’s remarks, saying his “politics is one of fear and division”. He claimed London remains “a global success story” that attracts record numbers of Americans.

The announcement was made during a large public gathering held by the Swat Qaumi Jirga at Matta Chowk here under the slogan Swat Aman Pasoon (Swat Peace March).
Speakers included MNA Dr Amjad Ali, Swat City Mayor Shahid Ali Khan and elders Rahmat Ali Khan, Sher Badar Khan, Bahadar Sher Afghan, Ayoub Asharey, Sher Shah Khan and Mukhtar Yousafzai, Provincial minister Fazal Hakim Khan Yousafzai, PTI MNA Dr Amjad Ali Khan, MPAs Ali Shah Khan, Sultan Rom Khan and Mohammad Naeem Khan, and chairman of the Kabal tehsil council Saeed Khan were also in attendance.
Thousands of people from all walks of life showed up, filling the adjoining roads of Matta Chowk. Many participants climbed rooftops to listen to the speeches due to a lack of space. Scores of women and children also attended the march.

Warn they’ll challenge terrorists if govt fails to oust them

The speakers emphasised that today’s Swat was no longer a place where terrorists could find refuge.
They said they knew who brought terrorists to the mountains of Swat. They asked the terrorists to leave the valley to prevent a stern action by residents. The speakers pointed out that Swat had more than 7,000 policemen equipped with modern weapons but they are not authorised to launch operations against terrorists.
They said the Matta gathering should be taken as a “referendum against terrorism” as thousands of residents voted against violence.
The jirga leaders described terrorism in Bajaur and southern districts “artificial” and rejected by the people. They demanded lasting peace across the province, reminding the state that it was responsible under the Constitution to protect every citizen.
The Aman Pasoon gave the provincial government and police a one-month ultimatum to take decisive action against terrorists and warned that if no operation was launched within that period, protest rallies would be staged across Swat not only against terrorism but against the provincial government and police as well.
Leaders and office-bearers of political parties and organisations, including Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), joined the peace march.
According to local peace activists, the Aman Pasoon gathering at Matta Chowk was unprecedented in the region’s history. In 2022, when terrorists re-emerged in Swat’s mountainous areas, the Swat Olasi Pasoon staged a historic rally at Nishat Chowk.
Two years later, the Swat Qaumi Jirga’s peace march at the same venue was even bigger.

Pace spearhead Cummins has been ruled out of the October white-ball series against New Zealand and India with “lumbar bone stress”.
The 32-year-old has not bowled since the Test tour of the West Indies in June-July and no firm date has been set for his return. Cummins said on Friday that although he hopes to be part of the Ashes, he would need to “wait and see”.
“There are no hard and fast plans yet,” the skipper told reporters. “I’m still doing a bit of gym and keeping things kicking over, but with this kind of injury, it’s rest and then we’ll build back and kind of work back from the Ashes,” he said.
“Still really hopeful to be able to be part of the Ashes. But it is a little bit of a wait-and-see.”
Cummins told reporters he aimed to play in all five Tests, but conceded a decision would have to be made closer to the time.
“It’s honestly too far out to say. But the aim at the moment is to try and be ready for all of it,” he said.
Cummins has suffered serious back issues several times over the years, including a flare-up in 2018 that kept him out of action for a full off-season.
Australia coach Andrew McDonald said this week he was confident Cummings would play a key part in the Ashes.
But he acknowledged to SEN radio that the uncertainty around Cummins “is not ideal”, but it was an  “overreaction” to say the skipper would not play.
“It’s not ideal. I’m not going to sit here and say that it’s ideal,” McDonald told the radio station. The first Ashes Test against England in Perth starts on November 21.
Australia retained the Ashes in England in 2023 after the series ended in a 2-2 draw. They enjoyed a 4-0 sweep of England at home in 2021-22. Cummins was the leading wicket-taker with 21 scalps at an average of 18.

Rai Benjamin’s win in the men’s 400m hurdles — adding the world title to the Olympic gold he won last year — made it a special night for track and field powerhouse United States.
It threatened for a short time to be spoiled as Benjamin was disqualified before being reinstated after an appeal.
Donning a crown handed to him and having selfies taken with the crowd, it took several minutes before an official informed him he had initially lost his gold.
Fortunately, all those celebratory photos that spectators had taken with him can now be put on the mantlepiece, as Benjamin was reinstated.
“We were sitting down near the elimination chairs, ironically, and [Alison] dos Santos [who won silver] said the referees are reviewing the race, and that it was about me being disqualified,” the 28-year-old said. “It was all fine in the end. I know my mum is at home watching, this medal is for her.”
Lyles had to battle to get his head in front, but the showman with the dyed-blond locks managed it handsomely and secured a fourth successive 200m crown to emulate Usain Bolt.
For the 28-year-old, who raised his arms to the heavens and then let out a mighty roar when his name was announced before the start, his feelings were the polar opposite to how he felt after winning Olympic bronze in Tokyo in 2021.
“At that time I was depressed, but this time I am energised,” said Lyles, who went over and hugged his mum, Keisha Caine Bishop. “My face is blasted all over Tokyo. This is amazing and such a joyous moment, I am going to keep with me forever.”
In contrast, 100m champion Jefferson-Wooden coasted to victory, becoming the first double champion since another Jamaican sprint icon, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, in Moscow in 2013.
“I am now looking forward to the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics,” the 24-year-old said. “I definitely put a target on my back.”
The women’s 400m hurdles race lacked the drama of the men’s — it was already without its superstar Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, who had instead swept to an imperious victory in the flat 400m on Thursday — with Femke Bol of the Netherlands retaining the title.
Bol can only beat what is in front of her and she did that with aplomb.
“This means the world to me,” said the 25-year-old. “At these world championships, I had to keep my title. I am proud of myself and my team for doing it.”
If anything, the most drama occurred in a sandpit involving a hop, skip and a jump — the men’s triple jump final.
Italy’s Andrea Dallavalle livened up a competition that had not really caught fire by snatching the lead with his sixth and final effort — a personal best of 17.64m.
However, Portugal’s long-time leader Pedro Pichardo reacted in the best possible way and with the last jump of the final, 17.91m, he regained the lead and won gold — in the same stadium where he won the Olympic title four years ago.
Four years ago, Norway were on a crest of an Olympic wave in track and field as Karsten Warholm and Jakob Ingebrigtsen won gold.
Warholm broke the 400m hurdles world record that scorching hot day in Tokyo, and his celebration was one of the iconic moments of those Games.
On Friday, he was far from his best, hitting the third hurdle, and slumped to the ground at the finish, putting his hand to his face.
Ingebrigtsen won the 1,500m Olympic title in 2021, but only sneaked into Sunday’s 5,000m final by the skin of his teeth on Friday.
“I am not myself,” he said.  “I don’t have any idea what I am going to do in the final. I will try my best. Can it be a medal for Norway? I don’t know, maybe. We will see.”

The IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in October 2023 for recognising regional Olympic councils for Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, saying the move had violated the Olympic Charter.
“We also spoke about the Independent Neutral Athletes (AINs). This will be nothing new,” IOC President Kirsty Coventry told a press conference.  “The executive board will take the exact same approach that was done in Paris (2024 Olympics). Nothing has changed.”
Russian and Belarusian athletes who reach qualifying times will be first vetted for any links to the Russian military or support of the war in Ukraine, both of which will exclude them.
Russian teams are banned from the Games. Belarus has acted as a staging ground for the invasion of Ukraine.
A small number of individual Russian and Belarusian athletes were allowed to take part as AINs in the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics after first passing rigorous vetting by the IOC. They competed without the Russian or Belarusian flag and anthem. Instead, they took part as neutral athletes.
It remains to be seen how winter sports federations will respond to the IOC’s decision.
Some have maintained a total ban on Russians. These include the International Ski Federation (FIS), whose disciplines account for more than half of the podium places at the Winter Olympics.
The International Biathlon Union (IBU) is taking the same line, as is the International Luge Federation (FIL), which conducted an anonymous survey among its athletes revealing  “their concerns about safety, Olympic quotas, compliance with anti-doping regulations and fairness” in the event of a Russian return.
The organisation governing skating, the ISU has opened a narrow path to Olympic qualification, allowing one competitor from each of the two nations in each category, but no entries in relays or team events.

According to police spokesperson Zeeshan Randhawa, the police were continuously chasing the dacoits after they kidnapped several people from the motorway a few days ago. He said that after a tip-off, action was taken against the kidnappers and all of the hostages were safely recovered.
As per details, on the night between Sept 4 and Sept 5, the Katcha area dacoits kidnapped 11 people from different vehicles on the Sukkur-Multan Motorway near Nawazabad in Sadiqabad tehsil. The bandits fired at vehicles on the motorway between 1 and 2am to force them to stop at the Azampur Rest Area and the Guddu Interchange.
In the attack, crew of a passenger bus was reportedly injured and shifted to the emergency ward of the Sheikh Zayed Medical College Hospital (SZMCH) in Rahim Yar Khan. Traffic also remained suspended on the motorway for more than four hours, before it was finally restored at dawn.

Incident happened after police operation near Punjab-Sindh border and Indhar gang threatened retribution

South Punjab Additi­onal Inspector General (IG) Kamran Khan told Dawn that between 20 and 25 suspects attacked vehicles on the motorway. “Three people were injured, two of whom suffered minor injuries, so they were discharged. One remains admitted at the hospital with gunshot wounds to the waist and leg,” he said.
SZMCH spokesperson Rana Ilyas Ahmed confirmed to Dawn that three injured were admitted to the facility and one was receiving treatment for a gunshot wound to the leg. The injured were aboard the same coach and hailed from Sheikhupura, he said.
The motorway incident came amid a police operation against the Katcha criminals in which the police used drones in Ronti near the Punjab-Sindh border. The police had destroyed the hideouts of Katcha criminals during the operation.
On the same day, Indhar gang leader Tanvir alias Dodu Indhar threatened the police with retribution. Later on September 8, Dodu Indhar claimed responsibility of the kidnapping. He also claimed that police had killed a person of his tribe after he was released from jail.
He claimed the police was planning a same fate for his brother who would be released in a few months. In another video showing nine of the hostages standing in the floodwater, he claimed that they had killed two of the passengers and demanded the release of his brother. However, all 11 passengers had been recovered alive during the operation.
It is pertinent to mention here that Katcha criminals have kidnapped 72 people so far this year. This is not the first time that the M-5 motorway was targeted by the criminals and after several incidents, the police started escorting vehicles in convoys.

The accused was presented before a court, which granted four days’ physical remand on Friday for further investigation.
The remand was approved on the police’s request after the court expressed satisfaction that more inquiry was required in the sensitive case.
A police spokesman said a shroud was found near the grave of the girl in the last week of August. Following the discovery, Dhamial police launched an investigation and arrested the suspect accused of desecrating the grave. According to initial findings, the suspect dug up the grave for witchcraft purposes and then attempted to cover it again.
Police immediately responded to the information and had the grave exhumed. No direct evidence of desecration of the body was initially observed. However, forensic reports are awaited for a conclusive determination. Samples were collected during the exhumation, the spokesman added.
The arrest posed a challenge, for which special teams were formed. Police said they worked tirelessly using technical and human intelligence to trace the suspect. Once forensic reports are received, the accused will be charged with solid evidence, and all legal formalities will be completed to ensure punishment for the crime.
A medical board, accompanied by a judicial magistrate, conducted the exhumation of the girl’s grave in Girja Road graveyard. The girl had been buried three days earlier. Samples from her body were collected for DNA and forensic analysis.
Police confirmed that no signs of violence or injuries were found on the body. Nevertheless, a case was registered for desecration of the grave and tampering with the remains.
Zafar Iqbal, father of the girl, lodged the initial complaint. He stated that his daughter died on August 26.
When he visited the grave the following morning for fateha, he found the grave disturbed and the shroud lying in a nearby mansion.
Upon receiving the report, City Police Officer Khalid Hamdani ordered legal action, considering all aspects of the case. Police later sought court approval for exhumation and the appointment of a medical board to establish facts without disturbing the grave unnecessarily.
When exhumation began, the girl’s head and parts of her body became visible, as though the soil had been filled hastily. Her lower torso remained under stone slabs, and the body was without a shroud. According to sources, decomposition had already begun as the body had been buried for three days. Samples were collected before the body was reburied.
A senior police official said the exhumation and postmortem were completed, with tissues and samples sent to the Forensic Science Agency for DNA and other tests. He confirmed that the grave had indeed been tampered with, and a case was registered against unidentified suspects.
As the investigation progressed, police traced the suspect, who turned out to be a black magic practitioner from Mansehra. He was arrested and remanded into custody for four days to aid further investigation.

The Wall Street Journal reported the potential helicopter and vehicle sales on Friday.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The news of the proposed sale came days before world leaders were set to gather in New York for the annual  United Nations General Assembly next week, while the UN Security Council is also due to hold a high-level meeting on Gaza.
The planned package includes a deal worth $3.8bn for 30 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and $1.9bn for 3,250 infantry assault vehicles for the Israeli army. Another $750 million worth of support parts for armoured personnel carriers and power supplies are also working its way through the sale process.
The Republican president’s full-throated support for Israel’s military contrasts with growing wariness about Israel’s assault on Gaza among Democrats.
On Thursday, a group of senators introduced the first Senate resolution to urge recognition of a Palestinian state and more than half of Democrats in the Senate recently voted against further arms sales.

Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) Chairman Dr Kabir Ahmed Sidhu told the committee that the case had been under review for 18 months due to its complex nature. He added that untimely responses from PTCL management partly caused delays.
Committee Chairperson Senator Palwasha Khan raised concerns about appointments to the boards of PTCL and its subsidiary Ufone, noting that while PTCL board details were available online, Ufone’s board composition was missing from its website. She said the names had also not been shared in previous meetings.
Senator Kamran Murtaza questioned the perks and privileges enjoyed by board members, including reports of $5,000 allowances and foreign trips. “This is public information and should be disclosed,” Senator Khan remarked.
Stolen data
Meanwhile, Senator Afnan Ullah revealed that stolen data worth over Rs65bn is being sold on the dark web, including the personal information of nearly 300,000 Haj applicants.
He warned of external pressure on Pakistan not to legislate data protection laws and urged urgent action to avoid serious consequences.
 
 

Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Chairman confirmed that SIM data, including his own, had been circulating on the dark web since 2022. He also acknowledged poor telecom service in Balochistan and widespread call drop issues.
Senators criticised IT Minister Shaza Fatima for her repeated absence from committee proceedings, questioning the ministry’s commitment to addressing sectoral issues.

Committee flags delays, lapses in telecom sector oversight

Senator Nadeem Bhutto highlighted the lack of mobile signals in several areas, including the Karachi–Sukkur Motorway.The PTA informed the committee that it was prepared to proceed with a 5G auction in December, with consultant reports completed. However, pending court cases could delay the process. The committee urged the ministry to coordinate with the Attorney General’s office to resolve legal hurdles promptly.

• FO adopts cautious approach; cites ‘evolving doctrine’ but offers no specifics
• Dar hints other states also interested in defence deals
ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s conflicting statements about Pakistan’s new defence agreement with Saudi Arabia have intensified speculation about the pact’s nuclear dimension.
During an appearance on a TV talk show on Thursday night, Mr Asif had suggested that Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities could be made available to Riyadh under the new framework.
“What we have, and the capabilities we possess, will be made available to (Saudi Arabia) according to this agreement,” he said, stressing that Pakistan has always acted as a responsible nuclear state.
The remarks were interpreted as the first explicit signal that Pakistan might extend its nuclear deterrence to the kingdom, particularly as Mr Asif was present at the signing ceremony in Riyadh.
However, in a subsequent interview with Reuters, the minister denied that nuclear weapons were part of the accord, saying they were “not on the radar”.
 
 

Amid the confusion, the Foreign Office on Friday seemed to choose ‘strategic silence’, adopting a cautious approach.
At the weekly media briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan sidestepped repeated questions on whether the pact alters Pakistan’s long-declared policy of keeping its nuclear deterrent India-centric, and not extending it to another country.
Asked twice whether that stance had changed, Mr Khan only referred to an evolving doctrine. “The doctrine has evolved and continues to do so,” he said. “I am not here to comment on the specificity of the doctrine, but our position is well known.”
Pakistan has consistently declared its nuclear programme is intended to deter India alone.
In Dec, the Foreign Office said: “Pakistan has made it abundantly clear that our strategic programme and allied capabilities are solely meant to deter and thwart a clear and visible existential threat from our neighbourhood and should not be perceived as a threat to any other country.”
Mr Khan, while parrying question about whether rules of engagement related to troop deployment in Saudi Arabia have been revised, framed the agreement as a consolidation of longstanding ties with Riyadh.
 
 

“Since the 1960s, defence cooperation has served as one of the principal pillars of Pakistan-Saudi Arabia’s all-encompassing bilateral relations,” Mr Khan said. “The strategic mutual defence agreement formalises this decades-old and robust defence partnership.”
When asked if the agreement was aimed to check Israel’s aggressive designs in the region, he said, “It is defensive in nature and not directed against any third country. It will contribute to regional peace, security and stability.”
Speculation about extended deterrence was first sparked by a Saudi official who, shortly after the agreement was signed, hinted to a Western news agency that Riyadh would under the agreement get nuclear cover. Saudi commentators later amplified the claim.
The joint statement that announced the accord, formally titled the “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement”, described it as an initiative “to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression”.
Other states ‘interested’: Dar
Separately, speaking to reports in London, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar hinted that some other states were also showing an interest in building strategic defence agreements with Pakistan.
“It’s premature to say anything, but some other countries want to enter into an agreement of this nature,” Mr Dar told reporters in London, replying to a question about whether other states will join the pact or ink similar deals. “This was not signed overnight; it has taken several months.”
Calling the agreement a “historic pact”, FM Dar said Pakistan has always maintained an informal defence arrangement with Saudi Arabia, which is the same as the agreement signed on Wednesday.
“I believe that both sides are very happy. Let’s be frank: Saudi Arabia has stood with us during difficult times, such as the sanctions. Their support was very relevant and important,” he added. “Similarly, during the current crisis since 2022-2023, when we needed IMF (International Monetary Fund) support, Saudi Arabia stood with us.”

• Plan missile early warning system; joint drills
GULF Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have pledged sweeping steps to bolster collective defence, including plans to increase intelligence sharing, develop new missile warning systems, and hold joint defence drills, after Israel launched a deadly strike on Doha earlier this month.
Following an emergency Arab-Islamic summit, where leaders expressed alarm about Israel’s attacks across the Middle East, GCC officials met in Doha to discuss military intelligence unification, UAE-based The National reported.
The GCC — a political and economic alliance of six Middle Eastern nations: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates — has agreed to expand intelligence sharing through Unified Military Command.
The six-member bloc said they would fast-track the creation of a regional early-warning system to counter ballistic missiles and share the “air situation” with all affected countries.
The measures will also see joint troops and command-centre drills within three months, to be followed by live air defence exercises, the statement said.
 
 

To address all risks and challenges, continuous efforts across military and intelligence sectors will be undertaken to enhance Gulf security cooperation and integrate the security systems, the statement added.
“The priority is ensuring the security, stability and safety of all GCC countries,” the council said, warning of the risks to a region already unsettled by months of conflict.
The decision comes days after Israel targeted a Hamas delegation in Doha that had been discussing ceasefire terms for the war in Gaza.
 
 

The strike killed five members of the Palestinian group, including the son of exiled political leader, alongside a Qatari security officer. Qatar said it had received no prior warning before the explosions erupted in its capital and Hamas said its senior leadership survived the attack
During the meeting, the council denounced Israeli strikes as a “dangerous and unacceptable” provocation.
Delegates in Doha included senior defence officials from all six Gulf states, with the Mohammed Al Mazrouei, the UAE’s Minister of State for Defence Affairs; Bahrain’s Minister of Defence Affairs, Lt Gen Abdullah Al Nuaimi; Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Minister of Defence, Prince Abdulrahman bin Mohammed; Secretary General of the Oman’s Ministry of Defence, Mohammed Al Zaabi; Kuwait’s Minister of Defence Sheikh Abdullah Ali Al Abdullah Al Sabah; and Jasem Al Budaiwi.
The presence of all ministers underscored, officials said, the urgency of forging a common regional shield.
While the GCC has long spoken of greater military integration, efforts have often faltered amid political rivalries and divergent threat perceptions.
Thursday’s agreement, amid the gravity of Israel’s unprecedented strike inside Qatar, was presented as a turning point.

• Non-compliant individuals to be treated as abettors, facilitators
QUETTA: The Balochistan government has directed families to immediately report if any of their relatives go missing or join non-state or militant groups, warning that strict legal action will be taken against those who fail to comply.
According to an official notification issued by the Home Department, families are required to provide such information within seven days and submit sworn declarations disowning relatives involved in militancy, or else face action under anti-terrorism laws.
The notification stated that citizens, parents and guardians must inform the nearest police station and FC/army unit within one week if a family member goes missing or is found to have joined any non-state or militant group.
It further directed that details of individuals already missing must also be submitted within seven days under Sections 118 and 202 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), read with Section 11(1)(EEE) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997.
Similarly, families of those who have already joined militant outfits must file a sworn affidavit of separation and disownment within a week, in line with sections 120/120-A of the PPC, read with Section 11(1)(a)(EEE) of the ATA.
 
 

The notification warned that if families fail to report missing persons or refuse to disown them, and it is later established that the individual was involved in terrorism, the family will be treated as abettors/facilitators under the ATA. Their names may also be placed in the Fourth Schedule under sections 107, 109 and 114 of the PPC, read with ATA provisions.
The Home Department warned that facilitators will face strict legal action, including confiscation of property, dismissal from government service, and denial of all state financial and welfare benefits.

Filed by Justice Jahangiri in person, the appeal before the Supreme Court pleaded for the Sept 16 restraining order to be set aside and suspended during the pendency of the petition, and for the division bench to be directed to hold back from proceeding further.
The two-judge IHC bench, headed by Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar alongside  Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, had issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed by lawyer Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution. The petition sought a writ of quo warranto, questioning “by what authority” Justice Jahangiri held judicial office.
 
 

In his appeal under Article 185(3), Justice Jahangiri cited the 2010 Iftikhar Chaudhry case, in which the SC had held that the Constitution did not permit any restraint on the exercise of judicial powers by a judge or any limitation on him during proceedings envisaged by Article 209. The ruling also held that even a temporary disability placed on a judge in the discharge of constitutional and official obligations amounts to removal from office and is therefore not permissible under the Constitution.
The Sept 16 order, the appeal argued, was patently mala fide in its conception and contrary to what transpired in open court. It added that the restraining order was passed in a palpable conflict of interest, opening the door to an egregious encroachment on judicial independence, allowing a larger bench of the high court to restrain fellow judges from performing their judicial functions.
The appeal stressed that although interference in interlocutory matters is an exception to the general rule, an exception arises when an order is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to settled principles of law.
In such cases, he argued, the Supreme Court is bound to intervene to prevent miscarriage of justice. It is a settled principle that no injunction may be granted without the three prerequisites of a prima facie case, irreparable loss, and balance of convenience being satisfied.
However, the Sept 16 order, which the appeal described as a non-speaking order, contains no discussion of these indispensable elements, thereby lacking legal foundation. It argued that the order overturns the convention that the court is a collegiate body of judges, each exercising equal judicial power, who are required to discharge their duties in a manner that upholds comity among them.
