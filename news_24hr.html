In a meeting of Subcommittee IV of the PAC, chaired by Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Passports Director General Mustafa Qazi revealed that thousands of passports had been stolen from 25 passport offices across the country “in different years.”
“All passports in these cases were blocked,” Qazi said. “They have not been reviewed, nor will they be.”
Audit authorities said in the meeting that 32,600 passports were stolen from passport offices in Abbottabad and elsewhere.
“This is a very worrying matter,” Chaudhry said. “Under the current circumstances, these stolen passports could be misused.”
The Passports DG said, “The Ministry of Interior arrested the foreigners who illegally went to Saudi Arabia from Pakistan. Riyadh has deported Afghan citizens from there.”
Qazi added that after the incident, the passport system will be completely digitised, and auditing authorities noted that a cyber-audit of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) was conducted two years ago.
“Now it has become very difficult to produce fake documents,” DG Qazi said.
The subcommittee instructed DG Qazi to submit an inquiry report.</p><small>2025-09-17 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/172201066c67e92.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942718/us-house-panel-questions-fbis-patel-over-epstein-investigation-files' target='_blank'><strong>US House panel questions FBI’s Patel over Epstein investigation files</strong></a><br><p>FBI Director Kash Patel on Wednesday faced a second day of questioning by US lawmakers, defending his handling of investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein against claims from Democratic and one Republican lawmaker that the FBI is shielding information related to the late financier and sex offender.
Appearing before a US House of Representatives panel, Patel offered a variety of explanations for the Trump administration’s about-face on releasing material on the Epstein investigations.
He argued that court orders prevented the release of some evidence and that in other areas the FBI had limited material in its possession.
“We are releasing as much as legally allowed,” Patel told the House Judiciary Committee.
The Justice Department enraged many prominent supporters of President Donald Trump with its decision in July not to release additional documents from the investigation, after raising expectations for a full disclosure.
Many in Trump’s political base believed his administration would implicate other wealthy and powerful people in Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking of underage girls.
Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a critic of the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein probe and co-author of legislation to require more disclosures about it, said he had been told by alleged victims of Epstein that they had given the FBI information about others who had been involved in Epstein’s abuse.
“We know these people exist in the FBI files, files that you control. I don’t know exactly who they are, but the FBI does. Have you launched any investigations into any of these people?” Massie asked.
Patel replied that the FBI would investigate “credible information” but that he has not received any such information.
 


Patel told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the FBI does not have credible evidence that Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, trafficked women and underage girls to anyone other than himself.
The issue has sparked a rare rift between Trump and his Make America Great Again movement. Trump, a one-time friend of Epstein, has urged his supporters to move on and dismissed the issue as a hoax pushed by his Democratic opponents.
Three federal judges have rejected Justice Department requests to unseal material from grand juries that investigated Epstein and his former partner, Ghislaine Maxwell. Judges found, and prosecutors acknowledged, that the material contained little information that was not already public.
Patel also suggested that other material, including reports of witness interviews, was protected from disclosure by court orders. He told lawmakers the FBI does not have videos that implicate others in Epstein’s alleged crimes.
Patel had boosted claims about Epstein during appearances on conservative podcasts before Trump nominated him to lead the FBI. Democrats accused Patel of seeking to shield information about Trump, who has not been accused of misconduct related to Epstein.
“How did you go from being a crusader for accountability and transparency to being a part of the conspiracy and cover-up?” asked Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.
The Justice Department has begun handing records to the House Oversight Committee, which has subpoenaed material related to Epstein.</p><small>2025-09-17 17:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/17222221763ff63.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942705/asia-cup-another-shaheen-cameo-gets-pakistan-to-146-after-dithering-start-against-uae' target='_blank'><strong>Asia Cup: Another Shaheen cameo gets Pakistan to 146 after dithering start against UAE</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan are batting first after the United Arab Emirates won the toss and elected to bowl first in their much-delayed men’s Asia Cup encounter.
The Pakistan-UAE clash is set to go through on Wednesday after Zimbabwean referee Andy Pycroft apologised to the manager and captain of the Green Shirts after much uncertainty surrounding the fixture in the fallout of the Pakistan-India match last Sunday.
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking at the toss, said: “For us, we want to play a proper game today, we didn’t play well in the middle overs in the last game — It’s a great day to play a perfect game.
Pakistan have two changes in their team, Haris Rauf and Khushdil Shah are in for Faheem Ashraf and Sufyan Muqeem.

Uncertainty regarding the national team’s participation in the Asia Cup today emerged after the handshake controversy that unfolded in their match against archrivals India.
The Zimbabwean oversaw Sunday’s politically charged clash with India, after which the victorious India team refused to shake hands with the Pakistan players. The PCB said that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav before the match. Pycroft was scheduled to be the match referee for today’s game as reports coming out from India claimed the ICC had rejected Pakistan’s demand.
A statement issued today by the PCB shortly before the toss between Pakistan and UAE said: “The ICC’s match referee, Andy Pycroft, has apologised to the manager and captain of the Pakistan cricket team.”
It said he termed the Sunday incident “a result of miscommunication and apologised”. The PCB also added that the ICC expressed its willingness to conduct an inquiry into the code of conduct violation that occurred during the match.
 






Addressing a press conference in Lahore shortly after the toss, with former PCB chiefs Najam Sethi and Ramiz Raja, cricket board chairman Mohsin Naqvi reiterated the events of the past few days and said Pycroft had apologised.
“Politics and cricket cannot go together. Let sports remain sports. Cricket should be above all this,” he said, adding that he had requested his predecessors for consultation since any boycott would have been a major decision with input from multiple stakeholders.
“These two specially came and we were constantly monitoring this because we did not even know ourselves what decision would be taken at the last moment. God maintained Pakistan’s dignity as the nation was expecting and I hope that we will now focus on cricket and not on politics.”
He said he had hope from the team of performing in the tournament and called on the people to support them till the end.
“We have a big panel of selectors, which will review and if there is any weakness, I promise that I will sit with them and tell them to remove them,” he said.
 






Sethi also said that politics should not be involved with sports, adding that the PCB had displayed sportsmanship. “I think cricket is the winner and we should continue to play the game,” he added.
Meanwhile, Raja termed the development a “win” since he said the situation had become a “critical” one.
“Emotions were running high and I am happy that an emotional decision was not taken that would have damaged cricket,” he said, adding that the cricket team had to do any “talking” and channel any frustration with its performance on the field.
The Pakistan cricket team was earlier seen leaving their hotel for their Asia Cup match against the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday after Naqvi asked them to depart.
 






The Asian Cricket Council confirmed in a statement that the match would go ahead at 8:30pm PKT.
 






In a statement that came late on Tuesday night, following what Dawn learnt was a meeting involving officials from the board and the government in Islamabad, PCB spokesperson Amir Mir had said in a statement that the board had not made any final decision regarding the Asia Cup.
The PCB correspondence was followed by Pakistan’s decision to not hold their pre-match press conference ahead of their final Group ‘A’ fixture against hosts UAE. The Pakistan team did, however, turn up for practice on the eve of the game.
 
 

Earlier, media reports said the Pakistan cricket team would not play their men’s Asia Cup 2025 match against the UAE.
Geo News reported that the team was given official instructions to return to their rooms, with the team bus parking outside the entrance to unload the players’ equipment.
Footage run by DawnNewsTV showed team staff loading kit bags into a bus outside the players’ hotel, adding that the bus was headed to the stadium.
This is not the first time teams have tried to change a match official in international cricket. India, in a  2001 test against South Africa, tried to have match referee Mike Denness removed, according to a report by Cricinfo.
The Indian and South African cricket boards agreed to remove Denness; however, the decision was not taken by the International Cricket Council (ICC).</p><small>2025-09-17 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/17213203e73d457.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942611/pm-shehbaz-arrives-at-riyadhs-yamama-palace-for-meeting-with-saudi-crown-prince' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz arrives at Riyadh’s Yamama Palace for meeting with Saudi crown prince</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived at Riyadh’s Yamama Palace on Wednesday for a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on multiple issues of bilateral interest.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in mutual economic interests, strategic military cooperation, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
The premier was welcomed by the Saudi crown prince and presented with a guard of honour.
 






PM Shehbaz was earlier received by Riyadh Deputy Governor Muhammad bin Abdulrahman bin Abdulaziz upon his arrival in the city, according to a post on X by PTV News.
Another post showed PM Shehbaz and the deputy governor having a meeting.
 






As soon as the premier’s plane entered Saudi airspace, “Saudi Air Force jets escorted and protected it”, state-run PTV News reported.
“This was a gesture of brotherly love and respect by the Government of Saudi Arabia. This honour in the Muslim world is the result of Allah’s blessings, Shehbaz Sharif’s diplomatic skills, and the unparalleled achievements of our Armed Forces.”
 






The Foreign Office (FO) said that PM Shehbaz undertook the visit at the invitation of the Saudi crown prince.
“During the visit, the prime minister will hold [a] bilateral meeting with the crown prince, to review the entire spectrum of Pakistan–Saudi Arabia relations,” the statement added.
 






In its statement, the FO said that both leaders were expected to exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest. “The visit is expected to result in the formalisation of cooperation in diverse fields, reflecting the shared commitment of both sides to further enhance and deepen their longstanding fraternal ties,” it added.
Highlighting the “historic relationship” between the countries, the statement said that the visit will “provide an important opportunity to the two leaders to consolidate this unique partnership, while exploring new avenues of collaboration, for the benefit of the peoples of the two countries”.
The premier was accompanied by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Environment Minister Musadik Malik and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, state media Radio Pakistan reported.
In July, President Asif Zardari met Saudi Ambassador Nawaf bin Saeed Ahmed Al-Malki to discuss ways to enhance bilateral cooperation, particularly in trade, economy and culture. During the meeting, President Zardari invited Saudi investors to explore opportunities in Pakistan.
PM Shehbaz had met the Saudi crown prince on a two-day official visit in June, where he thanked the Saudi leader for his role in ending the conflict between Pakistan and India in May.</p><small>2025-09-17 16:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1721021291adb7c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942638/trump-begins-historic-state-visit-to-uk-amid-pomp-and-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Trump begins historic state visit to UK amid pomp and protests</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump was treated to a royal reception featuring gun salutes, soldiers on horseback and bagpipes as he met Wednesday with Britain’s King Charles III for a historic second state visit, which unfolded far from marching protesters.
The pair laughed and joked as Trump inspected troops at Windsor Castle, west of London, in an elaborate spectacle featuring a carriage procession designed to play into the mercurial American leader’s love of pomp and pageantry.
Some 120 horses, and 1,300 members of the British military — some in red tunics and gold plumed helmets — feted Trump during a ceremonial guard of honour that United Kingdom officials called the largest for a state visit to Britain in living memory.
The president and First Lady Melania Trump were greeted by heir-to-the-throne Prince William and wife Catherine at Windsor after stepping off the Marine One helicopter under grey skies at 12:15pm (1115 GMT).
Inside a ring of steel and out of sight from thousands of demonstrators shouting anti-Trump slogans in London, William and Catherine then walked Trump and his wife a short distance to meet the waiting Charles and Queen Camilla.
As the president shook hands with the king, a 41-gun salute was fired simultaneously from six World War One-era guns on the castle’s east lawn, as a similar display occurred at the Tower of London, in the centre of the capital.
The Trumps and the royals were then taken in a black and gold coach, surrounded by mounted cavalry, through the Windsor estate towards the nearly 1,000-year-old castle, where Trump and Charles inspected the guard of honour.
The pair were seen sharing smiles, and the president saluted as the US national anthem played, before the royals and their guests headed inside for lunch.
They exchanged gifts, with the royals giving Trump a book to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the US declaration of independence next year, and Trump gifting Charles a replica of President Dwight Eisenhower’s sword.
‘Warm my heart’
Britain is pulling out all the stops to dazzle and flatter the unpredictable Trump as the UK government tries to keep him onside during a host of international crises.
The 79-year-old Republican is, however, being kept far away from Britons as polls indicate he remains unpopular with the public, with the entire visit happening behind closed doors.
An estimated 3,000 people marched through central London waving Palestinian flags and displaying banners with slogans, including “Migrants welcome, Trump not welcome”.
“I’m just scared of the way the world’s being taken over by really nasty men,” Jo Williamson, a 58-year-old funeral director from Kent, southeast England, told AFP.
 
 

Trump is the first US president to receive two state visits, after his previous one with Queen Elizabeth II in 2019.
At Windsor, he laid a wreath on the tomb of Charles’s mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2022, and viewed a collection of US-related items, including a letter sent from president Abraham Lincoln to Queen Victoria in 1862 after the death of Prince Albert.
The president and Charles will wrap up with a white-tie state banquet, where they are due to make speeches.
Trump’s unpredictability on everything from tariffs to Ukraine and Gaza has caused global turmoil and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will be hoping the president leaves on Thursday feeling the warm glow of royal soft power — but there are no guarantees.
Epstein’s shadow
“A lot of things here warm my heart,” the president, whose mother hailed from Scotland and who owns two golf resorts in the country, said on arriving late on Tuesday at the US ambassador’s official residence in London.
The US leader may also relish a chance to escape a turbulent period at home, where the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk has caused deep turmoil.
 
 

But the spectre loomed of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who is providing domestic headaches for both Trump and Starmer.
Police arrested four people after they projected images of Trump and Epstein onto Windsor Castle late Tuesday.
Starmer will host Trump on the second day of the visit on Thursday at his country residence, Chequers.
The pair will be buoyed by the announcement of billions of pounds of investment in each other’s economies, including from British pharmaceutical group GSK and Google, but there could be awkward moments.
Starmer’s government seeks to cement the two nations’ “special relationship”, deepen economic ties, secure billions of dollars of investment, discuss tariffs and press the US president on Ukraine and Israel.
Companies including Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and OpenAI have already pledged 31bn pounds ($42bn) in British investments over the next few years, in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy.
Starmer also wants further progress on trade, after Britain secured the first deal with Trump to lower some tariffs. Talks may touch on remaining levies on steel, whisky and salmon.
“They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit,” Trump said when he left the White House for Britain on Tuesday.
But while Starmer is banking on the unrivalled royal allure helping cajole the Anglophile president, many pitfalls for Britain’s prime minister remain.
Polls show Trump is widely unpopular in Britain and Starmer, faced with plummeting poll ratings of his own and economic woes, will need to show that his royal trump card can reap benefits.
Starmer faces political troubles at home after sacking his UK ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, over his links to the late Epstein.
Awkward questions about Epstein could also come to the fore.
Commuters in the capital had mixed views about the visit, with some angry about the invitation and others saying it was smart politics and a good use of Britain’s soft power.
“We’re looking to sort of make the best of a bad situation,” said lawyer Kirstie Robertshaw, 54.
For Charles himself, the visit might provoke mixed emotions. He has little in common with Trump, from his 50 years championing environmental causes to his efforts to bring harmony between religions and his recent steadfast support for Canada, where he is head of state.
But the occasion will also afford him the greatest global attention since his coronation.
“If it goes well … I think this will go down as the most consequential event in his reign,” said historian Anthony Seldon.</p><small>2025-09-17 16:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1717194609a49d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942648/pakistan-palestine-sign-health-mou-in-bid-to-foster-closer-bilateral-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Palestine sign health MoU in bid to foster closer bilateral ties</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the State of Palestine signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) aiming to “strengthen bilateral cooperation in the health sector”, as part of an effort to foster both nations’ brotherly ties, the Ministry of National Health Services said on Wednesday.
The two countries share strong bilateral ties as Pakistan is one of the few countries that recognises the state of Palestine. Pakistan has reiterated its support for Palestine against Israeli occupying forces at multiple international forums. The country also routinely sends humanitarian aid to Palestine’s Gaza, where Israel continues its offensive.
Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, who signed the agreement on Pakistan’s behalf with the Ambassador of Palestine Dr Zuhair Dar Zaid, remarked during the ceremony: “The purpose of this agreement is to foster closer collaboration for improving the health and well-being of the people of both brotherly nations.”
According to a press release by the health ministry, the ceremony was attended by Secretary of Health Hamid Yaqoob, the additional secretary of health and the director general.
Highlighting the details of the agreement, Kamal said, “A Pakistan-Palestine Health Working Group will be established within the next 30 days to oversee the implementation of the agreement and provide guidance for practical collaboration.”
 






The key areas of cooperation between the two countries under the agreement will focus on “enhancing capacity in advanced medical fields such as interventional cardiology, organ transplantation, orthopaedic surgery, endoscopic ultrasound, burn and plastic surgery”.
“Joint efforts will also be pursued in the fields of infectious diseases, ophthalmology, and pharmaceuticals,” the press release quoted Kamal as saying, adding that “opportunities for collaborative research will be explored.”
Underscoring Pakistan’s commitment to supporting Palestine, Kamal assured the Palestinian ambassador of continued support to “Palestinian brothers and sisters in the field of health.”
 
 

“The hearts of the people of Pakistan beat with Palestine, and we stand ready to assist them in every possible way,” he added.
The Palestinian ambassador, while expressing gratitude towards Pakistan for its continued support, remarked that “Palestine and Pakistan are brotherly countries.“
“Together, we will work for the improvement of [the] health and well-being of our peoples.”</p><small>2025-09-17 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/171634156634f9c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942645/fact-check-viral-video-does-not-show-schoolgirls-in-pain-after-hpv-vaccination' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video does not show schoolgirls in pain after HPV vaccination</strong></a><br><p>Multiple users on X on Tuesday shared a video, claiming that it showed schoolgirls falling sick after being vaccinated. However, the clip is of teargas shelling in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and not linked to the current Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaign against cervical cancer.
A day ago, Abdullah Gul, son of former intelligence chief Hamid Gul, shared a video on X showing girls in school uniforms in a hospital ward appearing sick with the following caption:
“After forced vaccination in schools, several girls fell ill and had to be transferred to the hospital. For God’s sake! Take a clear and firm stance in the matter of your children. All the world’s experiments are always conducted on us poor people. No help for flood victims, but the West is giving free vaccines.”
The post gained over 290,000 views, 2,700 reactions and 1,800 shares.
The post did not provide other crucial information, such as the location and date of the video or specify what vaccine was administered.
The same video was shared with a similar claim by a user on X, who appears to be a PTI supporter based on their past posts and profile picture.
The user referred to a HPV vaccination campaign in the caption:
“Big revelation. In Pakistan, the HPV vaccine is being administered to children. Protect your children from this vaccine. Look at the condition of the girls. Share this video with every household.”
The post gained over 30,000 views
The same video with similar claims was shared by multiple users on X as can be seen here and here and on Instagram as well.
A fact-check was initiated to verify the claim due to its virality, keen public interest in vaccine-related matters and to address the harm of such content.
A reverse image search yielded a YouTube video dated May 9, 2024, with the following title: “Police fired tear gas at girls’ schools in Dadyal”.
 


Dadyal is a tehsil in Mirpur district of AJK.
A keyword search for “tear gas”, “Dadyal” and “school girls” yielded a May 9, 2024, X post by journalist Basharat Raja, who had shared the same video with the following caption:
“This is also a clip from Dadyal where tear gas was excessively used by police and unidentified individuals dressed in civilian clothes on schools, causing female students engaged in annual examinations to faint.”
 






A keyword search to corroborate the incident through credible media outlets yielded a May 10, 2024, news report from leading English publication Dawn titled “Police crackdown in AJK prompts ‘shutter-down strike’ call”.
The report stated that police fired tear gas shells during clashes, and some landed in a school, affecting several girls. The demonstrations were part of a wider movement against high electricity bills and taxes in AJK.
A keyword search to determine whether any vaccination campaigns were underway in Pakistan yielded a World Health Organisation (WHO) article dated Sept 16, 2025, titled: “Pakistan joins 150 countries to protect 13 million girls from cervical cancer with WHO-prequalified vaccine”.
The report stated that the WHO, in collaboration with the Federal Directorate of Immunisation (FDI), launched the country’s first-ever HPV vaccination campaign to protect 13 million adolescent girls from cervical cancer, in partnership with vaccine alliance Gavi and Unicef. It added that Pakistan now joined more than 150 countries that include the WHO-prequalified vaccine in their immunisation schedules.
According to the landing page for the campaign on FDI’s website: “The HPV vaccine is safe, free and effective and girls aged 9–14 years will be vaccinated from September 15-27, 2025, in schools, madrassas and health facilities across Punjab, Sindh, AJK and Islamabad.”
In its announcement of the campaign, Gavi noted that the vaccine has “mild side-effects”, such as pain in the injected part of the body or a low fever that might occur, adding, however, that this was “similar to other vaccines”.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows schoolgirls in pain after being inoculated amid the current HPV vaccination campaign is false. The video shows schoolgirls affected by tear gas shelling in AJK in May 2024, not the HPV vaccine — which is safe and only has mild side effects.

“The police and Levies personnel retaliated, and an exchange of fire went on for three hours,” DC Sherani said in a statement, adding that the retaliation prevented any major damage.
“However, one policeman was martyred during the attack and two Levies personnel were injured, while another Levies official remains missing,” he said.
He added that the deceased was identified as Aftab-ur-Rehman, while the two injured — identified as Kalu Khan and Abdul Wahid — were rushed to the Trauma Centre in Quetta.
“A search operation is underway to look for the assailants. They attacked the police with rocket launchers, snipers, and explosives, damaging the stations’ communication system,” he said.
“The unknown assailants set a Levies vehicle on fire along with another vehicle carrying relief supplies from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).”
There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. In August, three security personnel, including a senior officer, were martyred in an attack in Balochistan’s Mastung district.
Earlier this month, at least five people were killed and 29 were injured in a blast at a rally of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium.
In July, a Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred, and two others suffered injuries when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on the National Highway in the Mastung district.</p><small>2025-09-17 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/171510171802d2e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942642/poison-killed-putin-critic-navalny-wife-says' target='_blank'><strong>Poison killed Putin critic Navalny, wife says</strong></a><br><p>The wife of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said Wednesday that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning while incarcerated at an Arctic prison in February 2024.
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin’s most formidable critic for years, died in mysterious circumstances while serving a 19-year prison sentence on a string of charges widely seen as retribution for his opposition.
The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-got gains of Putin’s inner circle.
 
 

His allies allege he was murdered in prison, and Moscow has never fully explained the causes of his death, saying only that he fell ill while walking in the prison yard on February 16, 2024.
Before he was buried, his wife Yulia Navalnaya said his allies “were able to obtain and securely transfer biological samples of Alexei abroad”.
“Laboratories in two countries came to the conclusion that Alexei was killed. Specifically: poisoned,” she said in a video posted on social media.
She did not divulge details of what samples were obtained nor the results of the analysis, but she urged the labs to independently release their results and to specify which poison they believe was used.
Navalnaya also published unverified photos she said were of his prison cell after his body was removed, showing a pool of vomit on the floor, and claimed that testimony from prison officials said he had been convulsing on the floor.
‘Murder’
Navalny was previously poisoned with a nerve agent of the Novichok type in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering.
Jailed upon his return to Russia in January 2021, he was convicted on a series of charges, including “extremism”.
From behind bars, he continued to campaign against Putin and spoke out against the invasion of Ukraine.
Russian authorities said he died suddenly after falling ill while walking outside after lunch in his prison colony.
Following Navalny’s death, officials refused for days to release his body to his relatives, raising suspicions among his followers.
Navalnaya has maintained that her husband was killed on Putin’s orders, an accusation she repeated Wednesday.
“Vladimir Putin is guilty of the murder of my husband, Alexei Navalny,” she said.
The Kremlin denies the charges.
It escalated a crackdown against his allies and opponents even after his death, adding Navalnaya to a “terrorists and extremists” blacklist and sentencing his lawyers and journalists who followed his court cases to years in prison.
Most of his family and key allies have long lived abroad.
The Russian opposition, plagued by infighting, has struggled for relevance in exile following Navalny’s death.
Public displays of opposition to Putin inside Russia have become exceptionally rare since he invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
The Kremlin introduced military censorship, ramped up its targeting of dissenters and critics and effectively outlawed criticism both of the Kremlin and the invasion.</p><small>2025-09-17 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1713591651e2a03.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942626/three-terrorists-killed-as-police-thwarts-attacks-in-kps-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>Three terrorists killed as police thwarts attacks in KP’s Bannu</strong></a><br><p>At least three terrorists were killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district as the police foiled two attacks, officials said on Wednesday.
Bannu District Police Officer Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com, “Three terrorists were killed in the Bannu operation responding to the attacks,
but the rest of the terrorists fled, taking away the bodies.”
The terrorists launched attacks on the Miryan Police Station and Mazang Checkpoints late at night, according to Bannu police spokesperson Kashif Nawaz.
“Due to the timely and effective response by the police, both attacks were successfully repelled,” he said, adding that four police officers were injured.
He also said that the attack on the Miryan Police Station was thwarted within 20 minutes, while an exchange of fire at the Mazang Checkpoint continued for about an hour.
Bannu Deputy Inspector General of Police Sajjad Khan praised the bravery and timely response of the police in a statement.
“Bannu Police stands firm against terrorists on every front. Protecting the lives and property of the public is our top priority, and such cowardly acts only strengthen the morale of our force,” he said.
Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
Last month, police carried out a search and targeted operation alongside security forces in Bannu, arresting “14 terrorist facilitators“ and destroying “three hideouts”.
In July, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was martyred when terrorists attacked him in Bannu.</p><small>2025-09-17 09:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624149-pakistan-urges-taliban-govt-in-afghanistan-to-cut-ties-with-ttp' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges Taliban govt in Afghanistan to cut ties with TTP</strong></a><br><p>

But players say those determined to bet will find a way to access overseas and unregulated websites while fans of fantasy sport apps can still play, although for prizes and not cash.
Adarsh Sharma, an advertising professional who regularly played fantasy sports games, said offshore sites will “see a sudden boom” as Indian gamblers look for a fix.
“A habit once formed cannot be broken easily,” he said. “It is an addiction and people will find ways to gamble.”
India’s parliament last month passed a sweeping law banning online gambling after government figures showed companies had stripped $2.3 billion annually from 450 million people.
 
 

Officials said the rapid spread of the platforms caused widespread financial distress, addiction and suicide, while also being linked to fraud, money laundering and financing terrorism.
The law has been challenged in court by a top online card games platform.
The ban impacts websites and apps for card games and fantasy sports — including India’s wildly popular fantasy cricket — with offenders now facing up to five years in prison.
India’s online gamblers will have to use virtual private networks (VPNs) to trick overseas websites into thinking they are not in the country, and also use proxy credit cards for placing a bet.
The whole process may seem too cumbersome for an average internet user, but gamblers know how to dodge the rules.
“We have done this before and will do it again,” one fan told AFP, asking not to be named. “We will go back to our old ways of making money.”
‘Love of cricket’
Technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the law separates still-legal eSports “from betting, gambling and fantasy money games that exploit users with false promises of profit”.
Dream11 — which boasts of being the world’s largest fantasy sports platform, with 260 million users — posted notices that “cash games and contests have been discontinued”.
It now offers prizes such as cars, phones and fridges instead.
Dream11 also pulled out of a $43 million deal with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), with its logo no longer splashed on the jerseys of the Indian players.
Jamshed Noor, a butcher in the capital Delhi, said his top win had been 600 rupees (about $7), a day’s wage for a labourer.
“We play it for the love of cricket,” said Noor. “Money was definitely an attraction, but I still play, despite money being off the table now.”
The law will also shake up the wider sporting industry, including the hugely lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket competition.
 
 

“Fantasy platforms are the most aggressive advertisers in IPL and world cricket,” Karan Taurani from Elara Capital said, adding that they would now likely explore the overseas market.
Santosh N, of D and P Advisory, estimated that fantasy sports and crypto platforms accounted for up to 40 per cent of the advertisement IPL broadcasters earned this year.
“The fantasy guys will obviously reduce their ad spends because their business model is at stake — or actually destroyed due to the ban,” Santosh told AFP.
That will impact the revenue of the broadcasters, meaning less cash for the league.
“When the time comes for the BCCI to renew media rights in 2027, it could very well see a lower renewal premium because broadcasters can’t afford to pay that much anymore,” he said.</p><small>2025-09-17 08:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/17123103c231bdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942616/security-forces-kill-5-indian-sponsored-terrorists-in-khuzdar-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 5 ‘Indian-sponsored’ terrorists in Khuzdar IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces earlier this week killed five “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Wednesday.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
In a press release, the ISPR said security forces conducted the IBO on the night of 14/15 September on the “reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan”.
“During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the military’s media wing added.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” the ISPR noted.
Sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, according to the ISPR.
“Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the military reaffirmed.
 
 

The operation comes after five security personnel, including an officer, were martyred in an explosion in Balochistan’s Kech district on Monday.
Over the weekend, security forces had killed 31 terrorists in two separate INOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, ISPR said.
On September 12, the ISPR said troops had also killed four “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Balochistan’s Mastung. On September 7, two people were seriously injured in Khuzdar’s Naal area when an improvised explosive device was detonated, police said.
Last month, security forces gunned down 50 terrorists over a four-day operation, foiling an attempt by militants to cross over from Afghanistan into Balochistan.</p><small>2025-09-17 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624134-govt-sees-a-conspiracy-behind-exaggerated-audit-figures-to-target-system' target='_blank'><strong>Govt sees conspiracy behind 'exaggerated audit figures' to target system</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking at an event organised by the Islamabad Policy Research  Institute (IPRI) on Tuesday, retired Lt Gen Khalid Ahmed Kidwai said that the country’s Full Spectrum Deterrence  (FSD) — or minimum credible deterrence — was never compromised during  the May standoff with India.
Lt Gen Kidwai, an adviser to the country’s National Command Authority (NCA), also noted that the newly-formed Army Rocket Force Command (ARFC)  will raise the nuclear threshold by providing an additional layer of  strategic deterrence between conventional operations and the potential  employment of nuclear forces.
 
 

He explained that the ARFC has merely a response to modern battlefield needs, while the nuclear deterrent remains in place as the ultimate  shield against India.
A former head of the army’s Strategic Plans Division (SPD), Gen. Kidwai said that Pakistan’s FSD worked in both directions, east and west, and it was no ‘bluff’, according to a press release issued after the event.
He stressed that, unlike India, Pakistan has repeatedly demonstrated that restraint and responsibility are the key components of its nuclear policy.
 
 

“The large size of the Indian army does not tell the entire story… quality, technology, and training are the force multipliers that determine the victor in an armed confrontation,” he remarked.
“India not only failed to achieve any of its politico-strategic-military objectives, but it also suffered major military reverses, especially in the IAF,” he pointed out.

In a meeting with Yin Tongyue, the chairman of Chery Automobile Company Ltd, the president encouraged the firm to explore joint ventures in electric buses, mini trucks, green energy solutions and charging infrastructure.
He also highlighted opportunities for collaboration with Pakistani companies in manufacturing, minerals and energy storage solutions.
Mr Yin briefed the president and his delegation on Chery Auto’s global operations, its commitment to technological innovation, and its achievements in international markets.
 







Witnesses accords on agriculture, mass transit, environment

Meanwhile, Zhu Xiaoping, CEO and Co-founder of SUS Environment Technology, a leading Chinese waste management company, also called on the president.
Discussions focused on urban was­­te management, waste-to-energy projects and integrated treatment solutions.
President Zardari underlined Pakistan’s need for modern waste management systems, especially in Sindh, and welcomed the prospect of cooperation.
Mr Zhu shared his firm’s experience in advanced waste treatment and expressed an interest in investing in Pakistan.
 






In a separate meeting with Chen Jining, secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), President Zardari reaffirmed that Pakistan-China ties are unshakeable, saying that while spoilers and hostile elements may try to harm the relationship, they will never succeed.
Chen also briefed the president on Shanghai’s transformation. Once a manufacturing hub, the city has become a major centre of the services industry, with significant inve­stments in healthcare and education, resulting in higher life expectancy than other parts of China.
 






The meeting also discussed op­­portunities for industrial collaboration in Pakistan’s Special Economic Zones and Gwadar Free Zone, particularly in technology, IT, artificial intelligence and innovation.
President Zardari also witnessed the signing of three Memoranda of Understanding to advance Pakis­tan’s agricultural, environmental and mass transit initiatives, in Sha­nghai, China.

“The Pakistan Cricket Board has not yet made any final decision regarding the Asia Cup,” PCB spokesperson Amir Mir said in a statement that came late on Tuesday night, following what Dawn learnt was a meeting involving officials from the board and the government in Islamabad.
“Consultations are ongoing in this regard, and a final decision will be made by tomorrow,” the spokesperson added. “The decision will be made keeping in view Pakistan’s interests.”
 






The PCB correspondence was followed by Pakistan’s decision to not hold their pre-match press conference ahead of their final Group ‘A’ fixture against hosts UAE.
The Pakistan team did, however, turn up for practice on the eve of the game.
 






“Pakistan has decided not to hold their pre-match press conference today,” a short message from the Asian Cricket Council said.
The PCB was awaiting a response from the International Cricket Council over a protest about match referee Andy Pycroft.
The Zimbabwean oversaw Sunday’s politically charged clash with India, after which the victorious India team refused to shake hands with the Pakistan players.
The PCB alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav before the match.
Pycroft is scheduled to be the match referee for the game on Wednesday as reports coming out from India claimed the ICC had rejected Pakistan’s demand.
“Late last night, ICC had sent a reply to PCB stating that Pycroft won’t be removed and their plea has been rejected,” an ICC source told the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency on Tuesday.
 
 

According to PTI sources, Pakistan cancelled their pre-match press conference “to avoid questions on the widely reported threat of a pullout” from the tournament.
Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema had also filed a complaint with the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) alleging that it was on Pycroft’s insistence that team sheets weren’t exchanged between the two skippers on Sunday as is the norm.
Pakistan could potentially lose out on revenue worth $16 million if they forfeit their remaining Asia Cup matches, the PTI said.
It is understood that PCB is trying to work out a respectable solution by which Pycroft doesn’t officiate in their matches, added the agency. One proposal given by the PCB is to have Richie Richardson stand in its match against the UAE but whether that would happen or not is the big question.
If Pakistan beat the home side in Dubai they will face neighbours India again on Sunday in the next round.
Last Sunday’s seven-wicket defeat to India was the first time the rivals had faced off in cricket since the countries fought a brief but deadly border conflict in May.
According to PTI, the situation arose due to PCB’s international cricket director Usman Wahla, who didn’t apprise Salman about the rules and regulations that are to be followed during the tournament.
It is learnt that an irate PCB chief Mohsin, who is also the current chairman of the ACC, ordered the sacking of Walha on Monday “for the embarrassment caused to the national cricket team and its captain”, PTI said.

The drama began late Sunday night, when reports emerged on social media that a leopard had been spotted in the Sathra area. Residents fanned out with torches and mobile phone lights to trace it, but in vain.
CCTV footage that surfaced later showed the animal roaming through Madina Market, a busy commercial hub about a kilometre away, without coming into contact with night watchmen or passers-by.
On Monday morning, the big cat was sighted in the Central Plate neighbourhood near Jinnah Dental Hospital, where it leapt past a female resident and crouched in an open plot beside her house. “Surprisingly, it was not violent but friendly,” she recalled.
Another resident, Raja Asad Khan, described his unnerving face-to-face encounter when the leopard jumped into his house. “As I stepped out of the washroom, I suddenly found myself staring at it. I swiftly locked the room, retreated to safety and alerted emergency services,” he said, adding that the animal appeared overwhelmed rather than aggressive. “It did not deliberately target my house. It was simply fleeing human pursuit.”
Police and wildlife teams rushed to the spot, but the leopard slipped away again, sparking conflicting reports about its whereabouts and a flood of memes on social media.
Later in the day, the animal entered a scrap warehouse along Plate Road owned by Matiullah Khan, an Afghan national settled in Muzaffarabad. His children managed to lock it in a room, but the leopard forced its way out through a narrow opening and climbed onto the roof before disappearing into a three-foot-wide alley, hemmed in by tall buildings, leading to a basement where it eventually got stuck.
Wildlife teams attempted to tranquilize it with a dart gun, but the confined space made it nearly impossible to strike properly. By Tuesday morning, the leopard had become visibly stressed and vets advised against sedation, fearing it could prove fatal.
At this stage, Mr Khan volunteered to take matters into his own hands.
Donning a helmet and gloves provided by the wildlife department, he crawled into the cavity with ropes as cameras rolled.
“It attacked me thrice, but I didn’t give up. I wanted to rid this city, which gave me livelihood and respect, of fear and panic,” he later told Dawn.
With assistance from wildlife watchers Junaid Akram and Raja Mudassar and local volunteer Hasnain Ali Khokhar, the leopard was finally subdued and dragged into the open, before being shifted to an iron cage.
The animal, believed to be aged between 1.5 and 2.5 years, was later transported to the wildlife department’s rehabilitation centre in Chela neighbourhood.
“We will keep it under observation to monitor its behaviour, following which it will be released into its natural habitat,” said Wildlife Monitoring Officer Dr Shaista Ali.
“At the moment, it is healthy and active, but if its condition deteriorates we will transfer it to Islamabad,” she told Dawn.
Since the leopard had shown little aggression during its early encounters and it remained unclear how it had strayed into the city, many residents speculated it might have been a pet.
Dr Ali, however, said it was too early to either confirm or rule out that possibility.

• Flour prices in KP jump 68pc; 20kg bag hits Rs2,800
• KP Assembly passes unanimous resolution against Punjab’s move
LAHORE: Punjab’s unannounced ban on the interprovincial movement of wheat has ignited a new crisis, causing a severe flour shortage and soaring prices in other provinces.
The move has drawn sharp criticism from politicians and flour millers who argue it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement.
While Punjab officials de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. Critics, however, argued that these mea­sures are against the spirit of a deregulated market.
The ban has been met with strong condemnation from other provinces, particularly Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa and Sindh, which heavily depend on Punj­ab’s wheat supply.
The All-Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA) has labelled the policy unconstitutional, citing Article 151 of the Constit­ution, which guarantees the freedom of trade and commerce across the country.
According to Riazullah Khan, chairman of the Punjab Flour Mills Associa­tion, checkpoints at the province’s exit points are bloc­king the transport of wheat and flour to other regions. He said that these actions run counter to the deregulation policy, which promised unrestricted trade and movement of wheat.
As a result of the restrictions, flour prices have skyrocketed in provinces like KP, where a 20kg bag of flour is now selling for up to Rs2,800, compared to around Rs1,800 in Punjab. This has placed an unbearable burden on low-income families already struggling with inflation.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi publicly condemned the ban, calling it a “blatant violation of Article 151” and a “serious breach of national unity”. The KP Assembly has also adopted a unanimous resolution denouncing Punjab’s restrictions on wheat supply, citing a 68 per cent hike in flour prices in the province.
 
 

It is not a new phenomenon but a recurring issue that resurfaces whenever there is a shortage of wheat, often caused by natural disasters such as floods or by low production due to inadequate or poor-quality farm inputs, particularly urea and DAP fertilisers. The country witnessed the same issue in 2020, 2022 and 2023.
The problem deepened when Punjab, which traditionally procured and stocked more than four million tonnes each harvest to stabilise prices and ensure year-round availability of grain, withdrew from this role under international agreements.
Govt stance vs market realities
Punjab officials maintained that the restrictions are a necessary measure to ensure food security within the province and to combat hoarding and smuggling.
They argued that preventing wheat from being diverted to feed mills or sold to other provinces at inflated prices is essential for ensuring a stable supply for local consumers.
They also pointed to the National Finance Commission award, under which each province is responsible for its own food security and should not blame other federating units for shortages.
However, millers and market analysts argued that this policy is counterproductive. They contended that the ban creates an artificial shortage, leading to market instability and driving up prices nationwide.
The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) has consistently advocated for a deregulated wheat market, arguing that bans on interprovincial movement only create inefficiency and corruption.
Majid Abdullah, president of the Progressive Flour Millers Group, warned that if administrative measures to regulate the so-called deregulated market continue, the private sector will be reluctant to invest in the wheat sector next season.
This could force the government to import grain at much higher rates than what is available locally. Abdullah highlighted the irony of the situation, noting that Punjab authorities had previously encouraged private investment, even offering bank loans for the purpose of purchasing large quantities of grain during harvest season.
He added that without proper legal protection, the deregulation process remains uncertain and vulnerable to being reversed by a future government, which could make private investment in storage facilities worthless.
“Stability of the market needs a consistent, thorough policy protected by a proper piece of legislation,” Mr Abdullah stated.
Farmers’ woes
The ban also has a ripple effect on farmers. While the government aims to secure a stable price for consumers, its actions are seen as a disincentive for farmers.
They may choose to plant other crops in the upcoming sowing season if they cannot get a fair price for their wheat, which could lead to a significant decline in domestic production and force the country to rely on costly imports.
Mr Abdullah cautioned that administrative efforts to control prices, especially with the next sowing season approaching, will discourage farmers who are already hesitant to plant wheat after failing to get good prices for their produce in the last two seasons.
The situation underscores a deep-seated tension between the government’s desire to control prices for the public and the free-market principles essential for a healthy agricultural economy.
The federal government, under pressure from affected provinces, is now being urged to intervene and restore the free movement of wheat to avert a full-blown food crisis.

A senior FIA official said that suspect Waqas Ali, a resident of Pasroor, Sialkot, was arrested in a case on Sept 15.
The official said the suspect, with the connivance of 17 immigrants, managed to get 15-day visit visas of Japan on the invitation of Boavista Football Club.
The official claimed that he used forged Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) registration letter and a fake NOC from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The official claimed that the suspect extorted Rs4 to 4.5 millions from each of the 17 person. He said that they travelled to Japan on January 1, 2024 and never returned.
FIA Gujranwala Director Muhammad Bin Ashraf told Dawn that a case had been registered against the suspect and further investigation was ongoing.
The suspect was also nominated in another similar case at FIA Gujranwala circle for sending a 22-member fake football team to Japan on June 15, 2025. However, the group was deported by the Japanese immigration authorities from the airport and the matter was then reported to the FIA.
The FIA launched an inquiry and finally arrested the suspect and registered cases against him.

The Ministry of Energy (Petr­o­leum Division), in a notification to Ogra and two gas utilities — SNGPL and SSGCL — conveyed that the federal cabinet in its meeting on Sept 10 relaxed the moratorium imposed on the provision of new connections with the direction that “RLNG shall not be provided to new consumers at any subsidised rate”.
Under the decision, Sui companies have been allowed “to process all applications for provision of connections on RLNG based on Ogra-determined and notified monthly RLNG tariff for distribution network”, the Petroleum Division said, adding that the cabinet also app­roved a framework for processing of RLNG-based connections.
 
 

Under the approved framework, the annual target for RLNG-based domestic connections will be decided by Ogra based on projected availability of RLNG in the network and the capacity of Sui companies to process the applications.
“Consum­ers who have already paid the connections fee, demand note or urgent fee for indigenous gas connections will have priority provided they pay the differential of security and sign the exclusive RLNG Supply Cont­ract,” it said, adding that the merit list for processing all such applications will be assigned from the date of payment of the differential of security or the demand note fee.

Lifts moratorium, with tariffs and fees set at Rs40,000-50,000 per connection

The framework also allowed the Sui companies to demand an undertaking from the applicant for seeking prior consent for processing an RLNG connection. In contrast, the security deposit and connection fees would be determined by Ogra from time to time, in line with existing practices.
Up to 50pc of the yearly quota of RLNG-based domestic connections would be considered for processing on an urgent fee basis. These connections will be provided within three months of the payment of the urgent fee, considering the availability of the network.
The cabinet also directed that “merit lists of older applications on indigenous gas will be rendered null and void and only a new merit list for demand notices will be issued in the RLNG category, considering the new application date and date of payment of the demand notice”.
Additionally, the Sui companies will cease immediately acknowledging new applications for indigenous gas connections and will only admit applications submitted by consumers for RLNG supply.
On top of this, the disconnected domestic consumers with an ageing of more than one year would be converted into RLNG connections at the time of reconnection, subject to signing of a revised gas supply contract, the framework read, adding that Sui companies will maintain a separate merit list for RLNG-based new bulk and special domestic connections.
Additionally, the policy of providing RLNG-based domestic connections to all areas will be implemented prospectively. The existing operational indigenous gas connections shall continue to be billed at the system gas tariff as approved by the Federal Government from time to time.
Under the RLNG rate notified by Ogra for the current month, the new consumers would get gas supply at Rs4,000 per unit (including sales tax) that would keep fluctuating on a monthly basis compared to the current average sale domestic gas rate of about Rs2000 per mmBtu. While the Ogra would set the connection fee, it has been proposed to be almost four times the existing connection fee.
The first-year target of 120,000 connections has been assumed.
 
 

Priority would be given to applicants who had previously been issued demand notices or had paid the urgent fee but could not get connections because of a ban that followed. The number of new connections is expected to increase for next year.
Around 250,000 applicants fall in this category, who would have to file affidavits not to approach courts for their past claims and enhance their connection fee. Before the ban, consumers were allowed to pay an upfront fee of Rs25,000 to secure a connection on a priority basis, unlike the routine Rs5000-7500 fee. On the other hand, a new connection on LNG earlier entailed a Rs15,000 fee.
At present, more than 3.5 million applications for new connections are pending with the gas companies. While new connections provide an additional avenue for the gas companies to claim a guaranteed return on fixed assets (pipelines and related infrastructure), this also leads to higher gas losses and lower revenue recoveries on top of greater gas shortages in winter.
No wonder, then, that the Lahore-based Sui Northern is rationing gas supplies even before the peak winter demand, providing gas to domestic consumers for only 6-9 hours per day — the equivalent of breakfast, lunch, and dinner cooking times. The recent increase in fixed charges starting July 1 by 50pc provides an additional incentive to secure higher funds without additional gas supply.
The moratorium on new gas connections was imposed in 2009, partially removed after six years, and then reinstated in 2022 due to rising gas shortages. The new connection fee would now be set at Rs40,000-50,000 and the consumers would be billed at the notified regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) price — currently at about Rs3300 per mmBtu. The final price, including general sales tax, would cross Rs4000 per mmBtu. The average gas price for high-end domestic consumers with a monthly consumption of 300 cubic meters currently stands at Rs3,300 per mmBtu. It increases to Rs4,200 per mmBtu for consumption exceeding 400 cubic meters.

In Punjab, often dubbed the country’s granary, the damage is unprecedented: floods have swallowed farmlands almost the size of London and New York City combined.
India’s agriculture minister said in a recent visit to the state that “the crops have been destroyed and ruined”, and Indian Punjab chief minister called the deluge “one of the worst flood disasters in decades”.
Old-timers agree. “The last time we saw such an all-consuming flood was in 1988,” said 70-year-old Balkar Singh in the village of Shehzada, 30km north of Amritsar.
The gushing waters have reduced Singh’s paddy field to marshland and opened ominous cracks in the walls of his house.
Floods and landslides are common during the June-September monsoon season on the subcontinent, but experts say climate change, coupled with poorly planned development, is increasing their frequency, severity and impact.
Punjab saw rainfall surge by almost two-thirds compared with the average rate for August, according to the national weather department, killing at least 52 people and affecting over 400,000.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a relief package worth around $180 million for Punjab.
‘10 feet high’
The village of Toor is in tatters — strewn with collapsing crops, livestock carcasses and destroyed homes.
“The water came past midnight on August 26,” said farm worker Surjan Lal.
“It rose up to at least 10 feet (three metres) in a matter of minutes.” Lal said the village in Punjab’s worst-affected Gurdaspur district was marooned for nearly a week.
“We were all on rooftops,” he said. “We could do nothing as the water carried away everything from our animals and beds.”
In adjacent Lassia, the last Indian village before the frontier, farmer Rakesh Kumar counted his losses. “In addition to the land I own, I had taken some more on lease this year,” said the 37-year-old. “All my investment has just gone down the drain.”  To make things worse, Kumar said, the future looked bleak. He said he feared his fields would not be ready in time to sow wheat, the winter crop of choice in Punjab.
“All the muck has to first dry up and only then can the big machines clear up the silt,” he said.
Even at the best of times, bringing heavy earth-movers into the area is a tall order, as a pontoon bridge connecting it to the mainland only operates in the lean months.
For landless labourers like 50-year-old Mandeep Kaur, the uncertainty is even greater.
“We used to earn a living by working in the big landlords’ fields but now they are all gone,” said Kaur.
Her house was washed away by the water, forcing her to sleep in the courtyard under a tarpaulin sheet — an arrangement fraught with danger as snakes slither all over the damp land.
Basmati blues
Punjab is the largest supplier of rice and wheat to India’s food security programme, which provides subsidised grain to more than 800 million people.
Analysts say this year’s losses are unlikely to threaten domestic supplies thanks to large buffer stocks, but exports of premium basmati rice are expected to suffer.
“The main effect will be on basmati rice production, prices and exports because of lower output in Indian and Pakistan Punjab,” said Avinash Kishore of the International Food Policy Research Institute in New Delhi.

Zalmay Khalilzad, who was named US special representative to Afghanistan during the previous Trump administration, also called on Afghanistan to “help Pakistan with such negotiations”.
The former diplomat recently undertook a visit to Kabul alongside US hostage envoy Adam Boehler, where he met with key members of the Afghan Taliban regime.
In a tweet posted after he wrapped up his visit, Khalilzad noted that violence between Pakistan’s security forces and the TTP had resulted in the deaths of a significant number of security personnel and citizens.

Imran echoes Khalilzad’s views, terms dialogue with Kabul only way to achieve lasting peace

Saying that he believed pursuing a military solution to this challenge was a mistake, he called on Islamabad to “shift to a political strategy and negotiate”.
“The Pakistani establishment always advised the US and Afghan government before 2021 to negotiate and seek a political settlement with the Afghan Taliban. The time has come for Pakistan to consider doing the same,” he said.
 






The timing of the message is significant, as it comes just days after PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir gave Kabul a stark choice.
“I want to give a clear message to Afghanistan to choose between Pakistan and TTP,” PM Shehbaz had said during a visit to Bannu alongside the army chief.
Although President Trump and US military officials such as CENTCOM chief Gen Michael Kurilla have repeatedly praised Pakistan’s counterterror cooperation — with the arrest of IS-Khorasan operative who targeted the Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate in 2021 being a highlight — Khalilzad’s message seems to be the first indication that the US wants both Islamabad and Kabul to come to the table.
 
 

In Washington circles, Khalilzad is viewed as a hawk. He openly sympathises with jailed PTI founder Imran Khan and has — in the past — reserved critical words for Pakistan.
In a tweet posted just last month, he claimed that Afghanistan’s successful operations against IS-Khorasan had pushed their leadership into Pakistan and alleged that the latter was now becoming a ‘safe haven’ for the militant group.
Imran echoes dialogue call
Khalilzad’s remarks echoed the views of the incarcerated former PM, who has also called for dialogue to address the militancy currently pla­guing the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — where his party is in power.
In a tweet posted to his X account on Tuesday, Mr Khan said that operations initiated in the former tribal areas were leading to rising police, military and civilian casualties.
“This approach can ne­­v­er establish peace. Las­t­ing peace only comes thr­ough dialogue,” he said. He alleged that what was being attempted in KP was merely an atte­mpt to discredit the PTI government, and claimed a military operation would only fuel further terrorism.
As police are diverted to counter the rising threat from terrorism, governance and law and order will collapse, he said. He urged all KP lawmakers to sit with the chief minister to urgently resolve the challenges of the province, and called on his allies — namely Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai — to send a peace delegation to Afghanistan.
