The attack occurred at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra on the city’s outskirts. The death toll was expected to rise.
“A 21-year-old man, who was brought from the imambargah, died,” said Dr Aneeza Jalil while speaking to Dawn. She added that nine of the injured are in “very serious condition”.
“The number of deaths has reached 33, and nine patients are in very serious condition.”
She further stated that 149 injured and 28 bodies were brought to Pims on Friday following the attack.
Separately, HBS Hospital’s Dr Riaz Janjua confirmed to Dawn that three deaths from the attack were reported at his hospital.
Victims laid to rest
Funerals are taking place on Saturday for some of the victims of a suicide blast at an imambargah in Islamabad during Friday prayers.
A mass funeral for 13 victims of the Tarlai attack was held in the federal capital, with a large crowd in attendance. Chairman of Interior Affairs Raja Khurram Nawaz attended the prayers.
Inspector Bahadur Ali of Gilgit-Baltistan, martyred in the attack, was also laid to rest with full honours at Police Lines Headquarters.
Senior police officers, including Islamabad IGP Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, attended the funeral. The body was later dispatched to his native area with full state honours.

 


“The attacker was stopped at the gate and detonated himself,” a security source told AFP.
Muhammad Kazim, 52, said an “extremely powerful” explosion ripped through the building as prayers were just starting.
Another worshipper, Imran Mahmood, told AFP there was a gunfight between the bomber and volunteer security personnel at the mosque.

“The suicide attacker was trying to move forward, but one of our injured volunteers fired at him from behind, hitting him in the thigh,” he told AFP.
He then “detonated the explosives”, Mahmood added.
Friday’s attack was the deadliest in the Pakistani capital since September 2008, when 60 people were killed in a suicide truck bomb blast that destroyed part of the five-star Marriott hotel.
Suicide bomber’s identity
Sources close to the investigation told Dawn that the attacker — whose severed head was found at the crime scene — had been identified as a resident of Gunj, in the walled city of Peshawar. They said that forensic investigators tracked his identity through the Nadra database.
Preliminary investigation suggested that he was linked to the IS militant group and had travelled to Afghanistan multiple times.
The Peshawar police are also being approached to interrogate the family and the relatives of the suicide bomber and collect the other relevant details.
Investigators said that all angles are being probed in this regard, and geo-fencing of the area was being conducted to identify other suspects.
Authorities were conducting forensic sweeps of the crime scene, while CCTV footage from nearby cameras has been obtained to track the attackers.
When approached, a senior Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police official told Dawn that they were making a lot of progress in the investigation.
Another source said that raids were being conducted, and that some of the suspected bomber’s relatives had been picked up in Nowshera.

In February 2025, Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) and China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) had signed a cooperation agreement. Under the pact, two Pakistanis would train in China, with one joining a mission on the Tiangong space station operated by Beijing.
In a press release, the ISPR said Suparco had “achieved yet another significant milestone in Pakistan’s Human Spaceflight Programme with the successful completion of the secondary phase of astronaut candidates’ selection”.
“Following an initial screening process in Pakistan, the candidates were shortlisted after undergoing comprehensive medical, psychological, and aptitude assessments conducted at the Astronauts Centre of China (ACC), in accordance with international human spaceflight standards,” the statement read.
As per the bilateral agreement, the two shortlisted candidates will undertake “advanced astronaut training” for six months at ACC. Upon completion of the training, one candidate will be selected for a spaceflight mission aboard the Tiangong space station in October / November 2026, the press release added.



The ISPR noted the cooperation was anchored on the bilateral “Astronaut Cooperation Agreement” signed in February 2025 “under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, “whose vision and support were instrumental in enabling Pakistan’s participation in human spaceflight”.
“This landmark initiative also reflects the strong support of the Government of the People’s Republic of China, which selected Pakistan as the first foreign partner in its astronaut programme,” the ISPR highlighted.
At the February 2025 signing ceremony of the cooperation agreement, PM Shehbaz had said that Islamabad, in collaboration with Beijing, would send its first manned space mission to China’s space station.
The CMSA later confirmed that two Pakistani astronauts would be trained in China, with one expected to join a future mission to the Tiangong space station as a payload specialist.

 

CMSA spokesperson Lin Xiqiang said the selected astronaut would conduct scientific experiments on behalf of Pakistan while also performing standard crew duties aboard the station.
He noted that the said the selection would follow the same three-stage process (preliminary, secon­dary, and final) used for Chinese astronauts.
China has been barred from particip­ating in the International Space Station since 2011, when the US prohibited Nasa from collaborating with Chinese space agencies. Since then, Beijing has sought to build partnerships with other countries — including Pakistan — in its expanding space programme.</p><small>2026-02-07 08:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/071219017012f69.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971648/in-meeting-with-iranian-ambassador-dar-reiterates-commitment-to-strengthening-bilateral-ties' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with Iranian ambassador, Dar reiterates commitment to strengthening bilateral ties</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening engagement with Iran in a meeting with the Iranian ambassador, Raza Amiri Moghaddam, in Islamabad on Saturday.
Ambassador Moghaddam conveyed condolences over yesterday’s tragic suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad, in which over 30 people were killed, the FO said in a post on X.
Dar “strongly condemned the terrorist attack, and reaffirmed Pakistan’s firm resolve to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations”, the FO said.







The Iranian envoy also briefed Dar on progress achieved through various bilateral institutional mechanisms to enhance cooperation across diverse areas.
The foreign minister reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening engagement with Iran in key priority sectors of mutual interest, the FO added.
Pakistan and Iran share close ties, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif having spoken with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian last week on the “evolving regional situation”.
According to a handout from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), PM Shehbaz “underscored the importance of sustained dialogue and diplomatic engagement for promoting peace, security and development in the region”.
The call came hours after Dar had underscored the importance of dialogue and diplomacy in a phone call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
Russian ambassador expresses condolences over loss of life
Earlier, the foreign minister also received the Russian ambassador to Pakistan, Albert P Khorev, according to a separate FO statement on social media.
“The two sides reviewed the entire gamut of Pakistan-Russia relations and reaffirmed their shared commitment to further strengthening bilateral ties,” the statement said.
The ambassador expressed condolences over the precious loss of lives in the Islamabad blast. The foreign minister again strongly condemned the heinous act of terror and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering resolve to combat terrorism, expressing solidarity with the victims’ families.

According to the Foreign Office (FO), United Nations Special Secretary Ambassador Nabeel Munir and the director general (Americas) participated in the consultations, while the Canadian side was represented by Assistant Deputy Minister (Indo-Pacific) from Global Affairs Canada, Ambassador Weldon Epp and High Commissioner Tarik Ali Khan.
A press release by the FO said that the two sides expressed satisfaction over the steady growth of bilateral relations, marked by recent “substantive interactions” between Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand.
“They noted that these engagements had provided strategic guidance and momentum to the partnership and reaffirmed their shared commitment to further deepen these ties,” the FO statement said.







Recognising the significant untapped potential in the relationship, both sides expressed their readiness to improve the implementation of existing agreements and identify new avenues for cooperation, the statement added.
“In this regard, they emphasised the importance of strengthening trade and economic cooperation, including greater support to business communities, facilitation of the trade delegations and enhanced institutional linkages,” it said.
The two sides also emphasised cooperation in “trade and investment, agriculture and agri-tech, mining and minerals, energy, climate change, artificial intelligence and information and communications technology, skilled workforce development, education and research, tourism and people-to-people exchanges” as key drivers for taking the relationship forward.
They also underscored the central role of investment in achieving sustainable and mutually beneficial growth, and agreed to work towards encouraging the private sector to explore emerging opportunities, according to the FO.
The countries exchanged views on the evolving global and regional environment and discussed key multilateral issues of mutual interest, agreeing to maintain regular consultations.
They further expressed confidence that sustained engagement would lead to new progress in the bilateral partnership.
In November, the two countries had issued a joint statement saying that they had agreed to facilitate the export of Canadian canola to Pakistan.
Canada has been looking to open new markets for the commodity after China announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports in August, a year after Canada said it would levy a 100 per cent tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles.</p><small>2026-02-07 07:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649515-bushra-family-meeting-allowed-under-strict-no-politics-condition' target='_blank'><strong>Bushra Bibi allowed family meeting under strict 'no politics' condition</strong></a><br><p>

The case in Bangladesh, where Nipah cases are reported almost every year, follows two Nipah virus cases identified in neighbouring India, which has already prompted stepped-up airport screenings across Asia.
The patient in Bangladesh, aged between 40 and 50 years, developed symptoms consistent with Nipah virus on January 21, including fever and headache followed by hypersalivation, disorientation and convulsion, the WHO added.
She died a week later and was confirmed to be infected with the virus a day later.
The person had no travel history but had a history of consuming raw date palm sap.
All 35 people who had contact with the patient are being monitored and have tested negative for the virus, and no further cases have been detected to date, the WHO said.
Nipah is an infection that spreads mainly through products contaminated by infected bats, such as fruit. It can be fatal in up to 75 per cent of cases, but it does not spread easily between people.
Countries including Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Pakistan implemented temperature screenings at airports after India said cases of the virus had been found in West Bengal.

 

The WHO said on Friday that the risk of international disease spread is considered low and that it does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions based on current information.
In 2025, four laboratory-confirmed fatal cases were reported in Bangladesh.
There are currently no licensed medicines or vaccines specific for the infection.</p><small>2026-02-07 06:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649511-karachi-reports-225-fire-outbreaks-in-january-alone' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi reports 225 fire outbreaks in January alone</strong></a><br><p>

The framework reaffirms a commitment to negotiations toward a broader bilateral trade agreement, the two governments said in a joint statement, while noting that further negotiations were needed to complete the pact.
US President Donald Trump announced a deal with India on Monday to cut US tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent from 50pc in exchange for India halting purchases of Russian oil and lowering trade barriers.
Half of the 50pc rate had been imposed separately by Trump as punishment for India’s purchases of Russian oil, which he said were fuelling Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.
Trump signed an executive order on Friday rescinding that 25pc portion after India agreed this week to shift its oil buying to the US and Venezuela.
However, the statement indicated that New Delhi resisted Washington’s push to broadly open its agricultural market.
Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said in a social media post on X the agreement safeguards farmers interests and rural livelihoods by completely protecting sensitive agricultural and dairy products, including staples such as maize, wheat and rice, as well as soya, poultry, milk products, ethanol, tobacco and some vegetables and meat.







India’s opposition Congress party, however, said the trade deal was concluded largely on US terms and hurt farmers and traders, calling it a pact that compromised national interests.
New details on tariff reduction
Friday’s joint statement provides additional details compared with initial outlines of the trade deal revealed by Trump on Monday.
It confirms that India will purchase $500 billion in US goods over a five-year period, including oil, gas, coking coal, aircraft and aircraft parts, precious metals, and technology products.
The last category includes graphics processing units, typically used for AI applications, and other goods used in data centers.
It said India would eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a wide range of US food and agricultural products, including dried distillers’ grains and red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits.
US to keep 18pc tariff
But the deal will apply an 18pc tariff rate on most imports to the US from India, including textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, plastic and rubber, organic chemicals, home decor, artisanal products and certain machinery.
India will get the same tariff relief granted to other allied countries that have signed trade deals with the United States on certain aircraft and aircraft parts, and will receive a quota for auto parts imports that will be subject to a lower tariff rate, according to the statement.
Depending on the results of the Trump administration’s tariff investigation into pharmaceuticals and their ingredients, “India will receive negotiated outcomes with respect to generic pharmaceuticals and ingredients,” the statement said.







Goyal hailed the framework agreement as opening a market worth $30 trillion - the US annual GDP - to Indian exporters, especially farmers, fishermen, and micro and small-to-medium enterprises.
Goyal had said on Thursday that Washington and New Delhi aimed to sign a formal trade agreement in March, after which India’s tariff cuts on US exports would go into effect.
Accepting US standards
India also agreed to address longstanding non-tariff barriers on imports of agriculture products, medical devices and communications gear, with negotiations to be completed within six months on an agreement to accept US or international safety and licensing standards for product imports.
The US affirmed that it intends to consider India’s requests for lower tariffs on Indian goods during further negotiations of the bilateral trade agreement.
The two sides also agreed to cooperate on enforcement of export controls on sensitive technologies and take actions to address “non-market policies of third parties,” a reference to China.
The United States and India have struggled for years to conclude a full trade deal, with disputes spanning agriculture, digital trade, medical devices and market access. But strategic concerns including competition with China, supply-chain diversification and energy security have injected new urgency into talks, officials in both countries say.</p><small>2026-02-07 05:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/698685f41c03d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971580/governing-beyond-diagnosis' target='_blank'><strong>Governing beyond diagnosis</strong></a><br><p>PAKISTAN’S recurring economic crises are often framed as failures of fiscal discipline or external shocks. Yet, perhaps the deeper, more enduring hurdle, as indicated by the IMF’s Pakis­tan: Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Report, released last November, lies in the ongoing erosion of governance, a rules-based administration and public accountability. Economic fragility is more than figures on a balance sheet. It is what is generated cumulatively by weak institutions, discretionary power and compromised oversight. The GCD provides an in-depth diagnosis of these shortcomings, offering an opportunity for course correction, if the rulers resolve to address its findings.
The GCD does not identify corruption as isolated transgressions put together; instead, what it underlines is the systemic weakness of governance arrangements that favour selectiveness over the rules and secrecy over transparency. We can see a similar pattern across fiscal management, market regulation, financial oversight and the justice system. In all these, authority becomes fragmented, internal controls are weak, appointments politicised and accountability is limited. These factors do more than enable corruption; they normalise it. Thus we see rent-seeking in everyday administration. NAB and FIA, the two major national institutions mandated to combat corruption, are used openly by the ruling elite for political engineering and settling scores against opponents.
In the absence of an independent judiciary, the rule of law, which is the bedrock of any functioning economy, is similarly compromised. Both legal certainty and investor confidence are shaken when faced with huge case backlogs, a plethora of special courts and tribunals, and judicial appointments widely seen as opaque. This results in businesses avoiding formal dispute resolution; they prefer, instead, to take recourse in informal arrangements that only further entrench inequality and weaken institutional legitimacy. Reactive anti-corruption efforts, meanwhile, result in a skewed approach. High-profile prosecutions might be headline news but do little to rectify vulnerabilities that encourage corruption.
The GCD’s policy recommendations are, by and large, sensible and aligned with good international practice. They include a level procurement playing field, end-to-end e-procurement, rationalising business regulations and strengthening audit independence, besides improving the effectiveness of AML-CFT rules and laws. The GCD also suggests reforms for policy, revenue administration and public investment management. But the question implicit in the diagnostic is, why haven’t such reforms already taken root? True, to exit the FATF grey list, some concerted efforts did yield positive results through successfully investigating and prosecuting cases of terror financing and illicit financial flows. Subsequently, the creation of a federal-level Anti-Money Laundering Authority improved coordination and monitoring. The report acknowledges this.

The question implicit in the diagnostic is, why haven’t such reforms already taken root?

Civil society’s perspective is helpful in taking a holistic view of the governance paradigm. Numerous reform blueprints exist in the country but what is missing is sustained implementation that rejects political interference. It is all too often that governance reforms become technocratic exercises, instead of being seen as political and social projects. Informal power structures have diluted or reversed reform gains.
Moreover, while the report acknowledges, in principle, the importance of non-state actors, it does not bring in civil society, an independent media and citizen oversight into the reform architecture — a notable omission. In fact, in many foreign environments where formal checks and balances are weak, public scrutiny, investigative journalism and community monitoring have been useful curbs on power and its misuse.

 

Civil society, therefore should be treated as a central actor in reform — and not as a peripheral stakeholder. Its main role is that of an implementation watchdog. By systematically tracking reform commitments, budget allocations, procurement practices, and institutional performance, civil society organisations, academia and the media can help bridge the gap between policy adoption and practice. Independent scrutiny can sustain reform momentum beyond electoral cycles and expose backsliding that might otherwise go unpunished.
Second, civil society has the ability to boost evidence-based public discourse. It is easy for technically complex governance reforms to be buried in bureaucratic jargon. In fact, they should be translated into easily comprehensible analyses, which explain, for instance, how tax exemptions compromise tax equality or how loopholes in procurement inflate costs. This can inform parliamentary debate and improve public understanding. Strategic use of access-to-information laws can also expose the gaps between official claims and administrative reality.
Third, civil society can be a constructive policy interlocutor. Reforms will face resistance or capture unless there is consultation. Professional associations, research institutions and sectoral watchdogs are in a position to give solid feedback on regulatory burdens and service-delivery failures. Such engagement will strengthen the state itself, by anchoring policy in lived experience.
Last, there is a critical role for civil society to play in preventing corruption and inculcating the ethos of integrity. At points where the state’s oversight is at its weakest, community monitoring of development projects, procurement observation, budget tracking and awareness drive can discourage corruption. In the same vein, sustained advocacy against arbitrary exemptions in taxation can bring the consequences of elite privilege under scrutiny and build public support for an equitable tax base.
However, an enabling environment is essential for civil society to play its due role. Access to information, protection of civil space and institutional consultation are prerequisites for durable reform. Recent moves that weaken transparency — such as diluting asset-declaration requirements for legislators — negate the spirit of accountability the GCD emphasises, risking further erosion of the public’s trust.
In the final analysis, the GCD’s value lies in the choices we have. Governance reform cannot be episodic, crisis-driven or externally imposed; it must be rooted in constitutionalism, rules-based administration, and an informed and engaged citizenry. Economic recovery without institutional repair will always be fragile and prone to reversals. The challenge is not simply to implement another set of reforms, but to reclaim the idea of the state as a neutral, accountable and lawful custodian of public interest — a task that demands both political courage and civic vigilance.

Iran, for its part, said it expected to hold more negotiations with the United States, hailing a “positive atmosphere” during a day of talks in the Gulf sultanate.
With an American naval group led by an aircraft carrier in Middle Eastern waters, US and Iranian delegations held talks in Muscat mediated by Oman without publicly meeting face-to-face.
Shortly after the talks concluded, the US announced new sanctions against shipping entities and vessels, aimed at curbing Iran’s oil exports. But it was not clear if the move was linked to the talks.







The talks were the first between the two foes since the United States joined Israel’s war with Iran in June with strikes on nuclear sites.
“We likewise had very good talks on Iran,” Trump told reporters on board Air Force One en route to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, adding, “we’re going to meet again early next week.”
However, as Iran warned against further threats after Washington raised the spectre of new military action, Trump said: “If they don’t make a deal, the consequences are very steep.”
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led Iran’s delegation in Muscat, said talks “focused exclusively” on the Iranian nuclear program, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb but Tehran insists is peaceful.
The US delegation, led by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner, had also wanted Tehran’s backing for militant groups, its ballistic missile program and treatment of protesters on the agenda.
“In a very positive atmosphere, our arguments were exchanged and the views of the other side were shared with us,” Araghchi told Iranian state TV, adding that the two sides had “agreed to continue negotiations.”
Speaking to the official IRNA news agency, Araghchi expressed hope that Washington would refrain from “threats and pressure” so that “the talks can continue.”
‘Destabilizing power’
Admiral Brad Cooper, the commander of US Central Command, was present at the talks, according to images published by the Oman News Agency.
Multiple sessions of talks in the morning and afternoon saw both sides shuttling to and from the residence of Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi.
The foreign ministry of US ally Qatar expressed hope the talks would “lead to a comprehensive agreement that serves the interests of both parties and enhances security and stability in the region.”
The White House has made clear it wants the talks to rein in Tehran’s ability to make a nuclear bomb, an ambition the Islamic republic has always denied.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Friday that Iran should stop being a “destabilizing power,” citing its nuclear program and support for “terrorist” groups.
Barrot also called on “groups supported by Iran” to exert “the utmost restraint” in the event of any military escalation involving the Islamic republic.
‘Maximum pressure’
Trump initially threatened military action against Tehran over its crackdown on protesters last month, which rights groups say killed thousands, and even told demonstrators “help is on its way.”
Regional powers including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar urged the United States not to intervene, calling on Washington and Tehran to instead return to talks.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said Friday it has confirmed 6,505 protesters were killed, as well as 214 members of the security forces and 61 bystanders.
Those numbers are expected to climb because the magnitude of the crackdown has masked by the blanket internet shutdown imposed by the authorities for a fortnight, rights groups say.
Almost 51,000 people are also confirmed to have been arrested amid “the growing use of forced confessions,” according to HRANA.
Yet Trump’s rhetoric in recent days has focused on reining in the Iranian nuclear program and the US has maneuvered a naval group led by aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln into the region.Iran has repeatedly vowed it will hit back at US bases in the region if attacked.
The new sanctions to curb Iran’s oil exports come with Trump “committed to driving down the Iranian regime’s illicit oil and petrochemical exports under the administration’s maximum pressure campaign,” State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said in a statement.</p><small>2026-02-07 04:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0705272860a9524.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971577/india-caves' target='_blank'><strong>India caves</strong></a><br><p>IN the end US President Donald Trump got everything he wanted. When he imposed 50 per cent tariffs on India and described it as a “dead economy”, India vowed never to bend to US bullying. Things, it appears, have changed.
The story began last year when Trump imposed first 25pc and then 50pc tariffs on Indian exports. This caused a furore in India. First, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s grabby hugs and over-enthusiastic handshakes with Trump (Modi was among the first leaders to kiss the ring upon re-election) had convinced many Indians that they had an airtight relationship with Washington. As proof, they cited the bromance displayed during Trump’s first term. All that hand-holding must have meant something. Second, Indians could not believe that Pakistan scored a diplomatic victory following Operation Sindoor. Watching Pakistan included in summits and getting special mention from the president likely hurt even more than the tariffs.

 

On Indian TV shows, which are a masterclass in propaganda, news anchors suggested the tariffs would only hurt Americans and India would be largely unscathed. Much was said about self-sufficiency, national interest and protecting Indian farmers. India was never going to stop buying Russian oil, it was alleged. India’s darling Prime Minister Modi — that champion of the common man — would never relent on opening the Indian agricultural market to US goods. This was a victorious moment, Modi-bhakts declared. India would never bend.
Unsurprisingly, India was doing quite the opposite behind the scenes. According to The Times of India, Modi’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval travelled to the United States soon after the tariffs were imposed. There, Doval met Secretary of State Marco Rubio and conveyed that India wanted to put acrimony behind it and resume trade talks. To domestic audiences, Doval insisted that he had also made clear India would not be bullied. Apparently, he remained in contact with Rubio four more times before the year was out.

New Delhi’s inflated view of itself has received a reality check.

Later, when Trump’s adviser on South Asia Sergio Gor arrived in New Delhi, further talks were held, led on the Indian side by Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar. To domestic audiences, the BJP-led government kept insisting Modi was not bending and that his visits to Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin ‘showed’ America that India had options. The impact of such signalling or even more recent deal with the EU on Washington’s assessment of India’s importance is doubtful. US strategic documents released last year suggested a focus elsewhere, indicating that India’s own inflated assessment of its standing in Trump’s worldview was inaccurate and vastly hyped. Here again nationalism and India’s belief in its own importance impeded a realistic assessment of its position vis-à-vis global power shifts.
This month, India caved. The proof lies in the pudding, or the deal the Modi government agreed to. Under its terms, according to Trump, the US reduced its tariffs on Indian goods from 50pc to 18pc, while India agreed to slash its own duties on US goods to zero. This is a huge shift. India had imposed tariffs of up to 200pc on certain American products — something that irritated Trump so much that he mentioned it numerous times.
The new arrangement means the US continues to charge higher tariffs on Indian goods than before Trump 2.0, while India has dismantled many of the barriers it once defended. India further agreed to US demands regarding Russian oil purchases, which was a major sticking point that led to the tariffs in the first place. Addi­ti­o­nal­­ly, India agr­e­­ed to increase pur­cha­ses of US ene­­rgy and other goods.
Finally, and almost unbelievably, India agreed to give US agricultural goods access to the Indian domestic market while maintaining only a few key protections. This goes against all the loud promises Modi and his party had made about protecting Indian farmers, who form a substantial share of the economy. In the tumult unleashed since, the BJP has again begun mouthing reassurances about protecting the country’s farmers — a confusing posture that shows the vast chasm between trade negotiations abroad and the lies peddled at home.
Days after the deal, it already appears fragile. The Indian parliament has been thrown into turmoil, suggesting it may struggle to pass the agreement smoothly. This is just the sort of thing that annoys Trump, who has shown little patience for legislatures that fail to move quickly on trade commitments. The Modi government is now attempting to spin the deal as a victory, on the basis that Indian tariffs stand at 18pc while Pakistan’s are at 19pc. Sadly, this is the sort of rubbish that landed India at Trump’s feet in the first place.

This is also true in the case of yesterday’s barbaric suicide bombing of an imambargah in Islamabad during Friday prayers. It was the first sectarian massacre in several years, and the second major attack targeting the federal capital since last November’s blast outside a district and sessions court building.
The defence minister has said Afghanistan and India are responsible, but a deeper probe is required, as Pakistan has had to confront home-grown sectarian terrorism for the past four decades now. Officials say that the suspected bomber had travelled to Afghanistan, and initial findings suggest links to IS.
Various theories are being advanced by state functionaries, some of whom believe that the bombing could have been a response to the recent action against terrorists in Balochistan, though Baloch separatist groups are not usually known to carry out sectarian assaults. The attack is also being interpreted as the banned TTP’s handiwork — which is a strong possibility. Historically, groups that were known as the ‘Punjabi Taliban’, which later merged with the TTP, have a record of sectarian violence, and may have been reactivated to hit ‘soft’ targets.
IS has also been active in Pakistan, though the group has been largely quiet for a few years. This outfit has a similarly rabidly sectarian worldview. Only a thorough probe can unveil the real criminals behind this grotesque act of violence.
It must be asked how the terrorists were able to carry out an attack in what is supposed to be Pakistan’s most secure city. No doubt, it is near impossible to prevent a suicide bomber from setting off explosives when he decides to strike. But better intelligence can be employed to foil such attacks. It is also a fact that while the more bloodthirsty sectarian groups in Pakistan, such as the banned Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, have been largely defanged, many of their political supporters remain active, free to take out rallies and indulge in hate speech.

 

The state’s counterterrorism policy will remain ineffective until these groups are put out of business. Such groups, including the banned ASWJ, share a worldview with the TTP, which the state has declared the mortal enemy of Pakistan. Hence it is necessary to take action against the political and ideological backers of violent sectarian groups in order to close the door on further violence in the country.
Together, state and society must thwart the efforts of malign actors who wish to foment communal unrest. Pakistan has, over the decades, witnessed numerous instances of sectarian violence. It cannot afford a return to such dark times, which is why the state’s top priority must be to neutralise sectarian terrorist groups.

Thomas DiNanno, the undersecretary of state for arms control, told the UN Conference on Disa­rma­ment that the New START treaty, which lap­sed on Thursday, had “fundamental flaws”. He insisted that any future agreement must include China.
“Serial Russian violations, growth of more worldwide stockpiles and flaws in New START’s design and implementation gives the United States a clear imperative to call for a new architecture that addresses the threats of today, not those of a bygone era,” DiNanno said.
The expiration of New START, which limited the US and Russia to deploying 1,550 nuclear warheads each, marks the first time in decades the world lacks a treaty curbing the planet’s most destructive weapons.
The void has sparked fears of a renewed arms race. President Donald Tr­u­­mp rejected a proposal from Russian President Vla­dimir Putin to extend the restrictions, calling ins­t­­ead for a “new, imp­roved and modernised treaty”.
DiNanno argued that a bilateral agreement is insufficient, citing US projections that China will possess over 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030. “As we sit here today, China’s entire nuclear arsenal has no limits, no transparency, no declarations, had no controls,” he said.
In a significant escalation, DiNanno accused Beijing of a “yield-producing” nuclear test on June 22, 2020.

According to Chaman Dep­uty Commissioner Ha­bib Ahmed Bangulzai, the polio team was carrying out routine vaccination activities when motorcycle-riding assailants launched the attack.
As a result, police constable Nizamuddin was martyred on the spot while protecting the team.
The polio workers rem­ained safe as they were inside a house administering vaccines to children at the time of the attack. The body of the martyred officer was shifted to Civil Hospital Chaman for legal formalities.
Following the incident, police cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to trace the attackers. The deputy commissioner said security measures had been further tightened, while the polio campaign continued on its final day under strict protection.
Funeral prayers for the martyred officer were of­­f­ered at Chaman City pol­ice station. District Police Officer Abdullah Imran Cheema, Deputy Sup­er­i­n­tendent of Police Tahir Mahmood Kiani, station house officers, other poli­­ce officials, and a large number of citizens participated in the funeral.
Meanwhile, the polio ca­­­mpaign remained unde­r­­way for the rest of the day, with security for vaccination teams further enhanced.
In December last year, two people, including a constable, were killed after unidentified assailants attacked a polio team in the Salarzai tehsil of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, the police said.
Polio vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by terrorists, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan.

KARACHI: Condemnations poured in on Friday after a suicide bombing at Imambargah Khadijah-tul-Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area during Friday prayers, which authorities said killed at least 31 people and injured 169.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the attack and offered condolences to the families of those who lost their lives, according to a statement shared by the PPP on X.
“Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity,” he said, and directed that all possible medical facilities be provided to the injured.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the blast and expressed sympathy with the bereaved.
In a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, he directed that the investigation be completed and those responsible identified.
He also ordered that the injured be provided the best possible medical treatment and said the health minister would monitor the situation. “No one will be allowed to spread chaos and unrest in the country,” he said, according to an official statement.







Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also condemned the “cowardly suicide attack” on worshippers.
He said targeting places of worship and civilians was a “heinous crime against humanity” and a violation of Islamic principles. “Pakistan stands united against terrorism in all its forms,” he said, adding that those responsible would be brought to account.
Balochistan Chief Minister Sarf­raz Bugti also condemned the atta­­ck, calling it the worst form of terro­rism and a crime against humanity.
He expressed solidarity with the affected families and prayed for the recovery of the injured, stressing that the entire nation was united against terrorist activities and stood with security forces.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi also condemned the blast, stressing that an attack on a place of worship was a heinous crime against humanity.
He emphasised that targeting worshippers through a suicide attack reflected extreme brutality and intolerance, which had no place in any religion or society.
National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq expressed grief over the loss of lives, extended heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and prayed for the swift recovery of the injured.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also termed the attack “cowardly” and said the prime minister had instructed that those responsible be brought to justice.
He said the state remained committed to protecting lives and places of worship and that action would continue against terrorists under a “zero-tolerance” policy.

 

JUI-F leaders, including Maulana Rashid Mahmood Soomro and Ma­­u­lana Nasir Mahmood Soomro, also con­demned the bombing and dem­a­n­ded swift action against those involved. They called for stronger security measures for places of worship.
The Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) termed the attack a brutal crime against Islam, humanity and the sanctity of religious spaces.
In a video message shared with media outlets, PUC Chairman Allama Tahir Ashrafi said the perpetrators of the attack had no association with Islam or human values.
PBC expresses sympathies
The Pakistan Bar Council also expressed sympathy with bereaved family members and prayed for the high ranks for the departed soul and early recovery for the injured.
The Islamabad Bar Association announced a day of mourning and a strike in protest over the terrorist incident. In a statement, the association expressed deep sorrow over the attack and demanded a thorough investigation.
Meanwhile, protests erupted across several parts of the country, as anger and grief spilt onto the streets following the Islamabad attack.
In Karachi, mourners and activists blocked major roads, demanding justice for the victims and swift action against those responsible for the attack.
Major demonstrations were held at key locations, including the main Malir 15 intersection, Shahrah-i-Pakistan near the Incholi bus stop, Abul Hasan Isphahani Road near Abbas Town and at Numaish.
The protesters chanted slogans against terrorism and held placards condemning continued failures to protect places of worship.
The protests organised and supported by Majlis Wahdat-i-Musli­meen (MWM), Jafferia Alliance, Imamia Students Organisation and Shia Ulema Council attracted a large number of participants, including women and children.
Demonstrations were also held in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza and Nagar districts, with protesters blocking sections of the Karakoram Highway and other roads to condemn the attack.
In Skardu, protesters gathered at Yadgar Chowk and chanted slogans against the government over security failures.
Speaking on the occasion, the President of Anjuman-i-Imamia Bal­tistan, Agha Syed Baqar Hussaini and other religious scholars dema­nded the immediate arrest of those responsible and announced a peaceful protest in Baltistan on Saturday and three days of mourning.
In Hunza and Nagar, protesters blocked the Karakoram Highway at Gulmit and Ganish for several hours, burning tyres and raising slogans against terrorists. In Gilgit, demonstrators described the bombing as an attack on humanity and Islamic values and offered condolences to the victims’ families.
GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, caretaker Chief Minister Yar Muhammad, GB Assembly speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate and other political and religious leaders and civil society members also condemned the blast and demanded exemplary punishment for the culprits.
Separately, the Shia Ulema Council staged a rally and demonstration in Nawabshah, condemning the bombing and demand-ing immediate action against the perpetrators.
Meanwhile, police authorities in Sindh said security arrangements at mosques, imambargahs and other religious sites were being strengthened following the Islamabad blast.

IRANIAN Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and his accompanying delegation depart for the site of the talks in Oman.—Reuters

• No public acrimony witnessed as both sides stick to their guns• Iran ‘sends message’ by testing ballistic missile before meeting• Washington follows talks with fresh sanctions targeting oil-related entities• Kremlin urges restraint; US tells its citizens to leave Iran
ISLAMABAD: The indirect talks between the United States and Iran held in Muscat on Friday, did slightly better than many had expected.
While there was no breakdown or public acrimony, the first meeting did not yield any breakthroughs, either. Even the tentative understanding to keep talking was left subject to approval by the respective leaderships in Tehran and Washington, after reviewing what had transpired on Friday.
In remarks following the indirect talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stressed the need to overcome the “wall of mistrust” bet­ween the two sides.
“It was a good start to the negotiations. And there is an understanding on continuing the talks. Coordination on how to proceed will be decided in the capitals,” Araghchi told Iranian state TV. “If this process continues, I think we will reach a good framework for an understanding.”
Mediator Badr al-Busaidi, Oman’s foreign minister, said the talks had been “very serious”, with results to be considered carefully in Tehran and Washington.
The context in which the talks took place also did little to ease tensions. Just hours before the meeting began, Iran unveiled the Khorr­amshahr-4 ballistic missile, a move that was widely read as a pointed message.
“Any dialogue requires ref­raining from threats and pressure. (Tehran) only discusses its nuclear issue … We do not discuss any other issue with the US,” Araghchi said, referring to earlier American atte­mpts to widen the agenda of the dialogue to cover the country’s missile programme as well.
Expectations going in were low, shaped by months of escalation, a short but intense war last summer, riots in Iran, which Tehran believes were engineered from outside, and growing military pressure.
Against that backdrop, the fact that the process survived its first test was seen by many observers as a limited success.
Indirect contact
The talks themselves followed last minute hiccups and adjustments. Originally planned for Istanbul, the meeting was shifted to Oman at Iran’s request.
Tehran had pushed for Muscat both because of its past role as a discreet channel and because it offered tighter control over format and participation.
The final arrangement for the dialogue was strictly indirect. There were no direct meetings between the American and Iranian delegations, while Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi acted as the sole conduit, moving between the two sides throughout the day.
The composition of the delegations signified a lot. Iran was represented by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, backed by officials closely linked to the Supreme National Security Council, signaling that the team had a mandate to test ideas within defined limits. On the American side, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff led the talks, but he was joined by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son in law and adviser, a presence that was widely noted.
Kushner’s participation appeared aimed at addressing long standing Iranian doubts about whether US negotiators carry sufficient authority to sustain any understanding reached at the table.
At the same time, the inclusion of Admiral Brad Cooper, the head of US Central Command, underscored the dual track nature of Washington’s approach. His presence underscored that diplomacy was being pursued alongside, not instead of, military pressure.
The significance of the Muscat talks lies less in what they produced than in what they prevented. A collapse would almost certainly have intensified military calculations at a time when the region is already saturated with forces. Continuation, even in such a tentative form, buys time to explore possibilities for peace.
But any sense of cautious optimism emerging from Muscat was quickly tempered by developments that followed. Within hours of the talks ending, Washington announced fresh sanctions targeting Iranian oil related entities, vessels and individuals reinforcing perceptions in Tehran that negotiations are being conducted under pressure and that sanctions relief, the central Iranian demand, remains distant dream.
Russia urges restraint
The Kremlin, an ally of Iran, said on Friday it hoped the negotiations would yield results and lead to a de-escalation. It urged all sides to show restraint in the meantime.
In a show of defiance, Iran’s state TV said hours before the talks that one of the country’s most advanced long-range ballistic missiles, the Khorramshahr-4, had been deployed at one of the Revolutionary Guards’ vast underground missile cities. Iran demands lifting of sanctions, re-imposed since 2018 when Trump ditched Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six powers.
US tells citizens to leave Iran
In a related development, the US Virtual Embassy in Iran issued a security alert early on Friday urging American citizens to “leave Iran now” and make departure plans that do not rely on assistance from the US government, citing heightened risks and the possibility of sudden travel disruptions.
The alert came ahead of scheduled talks between the United States and Iran in Oman on Friday, amid little indication that the two sides have bridged differences over the agenda of the meeting.
“Leave Iran now. Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on US government help,” the alert said, warning that flight cancellations and other disruptions could occur with little notice. Americans were advised to check directly with airlines for updates.

The amendment to rule 166(5) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate was approved by the upper House of Parliament as the chair rejected the government’s request to defer the matter.
A motion seeking the amendment to the rule was moved by PPP, PML-N and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) senators.
However, during the session, PML-N’s Rana Sanaullah, who is special assistant to the prime minister on political affairs, conveyed Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar’s request that the motion may not be taken up before the matter was discussed with him.
However, PPP Senator Saleem Mandviwala, who spearheaded the move to amend the rule and was also chairing the session today, highlighted that the “interference of courts” in House committees’ proceedings was the reason behind the need for the change in the rule.
“High courts granted stays on the cases and petitions admitted by the chairman,” he pointed out, adding that there had been “back and forth on the amendment for months”.
“We do not want to delay it any further.”
But, Sanaullah asked what the urgency was.
In response, Mandviwala said the functioning of the committees was getting affected. “The amendment is in the interest of Senate and its committees, and it has already been unanimously approved by the standing committee concerned,” he contended.
Stressing that it was desire of the House, Mandviwala said he had already discussed it with the law minister and the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP).
However, Sanaullah insisted that the matter be deferred till Monday.
But, Mandviwala did not budge, asking Sanaullah not to insist for the amendment’s deferment.
“I have to proceed [with the session],” he said, asking Senator Abdul Qadir to move the motion, which was passed by the House by a majority vote.
The amendment
Supporters of the amendment say the change will leave no legal room for the judiciary to interfere in the parliamentary matters.
The amendment expands the definition of public petitions that can be taken up by Senate committees.
It states that a public petition, submitted by a citizen or a group of citizens in the prescribed form under Rule 277, may be presented on “any matter of public importance”, including grievances arising from disputes where circumstances disclose an element of public interest, systemic concern, regulatory oversight and/or the protection of rights.
It further provides that, after consideration, the committee may issue: (a) observations or recommendations for systemic or regulatory improvements; and (b) facilitative guidance for resolution of the grievance and take necessary steps for disposal of the matter in accordance with relevant law.
A proviso added to the rule gives the Senate chairman broad discretion over whether a petition should proceed.
It reads: “Provided that, notwithstanding anything contained in this rule, the chairman Senate may, at his sole discretion, review, admit, pend, dispense with or decline to proceed with any petition, if in his opinion such action is necessary in the interest of propriety, parliamentary discipline, or to prevent frivolous, vexatious or otherwise inappropriate proceedings.”
Rule 166(5) in its previous form stated: “Public petitions may be presented on any matter connected with the business pending before the House or a committee, or any matter of general public interest which is primarily the concern of the government, provided that it is not one which falls within the cognisance of a court of law or tribunal, and it shall not directly relate to a matter pending before any court or other authority performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions.”
How it all started?
The move follows a dispute last year over stay orders issued by the Islamabad High Court and Lahore High Court against proceedings of Senate standing committees.
On July 25, the Senate summoned the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle raised concerns about alleged judicial interference in parliamentary matters.
The issue was raised by Mandviwalla during a sitting presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan. Mandviwalla had described the stay orders as “alarming” and regretted that they had been issued despite the absence of any pending court cases. “This is direct interference in the functioning and proceedings of parliamentary committees,” he said.
Legislators from both treasury and opposition benches, including PTI and JUI-F, had endorsed the concerns.
On Aug 18, 2025, AGP Mansoor Usman Awan had made a rare appearance before the Senate and backed the judiciary, calling for keeping the door open for judicial intervention in parliamentary proceedings.
The AGP had referred to Article 69 of the Constitution, under which the validity of proceedings in parliament cannot be called into question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure. Awan had insisted that the bar was not absolute.
Senate Standing Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges, chaired by Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi, had approved the amendment in December 2025 amid opposition from the Ministry of Parl­ia­mentary Affairs.
Need for reconciliation stressed
During the Senate proceedings today, the treasury and opposition members were also seen agreeing that both sides needed to move past their differences, work toward reconciliation and engage in dialogue.
The conciliatory tone was adopted merely minutes after the government and the opposition were witnessed exchanging allegations and barbs.
It was an admission by PTI’s Azam Swati that changed the mood in the House. The former federal minister admitted that mistakes had been committed when his party was in the government, stressing the need to learn from the past and move foward.
Swati emphasised the need for reconciliation, saying that “peace is under threat and joint efforts are the need of the hours to eliminate terrorism”.
He went on to say that incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s health was his party’s top priority as the country’s poor and underprivileged looked to Imran with hopes of easing of their difficulties.
The PTI has expressed concerns over Imran’s health after the government last week admitted that the former premier had been treated at Pims in Islamabad for an eye ailment.
Swati urged Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah to play a “positive role”, saying that people had no trust in the country’s justice system.
He urged the “decision-makers” to take the first step.
Swati also called for ensuring fundamental rights, including the rights to life and health, also mentioning Imran’s health in this connection.
He said he hoped the government would respond to his call for reconciliation and shunning the politics of hatred.
Responding to his remarks in an equally conciliatory tone, Sanaullah appreciated Swati’s admission of mistakes having been committed during the PTI’s tenure and said his party’s government was also prone to making mistakes.
Sanaullah said all matters could be settled when two parties sat together and added, “We are ready to move forward.”
He assured the House that Imran was being given facilities that he was “entitle to under the court order and according to his position”.
Sanaullah also maintained the Imran’s medical treatment was carried out with his consent.
Earlier, Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas delivered a hard-hitting speech, accusing the government of denying Imran the fundamental rights that a citizen and prisoner was entitled to under the Constitution.
“It is injustice” by means of which enmity would seep into politics, the opposition leader remarked.
He said any government’s “existence and legitimacy” would remain questionable if it failed to provide fundamental rights to its citizens.
Abbas alleged that the government was denying Imran the rights that he was entitled to as a citizen, prisoner and former prime minister.
“We have serious concerns about his health,” he said, adding that Imran’s family, lawyers and personal physicians were not being allowed to meet him.
He also alleged that police had began arresting PTI workers and supports after the party announced a “peaceful protest” on February 8.
“This can only happen in times of fascism and not in a respectable democratic country,” he said, proposing that a committee be constituted to look into the conditions of prisoners countrywide.
Taking exception to Abbas’s statements, Sanaullah said the House should hold a debate on “who turned politics into enmity… Who turned politics into an insult? You reap what you sow”.
He said the Islamabad High Court had directed the meetings with Imran be should have some “dos and don’ts”. Seemingly referring to some of Imran’s statements about the military leadership, he said the opposition party itself had failed to fulfil its responsibility and violated the terms of the meeting.
He asked the opposition to move the high court if they believed that court orders were being violated.
Addressing Abbas’s allegations of arrests following the announcement of February 8 protest, he said the PTI did not have a past record of holding peaceful protests. He also referred to May 9, 2023 riots following the arrest of Imran and the November 26, 2024 protest in Islamabad.
Sanaullah was of the opinion that a wheel-jam strike was also violence.</p><small>2026-02-07 02:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/070733598ce0c4a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971568/relief-for-industry-as-government-shifts-burden-to-domestic-bills' target='_blank'><strong>‘Relief’ for industry as government shifts burden to domestic bills</strong></a><br><p>• Proposes fixed monthly electricity charges of Rs200-675 for over 28.5m households• Aims to raise Rs125bn to fund Rs4.04-per-unit relief for industry• Nepra okays fuel adjustment; Feb bills to rise by Rs1.21 per unit
ISLAMABAD: The government has proposed imposing a monthly fixed charge of between Rs200 and Rs675 on more than 28.5 million residential electricity consumers to raise around Rs125 billion and fund a relief package of Rs4.04 per unit for industrial users.
The revised Schedule of Tariff (SoT) was submitted to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Friday evening and was immediately put on notice for a customary public hearing on the first available date after the weekend for immediate implementation within the current month.
“This is just a procedural formality. The government guidelines are binding on Nepra,” an official said when asked about a short notice for a public hearing.
The power division told Nepra that the imposition of a fixed charge on almost all residential consumers (barring lifeline users permanently using less than 100 units per month) was approved by the federal cabinet on Feb 4.
The change in SOT comes in less than three weeks after the government had notified the base national average tariff on Jan 12 for application with effect from Jan 1, denying a benefit to consumers of about 62 paise per unit reduction determined by the regulator.
The new fixed charge would generate about Rs106bn in tariff, besides about Rs19bn in sales tax, to slash cross-subsidy by industrial consumers with a Rs4.04 per unit tariff cut without affecting federal budget subsidy targets committed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Under the decision, a Rs200 per month fixed amount would be charged to about 9.9m consumers using less than 100 units and Rs300 on more than 6.1m users consuming less than 200 units per month in the protected category.
They must maintain their consumption within these limits to qualify their average unit price at Rs10.54 and Rs13 for a continuous six months, respectively.
For non-protected consumers who exceed the 100-unit threshold even once in six months, a fixed charge of Rs275 would apply to about 5.7m users, whose per-unit rate would rise above Rs22.44, excluding taxes.
The second slab of 200 units would attract a Rs300 per unit fixed charge and would affect around 2.24m consumers.
The fixed monthly charge would increase to Rs350 for 2.9m consumers using 201-300 units, while around one million people consuming 301-400 units would pay Rs400 per month.
Around 400,000 consumers using 401-500 units would be charged Rs500 and all above 501 units per month would swallow a bitter pill of Rs675. About 0.41m consumers fall in this category.
The power division said the fixed charge emanated primarily from fixed costs of the power system amid changing consumer behaviour.
“It has become necessary to rationalise the tariff structure” in view of the existing structural misalignment between the determined revenue requirement of the power sector, where a substantial portion comprises fixed costs, and the predominantly volumetric recovery mechanism under the current tariff, coupled with the significant expansion of off-grid solar.

 

“The present volumetric tariff framework has placed a disproportionate recovery burden on other consumers, leading to increased cross-subsidisation and migration to alternative energy solutions,” the power division said.
Therefore, while remaining within the determined revenue requirement and approved subsidy limits, a recalibration of fixed and variable charges had been approved by the cabinet to ensure equitable cost recovery and long-term financial sustainability of the grid.
“Accordingly, the fixed charges for all domestic consumers, except lifeline consumers, are introduced/revised,” the power division said, adding that this was being done without changing the targeted tariff differential subsidy of Rs249bn.
Fuel adjustment
This coincided with a simultaneous notification issued by Nepra allowing a net fuel cost increase of about Rs1.21 per unit in February billing when compared to January.
The regulator said in its notification that it allowed “positive fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for December 2025, i.e. Rs0.2841/kWh” for recovery in February billing, which will apply to all the consumer categories of KE and other Discos, except lifeline consumers, electric vehicle charging stations and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories.
A government official said that since a negative FCA of 93 paise had expired and would be replaced by a positive FCA, the net comes to about Rs1.21 per unit.
The power division reported last month that the number of poor and subsidised consumers more than doubled to 21m in three years, eating up an otherwise 62 paise per unit reduction in national average electricity rates due from Jan 1 for the current year.
The decision was criticised by multiple businesses, including representatives of the textile industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
As a follow-up, the prime minister subsequently announced that the export sector’s tariff would be slashed by Rs4.04 per unit.
Under the government decision, the tariff rebasing would now take place on a calendar year basis (on Jan 1 every year) instead of a fiscal year to reduce the impact of tariff increases coinciding with high consumption months, starting July 1.
Total determined revenue requirement for Discos for the current year stands at Rs3.379 trillion, with an amount of Rs249bn on budget subsidy.

Official data released by the State Bank showed the government borrowed Rs8.519tr from banks in FY24, Rs5.434tr in FY25 and Rs2.1tr in the first seven months of the current fiscal year (FY26). 
Total borrowing from banks during this period reached Rs16tr, almost 50 per cent of the total stock of government borrowing (Rs32.3tr) at the end of June 2025. 
The country’s revenues nearly doubled in two years, marking a major turnaround, as the government’s total revenues jumped from Rs9.6tr to almost Rs18tr. This increase was driven by higher tax collection, new taxes and support from the central bank. 

Revenues nearly doubled from Rs9.6tr to almost Rs18tr in two years

During this period, the government raised additional liquidity of Rs24.5tr through bank borrowing and higher revenue generation, but this was not reflected in the economy in terms of growth. 
Despite this huge liquidity, the government could not accelerate economic activity, either due to policy failure or misdirected spending. The negative impact of banks’ lending to the government appeared in reduced lending to the private sector, which stood at a cumulative Rs2.2tr during the same period. 
The staggering figure of Rs24tr appears sufficient to bring vital change to the economy, but spending remained unproductive, and for the last three years the country has struggled to achieve a better growth rate. The GDP growth target for this year is 3.7 to 4.7pc, and the State 
Bank believes 3.7pc could be achieved in FY26. 
However, despite low inflation of 5.6pc, the State Bank is not ready to cut the interest rate to allow a higher flow of liquidity to the private sector. The only recent incentive announced for the export sector was a reduction in the refinancing rate. The export sector has not shown any significant improvement. 
Trade and industry have been demanding an interest rate in line with inflation, but policymakers appear satisfied with low but stable growth. Low economic growth has increased poverty each year, with 46pc of the population living below the poverty line. 
The government has not presented any plan to address this serious issue of rising poverty. Low growth continues to increase unemployment and poverty, which is being addressed largely through charity.

On November 11 last year, a lone suicide bomber blew himself up in front of the main entrance of the Judicial Complex in G-11 after a couple of unsuccessful attempts to enter the premises, killing a dozen people and injuring at least 36 others.
Soon after the incident, a number of police pickets were established on different roads of the capital. 
In addition, the Islamabad Traffic Police narrowed some of the busy roads in the capital during rush hours by placing barricades on a daily basis to monitor suspicious activities, causing much difficulties for the commuters. 
After the Tarlai Imambargah attack on Friday, some of the grief-stricken people, who had reached Pims hospital to trace their missing relatives, expressed their anger over the alleged failure of the police and the law enforcement agencies in preventing the devastating attack.
However, a senior police officer, when contacted, said the suicide attack had taken place in a rural area located on the outskirts of the capital city whereas the security measures had been put in place in the urban areas and various sectors of Islamabad. 
He said the focus of the police was mainly on the government buildings and other sensitive installations, adding the police were also constantly monitoring the movements of the suspicious people within the capital city through the Safe City cameras besides keeping record of visitors staying in hotels and guest houses. 
The official said only “human intelligence” was possible to monitor such activities in rural areas which generally served as “safe heavens” for the terrorists. 
It may be recalled that talking to the media outside the Judicial Complex after the November 11 attack, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had declared that he had directed that no vehicle be allowed into Islamabad without an e-tag after two weeks. 
Later, Minister of State for Interior Senator Talal Chaudhry, while addressing a press conference outside Parliament House alongside Inspector General of Police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi on November 13, had said it would be declared mandatory for all vehicles in the city to have e-tags. 
Authorities installed e-tag readers and cameras at 11 to 14 different points in the capital. 
These e-tag readers and cameras were installed under the supervision of the Safe City Authority in Islamabad to read vehicle tags. 
The tags and cameras were linked with the Safe City system and were installed on newly erected poles at these points to scan e-tags and vehicle registration plates.
Officials further said that approximately 400,000 to 500,000 vehicles move on the roads of the capital daily, with a large number entering the city from neighbouring areas, including Rawalpindi.
So far, e-tags have been installed on 203,915 vehicles up to February 5, the capital administration said, adding that around 19 points are still operational for installing e-tags on vehicles.

An inconsolable scene was witnessed at the hospital, as family members, including women and children, of the injured and deceased, started arriving. They were wailing and loudly praying. Some women even expressed helplessness while crying, saying their main breadwinners had been hit in the terror attack. 
The grieving families, friends and emergency responders struggled to manage the chaotic situation, while the rescue teams rushed the wounded into the emergency wards. 
Ambulances arrived in rapid succession from the blast site in Tarlai situated in the outskirts of the federal capital with rescue workers rushing the wounded into emergency and doctors and paramedics providing immediate medical care. 

Hospital administration hands over 28 bodies to relatives; 105 injured under treatment

Officials at the hospital said an emergency had been declared to ensure the availability of doctors, nurses and essential medical supplies. Additional staffers were called in to assist with treatment and help identify the deceased. Several victims were shifted to operation theatres, while others were treated in the hospital’s emergency wards. 
The Pims administration handed over 28 bodies to the families from the OPD by late evening and 105 injured were under treatment. 
Outside the emergency ward, anxious relatives gathered in a large number, seeking information about their loved ones, in tears and later gathered at the parking lot, chanting slogans against terrorism.

Meanwhile, waiting among the grieved people were two clerics, who were reciting religious sermons and narrating the Karbala incident. 
The clerics, requesting not to be named, told Dawn that the most important role of community leaders, including religious leaders, was to prevent formation of mobs. 
“People get upset, disappointed and vent their anger on anything they see. We do not want any mob start damaging property or misbehave with hospital staff,” the clerics added. 
Police and district administration officials were also present at the hospital to coordinate with medical teams and maintain order as the situation remained tense late into the night. 
Many of the deceased and injured were originally from the Hazara community of Quetta and had relocated here, along with people from Hangu and Parachinar, escaping repeated terrorism in those areas. Some people from Gilgit-Baltistan also settled in Tarlai as it is a cheaper locality.  
It was announced that the collective funeral prayers of the deceased will be held at the same place (Imambargah Khadijatul Kubra) at 11am on Saturday (today). 
Incidentally, the Pims area witnessed very weak mobile network signals and slow data. However, all four telecom companies - Ufone, Jazz, Zong and Telenor - responding to a query said they had not lowered the signals for the area. They explained that the poor network quality could be due to a capacity issue, probably because of the large number of people in the area at the same time.

His post on the social media platform X came hours after the PTI again approached the Supreme Court (SC) seeking Imran’s medical report and visitation rights for his personal doctors and family members.
In the post, the minister noted that National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai had written a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif while PTI leaders had also approached the apex court “regarding medical checkup of Imran Ahmad Niazi, who is serving his sentences in Central Jail, Rawalpindi”.







“On directions from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), a detailed report has been sent by the executive director of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) hospital to the superintendent of Central Jail, Rawalpindi (Adiala), which has been handed over to the family,” he said.
According to the report sent by Pims Executive Director Dr Rana Imran Sikander, the hospital was directed by the PMO to communicate and give an update about Imran’s medical condition.
“Mr Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi (age 74 years) reported reduced vision in the right eye. A senior and qualified ophthalmologist from Pims, Islamabad, conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiala Jail, including slit lamp examination, fundoscopy, intraocular pressure measurements, essential laboratory tests and Optical coherence tomography of the retina,” he said in the report.
“Based on his assessment, a diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made, and hospital-based follow-up treatment was recommended,” he said.
He further said that Imran was then brought to Pims for the procedure, where the treatment plan was explained to him.
“Accordingly, informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure,” the Pims executive director said.
He said that the procedure was carried out in the operating theatre under standard sterile protocols and monitoring. It was completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes, he said.
“During the treatment, the patient remained vitally stable, and was discharged with routine post-procedure care instructions, follow-up advice and documents,” Dr Rana stated.
The development comes after the government last week admitted that the former premier was treated at Pims in Islamabad. The admission came days after reports regarding the treatment of Imran emerged in mainstream media.
The PTI had subsequently condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians.
Meanwhile, the Pims executive director, had earlier said that Imran’s eye procedure was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention.
It is worth mentioning that National Assembly Opposition Leader Achakzai on Tuesday wrote a letter to PM Shehbaz, seeking his “personal intervention” for the PTI founder’s medical examination by the jailed leader’s “trusted” doctors.
Report confirms diagnosis but no treatment plan: Imran’s doctor
Imran’s personal physician, Dr Aasim Yusuf, said in a video statement that the PTI founder’s medical report contained the diagnosis of his condition but it did not outline the investigation process or a plan for further treatment.
“A short time ago, Imran’s family shared a copy of a report released by Pims in Islamabad, summarising the investigations and treatment which he underwent at that hospital in late January this year,” he said.
“The report describes the investigations which were conducted and confirms that a diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion was made,” Dr Yusuf explained, adding that it did not provide details or results of medical investigations. According to Dr Yusuf, the report outlined that Imran was treated with an intraocular injection.
“Very importantly, the concern that we had raised earlier, that Imran ought to be treated by a retinal specialist, has not been addressed,” the physician added, noting that qualified and trained ophthalmologists saw and treated the PTI founder.
“We have stated earlier that we have no doubt as to the qualifications and experience of the individuals in question, but this is a specialised condition and general ophthalmologists are not best situated to investigate and treat this condition, which should always be treated by retinal specialists as far as possible,” Dr Yusuf explained.
“There is mention of the need for follow-up, but the exact details of how this is to be planned and what other investigations or treatments are planned have not been clarified in the report,” he added.
Moreover, Dr Yusuf highlighted that the possibility of an underlying medical condition was not mentioned.
“It is unclear whether a medical specialist saw or evaluated Imran during his illness, or has done so since, to rule out these very important conditions, which do need investigation and treatment in their own right,” the physician asserted.
Reiterating the seriousness of Imran’s condition, Dr Yusuf said, “We are not out of the woods as yet.
“We are still very concerned about Imran’s health and particularly the condition of his eye, and would urge the authorities to please allow me and a team of qualified and appropriately trained retinal specialists to see him urgently and to participate in his care, so as to ensure the best possible outcome and prevent any further damage to his eye,” he requested.
‘Imran, Bushra being provided care in accordance with jail rules’
Separately, the Adiala jail administration informed an anti-terrorism court in Islamabad that Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were being provided medical treatment in accordance with the jail rules.
A brief report on medical facilities provided to Imran and Bushra Bibi was submitted to the court of ATC judge Amjad Ali Shah, following earlier contempt proceedings over its non-submission.
The report, filed by Jail Deputy Superintendent Jamaat Ali Shah, stated that medical examinations and treatment for the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi were being carried out in accordance with the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978.
The court had earlier issued a contempt of court notice to the Adiala Jail superintendent for failing to submit the required report, prompting jail authorities to present the document during the hearing.
Further, the report by the Pims executive director was also submitted to the same court by Adiala jail officials.
However, Imran’s sister Aleema took to X to state that the SC chief justice had “committed last Friday that Imran Khan’s medical reports would be provided to his family”.
“Today, when the jail superintendent appeared before the ATC only two brief notes were submitted,” she said. “This conduct reflects a complete disregard for the authority of the chief justice of the SC,” she said.
“We urge Chief Justice Yahya Afridi to issue a contempt notice to the jail authorities and ensure that Imran Khan’s medical reports are handed over to his family without any further delay,” she asserted.







PTI approches Supreme Court
Earlier in the day, PTI’s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, expressing concern over Imran’s health, said that the party had submitted a memorandum to the registrar requesting access to Imran for his personal doctors, as well as requesting his medical report.

The memorandum, a copy of which is available with Dawn, reiterated the PTI’s request that “immediate access to Mr Imran Khan be provided to his family, doctors, lawyers and friends”.
Gohar said that this was the “10th time” the party was approaching the apex court about Imran and that they had approached the high courts 16 times as well.
Gohar said that Imran’s health was a “very important issue, not just for PTI’s parliamentarians but for the whole country and every Pakistani”.
The party chairman said that until now, they had not received information on Imran’s medical reports and the procedure that he recently underwent.
“In the middle of this, Tuesday and Thursday passed by,” Gohar added. “Still, there was no meeting of Imran with either family members or lawyers, nor his personal physician or doctors.”
According to Gohar, Achakzai had written a letter to PM Shehbaz seeking his “personal intervention” for Imran’s medical examination by his “trusted” doctors, there had been no answer.
Hence, he said, the PTI was again requesting the chief justice to make sure that not only would the party receive the report about the jailed leader, but his doctors would be able to meet with him as quickly as possible, for the peace of mind of “his family, the party and the whole country”.
“This is our minimum,” he said.

Police confirmed the number of casualties. The explosion occurred at Imambargah Khadijah-tul-Kubra in the Tarlai area of the federal capital.



Images from the site showed bloodied bodies lying on the carpeted floor surrounded by shards of glass, debris, and panicked worshippers.
Dozens more wounded were lying in the garden outside the imambargah as people called for help.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif suggested India’s and Afghanistan’s involvement in the attack, stating in a post on social media platform X that “it has been proved that the terrorist involved in the attack travelled to and from Afghanistan”.
“The collusion between India and Afghanistan is being revealed,” he said.







The defence minister said that security guards at the site of the incident had “challenged” the attacker, and in response, he opened fire. “He then blew himself up, standing in the last row of worshippers,” he said.
Asif said that the state would respond to this “cruelty with full force”.
“After a humiliating defeat, India is fighting a war through its proxies. It doesn’t have the courage to fight directly now,” he added.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’ later in the day, Asif said that the attack came as Pakistan signed landmark agreements with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and on the same day as the revival of Basant.
“The timing, I believe, is an effort to sabotage us and our progress … India cannot engage in an all-out clash with Pakistan, so it is using proxies and Afghanistan to disrupt peace here,” he said.
The defence minister said that the suicide bomber was a Pakistani national who had travelled to Afghanistan some time ago and undergone “extreme religious indoctrination”. He added that the bomber returned to Pakistan last year.
‘Attacker travelled to Afghanistan on several occasions’
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry later told the media in Islamabad that while the attacker was not an Afghan, authorities had been able to determine through forensic tests the number of times he had travelled to Afghanistan.
At the outset of his media talk, he said rescue teams from various departments began reaching the site of the incident within 10-12 minutes of the blast.
Regarding the attacker, he said: “Information has been obtained about the terrorist who carried out the suicide attack. He is not an Afghan national, but we have information about the number of times he travelled to Afghanistan after the forensics of his remains.”
Chaudhry added that a similar pattern was seen in terror incidents in the country, adding that attacks were either carried out “in the name of religion or on the pretext of … linguistic and provincial [differences].”
In connection with the latter, he particularly mentioned the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).
“They had planned a week ago that they would give a surprise in Balochistan, but they had to pay a heavy price for it and suffered losses.
“These terrorists have reached the extremes of cowardliness. They are attacking soft targets, including markets, schools, mosques, imambargahs, banks and other such places,” he added.
The state minister also said that a first cousin of the Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi had died in the blast.
“All of them are our brothers. Irrespective of any sect, they all are Pakistanis,” he said, adding: “We are resolute and determined that the implementation of the National Action Plan will continue [in the fight against terrorism]. There is no doubt or leniency on this.”
Chaudhry also said that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had visited the imambargah that was targeted in the attack and collected relevant information.
He said that Pakistan had shared evidence with the rest of the world, including its neighbouring countries, that terrorism in Pakistan was sponsored by India.
“We have proof that India has tripled its investment into this. They (terrorists) are not carrying out attacks for religion, but for dollars … Whether they belong to the BLA, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan or any other group, they are paid in dollars,” he added.
The minister further stated that Islamabad had repeatedly urged Afghanistan not to provide space to terrorists and not to become India’s proxy.
“These proxies will meet the same fate as India did in May [last year],” he added.
Speaking about today’s attack, he said “Everything is being monitored at the highest level … But a lot of information cannot be shared at this point because it is important to reach those who were behind them (attacker). And within 72 hours, we will share a detailed report, including information about their handlers.”
When asked whether the incident was also not a failure of the authorities and the state in protecting the public, Chaudhry replied: “This is not a failure … We are a frontline state that is protecting the world. And they are attacking us as they just want to weaken the wall that is Pakistan. If this wall weakens, this fire is not going to stop at our border … We are a responsible state and we are going to fulfil our responsibility. We are going to win this war, and we are winning this war.”
Earlier, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that “India is behind” the incident.
Speaking to the media at Polyclinic Hospital in Islamabad, he expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from Pakistan.
The minister further said that Pakistan had always promoted peace and wanted peace in the region. But, he added, Pakistan’s neighbours had been involved in terror activities in the country.

 


In this connection, the minister particularly mentioned India, saying that it was involved in “terrorism activities in Balochistan, Fata and in the incident that took place in Islamabad today”.
“We have exposed them to the world,” he said, adding that the nation was united against such “cowardly acts and enemies”.
“The fight against them (terrorists) will continue until they are eliminated,” he expressed resolve.
The minister said the injured and the dead had been taken to Pims and Polyclinic Hospital, and emergencies had been declared in hospitals across Islamabad.
Meanwhile, the district administration spokesperson said the site of the blast had been sealed off by security personnel, and added that assistant commissioners were assigned to oversee the treatment of the injured at various hospitals.

Pindi police on high alert; Punjab CM dispatches ambulances
In view of the prevailing security situation, Rawalpindi police were placed on high-alert, according to a statement by the police spokesperson.
“Security duties are being checked and [officials are being] briefed at imambargahs, mosques and other places across the city,” the statement read.
According to the statement, the police officials held meetings with the administrators and the guardians of the religious places and informed them about security standard operating procedures and the measures taken in this regard.
The Islamabad Bar Association also called for a day of mourning on Saturday. A notice issued by the association said that it strongly condemned the suicide blast and expressed deep sorrow over the lives lost.
The association demanded that authorities conduct an immediate investigation into this incident and bring those involved to justice.
The lawyer’s body announced a day of mourning and strike for February 7 (tomorrow), saying that lawyers would not appear in court.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, in a post on X, said the provincial government had dispatched 25 ambulances to Islamabad.







She added that all hospitals across Rawalpindi district had been placed on high alert with “surgical teams, anesthetists, orthopedic and neurosurgical specialists on standby”.
“Blood banks are fully staffed, and operation theatres are fully equipped to ensure prompt and effective medical care for the injured.”
Maryam added that the commissioner and deputy commissioner of Rawalpindi were also instructed to extend every possible assistance.
She later said that she would be cancelling “all my Basant-related activities that were scheduled for tomorrow”.
“The mega Basant show at the Liberty Square also stands cancelled,” she said. The chief minister said that it was imperative that the nation was united against “ the khwarji menace and their ‘sympathisers’, shows them no mercy, and stands shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces in defence of the country”.







Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said the provincial government had decided to cancel the “musical segment of the cultural night planned in honour of the Commonwealth Parliamentarians Association”.
“We share the pain of the bereaved families. The dinner will be held simply, without music, out of respect for the victims and our national grief,” he said.







President, PM condemn blast
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari extended condolences to the victims who lost their lives in the blast, according to a statement issued by the PPP on X.
He expressed grief over the incident, saying, “Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity”.
The president prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured and directed that all possible medical facilities be provided to them.







In a post on X later, he acknowledged the messages of support from around the world.
“Such solidarity reinforces our shared stand against violence. Pakistan remains resolute in upholding peace, resilience & national unity,” he said.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the blast, according to a statement. He expressed grief over the deaths in the blast and expressed sympathy with the bereaved.
In a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, the prime minister directed him to complete the investigation of the incident and immediately identify the people responsible for it.
He directed that “the injured be provided best medical facilities and the health minister will monitor” the situation, the statement quoted him as saying.
“No one will be allowed to disseminate chaos and unrest in the country,” he said.







In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said he was grateful for the messages of support and sympathy from across the globe.
“The support of our friends and partners has always remained critical in Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts. The perpetrators of this heinous crime will be brought to justice with full force and their nefarious designs will never be allowed to succeed,” he said.
“The brave Pakistani nation stands united at this time and we remain fully committed to our resolve to defeat terrorism, as we always have,” he said.







Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also condemned the “cowardly suicide attack on innocent worshippers during Friday prayers at a Shia imambargah in Islamabad, killing dozens”.
“Targeting places of worship and civilians is a heinous crime against humanity and a blatant violation of Islamic principles,” he said.
Dar further said, “Pakistan stands united against terrorism in all its forms. This barbarity will not intimidate us and extremists will be brought to full account.”







In his condemnation, Information Attaullah Tarar termed the attack “cowardly”, expressing grief over the loss of lives.
He said, “Targeting worshippers is an extremely cowardly, inhuman and detestable act.”
The minister added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had instructed that those responsible for the attack should be penalised.
Tarar said the state was committed to protect the lives and properties of people, as well as mosques and imambargahs, and actions against miscreant would continue under a zero-tolerance policy.







In a later post, he said that those behind the attack could not shake the resolve of the nation through fear and terror.
“Until the complete annihilation of khwarijs — the enemies of Muslims and humanity — this nation will never be at peace,” he added.







The bombing comes less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast.
Friday’s attack also occurred as Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev was in the federal capital on an official visit to Pakistan.

“A White House staffer erroneously made the post,” said a White House official, who declined to be named. “It has been taken down.”







The statement came hours after White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt described as “fake outrage” a wave of negative reactions to the video, including from several prominent Republican lawmakers.
Late on Thursday, Trump shared a minute-long video amplifying the Republican US president’s false claims that his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud. Spliced into the video was an apparently AI-generated clip of dancing primates superimposed with the Obamas’ heads.
The post on Trump’s Truth Social network drew swift criticism from prominent political figures, including Republican Senator Tim Scott, a Trump ally who is Black.
“Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House,” Scott said on X. “The president should remove it.”







Republican Representative Mike Lawler of New York was among several other prominent political figures who said Trump should apologise and delete the post.
Prior to the post being deleted, Leavitt said it was “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the king of the jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King”. Trump’s clip included a song from that musical.
A spokesperson for the Obamas declined to comment.
White supremacists have for centuries depicted people of African ancestry as monkeys as part of campaigns to dehumanise and dominate Black populations.
“Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our history,” said Ben Rhodes, a former Obama aide, on X.







Trump has a history of sharing racist rhetoric and long promoted the false conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. In December, Trump described Somalis as “garbage” who should be thrown out of the country.
He has referred to that and other developing nations as “shithole countries.” He was also criticised last year for depicting House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who is Black, with a superimposed handlebar moustache and a sombrero.
Civil rights advocates have said Trump’s rhetoric has become increasingly bold, normalised, and politically permissible.
“Donald Trump’s video is blatantly racist, disgusting, and utterly despicable,” said Derrick Johnson, national president of the NAACP, a civil rights group, in an emailed statement. “Voters are watching and will remember this at the ballot box.”</p><small>2026-02-06 18:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/062150415e2b668.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971451/fire-erupts-at-factory-in-karachis-landhi' target='_blank'><strong>Fire erupts at factory in Karachi’s Landhi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI:  A huge fire erupted in a factory located in the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) of Landhi on Friday night, according to officials.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the fire had erupted in a plastic factory located inside the zone.
He said at present, six fire tenders were busy controlling the flames, but the fire was intense. He said the blaze had erupted on the ground floor, engulfing the first floor.
He expressed the fear that the blaze would engulf another floor of the industrial unit.

 


He said that fire tenders and snorkels had been called from across the metropolis to meet any eventuality. He said at present, no casualties had been reported.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said fire tenders and snorkels were present on the ground to tackle the situation.
“Additional water bowsers are also present. Will keep everyone posted,” he said.







In a statement, the Sindh police chief, Javed Alam Odho, directed the Malir senior superintendent of police and the superintendent traffic to reach the scene and secure the area.
He also directed officials to keep the surrounding area clear of traffic for the fire brigade and rescue teams.
A day earlier, multiple fires that erupted in six places in the metropolis were put out by firefighters with no casualties.
On Monday, three cars were damaged in a fire that erupted at a high-rise commercial building near Saddar’s mobile market.
Last month, a huge fire erupted at Karachi’s Gul Plaza, which claimed the lives of at least 73 people.</p><small>2026-02-06 17:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649451-terror-at-friday-prayer-witnesses-describe-blast-rocking-islamabad-imambargah' target='_blank'><strong>Witnesses describe blast rocking Islamabad imambargah</strong></a><br><p>

The development came as ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra heard a case registered against the two under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act over their alleged involvement in a lawyers’ protest at Constitution Avenue.
The couple was arrested last month while leaving the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in connection with the case. It is worth mentioning that the two have been sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a separate case pertaining to controversial social media posts.
During the hearing, the prosecution submitted a notification dated February 5, citing the prevailing law and order situation that, according to authorities, made it difficult to physically produce the accused before the court. It subsequently requested the court to mark the suspects’ attendance via video link.
Accepting the request, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra marked the attendance of both accused via video link from Adiala jail.
Furthermore, the court extended the judicial remand of Imaan and Hadi for 14 days, directing jail authorities to ensure their virtual presence at the next hearing scheduled for February 19.
Separately, the Islamabad High Court issued a two-page written order on a petition filed by Dr Shireen Mazari against the two lawyers being denied visitation rights following their conviction in a separate case.
The petition was heard by Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, who noted in the written order that the couple had been sentenced on January 24, but, according to the petitioner, they were not being provided with the facility to meet their family members and lawyers after the sentence.
However, the court observed that the petitioner had not “approached the relevant administrative forum regarding the matter”.
The IHC converted the petition into an application and forwarded it to the Adiala jail superintendent, directing that the matter be decided “expeditiously in accordance with the law”.
The high court further clarified that issues related to facilities provided to prisoners under prison rules must first be raised before the relevant administrative authorities, after which judicial proceedings may be initiated if required.</p><small>2026-02-06 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649441-punjab-cm-cancels-basant-activities-following-islamabad-blast' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM cancels her Basant activities following Islamabad blast</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking at a press conference at the Central Police Office, the provincial police chief said since the launch of the operation, 113 encounters had taken place with criminals in which 27 kidnappers were gunned down, 82 others were injured, and 77 were arrested.
Flanked by Sindh Additional Inspector General of Police Iqbal Dara, Odho said 123 bandits had also surrendered before law enforcers as part of the government’s policy.
“These were not ordinary criminals,” he said. He further said that 15 people who had been kidnapped had been recovered safely. He lamented that some of the citizens rescued were in the custody of the bandits for up to three years.
Way forward
In an oblique reference to past operations against riverine bandits that failed to deliver desirable results, Odho said a comprehensive plan had been chalked out in which socio-economic aspects were also included as part of the government’s policy.
He vowed to continue the operation until the “total annihilation” of crime in riverine areas. The Sindh police chief said the riverine areas where military-grade weapons were available would be de-weaponised.
He said that under the plan, tribal feuds — which had remained nurseries for bandits in terms of provision of manpower and weapons — would be ended.
He said that these tribal feuds were the outcome of “egos, attempts to occupy government lands and petty issues”.
Some tribal chiefs had cooperated with the law enforcers for eliminating the criminals, he noted, adding that those who refused to do so would be taken to task.
He further said that there would be “permanent presence” of police to prevent the reemergence of the criminals. He declared that a “riverine police unit” would be set up for this purpose.
He claimed that recently hard-to-reach areas like Bagarji and Ranwati had been cleared of bandits, adding that notorious gangs were eliminated.
He further said that there would be a “socio-economic development plan” for riverine areas. He hoped that with the completion of the Ghotki-Kandhkot bridge on the Indus River, law enforcers would get easy access to riverine areas. He hoped that this proposed bridge would help to eliminate criminals.
Odho also said that roads, dispensaries and schools would be set up in these areas. For this purpose, certain non-governmental organisations in Karachi had pledged to help set up educational institutes in the riverine areas, he said.
He said that with the help of oil and gas companies, socio-economic uplift projects were launched in Ghotki district in 2003. He noted that these projects benefited local communities and helped in eliminating criminals, particularly from the Chachar community.
The police chief said that the riverine area was spread over 450 kilometres in the province. He said that out of this, 50-60km was where bandits had established their hideouts.
The police faced two challenges there, he said. “The presence of a significant quantity of water with fertile lands and islands, and the area’s proximity to border areas of other provinces like Punjab,” Odho added.
Referring to his recent talk with the newly-appointed Punjab police chief, who also belongs to Nawabshah, Odho said, the two had decided to further strengthen cooperation and joint operations in bordering areas.
“An air surveillance unit would also be set up for surveillance of the areas with the help of drones,” he added.
In response to a question about the alleged political patronisation of the bandits in areas, Odho said that certain individuals may support criminals due to caste, kinship, or land disputes in their individual capacity. However, he said that the government had given law enforcers a free hand, adding that they were not facing any pressure.
Odho said that with the launch of recent operations in Balochistan and the “improvement of the situation in the province”, he hoped that the “flow of sophisticated weapons” to riverine areas would end.
“The leakages in de-weaponising the areas will be addressed with the help of the federal government,” he said.
The Sindh IG said around 150,000 people were living in riverine areas, adding that the Sindh government had decided to “rehabilitate them”. He further said that if needed, they would be provided state land to sustain their livelihoods.
Crime in Karachi
During the press talk, the Sindh police chief said that another major challenge for the law enforcers was street crime in Karachi.
He said that there was a time when organised crime and terrorism prevailed in the metropolis, saying that there were “no-go areas” and police did not even “dare to go there”.
“Peace was restored in the provincial capital following the sacrifices of over 1,100 police officials,” he said.
He noted that crime had not been eliminated from Karachi, but said that the “numbers have declined”. He vowed to further improve the situation in the metropolis.</p><small>2026-02-06 13:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649417-imrans-medical-report-shared-with-family-on-pm-shehbazs-directives-tarar' target='_blank'><strong>Imran's medical report shared with family on PM Shehbaz's directives: Tarar</strong></a><br><p>

According to the report, he made the remarks while addressing the Pakistan-Uzbekistan Business Forum in Islamabad alongside Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who is in Islamabad on an official visit.
In his remarks, the premier said that it was in this spirit that both countries had set an “ambitious yet easily achievable target of increasing our bilateral trade to $2 billion”, the report said.
He said the two countries had also signed a protocol, which would lead to the constitution of a working group to draft a five-year roadmap in order to promote trade, investment, and joint collaboration in research and development, information technology and agriculture, it added.
PM Shehbaz also said that tourism was another area in which both countries could benefit from each other’s experience.
“He expressed the confidence that business-to-business memoranda of understanding worth $3.4bn are going to materialise,” the report said.
The premier also stated that Pakistan considered Uzbekistan not only a partner but a gateway to Central Asia with great potential for joint ventures with Pakistani entrepreneurs, it added.
Meanwhile, the visiting dignitary urged the business communities of both countries to come forward to tap the full trade potential between Pakistan and Uzbekistan.
“He assured a ten-year tax exemption to Pakistani businesses in addition to all possible facilitation. The Uzbek president emphasised that both countries have a great trade potential in diverse areas,” the report said.
‘Pakistan committed to boosting ties with Uzbekistan in diverse fields’
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari said that Pakistan was committed to elevating bilateral relations with Uzbekistan to “new heights” through closer cooperation in connectivity, trade and people-to-people contacts, according to a separate report by Radio Pakistan.
According to the report, President Zardari met with Uzbekistan President Mirziyoyev and expressed the confidence that the visit would prove “productive and forward-looking”.
“President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working closely with Uzbekistan to further strengthen cooperation in trade, connectivity, defence, security, culture and heritage,” Radio Pakistan said.
He noted that direct air links between the two countries had brought the people of the two countries closer and underscored the importance of regional connectivity initiatives, including the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project, while highlighting the need to address remaining challenges through collective efforts, the national radio broadcaster said.
During the meeting, President Zardari highlighted the “steady growth in bilateral trade in recent years and underscored the need to realise the true economic potential of the relationship, with the shared objective of expanding trade to two billion dollars as agreed by the two sides,” the report said.
“He also stressed the importance of enhancing people-to-people contacts, tourism cooperation and cultural exchanges, drawing on the rich historical and spiritual links between the two nations,” it added.
President Zardari also expressed the need to extend collaboration and facilitation between the financial institutions, including banks, to support trade and investment flows, it added.
Radio Pakistan quoted Uzbek President Mirziyoyev as saying that the country attached great importance to strengthening friendship and the strategic partnership with Pakistan.
“He noted with satisfaction the steady growth in bilateral contacts at various levels, including the expansion of trade, an increase in joint ventures, and the implementation of cooperation projects in priority sectors of the economy,” it said.
It added that President Mirziyoyev directed his concerned minister to coordinate with the Pakistani counterpart in this regard.
“The Uzbek president emphasised the need to further expand practical cooperation through closer political dialogue, stronger trade, economic and investment ties, and more active business exchanges,” the state-run broadcaster said.
It stated that President Mirziyoyev invited his Pakistani counterpart to pay an official visit to Uzbekistan.
“He said two additional direct flights would be added between the two countries, taking the total number of weekly flights to six, to further facilitate people-to-people contacts, tourism and business exchanges,” it added.
During the meetings, the two presidents also discussed the regional situation, including matters affecting peace, stability and security, it said.
Later, President Zardari conferred the Nishan-i-Pakistan on President Mirziyoyev in recognition of his contribution to strengthening Pakistan-Uzbekistan relations, the report added.
Joint communique underscores commitment to connectivity, cooperation
Separately, Pakistan and Uzbekistan underscored their commitment to further deepen bilateral ties and strengthen cooperation in a joint declaration, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Friday.
The joint declaration, signed by Mirziyoyev and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, said that the leaders held comprehensive and in-depth discussions covering the full spectrum of bilateral relations between the two countries.
“The two sides reaffirmed their strong resolve to comprehensively develop and strengthen cooperation in order to support each other’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, while advancing sustainable development aligned with the long-term national interests of the people of both states,” the declaration read.







The two sides also exchanged views on key issues, such as regional peace and security, connectivity and trade, and expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation developed over the last 34 years, since the establishment of their diplomatic relations.
The declaration noted that these relations were “firmly anchored in longstanding bonds of friendship, as well as deep historical, cultural and spiritual affinities between the two nations”.
According to the joint statement, both nations underscored their commitment to deepen bilateral ties and elevate cooperation “to a qualitatively new level that advances the core interests of both nations”, it said.
The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment to the joint declaration signed after PM Shehbaz’s visit to Uzbekistan in February 2025, noting that the roadmap for the implementation of the decisions reached during that visit provided a blueprint for further deepening bilateral relations in multiple areas of cooperation.
PM Shehbaz and President Mirziyoyev regarded the decision to establish a High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC) during last year’s visit as a significant milestone.
“This mechanism provides close guidance and monitoring of the top leadership on bilateral cooperation,” the declaration stated.
They welcomed the inaugural meeting of the HLSCC during Mirziyoyev’s visit to Pakistan, wherein the two leaders “reached important decisions on furthering bilateral cooperation”.
The leaders also commended the work of the Joint Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC) on Trade-Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation between Uzbekistan and Pakistan in promoting trade and commerce between the two countries.
“They noted with satisfaction the conduct of the 10th session of the IGC, held in Islamabad on Feb 2, and hoped to achieve the targets set therein in the stated timeframe,” the statement said.
Further, they welcomed the signing of the framework agreement of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project in July 2025, and noted the significance of connectivity as a means of regional integration, transit trade and socio-economic development in the region.
The two sides reiterated their commitment to enhancing regional connectivity and acknowledged the importance of this cooperation in promoting efficient, reliable, and cost-effective transport links, thereby contributing to deeper economic integration and strengthened bilateral and regional trade relations, according to the declaration.
To this end, they expressed their commitment to take measures necessary for the early operationalisation of an MoU on Multimodal Transport that was signed in September 2024. Pakistan also reaffirmed its readiness to provide access to its seaports for Uzbek transit cargo and to make available its road network of international standards to support Uzbek trade and transit requirements, the declaration said.
The leaders acknowledged the fact that Uzbekistan was the first country in Central Asia with which Pakistan had signed a Transit Trade Agreement as well as a Preferential Trade Agreement. They welcomed the growing volume of trade and commerce between the two countries.
They also reiterated their commitment towards achieving a $2 billion bilateral trade target by 2029.
The sides agreed to establish a joint management of economic or industrial zones in each country in order to create favourable conditions for developing industrial cooperation between the two countries, aimed primarily at exporting finished products to third countries, the declaration added.
“Noting the important role of interregional dialogue in promoting trade and economic cooperation, unlocking new opportunities and identifying new areas of growth for collaboration, the two leaders welcomed the signing of the framework agreement establishing the Inter-Regional Forum. The sides agreed to hold the first forum of regions of the two countries in the Republic of Uzbekistan in 2026 at mutually agreed dates,” it said.
According to the statement, both leaders expressed their satisfaction on the progress made by both sides for completing phase-II of expansion of the PTA, signing the Bilateral Investment Treaty and agreeing to explore the possibility of signing an agreement on aligning SPS measures and mutual recognition of standards to help Joint Ventures in pharmaceuticals, textile, leather industries, agriculture, minerals and engineering goods, and enhancing e-commerce cooperation.
They also emphasised the need to further diversify trade corridors between Uzbekistan and Pakistan to amend the existing Intergovernmental Agreement on Transit Trade for this purpose, it said.
In addition, both countries expressed their readiness to maintain regular dialogue and build constructive cooperation in the area of security and defence.
They expressed satisfaction at the level of defence cooperation, welcoming the recent engagements between the two sides in this regard, including the staff talks and high-level exchanges, the declaration said.
“In order to further promote cooperation in this area, they agreed to continue mutual participation in joint military exercises and training, and to cooperate in the field of professional development, exchange of best practices and collaboration between military institutions of the two countries.”
Additionally, they reaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations (UN) Charter and its purposes and principles. They pledged to consider each other’s initiatives favourably at multilateral fora.
“They underlined that sustained dialogue and peaceful engagement in accordance with the UN Charter, General Assembly and Security Council Resolutions remain essential for addressing longstanding issues and disputes, and advancing peace, stability and prosperity in South and Central Asia,” the declaration added.
Further, the countries agreed to extend favourable consideration to each other’s upcoming candidatures for various positions within international organisations, particularly at the UN.
Uzbekistan commended Pakistan on its contributions to advancing peace and security as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the term 2025-2026, and congratulated Pakistan on its successful presidency of the UNSC during June 2025.
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz congratulated the Uzbek president on the successful hosting of the 43rd session of the Unesco General Conference in Samarkand in 2025.
The declaration added that Uzbekistan expressed “full support” for Pakistan to work as the rotating chairman of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) for 2026-2027.
It also congratulated Pakistan on assuming the chairmanships of the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) of the SCO for the term 2025-2026, and the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) for the term 2026-2027.
“In addition, the Pakistan side noted its regular participation in the meetings of working groups on Uzbekistan’s accession to the WTO (World Trade Organisation) and its support for Uzbekistan’s early accession to the organisation,” it said.
Pakistan and Uzbekistan underlined the significance of peace and stability in Afghanistan as being “key to lasting regional peace, stability and prosperity in general and the successful implementation of the UAP Railway Project in particular”.
“The two leaders called on Afghanistan to address the threats of terrorism, and to take immediate and concrete actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan, which continue to pose serious threats to regional and global security, and prevent terrorist organisations from using the Afghan territory for terrorism against any other country,” the declaration said.
They also reaffirmed the importance of their constructive roles in promoting peace, stability, and just resolution of global conflicts, including expressing their support for the people of Palestine and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
The two sides underscored that the talks held during the visit and the bilateral documents signed will serve to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan, the statement added.
According to the declaration, Mirziyoyev invited PM Shehbaz to visit Uzbekistan “at a convenient time in order to further develop comprehensive cooperation”.
“Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif kindly accepted the invitation,” it said.</p><small>2026-02-06 12:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/061630562d71e13.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971423/captain-salman-agha-defends-x-factor-usman-tariqs-bowling-action-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-opener' target='_blank'><strong>Captain Salman Agha defends ‘X factor’ Usman Tariq’s bowling action ahead of T20 World Cup opener</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan captain Salman Agha defended off-spinner Usman Tariq’s unorthodox bowling action on Friday and called him the side’s “X factor” on the eve of their Twenty20 World Cup opener against the Netherlands in Colombo.
Tariq, who has played three T20 Internationals since his debut against South Africa in November, has been reported twice for a suspect bowling action in the Pakistan Super League. His bowling style culminates in him pausing near the crease before firing the ball in with a side-arm sling-shot action.
The 28-year-old claimed two wickets in his second T20 International, against Australia, and Australia batsman Cameron Green — one of his two victims in that match in Lahore — made a chucking gesture after being dismissed as he made his way off.
“I don’t understand why we are talking about his action because in my opinion it is a fair action,” Salman told reporters.
“He has been tested twice and he has been cleared,” he said.
“I think there is no problem in his action. Yes, he is the X factor of the team, and where we feel that we need an X factor, we will definitely use him.”
Having decided to boycott their Group A contest against defending champions India after Bangladesh were excluded from the tournament, Pakistan will have little margin for error in their bid to qualify for the Super 8 stage.
Apart from India, the group also contains the United States, who stunned Pakistan via the Super Over in the 2024 edition of the tournament.
Salman said they would have to be at their best even against second-tier teams like Namibia or the Netherlands.
“It is very important because you haven’t played much against these sides and you don’t really know their strength and weaknesses,” he said.
“So it is very, very important to bring your A game, and we as a team only think about how we can execute our plans for 40 overs.”</p><small>2026-02-06 12:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649366-blast-reported-near-imambargah-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad imambargah hit by suicide bomber; at least 32 killed, dozens injured</strong></a><br><p>
