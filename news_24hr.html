In the tournament being played as a warm-up ahead of the Asia Cup — which starts on September 9 — Pakistan have started with thrashings of Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates thanks to a number of players chipping in with impactful contributions. The tournament’s final is set for Sept 7.
After seasoned pacer Haris Rauf and skipper Salman Ali Agha led Pakistan to a 39-run win over Afghanistan in the opener, Saim Ayub and Hasan Nawaz scored half-centuries each to see the side down UAE by 31 runs.
The UAE fixture saw Pakistan cross the 200-mark as Hasan Nawaz launched a late onslaught after opener Saim Ayub had set the stage. Experienced fast bowler Hasan Ali then wrapped up the proceedings with 3-47 as UAE’s Asif Khan’s blistering 77 off 35 went in vain.
Under white-ball head coach Mike Hesson, Pakistan are building up to next year’s T20 World Cup without now discarded senior pros Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan and Hasan Nawaz said the young team was prepared for the upcoming challenges.
Pakistan shuffled their bowling line-up to bring in Hasan Ali and Salman Mirza in place of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris — the latter duo having played against Afghanistan.</p><small>2025-09-02 14:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/021921128898631.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939179/ppp-pti-leaders-take-exception-to-kp-cm-gandapurs-personal-support-for-kalabagh-dam' target='_blank'><strong>PPP, PTI leaders take exception to KP CM Gandapur’s ‘personal’ support for Kalabagh Dam</strong></a><br><p>PPP and PTI leaders took exception on Tuesday to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur conditionally backing the construction of Kalabagh Dam, pointing out that three provincial assemblies had adopted resolutions opposing the project in the past.
Gandapur said a day earlier that projects like the construction of Kalabagh Dam were necessary for the “sake of the future generation”, but also added that prior to such initiatives, reservations of all stakeholders, including provinces, should be addressed. Doubling down on his comments, today, he said that the very important national project was being stopped because of politics.
“Not building the Kalabagh Dam is unfair to the country and to our children’s future,” he said. Gandapur explained that the dam would be good for not just Punjab, but also for Sindh and KP. He called for all parties to talk together and find a solution.
Reacting to his remarks, PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro said that Kalabagh Dam’s construction was not just an issue for the PPP and that the Sindh, KP and Balochistan assemblies had passed resolutions against it in the past.
“This is not just about the PPP, but the entire province. Maybe Ali Amin sahib is unaware of this history or maybe he was not [active] in politics back then,” he added. Khuhro said Sindhis considered the waters of the Indus their lifeblood and any mention of Kalabagh elicited negation.
He said CM Gandapur should be questioned why the PTI government did not fast-track and complete the Bhasha dam and other such projects
PTI leader Asad Qaiser also downplayed Gandapur’s support as his “personal opinion” and not the party’s policy in a post on X.
“We do not believe that there is any need for Kalabagh Dam at this time. At this time, smaller dams can also be built … I think that it is not good to unnecessarily stir up controversial issues.”
 






The Awami National Party (ANP) and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) also rejected Gandapur’s remarks.
ANP chief Aimal Wali Khan stated that the Kalabagh Dam was not a solution to recurring floods in the country.
 






JUI-F KP spokesperson Abdul Jalil Jan termed the project a “dead horse” and questioned CM Gandapur about his earlier claim of constructing 350 dams.
Meanwhile, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan welcomed CM Gandapur’s proposal, emphasising that Kalabagh, along with other new dams, should be built with the consensus and consultation of all provinces.
He asserted that all four provincial assemblies and chief ministers must jointly find a solution to this pressing national issue.
Appreciating Gandapur’s support for the Kalabagh Dam, he noted that the construction of new dams was vital to safeguard against future water shortages and natural disasters as well as floods.
 






He stated that new dams would help to save trillions of rupees worth of water from going to waste. “Floods are no longer the issue of a single province; it has become a challenge for the entire country,” he added.
The minister highlighted that Pakistan as a whole was facing the adverse impacts of climate change, while the recent torrential rains in Gilgit-Baltistan, KP and Punjab had caused massive loss of lives and property.
He stressed that the immediate construction of small dams in all four provinces had become unavoidable and must be pursued on an urgent basis.
The minister further said that the construction of small dams required a collective national effort and a comprehensive policy framework at the national level, as fragmented approaches could not resolve such critical national challenges.

Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu.
Today morning, suicide bombers rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the main gate of the FC lines, which caused an explosion, Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan earlier told Dawn.com.
He further said the “attackers had infiltrated the premises, following which an operation was launched”, adding that Bannu District Police Officer Saleem Abbas was leading the operation inside the FC lines.
IG Hameed later told during a media briefing that police, army and FC personnel swiftly responded to the attack and killed five terrorists. “Four of the five terrorists were neutralised within an hour and later the fifth [attacker was also killed],“he said.
The IGP said a clearance and search operation was carried out at the site. The operation’s conclusion was later confirmed by RPO Khan, who initially told Dawn.com that five policemen were also injured during the exercise.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
Last month, police, alongside security forces in Hoveed and Wazirabad areas of Bannu, arrested “14 terrorist facilitators“ and destroyed their hideouts.
On August 3, a police constable was martyred in a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in Bannu, where an exchange of fire also left three terrorists dead and three policemen injured.
In July, ter­rorists used a quadcopter to attack a police station in Miryan, Bannu, making it the fifth such attack at the installation in a month.
According to data released by the Islamabad-based think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), the country witnessed an alarming spike in militant violence in August this year, registering a 74 per cent increase in militant attacks compared to July, becoming the “deadliest month in over a decade“.</p><small>2025-09-02 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/021857146815136.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939185/us-olympic-champion-gabby-thomas-to-miss-world-athletics-championships-due-to-injury' target='_blank'><strong>US Olympic champion Gabby Thomas to miss World Athletics Championships due to injury</strong></a><br><p>US track star and Olympic champion Gabby Thomas will miss the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo next week owing to an Achilles injury, NBC Sports reported on Tuesday.
A triple gold medalist at the Paris 2024 Olympics in the Women’s 200m, 4x100m and 4x400m, Thomas has dealt with an Achilles injury since May. It exacerbated in July, NBC Sports reported.
“I understand that it will be disappointing for some track fans to hear this news, but I’ve finally come to the realisation that it’s OK to be human and take care of myself,” she said in a statement, NBC Sports quoted her as saying.
“As an athlete, you always want to keep grinding, but sometimes you simply can’t outwork an injury,” the 28-year-old said.

“Sometimes it’s about patience and making the right decision for the long term.

“All the best to my Team USA teammates fighting for medals in Tokyo.”
The world championships run from Sept 13-21.

A press release from the PMD said the 5.4-magnitude earthquake occurred at 5:30pm in southeastern Afghanistan at a depth of 22 kilometres with tremors felt all the way in Peshawar, Mansehra, Islamabad, Abbottabad and Swat.
Meanwhile, the US Geological Survey reported it as a 5.2-magnitude earthquake 34 kilometres northeast of Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province.
The epicentre of the tremor was close to where a magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit late Sunday night, devastating remote areas in mountainous provinces near the border with Pakistan.
The “quake was felt in the same areas which were affected in Kunar [province] in the first earthquake”, Ehsanullah Ehsan, the disaster management spokesman in the hard-hit province, told AFP.
“These aftershocks are constant, but they have not caused any casualties yet.”
The number of victims from Sunday’s earthquake has mounted steadily, with 1,411 people dead and 3,124 injured in Kunar alone, chief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said today, making it one of the deadliest to hit the country in decades.
Another dozen people were killed and hundreds were injured in neighbouring Nangarhar province.
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, with dwindling aid since the Taliban seized power in 2021, undermining its ability to respond to disasters.
The devastation could affect “hundreds of thousands”, said United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Afghanistan Indrika Ratwatte.
The PMD earlier reported three more minor quakes in the day: a magnitude 4 in southeastern Afghanistan at 2:50pm at a depth of 97km, a magnitude 5.4 in China’s Xinjiang at 12:59pm at a depth of 10km and a magnitude 4.4 in southeastern Afghanistan at 12:25pm at a depth of 20km.</p><small>2025-09-02 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/021740415a69989.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939178/pm-shehbaz-president-putin-share-desire-to-bolster-pak-russia-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz, President Putin share desire to bolster Pak-Russia bilateral cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday agreed to further enhance the bilateral ties and cooperation between their countries in diverse fields.
In recent years, Russia and Pakistan have engaged in strengthening bilateral ties with each other. In July, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk said Islamabad and Moscow were “natural allies”. On June 3, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in a meeting with PM’s aide Syed Tariq Fatemi, reaffirmed Russia’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan, following a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed last September on multi-sector collaboration.
The meeting between the two leaders took place in Beijing today amid their visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of States (CHS) summit a day ago.
Addressing the Russian president, PM Shehbaz said: “Relations between the two countries have improved in recent years due to your personal commitment and interest.”
He expressed the resolve that Pakistan was also keen to strengthen the bilateral relations further, adding that they were moving in the right direction.
The premier added that after their meeting in Astana last year, both countries witnessed a flurry of delegation visits at the higher level, adding they also signed protocols to promote the agriculture, iron, steel, energy and transport sectors.
The prime minister also underlined the significance of the trade corridor connecting Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, noting that this initiative would boost regional connectivity and prosperity.
Expressing his satisfaction, he said both sides were keenly committed to building their relations.
The prime minister also expressed gratitude to the Russian president for supporting Pakistan, which was viewed as “a balancing act in the region”.
 






He said Pakistan respected Russia’s ties with India and wanted to establish very strong relations of its own, which would be “supplementary and complementary”.
PM Shehbaz expressed that these beneficial ties would add to the progress and prosperity of the region and assured President Putin of working closely in this context, as he had found him to be a “dynamic leader”.
Responding to Putin’s invitation to attend the SCO Heads of Government Summit in November, the premier replied that he was looking forward to it.
Meanwhile, President Putin said, “Pakistan has always been a traditional partner and remains as such in Asia, and we cherish these ties,” adding that both sides had agreed to intensify their bilateral relations.
The president noted that their bilateral trade needed to be enhanced and stressed taking steps to address the issue.
He also expressed his grief and extended his condolences to the people and the government of Pakistan on the losses suffered from catastrophes and natural disasters, including the recent flooding.
President Putin expressed optimism that Pakistan would overcome such challenges under the current leadership.
He also opined that the two countries kept cooperating at the inter-parliamentary levels, adding, “Pakistan is a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and both countries are keeping contacts within the framework of the United Nations, which is an important platform.”
Prior to their meeting, the prime minister appreciated Putin’s leadership for making sincere efforts to promote bilateral relations with Pakistan.
He observed that after their meeting in Astana during last year’s SCO-CHS summit, they had agreed to work closely to bolster the bilateral cooperation.
PM Shehbaz expressed confidence that together, both countries would make further efforts to promote bilateral ties and cooperation, particularly in commerce and trade.
He added that Pakistan-Russia bilateral trade witnessed a spike as Islamabad imported oil from Moscow last year that led to an increase in the trade volume.
PM, Tajik president express satisfaction with ongoing bilateral cooperation
Separately, PM Shehbaz met Tajikistan’s president and both leaders expressed their satisfaction with the ongoing cooperation between their countries in all areas of mutual interest.
The two leaders agreed to enhance collaboration in diverse fields, including trade and investment, connectivity, energy, regional security, culture, and people-to-people exchanges.
 






Both also reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations rooted in shared cultural, historical, and religious ties.
They further shared perspectives on regional and global issues of common concern.</p><small>2025-09-02 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621584-magnitude-54-earthquake-jolts-islamabad-kp-regions' target='_blank'><strong>Magnitude-5.4 earthquake jolts Islamabad, KP regions</strong></a><br><p>

At least 1,411 people have died, 3,124 have been injured and over 5,400 houses have been destroyed, Taliban administration spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.
 






More people are feared trapped under rubble, said the Afghan Red Crescent Society, a humanitarian group working in the region. The United Nations coordinator in Afghanistan said the toll was likely to rise.
A magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan later today, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). The epicentre of the quake was 34 kilometres northeast of Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province, according to the USGS.
Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.0, struck around midnight local time on Sunday, at a shallow depth of 10km, with the eastern provinces of Kunar and Nangarhar being the worst hit.
Rescue operations were carried out in four badly hit villages in Kunar on Monday and efforts will now be focused on reaching more remote mountain areas, said Ehsanullah Ehsan, the provincial head of disaster management.
“We cannot accurately predict how many bodies might still be trapped under the rubble,” said Ehsan. “Our effort is to complete these operations as soon as possible and to begin distributing aid to the affected families.”
Emergency “operations continued throughout the night”, Ehsan separately told AFP.
He said there were “still injured people left in the distant villages” in need of evacuation to hospitals.
Meanwhile, villagers joined the rescue efforts, using their bare hands to clear debris from mud and stone homes built into steep valleys.
Obaidullah Stoman, 26, who travelled to the village of Wadir to search for a friend, was overwhelmed by the level of destruction.
“I’m searching here, but I didn’t see him. It was very difficult for me to see the conditions here,” he told AFP. “There is only rubble left.”
The dead, including children, were wrapped in white shrouds by villagers who prayed over their bodies before burying them.
Some of the hardest-hit villages remain inaccessible due to blocked roads, the United Nations migration agency told AFP.
Mountainous terrain and inclement weather have hindered rescuers from reaching remote areas along the border with Pakistan, where the quake flattened hundreds of mud-and-brick homes.
Access for vehicles along narrow mountain roads was the main obstacle, said Ehsan, adding machinery was being brought in to clear roads of debris.
On Tuesday, a line of ambulances was on the damaged mountain road trying to reach Kunar villages, as helicopters flew in, bringing aid supplies and taking the injured to hospitals, according to a Reuters witness.
Some of those injured have been transferred to hospitals in Kabul and the adjacent province of Nangarhar, said Ehsan.
Thousands of children were at risk, the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) warned on Tuesday.
Unicef said it was sending medicines, warm clothing, tents and tarpaulins for shelter, and hygiene items such as soap, detergent, towels, sanitary pads, and water buckets.
Taliban soldiers were deployed in the area, providing help and security.
Rescue teams and authorities were trying to dispose of animal carcasses quickly so as to minimise the risk of contamination to water resources, a UN official said on Monday.
“Damaged roads, ongoing aftershocks, and remote locations of many villages severely impede the delivery of aid,” the World Health Organisation said, adding that over 12,000 people had been affected by the quake.
“The pre-earthquake fragility of the health system means local capacity is overwhelmed, creating total dependence on external actors,” it said.
Food and tents were desperately needed, said Safiullah Noorzai from Aseel, a humanitarian tech platform with networks around Afghanistan. With their houses in ruins, many people were living in the open amid a fear of aftershocks, Noorzai added.
Aid cuts and promises of assistance
After decades of conflict, Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, facing a protracted humanitarian crisis and the influx of millions of Afghans forced back to the country by neighbours Pakistan and Iran in recent years.
Since the Taliban seized power in 2021, foreign aid to the country has been slashed, undermining the already impoverished nation’s ability to respond to disasters.
The United States was the largest aid donor until early 2025, when all but a sliver of funds were cancelled after President Donald Trump took office.
In June, the United Nations said it was drastically scaling back its global humanitarian aid plans due to the “deepest funding cuts ever”.
On Monday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a statement the organisation was working with authorities to “swiftly assess needs, provide emergency assistance and stand ready to mobilise additional support”, and announced an initial $5 million.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed deep condolences to the families who lost their loved ones in the earthquake.
Meanwhile, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government decided to immediately dispatch a consignment of essential medicines to earthquake-stricken reg­ions of Afghanistan, with Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announcing that the provincial government was fully prepared to deploy medical staff.
Today, adviser to KP CM on Information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif further assured that the provincial government “will extend full support to the affected Afghan families, emphasising solidarity in this hour of hardship.”
“We stand shoulder to shoulder with our Afghan brothers during this difficult time and assure them of all possible assistance,” state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported on Tuesday.
The report quoted him as saying that “hospitals across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are open and ready to treat injured Afghan victims of the earthquake. Relief teams, rescue workers, medicines, tents, and food supplies are prepared for immediate dispatch to the affected areas.”
 
 

Earlier, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also held a phone call with his Afghan counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi and assured him of Pakistan’s “readiness to extend all possible support”.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), Dar held a phone call with Muttaqi on Monday “to convey condolences on the tragic loss of lives, with thousands injured in last night’s earthquake in Afghanistan.”
 






Meanwhile, Britain has allocated 1 million pounds to support the efforts of the UN and the International Red Cross in delivering critical healthcare and emergency supplies to Afghanistan.
India delivered 1,000 tents and was moving 15 tonnes of food supplies to Kunar, with more relief materials to be sent on Tuesday.
Other nations such as China, the United Arab Emirates, the European Union and Iran have also pledged help, but aid is yet to arrive.
Deadly earthquakes
Afghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, near the junction of the Eurasia and India tectonic plates.
In October 2023, western Herat province was devastated by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake, which killed more than 1,500 people and damaged or destroyed more than 63,000 homes.
A 5.9-magnitude quake struck the eastern province of Paktika in June 2022, killing more than 1,000 people and leaving tens of thousands homeless.</p><small>2025-09-02 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/02101641b108d78.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939120/asif-ali-announces-retirement-from-international-cricket' target='_blank'><strong>Asif Ali announces retirement from international cricket</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s middle-order batter Asif Ali announced his retirement from international cricket on Monday, calling it the “greatest honour” of his life to represent the country.
Asif, 33, played 21 ODIs and 58 T20Is, mainly as a finisher in the middle order.
“Wearing the Pakistan jersey has been the greatest honour of my life and serving my country on the cricket field has been my proudest chapter,” he said in a post on social media.
 






“To my fans, teammates, and coaches, thank you for your love, belief, and support through every high and low.
He made his T20I debut against West Indies in April 2018 after helping Islamabad United win the PSL that year, hitting three successive sixes at a crucial point in the chase in the final. Two months later, an ODI debut followed.
“To my family and friends, who stood with me in moments of joy and in ther deepest of trials, including the loss of my beloved daughter during the World Cup, your strength carried me forward,” he said.
 
 

He added: “I retire with immense gratitude, and InshaAllah will continue to share my passion for the game by playing domestic and league cricket worldwide.”
Primarily utilised as a finisher and power hitter, Asif Ali carved out a niche in Pakistan’s middle order, boasting strike rates of 133.87 in T20Is and 121.65 in ODIs, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said.
His standout moment came at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2021 against Afghanistan, where he produced a breathtaking cameo that remains etched in memory.
With Pakistan needing 24 off 12 balls, Ali hammered four sixes in the penultimate over off Karim Janat, racing to 25 from just 7 deliveries and sealing the chase with an over to spare, a knock that proved pivotal in Pakistan’s march to the semi-finals.
Asif was fined by the ICC for a fiery on-field spat with Fareed Ahmad of Afghanistan in their thrilling Asia Cup match in Sharjah.
The Pakistan Cricket Board thanked Asif for his services to Pakistan cricket in a post on X.
 






Teammate and all-rounder Shadab Khan extended best wishes to Asif for the next chapter in his career.
“Happy retirement to one of the best teammates and a brother. Best wishes for the next chapter in your career, Asif bhai!” he said in a post on X.

However, the viral visual is doctored.
Punjab remains in the grip of a worsening flood crisis, as the Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers surge to “exceptionally high” levels, threatening vast swathes of land, while the Provincial Disaster Management Authority has warned of more torrential rain, which could lead to urban flooding across Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat.
On Sept 1, a visual of digital news outlet Siasat.pk was shared on X by a user who appeared to be a PTI supporter based on his past posts and username. The visual featured a quote attributed to Warraich.
The text on the image read: “The type of anti-ageing treatment Maryam Nawaz is undergoing has harmful side effects — it causes brain cells to shrink. That’s why Maryam has been acting childishly and behaving with extreme stubbornness. Otherwise, only an ignorant person would put their own photos on flood relief supplies.”
The post was viewed by more than 47,800 users.
The same post was shared by other PTI supporters as well. These posts can be seen here, here, and here, collectively garnering over 38,000 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the Punjab floods and the provincial government’s response to them.
A reverse image search to corroborate whether Siasat.pk had shared any such post produced no results. Reviewing the platform’s official X and Facebook accounts also yielded nothing.
A keyword search to confirm whether the senior journalist had made the remarks anywhere in speech or writing also yielded no results.
On closer examination of the viral post, several discrepancies were identified. The QR code in the lower-left corner was scanned and led to an unrelated X post instead of the source where Warraich might have made the alleged statement, indicating it had no connection to the alleged claim.
A comparison between the viral visual and the platform’s authentic templates revealed clear differences. Siasat.pk currently uses two standard designs. In both, the QR code appears with the word “source” written in a regular font beneath it with the “S” in upper case.
In the viral post, however, “source” appears in bold font with the “S” in lower case.
 


Additional inconsistencies include an incorrect date format (“Sept01,2025” without spacing and using a non-standard abbreviation) and an oversized logo compared to the original posts.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral visual shows journalist Suhail Warraich making critical remarks about CM Maryam Nawaz is false. The viral visual is doctored, and no evidence exists that the journalist has uttered the alleged remarks.

“We call it chambi,” he explained to Dawn.com, referring to the makeshift fishing rod — a wooden frame glued together from multiple pieces of wood and a net tied at one end — as we caught up with him at the downstream Hyderabad-Kotri railway bridge on the left bank of the Indus. Ali had tied a piece of foam around his waist with a rope. “This [foam] helps me float in the river as long as I am in there,” he remarked.

Most days, he swims in the river on both sides as well as in the rivercourse, wherefrom the main current of the Indus flows. While entering the river, Ali holds the chambi tight. “As soon as a fish hits it [the net], my hand feels its impact,” he said. “These days we hope to catch the palla fish, a unique species,” he added.
On better days, his catch comprises around five to six small fish, each of which sells for Rs200. Of late, Ali and many other fishermen like him spend long hours inside the river, which has swelled courtesy the improved flows downstream of Kotri.

A lifeline
For people of Sindh, the Indus river holds a special place in their hearts. It is celebrated. It is their lifeline. And this is exactly why, until April this year, a massive anti-canal movement, led by lawyers and political forces, converged in the province. It ended only with the announcement by the prime minister-led Council of Common Interests (CCI) that no new canals would be built over the river until a mutual understanding could be reached among the provinces.
“Floods in Sindh are taken as a positive sign because the province is located at the tail end of the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS)”, explained Sindh Chamber of Agriculture (SCA) vice president Nabi Bux Sathio, a progressive farmer.
“I think the Indus river flows aplenty these days. This is certainly going to benefit the entire area wherefrom the water flows will travel between the three barrages,” he said.
 

Two elderly staff members of civic agency sit near at the water facility set up near bank of Indus river for lifting of drinking water for Latifabad.

According to Sathio, groundwater in Sindh is generally brackish compared to upper riparian Punjab. “So, these flows will recharge the groundwater to some extent. Likewise, lands in four districts — Tando Mohammad Khan, Sujawal, Thatta and Badin — have lost soil fertility wherever they were located close to the drainage system,” he continued, adding that the flows within the two dykes of the Indus river will help reclaim fertility in all those areas that are located within its reach.
The riverine area of the Indus is inundated whenever such flows start passing the barrages, and they are beneficial for it. At the same time, forests benefit too. According to the forest department’s website, out of Sindh’s total land mass of 14.099 million hectares or 34.84m acres, an area of 1.384mha or 3.426m acres is under the forest department’s control, making up 9.83pc of the total land of the province. Of this area, riverine forests and irrigated plantations cover only 2.29pc, clearly indicating that Sindh is deficient in forestry resources.

These riverine areas also contribute substantially to crop production, with increased flows naturally benefiting the area’s soil. “If water flows increase and are termed high flood, the riverine area, which is considered part of the river, gets inundated.
“It’s absolutely normal, in fact, a lifeline for the river. This helps maintain the ecosystem, biodiversity, forests and aquifer,” explained Mahmood Nawaz Shah, president of the Sindh Abagdar Board (SAB), a community of agriculturalists.
“Therefore, it’s normal that some crops get impacted, which are essentially in the riverine area. The quantum of water is huge, but not abnormal for the river at this time,” he added.
Under threat
On the flip side, the riverine floods trigger relocation and displacement of katcha dwellers. Katcha, a term frequently used in the revenue department’s records, refers to areas located inside the Indus river’s dykes on both sides. Millions of people have lived in these areas for centuries, right from the Guddu to the Kotri barrages.

Recently, the Sindh chief minister announced an evacuation strategy for the population living in the katcha area, considering the variations in river flows passing the three barrages. “It is in our mind to protect lives and livestock under any circumstances,“ CM Murad Ali Shah told a press conference earlier. “Whether the waters are 800,000 [cusecs] and 900,000 or God forbid more than that, our entire katcha area will drown, so we will need to evacuate people from there,” he said.
Shama Bagri, a member of a nomadic community, resides with her family in Palari village, located in the Hussainabad area. A small hut covered with a patchwork of discoloured rags serves as her shelter on the left bank of the Indus river. “We settled here from Tando Mohammad Khan to eke out a living by selling fruits or doing daily wage labour,” said Bagri, whose hut sits atop a small mound a few feet away from the river.

Around 35 Bagri families have settled in this reach of the riverine area. Premo Bagri is another one of them. For now, he is convinced that the river will not cause any harm to him or other families in his community. “When the water flow peaked last year, the river reached a certain height,“ he said, pointing at stones dumped near a water pumping facility, run by a municipal body that lifts supplies of potable water to the city.
For him, the facility serves as a benchmark for when the water level crosses a certain threshold and necessitates temporary shifting to higher ground. “When the water level starts rising, we notice it. I look at the Indus from here and make my own assessment … I am not worried as of today,” he added.
A guessing game
For the past few days, the arrival of floodwaters — downstream Punjab through eastern rivers — has become a guessing game for authorities. Irrigation authorities are making assessments after examining discharges in the eastern rivers of the country. The Chenab river reached a peak of around 1.75m cusecs last week, prompting the Sindh government to prepare for a ‘very high’ or ‘super flood’.
Kotri is the last barrage on the mighty Indus in Sindh. After the river passes the barrage, it enters the Arabian Sea in the coastal district of Thatta through various creeks. Since July, the Indus river has remained in a flood-like state.

This year, Sindh’s two main barrages — Guddu and Sukkur — have already experienced medium and high floods in July and August. Now, authorities are bracing for another flood, with the Sindh chief minister highlighting in his presser on Sunday that while Guddu has already recorded a peak of 550,000 cusecs on Aug 24 in the Indus, the government is preparing for the worst-case scenario.
“Weather patterns can go anywhere. Nobody knows how hill torrents will behave, as was seen in Koh-e-Suleman range when floodwaters were entering Sindh back in 2010,” he told the media in Sukkur. According to him, the Sindh government is preparing itself for a super flood having a quantum of 900,000 cusecs or above under a comprehensive strategy.

Meanwhile, per the irrigation department’s figures, the Guddu barrage in Sindh has a designed discharge capacity of 1.2m cusecs, followed by the Sukkur barrage’s 900,000 cusecs and Kotri’s 875,000 cusecs. The Sukkur barrage, at the time of construction, had a designed discharge capacity of 1.5m cusecs, but due to silt accumulation upstream, 10 of its gates had to be closed, thus reducing its capacity to 900,000 cusecs.
The last time the Guddu and Sukkur barrages passed a super flood was 15 years ago. On August 8, 2010, Guddu had passed a flow of 1,148,200 cusecs downstream after receiving a flow of 1,148,738 cusecs upstream; Sukkur passed 1,108,795 cusecs downstream after having 1,130,995 cusecs upstream the same day. Meanwhile, Kotri barrage passed 939,442 cusecs downstream on Aug 27, 2010, following 964,897 cusecs upstream.
This was not, however, without spelling disaster. The Aug 7, 2010, infamous breach at Tori dyke on the right bank of the Indus upstream Guddu barrage had wreaked havoc for districts on the right bank of the river. Twenty days on, another breach at Kot Almo downstream Kotri barrage had caused further destruction.

Provincial authorities are currently observing flow patterns at the Trimmu barrage and the upstream Panjnad barrage, both located in Punjab. According to Pakistan’s river system mapping, Panjnad barrage is the location where the water from all rivers — Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej — gather and then head for Sindh via the Guddu barrage. At this stage, the flows of the Chenab River are likely to precede the flows of Ravi and Sutlej insofar as arrival at Guddu is concerned.
According to the Flood Forecasting Division’s river flows chart, Trimmu, which was showing a rising trend until last night, is now falling constantly. It has a designed discharge capacity of 875,000 cusecs. It is currently receiving floodwaters generated in Chenab, invariably 10,77,951 cusecs that passed through Khanki and Qadirabad last week. The travel distance for water between Trimmu and Panjnad — the final destination in Punjab before the eastern river flows would enter in the Indus — is around 48 hours. It would then take another 24 hours to reach Mithan Kot, from where they hit the Guddu barrage.

At 4pm on Monday, the discharge downstream Trimmu was recorded at 550,965 cusecs, according to the FFC river flow situation’s chart. But by noon today, the downstream discharge fell to 445,712 cusecs after reaching 516,313 cusecs at 8am. With this flow, Trimmu is perhaps recording a falling trend only to lessen pressure on Guddu ultimately for the authorities.
On the other hand, the Panjnad downstream outflow was recorded at 101,664 cusecs on Tuesday noon, while the Guddu barrage started showing a rising trend at the same time with an inflow of 360,777 cusecs upstream and 345,373 cusecs downstream. A flow that passes downstream at any barrage is considered a flood, considering different categories defined based on river flows.
The storage at Tarbela dam, which remains the principal source of water for Sindh, is being maintained at 1,500 — its optimum level, according to the FFC. Not only this, but the Chashma barrage over the Indus is also holding water to some extent, and its level has risen over the last few days from 647ft to 648ft to help Sindh manage floodwaters from the eastern rivers.
While the flood waters may have reignited hope for farmers and other fishermen in the regions, katcha dwellers wait with bated breath, bracing themselves for yet another year of destruction and displacement.

Lin and Algerian boxer Imane Khelif were at the centre of a major gender row at the 2024 Paris Olympics, where they won titles in separate weight classes.
World Boxing said last month that women wanting to compete at the championships in Liverpool on September 4-14 would have to undergo mandatory gender testing under its new policy.
The 29-year-old Lin had agreed to undergo the testing, her coach Tseng Tzu-chiang told AFP at the time.
Taiwan’s boxing association said it submitted the results to World Boxing and had not received a response, the semi-official Central News Agency reported late Monday.
“We cannot allow the athlete to travel to the UK without any guarantee,” the association was quoted as saying.
The association told AFP in a message on Tuesday that Lin “will not attend the world championships in Liverpool”, but did not give a reason or respond to AFP’s other questions.
Lin’s coach Tseng did not respond to phone calls or messages.
AFP has contacted World Boxing for comment.
Under its policy, fighters over 18 who want to participate in a World Boxing-sanctioned competition need to take a PCR, or polymerase chain reaction genetic test.
Lin and Khelif were excluded from the International Boxing Association’s (IBA) 2023 world championships after the IBA said they had failed eligibility tests.
However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) allowed them both to compete in Paris, saying they had been victims of “a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA”. Both went on to triumph.
Khelif has turned to sport’s top court, CAS, to challenge World Boxing’s gender testing.
At present, neither boxer is set to compete in Liverpool.
Khelif and Lin were subjected to attacks on social media, rumours about their biological sex and disinformation during the Paris Games.
The IOC leapt to their defence, saying they were born and raised as women, and have passports attesting to that.</p><small>2025-09-02 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621533-treasury-opposition-unite-in-backing-water-reservoirs-to-curb-flood-devastation' target='_blank'><strong>Treasury, opposition unite in backing water reservoirs to curb flood devastation</strong></a><br><p>

The WHO said that, while global suicide rates had fallen somewhat in recent years, progress in combating the issue was far too slow.
In 2021— the last year for which data was available — there were an estimated 727,000 suicides worldwide, the United Nations’ health agency said.
“Globally, suicide accounts for more than one in every 100 deaths, and for each death, there are 20 suicide attempts,” said Devora Kestel, the interim head of the WHO’s non-communicable disease and mental health department.
Those suicides “affected countless more lives and livelihoods, as friends, carers and loved ones were forced to grapple with unimaginable hardship”, she told reporters.
The WHO’s World Mental Health Today report highlighted that suicide remains a leading cause of death among young people across geographies and socioeconomic contexts.
In 2021, it was the second leading cause of death for girls and women aged 15 to 29, and the third leading cause for males in the same age category, it found.
Despite a 35-per cent global decline in the age-adjusted suicide rate between 2000 and 2021, the world is still falling short of its goal: instead of the targeted one-third reduction in suicide rates between 2015 and 2030, current progress suggests only a 12pc decrease will be achieved, according to the WHO.
‘Stagnation’
Decreases were seen in every region — except in the Americas, where the suicide rate increased by 17pc in the same period.
Nearly three-quarters of all suicides take place in lower-income countries, where most of the global population lives.
Although wealthier countries have a higher suicide rate, as a proportion of population, it is difficult to compare since they also tend to have better data available than lower-income countries, the WHO pointed out.
The agency cautioned that, while suicide rates have been slowly declining, the prevalence of mental disorders like anxiety and depression has been swelling.
“Between 2011 and 2021, the number of people living with mental disorders increased faster than the global population,” the report said.
According to the latest findings, more than one billion people are living with mental health disorders.
The WHO voiced particular concern about growing mental health distress among young people.
While there is likely a long line of drivers behind the increase, Mark van Ommeren, head of the WHO mental health unit, said, “The two main hypotheses are social media and the impact of the Covid pandemic”.
In this context, WHO voiced alarm at a “stagnation” in mental health investment around the world, with median government spending on mental health remaining at just two per cent of total health budgets – unchanged since 2017.
Globally, only nine per cent of people with depression get treatment, it found.
“Transforming mental health services is one of the most pressing public health challenges,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.</p><small>2025-09-02 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/021257059be8b8c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939147/nestle-investors-face-more-turbulence-after-ceo-ousted-over-affair-with-subordinate' target='_blank'><strong>Nestle investors face more turbulence after CEO ousted over affair with subordinate</strong></a><br><p>Nestle investors were pitched back into choppy waters on Tuesday after the Swiss food giant changed its chief executive officer for the second time in a year, ousting boss Laurent Freixe over an affair he had with a subordinate.
The company’s shares were indicated 1.9 per cent lower in premarket activity in Zurich following Freixe’s sudden dismissal on Monday following a board meeting to discuss the findings of an investigation into the relationship.
The downturn is another blow for Nestle investors who have been frustrated with three years of share price declines between 2022 and 2024 and no signs of a recovery this year.
Freixe will be replaced by Philipp Navratil, a rising star at the maker of Nescafe coffee and KitKat chocolate bars, which has been struggling with sales volumes since the pandemic.
The dismissal of Freixe follows an investigation into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate, which breached Nestle’s code of business conduct, Nestle said late on Monday.
Freixe, who spent 39 years with Nestle, will receive no exit package following his departure, the company told Reuters.
The Nestle veteran’s abrupt removal comes a year after predecessor Mark Schneider was axed, and two and a half months after longstanding chair Paul Bulcke announced he would step down in 2026 in one of the most turbulent periods in the company’s 159-year history.
In a short statement, Bulcke thanked Freixe for his years of service at Nestle, but said the dismissal was a “necessary decision”.
Management stability sought
Nestle’s shares, a bedrock of the Swiss stock exchange, have lost almost a third of their value over the past five years, underperforming European peers.
Freixe’s appointment failed to halt the slide, with the company’s shares shedding 17pc during his leadership, disappointing investors.
In July, Nestle launched a review of its underperforming vitamins business that could lead to the divestment of some brands after first-half sales volumes missed expectations.
“The market did not particularly like Freixe, and the restructuring goals were also put on the back burner,” said Maurizio Porfiri, chief investment officer at trading firm Maverix.
“Another fresh start is needed, and it is time for more stability to return to the management at this global corporation,” he told Reuters.
Freixe’s dismissal was featured on the front page of Swiss newspapers, with Neue Zuercher Zeitung noting that Nestle had lost its “legendary stability” where CEOs stayed for years before eventually becoming chairmen.
The latest change is likely to leave questions unanswered about Nestle’s mid-term direction and “keep a lid on the equity story until we hear more about Mr Navratil’s plan,” JP Morgan analysts said in a research note.
The bank’s analysts said the news of Freixe’s ouster was unlikely to reassure investors because it was the second time in a year that the company had appointed a new boss without carrying out a thorough search for a replacement.
The note also expressed concern that incoming CEO Navratil looked as though he would be “boxed in” by Freixe’s turnaround strategy for now at a time when the market remained unconvinced.
Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, said he expected Nestle’s shares to come under pressure due to the latest upheaval at Nestle’s HQ in Vevey, next to Lake Geneva.
“This is not the Nestle way to do things, to have two CEO replacements in just over a year,” Cox said. “Hopefully this will get them back on the straight and narrow.”</p><small>2025-09-02 08:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/021208021c52345.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939128/pakistan-china-vow-to-deepen-all-weather-strategic-cooperative-partnership' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China vow to deepen ‘all-weather strategic cooperative’ partnership</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and China on Tuesday reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening their “iron-clad and all-weather strategic cooperative partnership” through enhanced cooperation, reflecting their unique bilateral relationship.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with ties ranging across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence, and infrastructure.
The bilateral ties and cooperation were discussed in a meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit, held from August 31 to September 1.
“During the meeting, the two leaders agreed that the relationship between their countries was unique and unparalleled, which should be reflected in their enhanced bilateral cooperation,” the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) said.
“Both leaders also discussed important regional and global developments and agreed to continue close cooperation between Pakistan and China in this regard.”
 






PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the desire to continue working closely with China for the successful implementation of the next phase of the upgraded China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), with its five new corridors, the report said.
“He congratulated President Xi on the success of the SCO Council of Heads of State Summit in Tianjin and offered his felicitations on the 80th anniversary of the World Anti-Fascist War.”
 
 

Lauding President Xi Jinping for his visionary and transformational leadership that has inspired China’s remaining journey towards modernisation and progress, the prime minister said that Pakistan took great pride in Beijing’s achievements and would always stand ready to work together with China in this great journey.
He also appreciated China’s unflinching support for Pakistan’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, and socio-economic development, as well as the significance of CPEC as a flagship project of President Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to help both countries build an even stronger Pakistan-China community with a shared future.
The prime minister hailed President Xi’s strong commitment to strengthening multilateralism and said Pakistan fully supported China’s landmark steps in this regard, including the Global Governance Initiative, Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, as well as Global Civilisation Initiative.
“These initiatives would serve the collective global good and contribute to regional as well as global peace, stability and development,” the PM was quoted as saying in the report.
President Xi said that China would continue to assist Pakistan in all fields of economic growth and development, especially as the two countries were now ushering in the second Phase of CPEC, which would focus on Pakistan’s most important economic sectors.
PM Shehbaz renewed his “most cordial” invitation to President Xi to undertake an official visit to Pakistan next year, when both countries would celebrate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Pakistan-China diplomatic ties.</p><small>2025-09-02 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/02115526e134e70.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939045/senate-panel-nixes-bids-for-carec-highway-project' target='_blank'><strong>Senate panel nixes bids for CAREC highway project</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A Senate committee on Monday invalidated the bids for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Tranche-III project and called on the National Highway Authority (NHA) to cancel the bids and inform the project financier of its findings regarding the use of “forged” documents to secure all four contracts associated with the Rs170 billion project.
The Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs Division also called for the blacklisting of a joint venture (JV) of three firms — M/s Ningxia Communications Construction Co., Ltd NXCC, M/s Dynamic Constructors, and M/s Rustam Associates.
The committee called on the NHA to write to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the project financier, within two days regarding the firms’ non-compliance and the fraudulent nature of the bids.
It further recommended that the Economic Affairs Division officially notify the ADB that the bids were “technically invalid and were manipulated due to the malafide intentions of NHA officials and the contractors.”

Committee shocked by NHA revelation that companies have refused to provide relevant documents, terms bid papers ‘forged’

The committee declared the bids null and void, concluding that documents submitted by the auditors were “fraudulent and unverified” and that due process was not followed.
The committee noted that the lead partner, NXCC, had previously been disqualified from two other ADB-funded projects, including CAREC Trance-II, but was still deemed qualified for Tranche-III.
It also criticised the NHA for awarding the contracts to a company with a history of disqualification and for what it called persistent non-cooperation with the parliamentary investigation.
According to an official statement, issued by the Senate Secretariat, NHA officials told the committee that letters had been sent to all firms, but they had refused to provide the required documents.The committee was shocked to learn that the firms had sent their responses to their auditors instead of directly to the NHA.
“The NHA has failed to submit the required documents to date, despite  a commitment made by the CEO, NHA, in the last meeting to provide them  within two days,” he added.
After extensive deliberations, the committee concluded that NHA failed to provide the required documents. The auditor of the local firms admitted that they did not have the documents, and both contractors also refused to provide them.

As a learner of flood management, I have been directly part of the 1994, 1995, 1997, 2010, 2015 river floods and the 2003, 2005 (Balochistan), 2011 and 2022 rain-induced floods. And now, in just three to four days, a very high flood looms over the province, threatening to engulf us yet again.
The water is expected to surpass 700,000 cusecs with a 10-20 per cent margin of uncertainty, pushing possible peaks and likely hitting 775,000 to 850,000 cusecs. Upstream, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) have already been battered by floods that have claimed hundreds of lives and shattered infrastructure, most of which was built in the waterway or flood plains of the rivers.
I have said this before, and I will say this again: people may forget, but rivers remember their ways.
In KP, forests, once lush green, have been shaved bald, causing fatal landslides. On the other hand, unplanned urbanisation, an inadequate flood-resilient infrastructure and poor river management have all aggravated the situation.
One mission
When it comes to Sindh, where 1.65 million lives are at stake, we stand at a pivotal moment: falter under criticism or unite — government, institutions, communities — in a singular mission to guide this flood to the sea and save our people, our province, our country.
The Sindh Irrigation Department, charged with taming this colossal flow, faces sharp scrutiny. Decades of weak flood infrastructure planning and execution, political interference, and systemic corruption across federal and provincial governance have eroded its capacity, a malaise echoing through Pakistan’s disaster management framework, laid bare by the 2010 and 2022 historical floods that displaced millions and caused over $30 billion in damages.
Yet, the department remains a cornerstone of flood-fighting, its engineers holding the line where newer entities such as the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) fall short. The revenue department and district administrations, despite inefficiencies rooted in their colonial and bureaucratic character, wield immense power to mobilise resources, coordinate relief, and enforce actions.
If we can shake off their rigid, outdated ways and rally them to the mission of saving the country and its citizens, their authority can turn positively for the vulnerable people and areas. Blanket criticism, especially now, risks breaking the spirit of those on the frontlines.
Between panic, criticism, and actions, the truth rings clear: saving lives comes first. Let us sharpen our critiques to target specific weaknesses — unrepaired barrage gates, riverbank encroachments, private embankments — and act swiftly to mend them.
The challenge
Sindh faces a unique challenge: the Indus flows on an elevated ridge, higher than the surrounding land, with no breaching sections or escape routes for excess water. When the river breaks free, as it did in the 2010 Tori Bund breach, it carves paths hundreds of miles long, flooding areas like Manchhar Lake and drowning Khairpur Nathan Shah.
Since 2010, promises of projects for river outlets and flood escape canals have stalled, leaving us with one task: to guide the floods to the sea safely. The province’s 1,400 miles of embankments, with 875 miles as the first line of defence along the Indus, hold over 140 vulnerable points prone to erosion, scouring, or breaches. The water’s speed demands we fortify this first line of defence at Guddu first, then almost immediately at Sukkur, and finally at Kotri barrages.
 
 

At the heart of this crisis are 1.65 million people in the riverine katcha areas across 14 districts — Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, Hyderabad, Thatta — where 273,000 families, their homes, crops, and livestock face peril. Once, indigenous floodplain communities thrived through nomadic resilience, moving to higher ground with ancestral knowledge of the river’s rhythms, and knew exactly at what river discharge, what coping mechanism was to be applied.
But the rise of an aggressive agriculture-based economy has rooted permanent settlements — concrete homes and farmlands — that now stand vulnerable. Encroachments for crops have choked natural flood channels, heightening risks of erosion and breaches, as seen in past devastations.
Landowners in these areas deserve economic benefits, but these must align with historical practices, British-era surveys, water laws, and our Constitution, ensuring no one’s profit endangers another’s life.
Bracing for the upcoming water flows, evacuations have begun with over 24,000 people moved to over 300 relief camps. Yet, many cling to their katcha homes, unwilling to abandon their livestock (read: their lifeline).
Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro are inspecting sites, including the Guddu Barrage, their presence signalling urgency. To reach katcha residents, mobile relief units — equipped with boats, emergency supplies, and veterinary support — must deliver aid on-site, honouring traditional coping strategies while addressing modern risks.
The agony and pain of camp life were demonstrated in the 2022 floods, and the same echoes in Punjab’s recent flood camps — a horrible experience, especially for women and the elderly.
The plan
From decades of facing floods, a clear path emerges — a multi-layered strategy to safeguard Sindh.
First and foremost, fortify the frontline. Urgent repairs to embankments and barrage gates must begin with Guddu, then Sukkur, and Kotri. The “three Ms” — man, material, machinery — are the foundation: active camps, trained staff, excavators, bulldozers, flood-fighting equipment, and open supply routes.
At the same time, small details matter — mosquito repellent for workers, life jackets for those measuring river levels by boat. Real-time monitoring through satellite data and field river gauge observations, with alerts in Sindhi and Urdu, will keep us ahead of the flood. It must be round the clock, not leaving the frontline unattended for a spur-of-the-moment.
The next step is the mobilisation of all institutions, from the revenue department to the local administration. They must shed their colonial bureaucratic shackles, enforce actions, and join the engineers of the irrigation department who hold “unity of command” per the Bund Manual — a document detailing rules for river channel operation and maintenance.
Narrow bridges, like Dadu-Moro, choke floodwaters, as seen in 2010 when a cut in the approach road saved a city. Inspect and widen bridge approaches now. The 2022 Sindh Indus River Commission’s plan to expand all bridges must move forward, no matter the cost, once we have safely handled the current floods.
 
 

Separately, local leaders and residents must support watch posts and patrols, armed with spades and torches. Social media can dispel rumours or confirm threats, but only if we visit sites and act. Updated data on private embankments — ordered removed post-2010 by the Supreme Court — is critical. Have they returned by 2025?
Next comes delivering relief, particularly to those who need it the most. Start with evacuating women, children and the elderly. Camps need food, water, medicines, and document pouches, with mobile health units to curb disease outbreaks.
A national emergency can align federal and provincial efforts, with the NDMA leading to ease Sindh’s isolation. The authority has both power and money, but they are least linked with communities on the ground. Here, the irrigation department and other organisations can provide links and connectivity.
Transparent resource allocation, overseen by opposition leaders and civil society, will silence corruption allegations. Ad hoc task forces, guided by neutral bodies like the Supreme Court-mandated water commission, can mend institutional gaps.
Coming together
This flood exposes deep challenges.
The PPP’s governance since 2008 has faced accusations of prioritising elite projects over resilient infrastructure, while federal-provincial disputes over water persist. Pakistan’s reactive flood management, stalling reforms, amplifies climate-driven risks. The National Flood Protection Program IV has been in the doldrums for the last eight years or so.
 
 

Yet, in this moment, the Quran’s wisdom guides us: “Whoever saves one life, it is as if they have saved all of humanity.”
With hours ticking down, all relevant public sector departments, and all of Sindh must unite — shedding bureaucratic inertia for a mission to save lives, Sindh, and Pakistan. Long-term reforms — vulnerability mapping, anti-encroachment drives, sustainable agriculture — await, but today, we guide this flood to the sea, as the Indus waters wait for no one.

The 35-year-old left-armer retires as the nation’s most prolific fast bowler in the format, with 79 wickets from 65 T20Is, second on the all-time Australia list to spin bowling teammate Adam Zampa.
Test cricket is and has always been my highest priority,” he said in a Cricket Australia statement on Tuesday.
 






“I have loved every minute of every T20 game I have played for Australia, particularly the 2021 World Cup, not just because we won but the incredible group and the fun along the way.
“Looking ahead to an away Indian test tour, the Ashes and an ODI World Cup in 2027, I feel this is my best way forward to remain fresh, fit and at my best for those campaigns.
“It also gives the bowling group time to prepare for the T20 World Cup in the matches leading into that tournament.”
Starc was not included in Australia’s T20I squad released on Tuesday for the upcoming series against New Zealand.
Selectors chairman George Bailey said the rangy, swing-bowling maestro would be hard to replace.
“His ability to impact early with the new ball and bowl clutch overs at the death (will be missed),” he told reporters on Tuesday.
“You don’t find many swinging it at 145km per hour. His fielding’s also outstanding.
“We won’t replace him like-for-like, but we’ve exposed others to key roles — Nathan Ellis, Ben Dwarshuis, Sean Abbott, and Xavier Bartlett.”
Starc played a pivotal role in Australia’s first and only T20 World Cup title in 2021, taking nine wickets in seven matches in the United Arab Emirates.
 
 

His retirement, 13 years on from his 2012 debut, is a big blow for Australia’s hopes of another T20 World Cup triumph next year and continues the winding-down of a golden generation of players.
Following opening batsman David Warner’s retirement last year, Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis have all retired from the one-day game.
Cricket Australia boss Todd Greenberg praised Starc for making “significant sacrifices” to play for his country.
“To allow the next crop of fast bowlers a clear path to the T20 World Cup early next year is another example of putting team first,” he said.</p><small>2025-09-02 04:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/02091411eb1a4ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939053/flour-prices-climb-as-supply-concerns-mount' target='_blank'><strong>Flour prices climb as supply concerns mount</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Wheat and flour prices have surged sharply in Karachi’s wholesale market, raising fresh concerns about food inflation and market supply, despite government assurances of sufficient national stocks.
Wholesale wheat now sells for Rs90 per kg, up from Rs72 in mid-August and Rs62 in July. This increase has pushed the price of flour no. 2.5 to Rs97 per kg and fine flour to Rs103, compared with Rs81 and Rs85, respectively. In early August, these prices were Rs74 and Rs79 per kg.
Chakki flour varieties are now available at wholesale rates between Rs110 and Rs135 per kg, marking an average rise of Rs20 per kg. According to the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) for the week ending Aug 28, the price of a 10kg wheat bag climbed to Rs794 from Rs640. Consequently, 20kg wheat flour bags now sell between Rs1,700 and Rs2,100, while one kg of fine flour is priced at Rs106 — up from Rs1,350–1,700 and Rs93, respectively, in early August.
With flour prices continuing to rise, a further burden on consumers is expected once roti and naan (bread) sellers adjust their prices to reflect higher input costs.

Despite govt claims of adequate stocks, wholesale wheat rate hits Rs90/kg in Karachi

This surge comes despite a statement last week by National Food Security and Research Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, who, while chairing the 8th Wheat Board meeting, claimed the country had 33.47 million tonnes of wheat against a requirement of 33.58m tonnes — a marginal shortfall of just 0.11m tonnes. He said the situation was under control and ruled out wheat imports, asserting that existing stocks were sufficient.
However, market stakeholders dispute the government’s assessment. Chairman of the Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA), Rauf Ibrahim, said the claimed availability figure includes 400,000-500,000 tonnes from last year’s leftover stock. He estimated the actual crop size at 29-30m tonnes this year, of which 3-4m tonnes have already been diverted for livestock feed.
He questioned the disconnect between rising prices and the government’s claim of ample stocks. He criticised the government’s decision to suspend wheat procurement by flour mills and remove the support price under the IMF programme, saying it had created a free-market environment that benefits hoarders, speculators, and flour millers — but not consumers.
Rauf warned that the discontinuation of wheat procurement had left flour millers without official quotas, which previously helped stabilise the market. He added that farmers who sold wheat at Rs2,200 per 40kg are now at a loss, while flour millers continue to store grain in private silos.
 
 

With the next wheat crop due in March/April 2026, he urged the government to act urgently to curb hoarding and safeguard consumers, warning that flour prices could exceed Rs200 per kg in the coming months if left unchecked.
A flour miller echoed concerns about the stock data, claiming the total crop size this year is closer to 28m tonnes. He also feared that flooding in Punjab may have damaged some of the carryover stock being counted in the government’s total availability figures.
Asad Ali of Topline Securities said the recent wheat price rebound could incentivise farmers in the upcoming Rabi season. After facing depressed returns in the previous crop cycle, the recovery in prices may boost sowing sentiment.
Agricultural growth slowed to 0.6pc in FY25 from 6.4pc in FY24, as adverse weather, water shortages, and rising input costs undermined farm profitability. Major crop output fell 13.5pc year-on-year, with wheat production declining by 9pc. According to FFC estimates, farmers lost Rs10,695 per acre this year, compared with profits of Rs13,572 per acre last season.
SBP estimates an 11pc decline in wheat production for FY25 due to weak profitability, which discouraged sowing. Asad noted that although current wheat prices remain 43pc below the previous peak of Rs1,256 per 10kg, the latest price spike offers some relief to struggling farmers.
He added that the current rebound may help restore confidence in wheat cultivation, provided the government ensures better market regulation and protection for farmers.

The project will be executed on a government-to-government basis by a joint venture comprising Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil company SOCAR, Pakistan State Oil (PSO), and the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO). Positioned as a strategic investment from Azerbaijan, the project had long been advocated by the FWO using local resources.
At a recent meeting, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet approved the terms and conditions proposed by the Petroleum Division to launch the project, citing its potential to enhance bilateral ties with Azerbaijan and attract future investment.
However, official documents reviewed by Dawn reveal that Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari cautioned against offering guaranteed dollar returns. He noted that lessons should have been learned from the experience with Independent Power Producers (IPPs). He urged a detailed assessment of costs and internal rate of return (IRR) before proceeding.

ECC clears $300m oil pipeline project with Azerbaijan amid ministries’ concerns

SOCAR had conditioned its investment on a “ship-or-pay” model — similar to the “take-or-pay” model used in IPP agreements — requiring full payment for the pipeline’s annual capacity of 7-8 million tonnes, regardless of actual throughput.
The Ministry of Finance also raised objections, warning that dollar-based returns should be linked strictly to foreign investment. It stressed that such returns should not apply if local financing is used. The ministry also recommended extending the payback period from four to seven years to mitigate the early-stage tariff impacts and called for more realistic assumptions regarding interest rates and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
Despite these concerns, the Petroleum Division argued that the proposed changes would render the project unattractive to investors. The ECC, siding with the Petroleum Division, overruled both ministries’ objections, terming the pipeline a strategic opportunity that could unlock further foreign investment.
The FWO had initially proposed a 14.6pc IRR and a 25pc equity IRR. The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) noted that the project’s final cost would depend on the adopted financing and operational model. The ECC partially addressed concerns by deciding that dollarised returns would apply only if foreign investment is involved.
Currently, about 70pc of petroleum products in Pakistan are transported by road, 28pc through an existing pipeline from Karachi to Machike, and only 2pc by rail. The new pipeline aims to shift a greater share of oil transport to pipeline infrastructure, reducing costs and inefficiencies.
 
 

As part of the approved framework, Ogra will allow transportation tariffs to be denominated in US dollars and will declare the pipeline as the default mode of oil transport.
Oil Marketing Companies will be required to commit to minimum annual pipeline volumes. Any shortfall will be adjusted through their existing Inland Freight Equalisation Margin (IFEM). If collective commitments fall below the threshold, the shortfall will be covered through the national IFEM mechanism.
The FWO has already submitted a revised tariff petition for the Machike–Thallian section, which Ogra has accepted. A separate petition for the Thallian–Tarujabba section is under review. Although Ogra has determined a provisional dollar-based tariff, the details remain confidential.

• Calls for building small dams, reservoirs, instead of mega projects
• Terms local govts essential for disaster management
• House to formally begin debate on floods today
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly’s new session on Monday began with an unusual display of unity as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed solidarity with flood victims, but this bonhomie proved short-lived as the opposition refused to attend a briefing by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
Addressing a news conference outside Parliament House soon after the adjournment of the sitting, PTI leaders, including Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Asad Qaiser, announced they had decided not to attend the briefing on the orders of incarcerated party leader Imran Khan.
Proceedings continued only for an hour or so before Speaker Ayaz Sadiq cut short the sitting, announcing that the NDMA had arranged a briefing for some 100 MNAs at 6pm and asking members to attend it.
Earlier, the house suspended the normal agenda of the day and decided to initiate a full-fledged debate on the ongoing flood catastrophe that had caused massive devastation in the country’s northern areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, besides inundating a vast area of Punjab due to release of water by neighbouring India.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry moved a motion to begin a formal debate on “the situation arising out of the recent devastating floods in the country”.
‘Man-made disaster’
The highlight of the brief NA sitting was the speech of Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, who termed the recent devastation caused by floods “a man-made disaster”.
The minister also called for local government elections in the country, besides stressing the need for building small dams and reservoirs to avert such tragedies in future.
“The catastrophe we are facing [today] cannot be called a natural disaster,” the minister declared.
“We have done value addition by constructing hotels and houses on waterways. We have encroached riverbeds,” he said, adding that this was the third or fourth such disaster in last 12 to 14 years.
Without naming anyone, he said when someone would be obliged to build a housing society on a riverbed, nature would react.
“In KP also, the people had encroached natural flow of rivers. What steps we have taken to remove encroachments on waterways after the country faced similar floods some three years back. He said they would face such tragedies again and again if they did not change their way.
Highlighting damages caused by floods in his home constituency, Mr Asif alleged a “contracting company” had destroyed his city of Sialkot.
“They are influential people and sitting in the Senate,” he said, pointing the finger at Zahir Khan and Bros (ZKB).
It was unfortunate that all big dams had been built by military dictators, while politicians had built hotels on riverbeds, he regretted.
He suggested building hundreds of small dams and reservoirs, instead of waiting for decades to build mega projects, warning that water would become an extremely scarce commodity in the future.
He was of the opinion that they needed to build small dams, which could be completed within a year or two.
“Do not do politics on it. We have political differences, but climate is a national, rather international issue, and it needs a national response,” he said.
LG system
“A comprehensive and robust local government system is needed to serve the masses in the cities, villages and tehsils,” said the minister amid desk-thumping by the members, regretting that presently there were no local body institutions in Punjab and other parts of the country.
The local bodies were essential for disaster management, he said, adding that power must be dispersed to towns, villages, tehsils and districts.
Earlier, Ali Muhammad Khan of the PTI said the federal government should come forward to help KP people. He called for a detailed parliamentary discussion on water issues and the need for building new dams.
“The whole house should think over it as to how we can build dams and reservoirs. There should be no politics on the issue of dams,” the PTI leader said.
He asked the federal government to complete work on Mohmand Dam project that had been started by the PTI’s government.
He said political parties had failed to build even a single big water reservoir.
 
 

PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan drew the attention of the house towards the flood devastations in his Buner constituency, stating that 240 people had died and another 120 were still missing.
He said the party had suspended its political activities in Punjab due to flood situation.
He praised the KP government and the armed forces for their role in the rescue efforts in the province.
He, however, termed the assistance so far provided by the federal government “insufficient”.
PPP’s Naveed Qamar urged collective national action against climate change and environmental mismanagement.
The PPP leader warned that floods could be 22pc more destructive next year, while in the long term, melting glaciers might dry up the Indus and other rivers, turning fertile lands into deserts and threatening centuries-old ecosystems.

• Putin urges shift from ‘Euro-centric’ security model
• Tianjin Declaration condemns terror attacks in Pakistan; reaffirms commitment to fight separatism and extremism
ISLAMABAD: Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday pressed his vision for a new global security and economic order that prioritises the “Global South”, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called on leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to initiate a structured process to resolve longstanding disputes in South Asia.
“Global governance has reached a new crossroads,” said President Xi, adding that member states “must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics, and practise true multilateralism” — a thinly veiled swipe at the US.
The summit brought together more than 20 world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Indian PM Narendra Modi, in the Chinese port city of Tianjin.
In an image designed to convey a mood of solidarity, Putin and Modi were shown holding hands as they walked jovially towards Xi before the summit opened. The three men stood shoulder-to-shoulder, laughing and surrounded by interpreters.
“It’s hard to tell if the scene was choreographed or improvised, but it doesn’t really matter,” wrote Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project, a research agency.
Putin, whose country has forged even closer economic and security ties with China amid the fallout from the Ukraine war, said the SCO had revived “genuine multilateralism”, with national currencies increasingly used in mutual settlements.
“This, in turn, lays the political and socio-economic groundwork for the formation of a new system of stability and security in Eurasia,” Putin said.
“This security system, unlike Euro-centric and Euro-Atlantic models, would genuinely consider the interests of a broad range of countries, be truly balanced, and would not allow one country to ensure its own security at the expense of others.”
Xi also called for the creation of a new SCO development bank, in what would be a major step towards the bloc’s long-held aspiration of developing an alternative payment system that circumvents the US dollar and the power of its sanctions.
Call for S. Asia dialogue
Addressing the 25th SCO Heads of States Council meeting, PM Shehbaz also made Pakistan’s case for normal and stable relations with its neighbours, advocating dialogue over confrontation.
“Pakistan has always believed in the power of multilateralism, dialogue and diplomacy, and shunning unilateralism,” he said, expressing disappointment over the region’s extremely disturbing development in the last few months.
 
 

Highlighting Pakistan’s support for multilateralism, the prime minister said the SCO remained a platform that best represents Pakistan’s abiding commitment to regional cooperation and integration.
On regional security, the prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s condemnation of terrorism in all its forms, including what he termed “state terrorism,” while recalling the country’s immense sacrifices in the fight against extremism.
“We have lost over 90,000 lives and endured economic losses exceeding $152 billion — a sacrifice unparalleled in history,” he said, adding that foreign elements were involved in recent terror incidents in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“We condemn terrorism in all its forms… Those who have long used terrorism for advancing their political interest must know that the world no longer buys this narrative. We had irrefutable evidence of the involvement of some foreign hands in the devastating Jaffar Express train hostage incident as well as countless other terrorist attacks against us in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the PM remarked.
The prime minister also strongly condemned Israel’s unjustified aggression against Iran, a fellow SCO member, and called for an immediate end to the bloodshed in Gaza. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the two-state solution with pre-1967 borders and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as the capital of Palestine.
He said Pakistan supports a peaceful and stable Afghanistan for the benefit of the entire region, expressing that hope that trilateral cooperation between Pakistan, China and Afghanistan would yield positive results. Addressing the challenge of climate-induced disasters, the prime minister spoke about the devastating floods currently affecting Pakistan due to torrential rains, which have caused massive human and economic losses. He thanked the international community, particularly China, for their solidarity and assistance.
Tianjin Declaration
The summit adopted the Tianjin Declaration, which notably stated: “Member states strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22, 2025. Member states also strongly condemned the terrorist attacks on Jaffar Express on March 11 and in Khuzdar on May 21, 2025.”
The SCO leaders expressed their “deepest sympathy and condolences” to the families of the dead and the wounded, saying that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice.
“The member states, while reaffirming their firm commitment to the fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, stress the inadmissibility of attempts to use terrorist, separatist and extremist groups for mercenary purposes.
They recognise the leading role of sovereign states and their competent authorities in countering terrorist and extremist threats,” the declaration said.
It added that the SCO members were committed to ensuring sustainable international peace and called for joint efforts to counter traditional and new security challenges and threats.
It said that they reaffirmed their determination to continue the joint fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, as well as against the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors, arms smuggling and other forms of transnational organised crime.

• Endorses boycott of by-polls and resignation from parliamentary committees; daily walkouts planned in NA and Senate to highlight ‘lack of democracy’ in country
ISLAMABAD: Claiming that the international community has not shown interest in supporting Pakistan after floods, the parliamentary committee of the PTI on Monday urged former prime minister Imran Khan to appeal to overseas Pakistanis to donate funds through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government to help flood-hit people in Punjab and KP.
The committee endorsed the decision of Imran Khan to boycott the by-elections and resign from parliamentary committees. It also decided to stage a daily boycott of the National Assembly to send a message to national and international community that the democracy does not exist in the country.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser, while talking to Dawn, said that during the meeting, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan briefed the committee on his meeting with party patron-in-chief Imran Khan, after which the committee endorsed the decision to boycott the by-elections and resign from parliamentary committees.
“However, as international community has hardly shown any interest in supporting the flood victims, the committee decided to urge Imran Khan to appeal to overseas Pakistanis to donate funds for their support,” he said.
Replying to a question, Mr Qaiser further said that the overseas Pakistanis would be asked to transfer funds either to KP government or charity organisations of Imran Khan. The funds would be used to support flood victims in both Punjab and KP, he said.
“We fear that the crops will be ba­­dly affected due to floods, and next year there will be enormous pressure on the rupee as government will have to import food items including wheat and rice,” he warned. He said that the committee had decided to boycott the parliamentary sessions on a daily basis.
 
 

To another question, the PTI leader explaining the decision said that members of parliament would attend the sessions of the Senate and National Assembly and then walk out in protest.
He added that the country lacked the democracy, which was leading to continuous problems and growing security issues.
Rain hits Gandapur meeting
Meanwhile, PTI had arranged a meeting of media persons with KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur at KP House in Islamabad but heavy rain disrupted the event.
Strong winds dislodged the canopy set up in the lawn, forcing organisers to cancel the meeting. Media persons were later informed that the session could not be held.

• Senators seek clarity on energy supply, debt before privatisation
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee was informed on Monday that Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited is expected to be privatised by November this year.
Briefing the Senate Standing Committee on Privatisation on the current status of the process, the Privatisation Commission secretary said that four companies were participating and would need to form consortiums with established airlines to operate PIA. Two applicants had already been disqualified for not meeting standards.
When Senator Zeeshan Khanzada raised concerns over PIA’s Rs650 billion debt, committee chairman Senator Dr Afnan Ullah Khan suggested that the airline’s two hotels could be sold to offset liabilities.
When Senator Khanzada questioned the government’s strategy of selling profitable companies in the first phase, the Privatisation Com­mis­sion secretary replied that investors are naturally more interested in profitable entities. Even if such companies were given away for free, he argued, it would still be the right decision as they may not remain profitable in the future.
The committee, chaired by Afnan Ullah Khan and attended by Senators Zeeshan Khanzada, Umer Farooq and Asad Qasim, also reviewed progress on other key privatisation initiatives, including power distribution companies (Discos), generation companies (Gencos), and Pakistan Minerals Development Corporation (PMDC).
 
 

The committee members stressed the need for clarity on energy supply agreements, debt restructuring and protection of profitable state assets before moving forward with privatisation.
Power Division officials informed the committee that Nandipur and Guddu power plants are on the privatisation list. “Eight important issues of Nandipur have been resolved, with only one pending related to the gas purchase and sale agreement,” they said, adding that the government was still deciding whether to provide a dedicated gas supply or continue with the current arrangement of supply on availability.
Regarding the Guddu power pla­nt, the officials said that four of nine outstanding issues had been resol­v­­ed, while disputes over land transfer re­­mained. The plant’s land is still re­­g­­istered under Wapda, though the latter has issued an NOC and the transfer process is underway.
Senator Afnan Ullah underlined the importance of resolving the energy supply issue for successful privatisation.

A statement from the police spokesperson said the action was taken after her complaint and video statement.
A case was registered in the capital’s Shalimar Police Station at her complaint under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 392 (punishment for robbery), 500 (punishment for defamation), 509 and 511 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The suspect had been stalking her for several days, the social media influencer said in the first information report.
She added that on Sunday at 6:30pm, an attempt was made to forcefully take her out of the house
“Today’s incident further escalated when he attempted to forcibly abduct me from my house while I was returning his gifts. This amounts to abduction, harassment, and assault under the law. For evidence, I have CCTV footage,” she was quoted as saying in the FIR.
Samiya thanked the Islamabad police in a subsequent video on her Instagram account and mentioned that the suspect had threatened her to take her complaint back.
Earlier in June, the Islamabad police said they had arrested the main suspect in the murder case of 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf, a day after she was shot dead in her house.</p><small>2025-09-01 19:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621453-kp-cm-gandapur-urges-unity-calls-for-kalabagh-like-project-for-national-interest' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM backs Kalabagh Dam-like national project, calls for unity</strong></a><br><p>
