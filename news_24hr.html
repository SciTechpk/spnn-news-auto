Beyond surface appearances, however, there is a distinct sense that old wine is being repackaged in new bottles.
The Jamaat-i-Islami and Bangladesh National Party (BNP) will be the two biggest parties in parliament. The latter’s leader, Tarique Rahman, son of military dictator Gen Ziaur Rahman, is set to become prime minister; his mother, the late Khaleda Zia was PM twice in the 1990s and early 2000s. The JI, meanwhile, has literally come back from the dead following the execution of its main leaders in the mid-2010s for their opposition to Bangladesh’s independence movement.
The only genuinely ‘new’ actor in Bangladesh’s latest chapter, the organic student leadership which spearheaded the movement to oust ex-PM Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League (AL) party, is represented to an extent by the recently formed National Citizen Party, which chose to ally with the JI in the lead-up to the poll.
Election day was notable for the fact that voters cast two separate ballots — one to elect members of parliament and the second as a referendum to introduce sweeping constitutional amendments. Bangladesh has held three referendums before this one — two were shambolic and designed to rubber-stamp military dictatorships. The present one has followed the banning of the AL under a dubious anti-terrorism law. It remains to be seen whether Bangladesh’s version of constitutional reform resembles the 26th and 27th amendment abominations in this country.

Most voters have been swayed by rhetoric around ‘corruption’.

Bangladesh is, like Pakistan, an extremely young country. At least half of its 120 million voters have never voted before. The student-led movement to depose the Hasina regime was a coming-of-age moment for many young people. The further exercise of their political agency through the vote is no small matter. Yet most of the voting public has been swayed by rhetoric around ‘corruption’, that age-old empty signifier. Neither the interim government nor the three main political parties that contested seemed interested in naming, let alone addressing, deeper structural challenges like the limits of the cheap labour-centric export-oriented capitalist growth model and the powers of military, civil and judicial bureaucracies.

 

On the other end of the subcontinent, the establishment and mainstream intelligentsia celebrated recent events in Bangladesh, gleefully watching the India-friendly AL’s demise and the resuscitation of right-wing forces that have a much greater ideological synergy with the usual suspects here. It should be noted, for instance, that the BNP and JI fielded very few women candidates. Pakistan’s own embattled progressive forces can hardly be thrilled about Bangladesh’s current direction. The re-emergence of the JI in particular inevitably throws up memories of 1971, an event that many here continue to see only through the prism of Indian designs; the aspirations of the Bengali masses remain absent from the narrative. Indeed, the fact that the mainstream here continues to reduce the situation in Balochistan to a rendering of the proverbial foreign hand shows that few lessons have been learned from 1971.
Separately, Pakistan’s exceedingly you­ng population also craves a break from the security-centric system. But youth aspirations for change have repeatedly been suffocated by manipulation of poll man-dates and/or outri­ght re-pression. We have learned that getting rid of inc­u­mbents and bringing in ‘new’ faces can reinforce the under­-lying struct­ure of power rather than displacing it.
Bangladesh’s you­th, who in August 2024 proved that revolutionary imaginaries can still motivate a collective politics of the people, will have their work cut out to hold the new elected government to account, both with regard to the economic needs of young working people and the preservation of democratic freedoms. Yet it is true that the current political clime in Bangla­desh feels more open and hopeful than the gloom engulfing young people here.
This despondency is not just due to state authoritarianism or the complicity of the PML-N and PPP. The differences between the two countries, and the organised power of young people in particular, are explained in part by the fact that student unions are alive and well in Bangladesh. This foundational democratic institution has been conspicuous by its absence in this country for 42 years now, the ban enforced by Gen Ziaul Haq’s dictatorial regime in February 1984 still being in force. We need such nurseries of democracy to seed organised political forces that can genuinely challenge power wielders and their lackeys.

Published in Dawn, February 13th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-13 04:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1309104982c0ead.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972897/un-extends-mandate-of-taliban-sanctions-monitoring-team-amid-regional-security-concerns' target='_blank'><strong>UN extends mandate of Taliban sanctions monitoring team amid regional security concerns</strong></a><br><p>The UN Security Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a resolution extending by one year the mandate of the Monitoring Team that supports the 1988 Afghanistan Sanctions Committee, which oversees sanctions imposed on the Taliban.
All 15 council members voted in favor of the US-drafted resolution, renewing the Monitoring Team’s mandate until February 17, 2027. The extension comes amid mounting international concern over Afghanistan’s deteriorating security situation, the growing influence of multiple terrorist groups, and the potential for regional destabilisation.
Pakistan, which supported the resolution, stressed the ongoing threat posed by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K), Majeed Brigade, and Al-Qaeda.
Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, said these groups “have been responsible for some of the most heinous terrorist attacks against Pakistan,” citing recent attacks that killed 80 people this month alone.
“Once again, Afghan soil was used by these groups to plan and orchestrate attacks against neighbouring countries,” he said, urging the Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan territory for terrorist operations.







“It is for the Taliban to decide what path they wish to choose for Afghanistan: whether the path to isolation or the path to peace and prosperity as a responsible member of the international community,“ he said.
The ambassador also highlighted the council’s concerns over the wider humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. “The resolution rightly emphasises the dire human rights conditions, particularly for women and girls, economic collapse, political exclusion, and the challenges posed by drug trafficking,” he said.
“Through this resolution, the council has sent a clear message that Afghan territory should not serve as a safe haven for terrorists and that all member states must prevent ransom payments or political concessions benefiting hostage-takers or terrorist groups.”
The UN Monitoring Team’s 37th report, released this week, paints a grim picture of Afghanistan as a base for multiple terrorist organisations. It noted that the de facto Afghan authorities continue to provide a “permissive environment” for groups, particularly TTP.
The report cited rising regional anxiety over cross-border attacks, the radicalisation of vulnerable communities, and the exploitation of commercial satellite communications and artificial intelligence by militant groups.
While Afghan authorities insist no terrorist groups are present in the country, the Monitoring Team stated that “no UN member state supported that assessment.”
Although the authorities have taken action against ISIL-K and control some external activities of other groups, TTP has enjoyed greater freedom, resulting in an escalation of attacks against Pakistan and heightened regional tensions.
On Al-Qaeda, the report said the group’s intent and capability for external operations remain unchanged. It continues to serve as a training and advisory hub, particularly for TTP, and “favors spectacular attacks aimed at attracting global media attention,” highlighting the continued threat beyond the immediate region.
Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), not listed under UN sanctions, remains active in southeastern Afghanistan, especially in areas influenced by the Haqqani Network. The report indicated AQIS leaders Osama Mahmoud and deputy Yahya Ghauri are believed to be in Kabul, with the group’s media cell operating from Herat.
Member states warned that AQIS increasingly focuses on deniable external operations, possibly under cover groups such as Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan, likely to avoid causing difficulties for the Taliban.
TTP, one of the largest terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan, has intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces and state institutions. A November 11 attack on an Islamabad courthouse killed 12 people, marking the first such strike in the capital in several years. Despite operational setbacks, including the killing of deputy emir Mufti Muzahim in October, the group remains a serious threat.
The Monitoring Team warned that TTP could deepen cooperation with Al-Qaeda-aligned groups, potentially expanding the threat beyond the region.
ISIL-K, though under pressure from Taliban actions and regional security operations, retains significant combat capability, particularly in northern Afghanistan near Badakhshan and along the Pakistani border. The group continues to replenish its ranks through online recruitment and seeks alliances with other armed factions.
Other groups of concern include the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM/TIP), which reportedly enjoys Afghan patronage, including identity documents, and raises funds through poppy cultivation and mining. Approximately 250 ETIM/TIP members joined Taliban police forces in 2025, and some have called for fighters in Syria and neighboring countries to relocate to Afghanistan in preparation for operations in China’s Xinjiang region.
The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which is not listed under UN sanctions, has carried out attacks against Pakistani security forces and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects, including a September 16 ambush that killed 32 soldiers. While Pakistani counter-terrorism operations have constrained the group’s activities, it remains operational, with some member states reporting coordination between BLA, TTP, and ISIL-K through shared training and resources.
The Monitoring Team’s findings are expected to shape further deliberations at the Security Council on Afghanistan’s security trajectory and the effectiveness of the existing sanctions regime.
Pakistan and other member states have emphasised that the resolution underscores the need for the Taliban to take “sustained and verifiable” action against terrorist groups, prevent Afghan territory from being used for external attacks, and uphold commitments to international peace and security.</p><small>2026-02-13 04:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/698e88798af5c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972867/police-reforms-missed-opportunity' target='_blank'><strong>Police reforms: missed opportunity</strong></a><br><p>IN May 2010, when public confidence in the criminal justice system (CJS) was visibly eroding, nine retired and seven serving inspectors general of police, under the aegis of the Law and Justice Commission, came together to confront the question of why policing consistently failed to deliver justice. Months of intensive deliberation by the Police Reforms Committee resulted in the comprehensive report titled Police Reforms: Way Forward — a professional blueprint drafted by the highest ranks of the police service, with the active engagement of senior members of the judiciary. Yet it was ignored.
The central diagnosis of the report was stark but accurate. Flawed investigations are the primary cause of high acquittal rates in Pakistan, owing to poor evidence collection, weak forensic support, inadequate case preparation and interference in investigations. The result is not merely acquittal of the accused; it is systemic discrediting of the entire CJS. The police blame the prosecution, the prosecution questions the investigation, the judiciary is accused of being lenient, and citizens lose faith in all three. The committee identified three structural weaknesses: politicisation of police command and transfers, weak accountability mechanisms and chronically deficient investigations due to lack of specialisation and resources. These observations were grounded in decades of operational experience and supported by professional analysis.
At the heart of the report was the drafting of a ‘Model Police Law’ to meet the demands of 21st-century policing, which sought to ensure that the police would be politically neutral, democratical­ly controlled, administratively and operationally au­­tonomous, effectively accountable and professionally specialised. It was an attempt to balance au­­t­o­nomy with structured oversight through public sa­­fety commissions and independent police complaints authorities. The report concluded that ind­e­­­pendence without accountability breeds imp­u­ni­­ty and accountability without independence bre­eds subservience. Sustainable reform requires both.

 

The report examined the institutional evolution of policing — from the Police Act of 1861 to the Police Order 2002. It concluded that policing is interwoven with criminal law, criminal procedure and evidence. Fragmentation of police laws across provinces, without regard to constitutional jurisprudence and federal primacy in criminal matters, weakens uniform enforcement of fundamental rights. The Supreme Court, therefore, settled this by recognising the concurrent jurisdiction of the provinces and the federation over policing, in addition to criminal laws. In any case, equal protection under the Constitution cannot coexist with wildly divergent standards of police organisation and accountability.

The blueprint exists. But what is missing is political maturity and sustained commitment.

The committee proposed the separation of investigation from public order. A distinct investigation wing, headed by an additional inspector general, would oversee crime, legal matters, fore­n­sic integration and data management. Special investigation units were recommended for crimes such as terrorism, kidnapping for ransom and human smuggling. Forensic laboratories were to be made operationally autonomous. Scientific and digital evidence was to be given primacy. Without structural separation, investigation officers remain overburdened with law-and-order assignments, VIP security and other duties.. The report recognised that improving conviction rates requires institutional redesign.
The section dealing with terrorism noted the abysmally low success rate in the prosecution of terrorism offences and the inconsistent conviction statistics claimed by different provinces. It observed the misuse of anti-terror laws for ordinary crimes. Recommendations included specialised training for investigators and prosecutors, clearer statutory definitions, improved evidentiary standards and stronger coordination among agencies. Another component of the report, urban policing, recognised the need for differentiated policing in densely populated centres. The committee proposed urban police divisions that would serve populations of up to half a million, each with functional wings for operations, investigation, traffic, security, internal accountability, community relations and IT. The burdened court system was also addressed, and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms under legal safeguards were suggested to resolve minor conflicts swiftly and affordably. Accountability mechanisms were treated with equal seriousness. The report acknowledged public grievances such as failure to register cases, harassment, abuse of power, defective investigations and other abuses, and proposed strengthening internal accountability branches while also operationalising independent external complaints authorities.

 

So why was such an in-depth report sidelined? The answer lies less in constitutional debate and more in political economy. Professional reform reduces discretionary political control over postings, transfers, investigations, and law-and-order deployment. In a system where influence over police machinery is a tool of patronage, autonomy is perceived as loss of control. Political parties routinely promise police reforms in their manifestos. Yet when presented with a professionally drafted framework requiring no external consultants and minimal structural experimentation, successive governments chose inaction. This was not a failure of capacity but of will, compounded by vested interests and short-term political calculations.
A malfunctioning CJS undermines economic growth. Investors want jurisdictions where property rights are protected and contracts are enforceable; businesses need predictable law enforcement and credible dispute resolution. Tourism, infrastructure development and foreign investment all depend on internal stability. Modern economies have not flourished in an environment where the CJS collapses owing to weak investigations and politicised policing. The report stresses that the police must serve the Constitution and the public, and not individuals or factions. Security of tenure for key appointments, transparent oversight mechanisms, functional specialisation and financial autonomy were not privileges for officers but safeguards for citizens. An accountable and independent police service is the backbone of enforceable fundamental rights and a country free of terrorism and organised crime.
So the blueprint exists and the jurisprudence supports reform. But what is missing is political maturity and sustained commitment. The problems identified in 2010 remain largely unresolved. Fragmented legal frameworks persist while investigations are still structurally weak. Accountability mechanisms are unevenly implemented. Public trust continues to fluctuate. Policymakers can either continue treating policing as an instrument of short-term political convenience or recognise it as a professional institution essential to the rule of law, economic progress and national security. The responsibility now rests with those who govern to decide whether reform will remain a slogan or become a reality.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday urged the United States and Iran to move towards direct negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear programme.
“Whilst we stand ready to participate in any format of dialogue and diplomacy on Iran, we encourage the relevant parties to have as direct a negotiation framework as possible,” Foreign Office spokesman Tahir Andrabi said at the weekly media briefing.
The indirect Iran-US talks took place in Muscat on Feb 6 amid heightened regional tensions, including an expanded US military presence and warnings from President Donald Trump of severe consequences if no deal is reached.
The session was mediated by Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who shuttled between the two sides. Both sides described the discussions as a “good start”.
A follow-up visit by Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, took place in Muscat around Feb 9-10 to discuss next steps.
No date or venue has been for­mally announced for the next rou­nd of talks, though both sides have signalled their intention to continue discussions pending consultations in their respective capitals.
On Thursday, Mr Andrabi said Islamabad hoped the momentum generated in Muscat would continue. “We hope the positivity (in Oman talks) would be carried forward by the parties in the conduct of these talks,” he noted.
Diplomatic efforts
“Pakistan welcomes the talks in Oman between relevant parties. We support all initiatives of dialogue and diplomacy to settle
outstanding issues, including this question of nuclear talks,” Mr Andrabi said. He called the development “a positive progression towards a negotiated solution”. During the briefing, Mr Andrabi was asked specifically about Pakistan’s role in the Muscat process, but he did not directly address whether Islamabad had facilitated contacts or participated behind the scenes. However, he reiterated that Pakistan supports dialogue and would be ready to participate “in any format”, if requested.
Before Oman, talks between the US and Iran were originally slated to be held in Istanbul, where a host of regional players were also expected to take part. When Tehran asked for a change of venue and sought to limit the agenda of the talks, it also limited the scope for engagement by regional players, such as Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
Diplomatic sources said that a top Pakistani official had visited Oman, and met with US envoy Steve Witkoff on the sidelines of the dialogue process, but there was no official confirmation in this regard.
Since June last year, Pakistan has acknowledged acting as a messenger between Tehran and Washington, something which was also confirmed by the Foreign Office.
Immediately after the Muscat talks, Iran’s ambassador in Islamabad had called on Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to brief him on Tehran’s position. Days later, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Mr Dar spoke by phone.
According to Iranian accounts of the call, Mr Araghchi explained Tehran’s positions regarding what it described as a fair and just agreement and elaborated on the process of indirect negotiations in Muscat. Mr Dar wished success for the negotiations and emphasised Pakistan’s readiness to support diplomacy.
The spokesman also pointed to recent high-level contacts between Islamabad and Tehran. “Our deputy prime minister and foreign minister spoke twice with his Iranian counterpart. We are maintaining close contact at the leadership level,” he said, adding that the prime minister had a conversation with the Iranian president in the recent past. “Our support for dialogue and diplomacy continues,” he added.
‘Board of Peace’ meeting
Mr Andrabi also confirmed that PM Shehbaz Sharif will attend the inaugural meeting of President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ next week, saying Pakistan would use the platform to push for a just and lasting solution to the Palestine issue.
The leaders-level meeting of the Board of Peace is scheduled for Feb 19 in Washington. It will mark the first formal gathering of the multinational body since its charter was signed during a ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan 22.
“I can confirm that the prime minister will attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting. He will be accompanied by the deputy prime minister,” Mr Andrabi told the weekly media briefing.
“As regards the other members of the delegation and on engagements of the delegation in the US, we will inform you in due course of time,” he said when asked to comment on reports that Field Marshal Munir would also join the prime minister at the session.
US officials and media reports suggest the Feb 19 summit will focus on fundraising for Gaza’s reconstruction, implementation of ceasefire phases including transitional governance and security arrangements, and clarification of the board’s broader mandate and structure.
“We have joined the Board of Peace in good faith. We are in it, not in isolation, not as one voice, but as a collective voice of eight Islamic-Arab countries,” Mr Andrabi said, referring to two statements that were issued by these countries, not just on Gaza, but also on the West Bank.
“Our collective voice is resonating in the Board of Peace, and we will continue to strive for the rights, peace and prosperity of the people of Palestine, aimed at the long-term solution of the Palestine issue — to create a state of Palestine, in accordance with the pre-1967 border with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.”
“So, our engagement is for short-, medium- and long-term solution of the plight of the Palestinian people,” he maintained.

As per the meeting’s reported agenda, it will examine the Gaza situation while also discussing the BoP’s mandate and structure.
However, unless concrete proposals to stop the continuing Israeli violence in the occupied territories and hold the Zionist state to account for the atrocities it has committed in Gaza emerge, the meeting may prove to be nothing more than a photo op. The situation in the West Bank is critical, while new evidence has emerged of barbaric methods used by Israel in the Strip during its bloodthirsty campaign. Tel Aviv must be made to answer for these crimes if the BoP is to be taken seriously.
Regarding the West Bank, the Israeli cabinet has recently passed new regulations that allow settlers to buy land in the occupied territory — a clear violation of international law. As the UN rights chief has put it, these moves will lead to “rendering a viable Palestinian state impossible”. But that is what Tel Aviv appears determined to do.
Meanwhile, several Muslim states, including Pakistan, have also slammed “continued Israeli expansionist policies” in the West Bank. Separately, an Al Jazeera investigation has revealed that Israel used monstrous weapons in Gaza that may have left no trace of their victims. The internationally banned thermal and thermobaric weapons, many supplied by the US, were used to ‘evaporate’ nearly 3,000 Palestinians. These weapons generate unbearable temperatures, and usually no traces are found of the victims.
It is shocking that the Israelis — whose forefathers perished in Nazi gas chambers and ovens — are now using similarly horrific methods on innocent Palestinians. But perhaps such revelations should not shock, as the Zionists have a long history of committing war crimes.

 

In light of these facts, the Muslim bloc at the upcoming BoP meeting must take a firm stand. The illegal land grab in the West Bank must cease immediately. Moreover, Israel must be held accountable for using illegal weapons on Palestinian non-combatants. It should also be noted that nearly 600 Palestinians have been murdered by Israel in Gaza since last October’s ceasefire. All these issues must be discussed at the BoP.
Instead of conjuring up strange fantasies of a ‘Gaza Riviera’, the board must focus on the immediate cessation of violence against the Palestinian people, commit to a clear roadmap for a viable Palestinian state, and hold Israel to account for its diabolical behaviour. But with Israel itself part of the BoP — and Mr Trump beholden to his powerful Zionist backers — it is difficult to see this happening. Unless firm steps are taken to confront these issues, the BoP will remain a pointless entity.

ISLAMABAD: The PTI raised alarm over the treatment meted out to former prime minister Imran Khan in jail in light of a health report submitted to the Supreme Court, with its leaders calling out the “medical neglect” that worsened the situation.
On the other hand, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar used the report to point out that the PTI chief had been enjoying all facilities in jail, as evident from his diet plan outlined in the document submitted to the apex court.
PTI lawyer Salman Safdar had submitted the report, which claimed that Mr Khan had lost 85 per cent of the vision in his right eye, after meeting Mr Khan in jail on the directions of the SC.
Amid these reports about their leader’s health, PTI leaders, including Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, held a press conference at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, terming the situation alarming.
The CM said Imran Khan had informed au­­thorities a number of times about the problem with his vision, but no one bothered ab­­out it. “When his eyesight was lost, he was ta­­ken to the hospital. It was nothing but a criminal act because, had they allowed the meeting with the family and lawyers, the hea­lth issue would have been highlighted,” he said.
The CM said Mr Khan had never demanded relief on the basis of health, but “now we are saying this because there is a possibility of irreversible loss”.
He said that when the health of Nawaz Sharif was discussed during his imprisonment, the judiciary and media had raised their voices for him.
“At that time, Imran Khan had allowed him [Nawaz Sharif] to go for treatment. At this time, we are unable to hear similar voices from the judiciary and the media. One media outlet had raised the health issue (of Mr Khan), due to which a federal minister had to confirm it,” he said.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said that he had never seen such a thing in the history of Pakistan.
“…When eyesight was lost, the administrator of the jail was changed, and the new administrator also took 10 days to send him [Imran Khan] to the hospital.” He demanded that Mr Khan be allowed to be examined by his personal physician, saying that they did not trust the government with his treatment.
PTI leader Junaid Akbar Khan warned that while the party leadership had asked its supporters to exercise restraint, it could not control them indefinitely. “The day our workers come out without our call, you will not be able to run,” he warned, cautioning that frustration among PTI’s youth base was fast approaching a tipping point.
Mr Akbar said Imran Khan had never publicly complained about his health, but the party now considered his medical condition a matter of utmost urgency.
Moreover, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram demanded that cases be registered against the officers concerned, including the former Adiala superintendent and senior prison officials, for medical neglect so that they could be held accountable. “Negligence in Imran Khan’s treatment is unacceptable. Public anger is rising and the situation could soon get out of control,” he said in a statement.
‘Direct consequence’
Meanwhile, Imran’s son Kasim Khan, in a post on X, termed the development “a direct consequence of solitary confinement and medical neglect”.
“We have been informed that my father, Imran Khan, has lost most of the vision in his right eye, with reports indicating that only 15pc eyesight remains,” he said.







“This is the direct consequence of 922 days of solitary confinement, medical neg­lect (denied blood tests), and the deliberate denial of proper treatment in jail,” he stressed, maintaining that the “responsibility lies squarely with the regime in power, the army chief and the puppets enabling this cruelty”. He said that Imran’s “physical deterioration is happening under their orders, their watch and their responsibility”.
“They have manipulated and warped the justice system in order to keep my father in solitary confinement,” he added.
He claimed that he and his brother Sulaiman were “still being denied a visa to see our father as his health deteriorates”.
Separately, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, along with opposition leaders, said that the report presented before the Supreme Court was deeply alarming. He demanded that meetings be allowed with the family, party leaders and doctors and that medical treatment be ensured.
‘Fallen flat’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaul­lah Tarar said the narrative being “propagated” by the incarcerated ex-premier’s family had “fallen flat on its face” in light of the report.
In a post on X, he said: “The narrative which was being propagated to international media by Aleema Khan and other members of Imran Khan’s family regarding mistreatment and shabby conditions in prison has fallen flat on its face. “The report regarding daily routine and diet plan has cleared all ambiguity. All facilities are available to him and he has privileges more than any other prisoner,” he added.

In an income tax reference, titled Commissioner Inland Revenue versus Sajid Hussain Gondal and others, Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf and Justice Jawad Hassan laid down guidance on the scope and limits of amendment powers under Section 122, bringing long-awaited doctrinal clarity to a provision frequently invoked by tax authorities.
The reference application, filed under Section 133 of the ordinance, challenged an order of the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR), which had set aside an amendment made to a taxpayer’s deemed assessment for tax year 2019. The tribunal had earlier ruled that the FBR’s use of Section 122(5A) in the case was unlawful.

 

The taxpayer, Sajid Hussain Gondal, had filed an income tax return for 2019, which became a deemed assessment under Section 120 of the ordinance. Subsequently, the Additional Commissioner of Inland Revenue issued a show-cause notice under Sections 122(9), 111(1), and 122(5A), alleging discrepancies in declared gross revenue, purchases under Section 236A, deductions under Section 153, profit and loss expenses, and capital declarations.
The tax department claimed that these discrepancies rendered the deemed assessment erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of revenue, justifying an amendment under Section 122(5A). Despite the taxpayer’s explanation, the assessment was amended in June 2022, an action later upheld by the Commissioner (Appeals) but ultimately struck down by the ATIR in November 2023.
In a detailed ruling, the LHC reaffirmed that a deemed assessment under Section 120 cannot be unsettled lightly and drew a clear legal boundary between Section 122(5) and Section 122(5A).
It said Section 122(5) applies where an amendment is based on audit findings or definite information indicating escaped income, under-assessment, misclassification or excessive relief. By contrast, Section 122(5A) is revisional in nature and can be invoked only when the assessment order is both erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of revenue.
The bench stressed that both conditions must coexist, and that mere suspicion, arithmetic mismatch or perceived revenue loss does not meet the statutory threshold.
Justice Rauf observed that Section 122(5A) does not grant open-ended authority to revisit assessments. Rather, it is meant to correct glaring and apparent errors committed by the assessing officer where such errors are demonstrably harmful to revenue.
“The revisional jurisdiction under Section 122(5A) is not a licence for roving or fishing inquiries,” the high court held, adding that the alleged error must be evident from the record, and the claimed prejudice must be legally demonstrable, not conjectural.

The parliamentary election held on Thursday was Bangladesh’s first vote since the 2024 Gen Z-driven uprising that toppled long-time premier Sheikh Hasina. A clear outcome had been seen as crucial for stability in the Muslim-majority country of 175 million after months of deadly anti-Hasina unrest disrupted everyday life and hit major industries, including the apparel sector in the world’s second-largest garment exporter.
It was also the first national election to follow recent revolts led by the under-30s that have cropped up through the wider region. Nepal is set to hold a vote next month.
BNP sails to victory
Opinion polls had given BNP an edge and the party lived up to the forecasts, with the coalition it dominates winning 209 seats to secure an overwhelming two-thirds majority in the 300-member Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation, Jamuna TV showed.
Soon after it won a majority in the overnight vote-count, the party thanked and congratulated the people and called for special prayers on Friday for the welfare of the country and its people.
“Despite winning the national parliamentary election by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised by BNP,” the party said in a statement and urged people to pray at mosques, temples, churches and pagodas across the country. The BNP is led by top prime ministerial contender Tarique Rahman, the 60-year-old son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and former President Ziaur Rahman.
Its campaign promises included financial aid for poor families, a 10-year limit for an individual to remain prime minister, boosting the economy by measures including foreign investments, and anti-corruption policies.
Jamaat promises positive opposition
Shafiqur Rahman, the head of BNP’s main rival, the Islamist Jamaat-i-Islami, conceded defeat, with his party-led alliance on just 68 seats. Rahman said Jamaat would not engage in the “politics of opposition” for the sake of it. “We will do positive politics,” he told reporters.
The National Citizen Party (NCP), led by youth activists who were instrumental in toppling Hasina and was a part of the Jamaat-led alliance, won just five of 30 seats it contested.
Despite the landslide result, the election had been seen as Bangladesh’s first truly competitive vote in years. Hasina’s Awami League party, which ruled the country for more than 15 years until her ousting, was barred from contesting.
Turnout appeared on track on Thursday to exceed the 42pc recorded in the last election in 2024. Local media reported that more than 60pc of registered voters were expected to have cast ballots.
More than 2,000 candidates — including many independents — were on the ballot, and at least 50 parties contested seats, a national record. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.
Alongside the election, a referendum was held on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and introducing a two-term limit for the prime minister.
There was no official word on the outcome of the referendum. Leading local newspaper the Daily Star reported that 73pc of the nearly 296,000 votes cast in the referendum said ‘Yes’ and the rest said ‘No’.
Hasina calls vote a farce
Hasina is in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, which has frayed ties between Dhaka and New Delhi and opened the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh.
In a statement sent after polling stations closed, Hasina denounced the election as a “carefully planned farce”, held without her party and without real voter participation. She said Awami League supporters had rejected the process.
“We demand the cancellation of this voterless, illegal and unconstitutional election … the removal of the suspension imposed on the activities of the Awami League, and the restoration of the people’s voting rights through the arrangement of a free, fair, and inclusive election under a neutral caretaker government,” she said.
Opponents of Hasina say that elections under her rule were frequently marred by boycotts and intimidation.</p><small>2026-02-13 02:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/130825437f4f84e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972848/president-pm-take-stock-of-political-security-situation' target='_blank'><strong>President, PM take stock of political, security situation</strong></a><br><p>• Insider says govt wants joint session of parliament for legislation, debate on terrorism• Law officers to get special allowance after president signs off on amendment
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a meeting at the Presidency on Thursday to take stock of the political and security situation amid purported plans for convening a joint session of parliament in which some important pieces of legislation are expected to be tabled, besides discussions on rising incidents of terrorism.
A source told Dawn that the premier met the president because the government wanted to call a joint session of parliament. However, it was not clear what would be on the agenda of this sitting.
During the session, a debate on terrorism is also expected. It is likely that some top military officials could brief the house on terrorism, and the session might turn into an in-camera sitting.
The source also said the president and his team conveyed their displeasure to the prime minister over new net-metering regulations introduced by the Natio­nal Electric Power Regulatory Authority.
The PM was accompanied by a group of federal ministers, while the president was accompanied by legislators and senior party leaders.
According to a statement by the Presidency, the two sides reviewed the political, economic and security situation as well as the prevailing regional and global environment.
The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Minister for Economic Affairs Division Senator Ahad Cheema, PM’s adviser Touqeer Shah, PM’s aide on political affairs Rana Sanaullah, Senator Sherry Rehman and Raja Pervez Ashraf.
Allowance for attorneys
Meanwhile, President Zardari appro­ved an amendment introducing a special allowance for long-serving additional attorneys general. The president signed the summary on the advice of the PM, approving an amendment to the terms and conditions of service of additional, deputy and assistant attorneys general.
The amendment introduces a special allowance for additional attorneys general who have served for more than 10 years in the capacity of assistant attorney general.
The measure is intended to recognise sustained service within the law officers’ cadre and to provide structured financial consideration for those who have completed over a decade in the role of assistant attorney general before elevation. The amendment will take effect in accordance with the approved summary.
In a separate meeting with a four-member delegation of Turkiye’s Agricultural Technologies Cluster (TUME), led by its Board Chairman Abdulkadir Karagoz, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan desired to strengthen its relations with Turkiye and enhance bilateral economic partnership, particularly in the agriculture and livestock sectors.

Jim Ratcliffe

LONDON: Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe apologised on Thursday for his “choice of language” after saying the “UK has been colonised by immigrants”.
The billionaire businessman, founder and chairman of the Ineos chemicals company, made the remarks in a television interview in which he suggested “huge levels of immigration” to the UK had harmed the economy.
But following calls for Ratcliffe to apologise, including from Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the 73-year-old said: “I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern, but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.
“My comments were made while answering questions about UK policy at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, where I was discussing the importance of economic growth, jobs, skills and manufacturing in the UK.”

UK PM Starmer had called for an apology after tycoon claimed ‘UK being colonised by immigrants’

Monaco-based Ratcliffe added: “My intention was to stress that governments must manage migration alongside investment in skills, industry and jobs so that long-term prosperity is shared by everyone.
“It is critical that we maintain an open debate on the challenges facing the UK.”



‘Inflammatory and divisive’
A spokesman for Starmer reacted by saying: “The Prime Minister asked for an apology, and one’s been issued, and it’s absolutely right that Jim Ratcliffe has apologised for that language.”
He added: “There should be a serious debate about immigration, but the Prime Minister believes in a Britain built for all.” Nevertheless, finance minister Rachel Reeves insisted the government would still support Ratcliffe’s businesses in Britain, including the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland.
“What Jim Ratcliffe said was unacceptable. It was disgusting, frankly, and he should apologise for his remarks, but I’m not going to let what Jim Ratcliffe has said determine the future of jobs in Scotland,” said Reeves.
Ratcliffe told Sky News on Wednesday: “You can’t have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. I mean, the UK is being colonised. It’s costing too much money.The UK has been colonised by immigrants.”
Ratcliffe’s comments could lead to a possible disciplinary charge of “bringing the game into disrepute” by England’s governing Football Association.
During his Sky interview, Ratcliffe, who said his “unpopular” decisions at Old Trafford were now bearing fruit following United’s recent on-field resurgence, cited erroneous statistics that the UK population was 58 million in 2020 and that “now it’s 70m”.
Population estimates by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the country’s population was in fact 67m in mid-2020 and just under 70 million in mid-2024.
Hours later, Starmer urged Ratcliffe to apologise for the “offensive and wrong” comments, with Kick it Out, a UK-based body seeking to counter racism in football, reacting strongly to the “disgraceful and deeply divise” remarks on Thursday.
“In addition to the inaccurate figures mentioned, it’s worth reminding him that Manchester United has a diverse fan base and plays in a city whose cultural history has been enriched by immigrants,” Kick It Out said in a statement.
“This type of language and leadership has no place in English football, and we believe most fans will feel the same.”
Several United supporters’ groups did criticise the comments while the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said that while calling for immigration curbs was “one thing”, portraying those who arrived in Britain “as a hostile invading force is quite another”.

The minister acknowledged that the high electricity tariffs had been pushing the consumers away from the grid and solar penetration had created a serious challenge to the grid. Therefore, the government was considering restructuring of the power sector debt, besides taking measures for curtailing peak demand.
Over the past few months, the government has taken up the restructuring of power sector debt with multilateral lenders, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, including a $30bn Chinese debt for longer duration. A circular debt of Rs1.6 trillion and a Rs1.225tr recent financing with local commercial banks are also on the agenda.
Pakistan’s repeated direct requests to Chinese institutions for extension in debt repayment period have remained fruitless for well over five years. The authorities have therefore been looking at refinancing of even the Chinese debt and domestic commercial debts with the banking sector to longer terms — 15-20 year concessional multilateral debt.

Power minister says rapid switchover to solar power has created ‘serious challenge’ for national grid

They estimated such a large-scale refinancing of power sector debt could bring down overall tariffs, particularly for industry, to 8-9 cents per unit from 11.5 cents per unit at present.
Mr Leghari said clean energy contribution to the national generation basket had reached 55pc in FY2025 and was estimated to cross 90pc by 2035. He said solar penetration had created a challenge for the national grid where daytime demand dipped to around 8,000MW, but went beyond 26,000MW during peak hours as the government policy encouraged households to invest their incomes and belongings in rooftop solar systems.
In such a situation, power plants are required to be kept on standby to meet peak demand. He said this “people-led solar revolution” had earned global accolades for Pakistan in leading a clean energy transition. He, however, noted that unfair pricing transfer was converting solarisation into a burden for other consumers and this “needs to be rationalised”.
The power minister said electricity prices had come down by 20pc over the last 18-20 months and despite imposition of fixed charges on households, residential tariff was still 35-40pc subsidised. In addition, the industrial power tariff had been cut by 35pc and brought down to around 11.5 cents per unit, which required to be brought down further to be internationally competitive.
The managing director of the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority said the government had given a target for launching the fan replacement scheme within 90 days and his agency had been able to complete all preparation for formal operationalisation in 81 days.
The project involves the State Bank and commercial banks through a tripartite agreement for the launch of the Prime Minister’s Fan Replacement Programme with a government rolling guarantee of Rs2bn to insure first installment default.
Minister for Climate Change Musadik Malik said the scheme would help reduce carbon footprint, reduce energy costs to consumers and reduce peak summer demand and contribute to climate resilience. He said replacement of an old fan with new efficient plant could help reduce energy bill by Rs12,000 per year.

Delegations from at least 20 countries, including many heads of state, are expected to attend the meeting in Washington, DC, which Trump will chair on February 19, the officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Trump signed documents in Davos, Switzerland, on January 23 establishing the Board of Peace. The board’s creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Trump’s Gaza plan.

 

While regional Middle East powers, including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as major emerging nations such as Pakistan and Indonesia, have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western US allies have been more cautious.

Feb 19 huddle will seek monetary contributions for Gaza reconstruction

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday, during his visit to Washington, that Israel has joined the board.
Trump has stirred concerns that the Board of Peace might try to resolve other conflicts around the world and compete with the United Nations. The US officials said the meeting next week will focus solely on Gaza.
They said a central part of the meeting will be Trump’s announcement of a multi-billion-dollar fund for Gaza, which will include monetary contributions from participating board members.
One official called the offers “generous” and said that the United States had not made any explicit requests for donations. “People have come to us offering,” the official said. “The president will make announcements vis a vis the money raised.”
Stabilisation force
The deployment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) is a key part of the next phase of Trump’s Gaza plan, announced in September. Under the first phase, a fragile ceasefire in the two-year-old war began on October 10. According to the terms of the ceasefire, Hamas has handed over all prisoners and bodies, while Israel has also freed detained Palestinians.
At the board meeting, Trump is likely to announce that several countries plan to provide several thousand troops to the stabilisation force that is expected to deploy in Gaza in the months ahead, the officials said.
A primary concern for now is disarming Hamas, which has opposed plans to disarm until the Israeli occupation ends.
Under Trump’s plan, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries, under the plan.
The Board of Peace meetings will also include detailed reports on the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, which was established to take over the day-to-day civil administration of Gaza Strip from Hamas. The committee announced its members and held its first meeting in January.
Other updates will cover humanitarian aid for Gaza as well as the Gaza police, the officials said.

The development came hours after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting a strong response from the PTI.
The information was shared in a report submitted to the SC by PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar, who quoted the PTI founder as telling him that “he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Videos shared by the TTAP on the social media platform X on Thursday night showed Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas speaking to the media alongside the PTI leadership.
“After Friday prayers, we will stage a sit-in outside Parliament,” he said.







“We demand that Khan sahib be given full access to doctors whom he trusts,” he said.
“I am told that Imran’s personal physician, Dr Asim Yusuf, is at Shifa Hospital, as are Dr Amir Awan and Dr Mazhar Ishaq; these are the two top specialists in Rawalpindi,” Abbas said.
“We can trust them, so we demand that he (Imran) be shifted immediately and provided the right treatment,” he added.
“He (Imran) was in the custody of the government, and his medical care and access to doctors were their responsibility,” he asserted.
TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai said that the opposition would present their demands at tomorrow’s sit-in.
“Our demand is just, and nobody will use abusive language or say hurtful things,” he vowed. “Only courteous and respectful language will be allowed.”
“Only God knows how long we will sit there, and we promise not to stand up,” Achakzai stated, inviting those who opposed injustice to join them.
In a post on X, he reiterated the same, saying, “A peaceful protest sit-in will begin outside the Parliament house from tomorrow.
“We will present our demands during tomorrow’s sit-in, and the sit-in will continue until the demands are accepted. If, God forbid, something goes wrong in accepting the demands, the government will be responsible,” he said.







‘State has committed a crime against Imran’
Earlier in the day, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, alongside Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, spoke to the media outside the SC.
“A crime has been committed against Imran Khan, and this state has committed this crime,” Raja contended.
The PTI secretary general further stated that the “face of this crime is Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. We will not forget this name”.
Anjum has served as the jail superintendent at the Adiala jail, where Imran is imprisoned. Safdar told the court on Thursday that according to jail staff, he was transferred on Jan 16, being replaced by Sajid Baig.







The PTI secretary general said it was difficult for him to control his emotions after reading the report.
Raja said the pain in Imran’s eye began in November, and “sometime in December, he completely lost vision in his right eye”.
“Yet Imran was only given drops meant to treat irritation in the eye. He was not taken to hospital, and a qualified doctor to treat eye ailments was also not called. Instead, prison doctors kept giving him eye drops as Imran continued to complain that the pain in his eye was not subsiding,” he alleged.
Raja further claimed: “When the situation worsened, Ghafoor Anjum was immediately replaced on January 16. The new administrator who replaced him also wasted 10 days before a doctor from Pims, Dr Arif, was called [to the Adiala jail] on January 26.”
The PTI secretary general said Dr Arif, after examining Imran’s eye, advised that he should immediately be taken to the hospital. The former premier was administered treatment, including an injection, at the Pims hospital in Islamabad.
“The word used [in the report for Imran’s ailment] is occlusion of the retina,” Raja said, adding that Imran was quoted as saying that after treatment at the hospital, he regained 10pc-15pc vision in his right eye. “He is able to detect light through that eye, but he has not [fully] regained his vision.”
“This is a very painful and terrifying situation,” he said, adding that they had no information about what medical condition was affecting Imran’s vision.
He stressed the need for Imran’s medical examination at the earliest by doctors trusted by the PTI founder, family and public.
“The ongoing situation is unacceptable,” he asserted.



Pointing out that there were no doctors in Pims to treat ailments pertaining to the retina while Shifa International in Islamabad had two such doctors, he alleged that they were “deliberately” not asked to examine and treat Imran.
“So, several people are involved in the crime that has been committed against Imran. All of those names will be revealed; we will not hide any of them. Khan sahib has himself identified one of them, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. A case will be filed against him immediately.”
Raja further alleged that the “Islamabad High Court is also involved” in this matter, questioning why Imran’s cases were not being fixed for hearing.
Meanwhile, “the condition of one of the eyes of the biggest leader of this nation is very concerning, and we have no information about his overall health condition”.
Despite this, Raja continued, Imran had directed his party to approach the courts. “We will not spare these courts. This nation and history will avenge the crime committed by these courts,” he said, demanding that Imran’s cases be fixed for hearing.
He also asserted that no reason was left to keep Imran behind bars and “freedom is his right now”.
“He will get freedom and this nation will get him freedom. We will fight his case inside and outside courts,” Raja said.
Imran’s sister, Aleema, said that the report had shattered her heart.
“We haven’t done enough for a person who has been in jail for two-and-a-half years,” she said. She said that the jail authorities knew about Imran’s health but failed to arrange adequate treatment for him.
“Imran Khan is in jail because our judiciary is not free,” she asserted.
Speaking to the media later in the day, CM Afridi said that they had “options” and they were considering them.
He announced that PTI’s core committee, political committee and TTAP leaders were set to meet later in the day to deliberate over those options.
The KP CM recalled that it had been over 900 days since Imran’s incarceration, but he had “never complained” about his health.
But now, he said, “We have called you and are doing our second press conference, which means that this is serious.”
“God forbids. If there were an irreversible loss, then there would be no use in raising our voices,” Afridi stated, adding that the PTI would take some “serious” steps.







Afridi branded the jail authorities’ negligence of Imran’s worsening eye condition a “criminal act”.
“It violates human rights, the law, the Constitution, jail manuals and is just inhumane,” the chief minister stated.
“When [former premier] Nawaz Sharif experienced health issues, the judiciary and our media fraternity collectively raised their voices, even though we knew that the tests or condition were false,” he added, recounting that despite this, the PML-N supremo was allowed to leave the country for medical treatment.
“This man is a former premier and the chairman of the country’s largest political party. He is in pain right now and has serious issues,” he stressed.
“We have to rise above politics and, on humanitarian and legal grounds, raise our voices for him,” he said.
Senate opposition leader demands formation of medical board
Abbas said in a post on X earlier in the day that he was “formally sending the full details of this matter, evidence and timeline to all national and international human rights organisations and ambassadors stationed in Pakistan so that they might take notice of this grave situation”.
In the post, which quoted his address to the Senate, the TTAP vice chairman demanded that an “independent and transparent medical board be immediately formed, the complete medical records made public, and those responsible be identified and action taken in accordance with the law”.
Lamenting that “timely and effective treatment was not provided”, Abbas also recalled that the nation was “constantly given the impression that he was completely healthy and had no problems”.
“If Imran Khan had been allowed regular meetings with his family, if medical examinations had been transparent and reports had been made public, then perhaps this would not have come to this,” he said.
Emphasising that the state was responsible for the life and health of any person in custody, Abbas stated: “Political disagreements have their place, but denying human rights and basic medical care is unacceptable in any civilised society.
“Delaying treatment, withholding information, and limiting access to family were not only inhumane but also a shirking of constitutional and legal obligations,” he contended.
“This was not just a matter of an individual; it is a matter of principle,” the TTAP leader asserted.
“If a former prime minister and a popular public leader of the country can be treated like this today, to what extent are the rights of an ordinary citizen protected?” he questioned.
“The state has a responsibility not to let political differences prevail over human dignity and fundamental rights,” Abbas noted.







TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar wrote on X: “For months in a row Imran Khan kept on complaining about loss of vision in his right eye but was denied prompt medical attention.
“This is not negligence. This is torture; cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment,” alleged Khokhar.
He highlighted that Pakistan was party to the United Nations’ rules on treatment of prisoners — also known as the “Nelson Mandela Rules” – and of the UN Convention Against Torture.
Khokhar, who is also a lawyer, argued that these rules “clearly prohibit such treatment” as meted out to Imran.







‘Not a matter to be trivialised’
Separately, in an official statement on the matter, the PTI expressed “profound concern and deep anguish” over the report detailing Imran’s health.
“We strongly condemn the treatment meted out to Imran Khan, particularly with regard to the serious deterioration of his eyesight,” the party said on social media platform X.
“The report has laid before the nation facts that are sufficient to shake the conscience of every Pakistani,” it asserted.
The PTI claimed that the jail authorities limited Imran’s treatment to basic eye drops during the last three to four months, while “denying access to his personal physicians”.
“This constitutes a grave and inexcusable act of negligence. It is not merely a medical lapse; it amounts to playing with his life and health,” the party stated.
It further said there would be “no compromise” on Imran’s health and rights.
The PTI declared: “We will raise our voice against this injustice at every constitutional, legal, public, and international forum available to us. Should our legitimate demands remain unmet, we reserve the right to initiate a public movement.
“Imran Khan’s health is not a matter to be trivialised. Any further negligence may provoke a severe public reaction.”







“When the eyesight of a leader of such national and international stature is at stake, every possible transparent and independent medical facility must be provided immediately,” the PTI demanded.
“Any harm inflicted upon Imran Khan’s health will be accounted for,” the PTI warned, asserting that it reserved the right to initiate legal proceedings against Anjum, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab prisons inspector general, the provincial prisons minister and “other responsible officials”.
While noting the SC’s directives regarding a medical team and contact with his sons, the PTI lamented that the “rejection of the request for a family member to be present during the medical examination, and the continued restriction or conditional provision of other basic facilities, is deeply disappointing”.
The party demanded that the ex-prime minister be granted “immediate and unrestricted access to his personal physicians and that, for specialised eye treatment, he be transferred without delay to a reputable hospital recommended by his medical team”.
Stressing that unhindered access to his legal counsel and the full restoration of family visitation rights were his fundamental rights, the PTI said, “To deprive him of these rights is tantamount to trampling upon justice and violating established international norms.”
The PTI urged international human rights organisations and global institutions to “take notice of the treatment being meted out” to Imran.

 

“A former elected prime minister facing prolonged solitary confinement, restricted medical facilities, and impediments to family and legal contact raises serious concerns under universally recognised human rights standards, and falls within the ambit of mental and medical torture,” the PTI alleged.
It also called upon the Pakistani media “not to treat this matter merely as a political dispute, but to highlight it as a serious human rights issue”.
In a separate post on X, the PTI said the report submitted to the SC itself mentions “rapid vision loss, visible distress, lack of full medical transparency, and restricted independent access” for the party founder.
“These aren’t social media claims. They are documented concerns,” the party contended.
It added: “A former prime minister in state custody is dealing with serious health deterioration while basic transparency remains a question. When someone is imprisoned, their health becomes the responsibility of those in power. Period.”
The party emphasised that this was not about politics anymore. “It’s about whether power is being used responsibly or ruthlessly,” it stated.
“You can disagree with a man. You cannot gamble with his health.”
‘Inhumane treatment’
PTI leader and former minister Hammad Azhar pointed out that Imran’s right eye was left with 15pc vision because he “was not provided timely medical treatment”.
“This stinking non-democratic, non-elected, and fascist system is the worst period in Pakistan’s history,” he said on X.







PTI’s Omar Ayub demanded that jail officials Anjum and Baig be “sacked by the Supreme Court”, further calling for the initiation of criminal proceedings against them.
“PM Imran Khan’s right eye vision deteriorated because of these personnel’s callous attitude. Shahbaz Sharif, Mohsin Naqvi and Maryam Nawaz are responsible as well as the establishment,” the former National Assembly opposition leader alleged in a post on X.
He further stated, “It is time for some serious introspection by the Supreme Court. Justice delayed, is justice denied. Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi should have acted sooner. PM Imran Khan’s vision in his right eye could have been saved.”
Ayub stressed that Imran should have access to an ophthalmologist with the requisite expertise and his family physician should be given unhindered access to him as well.







PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh termed the report about his party founder “heart-wrenching and sad”.
“The nation is in deep sorrow and grief today. We demand that Imran Khan be released immediately after providing complete and transparent medical facilities,” he said.







Former KP CM and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur emphasised that Imran’s “health is the most important concern of every Pakistani”.
“Proper treatment via his personal medical teams should be ensured,” he demanded.
“Denying proper medical treatment to a former prime minister and Pakistan’s most popular leader is purely evil. Every Pakistani here and overseas condemns this fascist approach,” he asserted.







Moonis Elahi, the son of former Punjab CM and PTI leader Parvez Elahi, posted on X saying that the damage to Imran’s eye was a “result of his inhumane and vindictive treatment of the leader in jail”.
“The nation will neither forget nor forgive,” he said.

According to a statement by the DOJ, Burhan Mirza, 31, and Kashif Iqbal, 48, along with several co-schemers, were accused of submitting fraudulent claims for medical services and equipment that were never provided.
The alleged scheme operated during 2023 and 2024 and involved nominee-owned laboratories and durable medical equipment providers, it said.
The DOJ added that three other alleged co-schemers had already pleaded guilty in the case: Mir Akbar Khan, 57, of West Chicago, who admitted recruiting nominee owners for the fake medical businesses; Fasiur Rahman Syed, 47, an Indian citizen who resided in Chicago; and Navaid Rasheed, 43, a Pakistani citizen who lived in Plano, Texas.
All three were awaiting sentencing, it said.
The statement quoted the indictment as saying that Mirza, a Pakistani national residing in Pakistan, allegedly obtained identifying information of individuals, healthcare providers and insurers without their knowledge. Mirza used this information to support false claims submitted to Medicare and private insurers on behalf of the nominee-owned companies, it said.
The indictment further said that Iqbal, also a Pakistani national, resided in Lavon, Texas, at the time of the alleged offences. It said he was associated with several durable medical equipment companies that submitted fraudulent claims to insurers. He was also accused of laundering the proceeds of the fraud and coordinating the transfer of funds from the US to Pakistan, it added.
“Rooting out fraud is a priority for this Justice Department,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche was quoted as saying by the DOJ statement, adding that the defendants had allegedly stolen millions of dollars from a programme designed to provide healthcare to American seniors and people with disabilities.
Northern District of Illinois Attorney Andrew S. Boutros said the alleged conduct went beyond financial loss to the government.
“The defendants didn’t just steal from a government programme; they stole from taxpayers who fund the promise of healthcare in this country,” he said.
The indictment charged Mirza with 12 counts of healthcare fraud and five counts of money laundering. Iqbal faces 12 counts of healthcare fraud, six counts of money laundering and one count of making a false statement to US law enforcement authorities. Arraignments have not yet been scheduled.
The DOJ emphasised that the indictment contained allegations only and that all defendants were  presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.</p><small>2026-02-12 17:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12214858764741f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972735/150-people-rescued-after-fire-erupts-in-high-rise-building-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>150 people rescued after fire erupts in high-rise building in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Around 150 people, including elderly people and children, were rescued after a fire erupted in a high-rise building near Karachi’s Baloch Colony on Thursday, according to police and rescue services officials.
Bahadurabad Station House Officer Mohammed Nawaz told Dawn that the fire broke out in the Index Palace in Sharifabad, near the Baloch Colony bridge.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan, meanwhile, told Dawn that it was an eight-storey building with two basements, where vehicles were parked.
“The blaze took place inside the parking space, ostensibly due to some short circuit failure in a parked car,” he said.
“Since the high-rise building had no ventilation, smoke spread and engulfed the building,” he said.

 


Though the fire only spread up to the first floor, smoke engulfed the whole building, spreading fear and panic among the residents.
Khan said two rescue teams were on site, with one engaged in rescue operations.
“With the help of ladders, residents from three floors — with four flats on each floor — were rescued,” he said.
Later, firefighters entered the building and safely rescued people, including the elderly, women and children, from the upper floors.
“Two people who had gone to the rooftop of the building were rescued with the help of a snorkel,” Khan added.
“With the timely action of the rescue team, around 150 persons were rescued safely,” he said.
The spokesperson said Rescue 1122’s command and control system received information about the fire erupting in the basement around 5:47am, with firefighters reaching the scene at 6am.
Initially, they were informed that fire had erupted where the generator was kept in case of power failure; however, it later transpired that the fire erupted in a car due to a short circuit, which spread and engulfed other parked vehicles.
Khan said two cars were destroyed, while a few others were damaged. The blaze was brought under control at 8:30am, while cooling work continued till 10am.
The Rescue 1122 spokesperson further said that the building had no fire safety system in the basement, and that mainly members of the Bohra community resided in the building.
Meanwhile, electricity distribution company K-Electric (KE) in a statement said that its staffers displayed remarkable bravery and helped save at least 25 individuals from the fire.
“KE teams responded promptly after the fire incident was notified, and the feeder supplying electricity to the affected area was isolated in line with the company’s safety protocols,” the statement read.
“This timely action was taken to eliminate any potential electrical hazard and to ensure the safety of residents and surrounding infrastructure.”
Sadia Dada, the chief distribution and marketing communications officer at KE, was quoted as saying: “We know how to go above and beyond our mandate for the betterment and safety of Karachi and its people. I laud my staff that not only followed safety protocols but also helped save lives.”</p><small>2026-02-12 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12220822c643f04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/early-counts-show-bnp-ahead-in-bangladesh-election-after-strong-turnout' target='_blank'><strong>Early counts show BNP ahead in Bangladesh election after strong turnout</strong></a><br><p>The Bangladesh Nationalist Party raced ahead of its rival Jamaat-i-Islami on Thursday, early counting showed, after tens of millions of Bangladeshis voted in a pivotal national election.
It was the first vote since the 2024 Gen Z-driven uprising that toppled long-time premier Sheikh Hasina.
Analysts say a clear outcome is crucial for stability in the nation of 175 million, after months of deadly anti-Hasina protests disrupted everyday life and hit major industries, including the garment sector, the world’s second-largest exporter.
It was the first national election to follow the recent under-30, Gen Z-led uprisings scattered around the world, with Nepal set to hold a vote next month.
Counting began at 4:30pm (3:30pm PKT) at most booths, immediately after polls closed, with clear trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, election commission officials said.



Contest between former allies
The race pits two coalitions led by former allies, BNP and Jamaat, with opinion polls giving the BNP a slight edge.
BNP was leading in 50 seats and Jamaat in 18, local TV news stations said. Bangladesh’s parliament, the Jatiya Sangsad, has 300 seats, with 151 required for a simple majority.
The party declared on its official Facebook page that its chief and prime ministerial candidate Tarique Rahman had won one of two seats he contested. Election authorities were yet to announce the result officially, however.
BNP members clapped and cheered loudly as they celebrated outside the party office in Dhaka on hearing the news of his victory, visuals on the Facebook page showed.
Turnout appeared on track to exceed the 42 per cent recorded in the last election in 2024. Local media reported that more than 60pc of registered voters were expected to have cast ballots.

Hasina calls vote a farce
Hasina’s Awami League is banned, and she remains in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, opening the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh as Dhaka’s ties with New Delhi fray.
Elections under Hasina were frequently marred by boycotts and intimidation, critics say.
In a statement sent to journalists on WhatsApp, Hasina denounced the election as a “carefully planned farce”, held without her party and without real voter participation. She said Awami League supporters had rejected the process.

“We demand the cancellation of this voterless, illegal, and unconstitutional election … the removal of the suspension imposed on the activities of the Awami League; and the restoration of the people’s voting rights through the arrangement of a free, fair, and inclusive election under a neutral caretaker government,” she said.

Alongside the election, a referendum was held on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and a two-term limit for the prime minister.
More than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, were on the ballot and at least 50 parties contested — a national record. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.
Long lines of voters, heavy security
There were no reports of major violence.
Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths.
“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”

Many voters echoed that sentiment, telling Reuters that the atmosphere felt freer and more festive than in previous elections.
Kamal Chowdhury, 31, who works as a driver for a company in Dhaka and travelled to his hometown in the eastern district of Brahmanbaria to cast his vote, said: “It feels festive here.”
Outside a polling booth in Dhaka, where BNP chief Rahman and head of the interim government Muhammad Yunus voted, policemen were on horses with saddle blankets proclaiming: “Police are here, vote without fear.”
President Zardari hopes for peaceful process
President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.
“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.
He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.

Thousands of federal agents have in recent weeks conducted aggressive raids and arrests in what the administration claims are targeted missions against criminals.
“I have proposed and President Trump has concurred that this surge operation conclude,” Trump official Tom Homan told a briefing in Minneapolis.
“A significant drawdown has already been under way this week and will continue through the next week.”

 


The operations have sparked mass protests in Minneapolis, and the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti less than three weeks apart last month led to a wave of criticism.
Homan raised the prospect that the officers would deploy to another location but gave no details, as speculation is rife about which city might be targeted next.
“In the next week, we’re going deploy the officers here on detail, back to their home stations or other areas of the country where they are needed. But we’re going to continue to force immigration law,” he said.
Opposition Democrats have called for sweeping reforms to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, including ending mobile patrols, prohibiting agents from concealing their faces and requiring warrants.</p><small>2026-02-12 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12141023f9307e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972715/pakistans-2nd-indigenous-earth-observation-satellite-launched-from-chinas-space-centre' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s 2nd indigenous earth observation satellite launched from China’s space centre</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has marked a major achievement in its national space programme with the successful launch of its second indigenous Earth Observation Satellite, EO-2, from China’s Yangjiang Seashore Launch Centre on Thursday.
Developed by the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), the EO-2 satellite is designed to significantly enhance the country’s earth observation and high-resolution imaging capabilities.
The officials of Suparco said the satellite will provide critical data to support national development planning, natural resource management, environmental monitoring, and urban expansion.

 


It will also strengthen governance, disaster management, climate analysis, and strategic decision-making by delivering accurate and timely satellite imagery.
With the addition of EO-2, Pakistan has expanded its satellite fleet, ensuring improved continuity, coverage, and precision of earth observation data, added the space agency.
Suparco officials termed the launch a milestone in Pakistan’s space journey, noting that the successful indigenous development of EO-2 reflects the country’s growing technical expertise and self-reliance in advanced satellite technology.

 


Earlier on February 7, Pakistan marked a major step forward in its Human Spaceflight Programme as two candidates were officially shortlisted by the Astronauts Centre of China (ACC), according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The development followed a cooperation agreement signed in February 2025 between Suparco and the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
Under the agreement, two Pakistanis will undergo astronaut training in China, with one ultimately selected to travel to the Tiangong space station.
Last year, Pakistan launched its first indigenous Electro-Optical (EO-1) satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northern China.
‘Historic milestone’
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that Pakistan had achieved “another space milestone”.
“This success reflects our growing technological footprint and is yet another manifestation of the enduring Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership that is now transcending into space,” he said.
“ Great job done by Suparco and our brilliant scientists. I look forward to more good news in the coming days with Pakistan-China cooperation in this vital area of national development,” he said.







Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar congratulated the nation on the “historic milestone”, highlighting that it was Pakistan’s fifth earth observation satellite and second indigenous electro-optical satellite.
“This achievement reflects Pakistan’s steady progress in strengthening its national space capabilities and advancing technological self-reliance,” he affirmed, noting that the satellite was launched in collaboration with China.

 

“I express my sincere gratitude to the Government of the People’s Republic of China for its continued cooperation and steadfast support,” Dar said.
The foreign minister noted that the Pakistan–China All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership “continues to scale new heights, including in space technology”.
He also commended Suparco, Pakistani scientists, engineers and the entire team for their “tireless efforts in expanding Pakistan’s indigenous space infrastructure and developing reliable, domestically engineered space systems for national development”.

According to a statement issued by Bannu CTD Superintendent of Police (SP) Fazal Wahid, the suspect belonged to Bannu district and was said to be an active commander of the newly formed organisation Ittehadul Mujahideen Pakistan (IMP), established through a collaboration between the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Gul Bahadur group.
He said that the suspect confessed to his involvement in nine major terrorist activities during the initial interrogation.
He said that these included the December 2025 attack on Miranshah Assistant Commissioner Shah Wali Khan, in which he was martyred along with his two security guards and a civilian.
The suspect also confessed to the abduction and killing of former Bannu station house officer Abid Wazir in November 2025. Additionally, he also admitted to his involvement in the abduction and murder of three members of the Lakki Marwat peace committee, who were actively working for public welfare and regional peace, the police official said.
According to the CTD official, the suspect had also confessed to kidnapping two Frontier Corps (FC) personnel and police officials from Pipal Daud Shah. He also admitted involvement in the June 2024 killing of a polio officer and his guard in Mamand Khel, the SP said.
He said that initial investigations showed that Osama alias Baghi was involved in the reconnaissance of sensitive institutions, and providing secret photographs and information of police personnel to terrorists.
The official said the suspect had also confessed to setting up illegal checkpoints in Pipal Bazaar and other areas along with his accomplices to harass civilians.
He said that further investigation was underway, and raids were being conducted to arrest his facilitators and other associates.
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa inspector general and CTD additional inspector general appreciated the CTD team for the successful operation and termed the arrest of the most-wanted terrorist commander as a significant step toward regional peace.
Meanwhile, Domel police also carried out a separate operation, arresting two terrorists along with three facilitators.
According to District Police Officer Yasir Afridi, the arrested terrorists were involved in sniper attacks at Nala Kashu and Police Post Khonia Khel. Two police personnel were injured in the attack on Khonia Khel police checkpost.</p><small>2026-02-12 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650517-pakistan-us-discuss-ways-to-boost-counterterrorism-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US discuss ways to boost counterterrorism cooperation</strong></a><br><p>

According to a handout from the interior ministry, the agreement was reached during a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs John Mark Pomeroy.
During the meeting, the US official said that the country attached great importance to its relationship with Pakistan. He condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Islamabad and Quetta and expressed condolences to the victims.
The interior minister welcomed US investment in the mining, minerals, and energy sectors and assured that American investors would be provided with the safest possible environment in Pakistan.
‎During the meeting, Pakistan–US bilateral relations and the regional situation were discussed, along with ways to enhance cooperation in counterterrorism, particularly in the field of internal security.
Speaking on the occasion, Naqvi said that global cooperation was essential in the fight against terrorism, and relations with the US were of key importance in this regard.
He emphasised that Pakistan believed in global partnerships to eliminate terrorism and promote investment.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, US charge d’affaires Natalie Baker, Interior Ministry Secretary Khurram Agha and senior officials were also present on the occasion.
Earlier this month, Pakistan participated in the inaugural Critical Minerals Ministerial at the US Department of State, as Islamabad sought to expand foreign investment and forge strategic partnerships in the minerals and energy sectors.</p><small>2026-02-12 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1216514852d5c5d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972723/risk-of-nipah-spread-low-after-cases-in-india-bangladesh-who' target='_blank'><strong>Risk of Nipah spread low after cases in India, Bangladesh: WHO</strong></a><br><p>The World Health Organisation has said the risk of the deadly Nipah virus spreading was low after three cases of infection were recently confirmed in India and Bangladesh.
Nipah, which spreads from animals to humans, has no vaccine and a fatality rate ranging from 40 to 75 per cent, according to the UN health body.
“In the past few weeks, three cases of Nipah — two in India and one in Bangladesh — made headlines and caused concern about a wider outbreak,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.

 

WHO assessed the risk of spread of the Nipah virus regionally and globally and found it low, he added.
Two cases of Nipah were confirmed last month in India’s West Bengal state, while one patient died in Bangladesh last week after contracting the virus.
“The two outbreaks were not related, although both occurred along the India-Bangladesh border, and share some of the same ecological and cultural conditions, as well as populations of the species of fruit bat that are known to be the natural reservoir of Nipah virus,” Tedros said.
Indian nurse infected with Nipah virus dies
Meanwhile, an Indian health worker who contracted the Nipah virus in December has died, a senior health official from the eastern state of West Bengal said on Thursday.
The woman — a nurse — was one of two people in the state who were infected and was being treated at a local hospital.
“The woman … who was critical, died due to cardiac arrest,” Health Secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam told Reuters.
Nipah was first identified in 1998 after it spread among pig farmers in Malaysia. In India, the first Nipah outbreak was reported in West Bengal in 2001.
In 2018, at least 17 people died from Nipah in Kerala, and in 2023, two people died from the virus in the same southern Indian state.
Symptoms include intense fever, vomiting and a respiratory infection, but severe cases can involve seizures and brain inflammation that results in a coma.</p><small>2026-02-12 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/121033478880642.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972699/imran-claims-only-15pc-vision-left-in-right-eye-sc-forms-medical-team-to-examine-pti-founder' target='_blank'><strong>Imran claims only 15pc vision left in right eye; SC forms medical team to examine PTI founder</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the formation of a medical team to examine former premier Imran Khan’s eye, after a report submitted in court quoted the PTI founder as claiming that “only 15 per cent” vision was left in his right eye.
The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. It was ordered that both the eye inspection and the phone calls be conducted before February 16 (Monday).
The instructions came as a two-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and including Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan resumed hearing the case regarding the PTI founder’s living conditions in Adiala jail.
Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
“The issue of Imran’s health is most important,” CJP Afridi observed, adding that “intervention was necessary”.
“We want to know the government’s stance on the matter of his (Imran’s) health,” the top judge said, at which Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan affirmed that it was the state’s responsibility to provide medical facilities.
“If the prisoner is not satisfied, then the state will take measures,” AGP Awan added.
CJP Afridi then noted that the issue of Imran’s “telephone calls with his children is also important”.

 

“We are trusting the government. The government is in a good mood today,” he remarked.
PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar, who was appointed amicus curiae and met Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Tuesday, had submitted a seven-page report to the SC regarding Imran’s living condition in the prison.
In his report, seen by Dawn, Safdar quoted Imran as telling him that “despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Imran told Safdar that approximately “three to four months earlier, until October 2025, he had normal 6 x 6 vision in both eyes”. He then began experiencing persistent blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then-jail superintendent but “no action was taken by the jail authorities”.

 

The report read: “[Imran] stated that he subsequently suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye, following which an ophthalmologist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was called to examine him.
“According to [Imran], he was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused severe damage, and despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye.”
Adding to Imran’s claims, Safdar said he “personally observed that the petitioner appeared visibly perturbed and deeply distressed by the loss of vision and the absence of timely and specialised medical intervention”.
“Throughout the meeting, the petitioner’s eyes were watery, and he repeatedly used a tissue to wipe them, reflecting physical discomfort,” the lawyer recalled.
However, during the hearing, the SC dismissed the request to have the condition of Imran’s eye examined in the presence of his family members.
On the request to provide some books to the PTI founder, AGP Awan said it would be done after consultation with eye doctors.
Recalling that the SC had received reports from Safdar and the Adiala jail superintendent, CJP Afridi said: “Most of the things in both reports are similar — the place is good, the facilities are fine.”
Noting that the issue of Imran’s meetings with his family members was pending before the Islamabad High Court (IHC), the top judge said it would be appropriate for the relevant forum to decide on that.
‘No access to personal physicians amid deteriorating eye condition’
The report detailed Safdar’s meeting with Imran, the cell conditions, the facilities and amenities provided to the ex-premier, his living compound’s description, as well as the lawyer’s process of reaching the jail.
Safdar further quoted Imran as claiming that “regular and periodic blood tests” were not conducted.
While his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yusuf had previously been permitted access, “despite repeated requests and a deteriorating ocular condition, no such access was allowed during the relevant period”, the ex-premier was quoted as saying.

 

“[Imran] stated that for nearly three months, the only treatment administered consisted of eye drops, which resulted in no improvement and was followed by a major impairment of vision in his right eye,” Safdar said.
Imran also claimed that “despite being 73 years old and requiring dental consultation, no dentist had examined or treated him over the past two years, notwithstanding repeated requests”.
According to Safdar, Imran told him about “rapid and substantial loss of vision over the preceding three months while he was living and detained under the ‘care and custody’ of Abdul Ghafoor Anjum”, the jail superintendent.
“This concern of his was neither taken seriously nor addressed by the relevant jail authorities,” Safdar was told. Upon inquiry, the jail staff informed the lawyer that Anjum had been transferred on Jan 16, 2026, and replaced by Sajid Baig.
Safdar stated that upon inquiry, the jail superintendent informed him that Imran was currently under the care of Pims’ Dr Arif and that the on-duty jail doctor recorded the PTI founder’s vital signs three times daily.
A day ago, Safdar denied making any statement on Imran’s health on Tuesday, making it clear that if anything was attributed to him in this regard, it was “misrepresented and misreported”.
On Tuesday, the day he met Imran, Safdar had reportedly told the media that the incarcerated PTI founder was fine and looking healthy.
The SC’s order allowing Safdar to meet Imran came after the bench rejected senior PTI leader Latif Khosa’s request for an immediate meeting, but issued notices to the parties.
Direct consequence of ‘medical neglect, solitary confinement’, says Imran’s son
Imran’s son Kasim Khan, in a post on X, termed the development “a direct consequence of “solitary confinement, medical neglect”.
“We have been informed that my father, Imran Khan, has lost most of the vision in his right eye, with reports indicating that only 15pc eyesight remains,” Kasim said.
“This is the direct consequence of 922 days of solitary confinement, medical neglect (denied blood tests) and the deliberate denial of proper treatment in jail,” Kasim stressed, maintaining that the “responsibility lies squarely with the regime in power, the army chief and the puppets enabling this cruelty”.
He said that Imran’s “physical deterioration is happening under their orders, their watch and their responsibility”.
“They have manipulated and warped the justice system in order to keep my father in solitary confinement,” he added.
Kasim claimed that he and his brother Sulaiman were “still being denied a visa to see our father as his health deteriorates”.
“History will record this injustice,” he said, and called on “human rights bodies, legal institutions and democratic nations to confront this persecution and ensure those responsible face consequences”.







Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the narrative being “propagated” by the incarcerated ex-premier’s family had “fallen flat on its face” in light of the report.
In a post on X, he said: “The narrative which was being propagated to international media by Aleema Khan and other members of Imran Khan’s family regarding mistreatment and shabby conditions in prison has fallen flat on its face.
“The report regarding daily routine and diet plan has cleared all ambiguity. All facilities are available to him and he has privileges more than any other prisoner,” he added.







Diagnosis and treatment
Meanwhile, a medical report dated February 6 — signed by Pims Executive Director Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander and addressed to the Adiala jail administration — was also submitted to the SC.
It noted that Dr Sikander had been directed by the prime minister’s office to communicate to the jail staff about Imran’s medical condition.
Imran “reported reduced vision in the right eye”, Dr Sikander said, without specifying when.

 

He added: “A qualified ophthalmologist from Pims, Islamabad, conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiyala Jail [sic], including slit lamp examination, fundoscopy, intraocular pressure measurements, essential laboratory tests and OCT (optical coherence tomography) of the retina.
“Based on his assessment, a diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made and hospital-based follow-up treatment was recommended.”
Recalling Imran’s treatment on the night of January 24, the doctor said the ex-premier was “brought to Pims on the night of Saturday/Sunday for advised procedure”.
“At the hospital, the treatment plan i.e. need for administering anti-VGEF intravitreal injection was explained in full to the patient. Accordingly, an informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure,” Dr Sikander stated.
He reiterated that the procedure was carried out in the operation theatre under standard sterile protocols and monitoring, adding that it was “completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes”.
In his report, Safdar said Dr Sikander’s note was provided to him by Imran’s family and it did not “contain full details of the episodes”.
“Nor does it identify the qualified ophthalmologist who conducted the tests and administered the treatment,” he highlighted.</p><small>2026-02-12 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12175452c5c5465.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972726/in-letter-to-pm-kundi-recommends-posthumous-civil-award-for-youth-who-resisted-islamabad-suicide-attacker' target='_blank'><strong>In letter to PM, Kundi recommends posthumous civil award for youth who resisted Islamabad suicide attacker</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi has urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to confer a posthumous national civil award on 22-year-old Oun Abbas, who lost his life while resisting the suicide attacker who targeted an imambargah in Islamabad, it emerged on Thursday.
On February 6, a suicide bomber ripped through the Friday congregation at the Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra on the outskirts of Islamabad. At least 38 people were killed in the incident, and more than 150 were injured.
According to eye witness accounts, Abbas, who was praying inside the hall, had abandoned his rituals and tried to tackle the attacker. However, he lost his life when the suicide bomber detonated.
In a letter addressed to the prime minister and dated Feb 11, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Kundi lauded the “exceptional gallantry and supreme sacrifice” displayed by Abbas.
“In those moments of terror and chaos, while many sought safety, this brave young man chose to confront the terrorist face to face,” Kundi said, stressing that the young man’s courage prevented “a far greater tragedy” and led to the “saving of countless innocent lives”.
“Tragically, he embraced martyrdom in this valiant effort,” he said.
The KP governor called on the prime minister to confer “a posthumous national civil award, such as the Sitara-i-Shujaat or Tamgha-i-Shujaat”.
He said that the award would “not only honour his memory with the dignity it deserves but would also serve as an enduring inspiration for the youth of Pakistan, affirming that courage, faith and sacrifice in service of one’s community are the truest expressions of Pakistani nationhood”.
The KP governor expressed faith that the prime minister would consider the recommendation with the “utmost priority and urgency it so clearly warrants and approve the award at the earliest possible instance as a fitting national tribute to his unparalleled courage and sacrifice”.
Kundi had made a similar request earlier this week during a visit to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), where the injured remained under treatment.
It is worth mentioning that a day earlier, PM Shehbaz had announced a sum of Rs 10 million for the heirs of Abbas. The premier had also announced Rs5m for each person martyred in the attack; Rs3m for those critically injured and under treatment at the hospital; and Rs1m for those with minor injuries who had been discharged.</p><small>2026-02-12 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12173229d0d0056.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972719/2-cops-among-6-injured-during-armed-confrontation-over-shop-ownership-in-kps-lower-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>2 cops among 6 injured during armed confrontation over shop ownership in KP’s Lower South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>LOWER SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: Six people, including a police constable and station house officer (SHO), were injured when an argument over shop ownership and financial dealings led to an exchange of fire between the rival groups at the Toi Khullah market in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lower South Waziristan on Thursday.
Wana Circle Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Asghar Ali Shah told Dawn that the incident took place at around 9am when “a disagreement between two groups over monetary transactions and shop ownership turned into a heated argument”.
“The situation quickly escalated into a physical altercation and subsequently into an armed confrontation,” he said.
The DSP said that upon receiving the information about the incident, SHO Qutab Khan Dottani of the Toi Khullah police station,along with a police party, reached the site of the incident.
“While trying to mediate between the rival groups, the SHO and a police constable came under fire and sustained injuries,” the DSP said, adding that SHO Dottani had sustained a bullet wound in the leg but was out of danger.
Meanwhile, injured constable Bahra Khan sustained a minor head injury.
Both were shifted to the district headquarters (DHQ) hospital in Wana for treatment.
The DSP said that among the four other injured, Juma Gai and Alauddin — who are brothers — sustained bullet wounds in their legs. Another injured person, Hazrat Ali, sustained a bullet wound in the abdomen and was reported to be in serious condition, he said, adding that a man identified as Khudai Noor also suffered an injury in the leg in the incident.
All the injured were shifted to the DHQ hospital Wana.
DSP Shah said police had registered a case of the incident and initiated an investigation to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the incident, while efforts were under way to identify and arrest those involved in the clash.</p><small>2026-02-12 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650485-ramadan-moon-sighting-ruet-e-hilal-committee-to-meet-on-feb-18-in-peshawar' target='_blank'><strong>Ramadan moon sighting: Ruet-e-Hilal Committee to meet on Feb 18 in Peshawar</strong></a><br><p>

A defence ministry source told AFP that the clearance covered the purchase of 114 Rafale fighter jets, adding to the dozens already used by the Indian Air Force (IAF).
“The procurement … will enhance the capability of undertaking air dominance roles across the spectrum of conflict and significantly boost the deterrence capabilities of IAF with long-range offensive strikes,” India’s defence ministry said in a statement, without specifying the number of jets being purchased.
The approval by the defence acquisition council — comprising top military officers and the defence minister — is an important first step for any military hardware purchase in the country.
“The majority of MRFA (Multi Role Fighter Aircraft) to be procured will be manufactured in India,” the statement added.
New Delhi has pushed hard in the last decade to reduce its dependence on Russia, its traditional main supplier of military equipment.
India has boosted military hardware imports from the United States, France, and Israel.
Macron is set to visit India on February 17.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has also liberalised laws to ease private investments in domestic defence manufacturing under the ‘Make in India’ policy initiative.
Since 2015, India has bought 26 Rafale jets worth around $8.7bn and in April announced a fresh multi-billion dollar deal to buy 26 more of the fighter jets.
Pakistan took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes, during the four-day conflict between the two countries in May 2025.</p><small>2026-02-12 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650487-pakistan-neither-shut-door-on-diplomacy-nor-seeking-war-with-afghanistan-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan neither shut door on diplomacy nor seeking war with Afghanistan: FO</strong></a><br><p>

The power regulator on Monday changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network. The notification effectively terminated the existing net-metering regime and replaced it with net-billing for all.
A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the Power Division to file a review appeal against it after the action drew much criticism.
In response to a call to attention notice — regarding prosumer regulations — raised by PPP’s Sharmila Faruqui during today’s session, Leghari spoke in defence of the move. He began his address by presenting “some key facts”.
He recalled that the issue had been under discussion for the “past 9-10 months”, adding that when the matter was forwarded to the federal cabinet, PM Shehbaz “told us to engage in further deliberations”.
The minister said that the total distributed solar generation in the country was estimated to be between 20,000 MW and 22,000 MW, out of which, “only 6,000-7,000MW of solar systems were on net-metering”.







He continued: “Out of these, only 2,200MW are used by industrial units, while the number for commercial and domestic consumers stood at 4,800MW.”
“Out of these, only 456,000 consumers use net-metering,” the minister said, stressing that given the limited number of consumers, it was “false to say that the general public will suffer due to the move”.
He maintained that only 8-10 per cent of the total solar consumers used the net-metering system. The minister stressed that the issue was not about “being anti-solar, but about fair pricing”.
The minister added that the proposed regulation had maintained the purchase rate for existing users at Rs27 due to “contractual obligations”; however, he noted that “this sparked another debate”.
He said that the net-metering users complained, “if you buy it from us at Rs27, and then give it to us at the rates of Rs45-65. How is this fair?”
“I will tell you how it is fair, this is fair [..] because with all the hydel, solar, wind, nuclear, gas, and coal sources combined, the average price is Rs8.31, then how can you justify the rate of Rs27,” the minister said.
He said that despite the “concessions”, PM Shehbaz has directed the Power Division to “file a review petition to the regulator and limit the move”.
The minister said that if the government were to continue with the policy, “these 456,000 investors, their profit will go down from 50pc to 37pc per year. Is that so bad?”
He stressed that “no one was going to incur any losses”.
“If the electricity cost goes down by Rs1-1.5 for the general consumers and you still get a 37pc profit, then, how can you say that the policy does not serve public interest?” he said.
“Yet, the prime minister has directed us to wait until the NEPRA hearing,” he added.
The minister said that the prime minister further directed the Power Division to develop a strategy to “lessen the burden on others caused by net-metering solar consumers”.
MNA Sharmila Faruqui terms action ‘daylight robbery’
Faruqui, in response to the minister’s remarks, objected to the minister for “shifting the blame to net-metering users for burdening the national grid”.
“These consumers are the ones who followed the government’s clean energy policy,” she said, stressing that the government had taken a “U-turn on their policies”.
“Now they are justifying it by blaming people who were at the forefront of your policy,” she said.
She maintained that the Power Division was “compensating for the cost incurred from line losses and transmission losses, their own inefficiency, inconsistency, corruption, line losses, capacity payments from the people”.
She termed the action “broad daylight robbery”.
In his response to Faruqui, the minister noted that the call to attention on the matter was no longer appropriate “since the prime minister has already said that the net-billing should be halted and the consumers will stay on net-metering for now”.
Addressing the list of issues pointed out by Faruqui, the minister held that “while other issues existed, this is still an important issue that is raising the price of power for all consumers on the grid.
“With this in rationalisation in mind, the regulations were introduced,” he added.</p><small>2026-02-12 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650447-imran-khan-left-with-just-15-sight-in-right-eye-claims-medical-report' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan claims only 15% vision remains in his right eye</strong></a><br><p>

The killer, who police identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, died by suicide after the shooting on Tuesday in Tumbler Ridge, a remote community of 2,400 people in the Pacific province of British Columbia.
Police revised the death toll down to nine, including Van Rootselaar, from the initially reported ten.
On more than one occasion, Van Rootselaar had been apprehended under the provincial Mental Health Act for an assessment, said Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald, commander of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia. She once attended the school but dropped out four years ago.



“Police had attended that (family) residence on multiple occasions over the past several years, dealing with concerns of mental health with respect to our suspect,” McDonald said.
Unlike the United States, school shootings are almost unheard of in Canada, and federal politicians initially struggled to maintain their composure.
“We will get through this. We will learn from this,” a visibly upset Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters.
Carney, who at one point looked close to tears, postponed a trip to Europe and ordered flags on all government buildings to be flown at half-mast for the next seven days.
Hours later, legislators in the House of Commons observed a minute’s silence and listened as a sombre Carney said the killings had left the country in shock and mourning.
“It is a town of miners, teachers, construction workers – families who have built their lives there, people who have always shown up for each other there … Tumbler Ridge represents the very best of Canada,” he said.
McDonald said Van Rootselaar, who was born male but began identifying as female six years ago, had first killed her mother, 39, and 11-year-old stepbrother at the family home.
She then went to the school, where she shot a 39-year-old woman teacher as well as three 12-year-old female students and two male students, one aged 12 and one aged 13. Police recovered a long gun and a modified handgun.
Dozens were injured, and two severely wounded victims, aged 12 and 19, remain in hospital.
Police officers who arrived at the scene two minutes after the initial call encountered active gunfire, including rounds fired in their direction, according to authorities, before discovering Van Rootselaar dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound.
“We do believe the suspect acted alone … it would be too early to speculate on motive,” McDonald told a press conference, saying police did not have information to suggest that anyone had been specifically targeted.
Several prominent world leaders sent messages of condolence. King Charles, Canada’s head of state, said he was “profoundly shocked and saddened” by the deaths.
Shooting among deadliest in Canadian history
Details about some of the victims were slowly emerging on Wednesday.
In an anguished Facebook post, Abel Mwansa said his 12-year-old son, also named Abel, had died in the shooting. Abel had once cried when his father proposed homeschooling because he loved going to school so much, his father wrote.
He raised his son, Mwansa added, to respect his elders, “be strong, work hard, put a smile on the face like I do, focus on his studies, never miss school and to be a good kid.” Another woman, Shanon Dycke, said her 12-year-old niece, Kylie May Smith, was among the victims.
“Pray for the other families who have lost their child, or are waiting to hear news,” she wrote on Facebook. “Just pray for Tumbler Ridge.” The attack sent shockwaves through the tiny community.
“Everybody knows everybody,” Jordon Kosik, a resident, said in an interview. “People don’t lock their homes. They don’t lock their cars. You can just go to your neighbour’s house, just walk right in.”
McDonald said police had seized firearms from the family residence about two years ago but returned them after the owner, who he did not identify, successfully appealed the decision.
Canada has stricter gun laws than the United States, but Canadians can own firearms with a licence.
Van Rootselaar previously had a firearms licence, but it expired in 2024. Canadians between the ages of 12 and 17 can obtain a minor’s firearms licence after taking a firearms safety course and passing tests.
The shooting ranks among the deadliest in Canadian history.
In April 2020, a 51-year-old man disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car shot and killed 22 people in a 13-hour rampage in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before police killed him at a petrol station.
In December 1989, a gunman killed 14 female students and wounded 13 at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, before dying by suicide.
“There’s not a word in the English language that’s strong enough to describe the level of devastation that this community has experienced,” said Larry Neufeld, a local provincial legislator.
“It’s going to take a significant amount of effort and a significant amount of courage to repair that terror,” he told CBC News.</p><small>2026-02-12 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650424-sindh-university-dadu-campus-official-removed-over-viral-videos' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh University Dadu campus official removed after viral videos</strong></a><br><p>

Visuals released earlier on Wednesday after the Netanyahu-Rubio meeting showed them holding a document with Netanyahu’s signature on Israel joining the board.
Netanyahu said on X that he “signed Israel’s accession as a member of the ‘Board of Peace’”. He later discussed Iran with Trump.







A UN Security Council resolution, adopted in mid-November, authorised the board and countries working with it to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza, where a fragile ceasefire began in October under a Trump plan on which Israel and Hamas signed off.
Under Trump’s Gaza plan, the board was meant to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance. Trump thereafter said the board, with him as chair, would be expanded to tackle global conflicts.
The board will hold its first meeting on February 19 in Washington to discuss Gaza’s reconstruction.
Many rights experts say that Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory’s affairs resembled a colonial structure. Israel’s presence on the board is expected to bring further criticism as the board does not include a Palestinian.
Countries have reacted cautiously to Trump’s invitation to join the board launched in late January. Many experts are concerned that the board could undermine the United Nations.
While some of Washington’s Middle Eastern allies have joined, many of its traditional Western allies have stayed away.
The ceasefire in Gaza has been repeatedly violated, with at least 580 Palestinians killed since it began in October, according to Palestinian and Israeli tallies, respectively.
The next phase of Trump’s Gaza plan calls for resolving complex issues like Hamas’s disarmament, which the group has long rejected, further Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force.
Israel’s invasion of Gaza has killed over 72,000, according to Gaza’s health ministry, caused a hunger crisis and internally displaced Gaza’s entire population.
Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide.</p><small>2026-02-12 06:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650404-imran-khans-eye-examination-must-be-conducted-before-feb-16-orders-sc' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's eye examination must be conducted before Feb 16, orders SC</strong></a><br><p>
