Earlier this week, security forces, backed by gunship helicopters and artillery, launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund tehsil and imposed a three-day curfew in the region. A day after he and his party came out all guns blazing against the military offensive, CM Gand­apur had appea­red to throw his full weight behind a “targeted operation” against militants. His statement came in complete contrast to the one issued on Tuesday night following a PTI parliamentary meeting, in which he vowed to take stringent measures, such as the withdrawal of the Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations 2011.
Though CM Gandapur took a U-turn, his party, the ruling PTI, had denounced the Bajaur operation, alleging that the decision bypassed the constitutionally elected government and it was nothing but a “dangerous replay of past mistakes”.
In a message from Imran posted today on his X account, which is not operated by him, the ex-premier said regarding any operation in KP: “I convey a clear message to Ali Amin that the federation must not be allowed to conduct another military operation in KP and the tribal areas.
“Confrontation between the army and the people destroys the institution of the army. Operations are not a solution to any problem. Issues should be resolved through dialogue in accordance with the system there. Afghanistan is our Muslim neighbouring country. Relations with them should also be improved, and issues should be addressed through discussions.”
Responding to the party founder’s instruction from his personal account, Gandapur said that keeping in mind Imran’s thinking, he had hosted today the first of several jirgas on restoring law and order in the province.
 






Gandapur had announced earlier this week that a series of jirgas would be convened to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.
In a post on X, a statement from the CM Office said the regional jirgas began today and were attended by tribal elders and elected public representatives from the Khyber and Orakzai districts, as well as representatives from the tribal subdivisions of Darra Adam Khel and Hassan Khel.
It added that 150 tribal elders from the aforementioned areas, six MPAs, three MNAs and one senator participated in the jirga.
 






The statement added that the CM’s adviser on information, the KP chief secretary, inspector general of police and commissioners and deputy commissioners were also present in the jirga.
The statement listed down the recommendations made by the jirga, such as ensuring unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”.
“Development is linked to peace and it will accelerate when peace is restored,” the statement said. “No one has asked for any resources of the province, including minerals, nor has it been given to anyone, nor will it be given to anyone.
“Tribal elders have recommended to the federal government that arrangements should be made to send a jirga of the provincial government and tribal elders for negotiations with Afghanistan,” the statement added.
The statement said that the jirga should receive resources and cooperation to achieve this, adding that the next regional jirga would be held in the Mohmand and Bajaur districts. A third jirga would be held in North and South Waziristan, while the fourth would be convened in Kurram district.
No dates were given for the jirgas in this statement.
“Immediately after the regional jirgas, a grand jirga will be held under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister,” the statement added.</p><small>2025-08-02 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02224129513b81e.png?r=224333' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928297/karachi-police-book-8-suspects-under-terror-murder-charges-for-gunning-down-senior-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Police book 8 suspects under terror, murder charges for gunning down senior lawyer</strong></a><br><p>The Darakshan Police on Saturday registered a case against eight nominated suspects under terrorism and murder charges for killing senior lawyer Khawaja Shamsul Islam and critically injuring his young son inside a mosque in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority a day prior.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza had told Dawn.com on Friday that the firing took place after prayers at a mosque in DHA Phase 6. “As advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam and his son [Khawaja Daniyal, 25] were about to leave the mosque, a lone gunman apparently resorted to firing on them and fled,” the DIG had said.
The Darakshan Police registered a first information report (FIR) today upon the complaint of the victim’s brother and under Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment), 302 (premeditated murder) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
“My brother Khawaja Shamsul Islam, along with his two young sons and two guards had gone to offer Friday prayers and attend funeral prayers at the Quran Academy mosque located on Khayaban-i-Rahat, Phase 6,” the FIR read.
“He was picking up his slippers at the staircase of the mosque when [the suspect] fired two shots at around 2:30pm. As a result, one bullet hit my brother and another hit his son. The suspect managed to escape while taking advantage of the rush.”
The complainant added that the victim’s younger son was unharmed in the incident and took his injured father to a private hospital in Clifton, while unidentified persons took the injured son to another private hospital in the same locale.
“Khawaja Shamsul Islam expired during treatment while his son was admitted with critical injuries,” the FIR added.
The complainant alleged that the primary suspect, along with 15-20 accomplices, attacked the lawyer last November, in which he was shot twice and tortured. The case was registered with Clifton police under terror and other charges.
“Now, the suspect, his two brothers and five other suspects attacked together … resulting in the death of the lawyer and serious injuries to his son,” the complainant stated, adding that the incident also triggered fear and chaos among the general public.
The complainant said he wanted legal proceedings against the nominated suspects over terrorism, murder charges and criminal conspiracy.
DIG Raza also told Dawn.com, “The prime suspect has confessed to the crime in a recorded video message.”
On Friday, the DIG constituted a special team under the supervision of the South senior superintendent of police to arrest the suspects who murdered the advocate and injured his son.
He had added that the prime suspect was the son of a police constable deployed for Islam’s security in the past, as witnesses heard him saying that he had taken “revenge” for the murder of his father.
In a statement issued yesterday, the Karachi Bar Association condemned the murder of Islam and announced that its members would not appear before any court today to express solidarity with the slain senior lawyer.</p><small>2025-08-02 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02225241975f13f.jpg?r=225258' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928298/police-arrest-suspect-for-allegedly-killing-female-cousin-over-honour-in-kps-shangla' target='_blank'><strong>Police arrest suspect for allegedly killing female cousin over ‘honour’ in KP’s Shangla</strong></a><br><p>The police arrested a suspect on Saturday for allegedly killing his female cousin over ‘honour’ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district.
Bisham Station House Officer Syed Khurshid Ali told Dawn.com the incident occurred in the Bobai area of Bisham tehsil on Friday. The first information report of the incident was filed at the Bisham Police Station on the complaint of the victim’s father a day ago under Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The complainant said he was at home at 8pm when his daughter went out to the toilet and he soon heard gunshots, adding that upon going out, he spotted his nephew with a weapon and axing his daughter. He further said that his daughter was taking her last breaths when he reached her.
The father said his daughter had been married for three years and had a young child.
Talking to Dawn.com, SHO Syed Khurshid Ali said: “The suspect was arrested today. Initially, the FIR was lodged under Section 302, but it will later be switched to Section 311 (honour killing) as the incident was related to honour [killing].”
The SHO added: “The cousin was suspecting that the victim had gone outside to meet someone and was in an illicit relationship.”
He said an investigation was being initiated into the incident.
A couple was shot dead by the woman’s family over ‘honour’ in Balochistan’s Mastung district, police said on Wednesday.
The incident occurred over a week after the killing of a man and a woman in the Degari area of Quetta on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’. The police had subsequently arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the incident.
Last week, a man allegedly shot dead his daughter and nephew in Quetta in the name of ‘honour’, just days after the Degari case, in which a couple was gunned down in broad daylight, drawing widespread condemnation, according to the police.
On July 26, a court in Rawalpindi remanded three suspects to police custody over an alleged murder and ‘honour’ killing case of a newlywed woman.
Police had initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of ‘honour’ in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2025-08-02 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02194041e5bd2c0.jpg?r=194154' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928257/iran-president-lands-in-islamabad-for-2-day-visit-eyeing-to-boost-trade-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Iran president lands in Islamabad for 2-day visit, eyeing to boost trade ties</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian landed in Islamabad on Saturday for a two-day visit, eyeing to reaffirm his commitment to elevate annual bilateral trade with Pakistan.
Pakistan has recently expressed solidarity and a desire for cooperation with Iran, which experts say is vital to securing shared interests in a shifting geopolitical environment.
Pezeshkian is paying a two-day official visit to Pakistan over the weekend, making it his first trip to Islamabad in his current role, the Foreign Office said. Ahead of his trip, Pakistan yesterday pledged to help defuse tensions between Iran and the United States.
Dr Pezeshkian arrived at Nur Khan Air Base, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar received him.
 






PM Shehbaz said he was honoured to welcome the Iranian president and looked forward to “substantive engagements during this important visit that will pave the way forward for stronger Pakistan-Iran ties”.
 






Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visited the Foreign Office, where he met FM Dar and the two held discussions.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening Pakistan-Iran ties, with a focus on expanding cooperation in regional stability, trade, and economic collaboration. They also discussed enhancing bilateral engagement across key areas of mutual interest,” the FO said.
 






FM Dar said the two had productive discussions on all areas of mutual interest, including trade, economic cooperation, regional and international developments. “Looking forward to substantive talks at the leadership level tomorrow.”
 






The FO said both held preliminary discussions on key substantive issues to be addressed at the leadership level, including regional developments, bilateral trade and connectivity, energy cooperation, and the need to strengthen mechanisms for regular consultation and coordination.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepening the longstanding and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Iran. They also emphasised the importance of sustained dialogue, enhanced cooperation on economic and security matters, and greater people-to-people exchanges.”
 






Dr Pezeshkian arrived earlier in Lahore, where PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz received him.
 


He visited the mausoleum of Allama Iqbal to pay tribute to his legacy with CM Maryam, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb and Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari accompanying him.
President Pezeshkian laid a wreath at the grave and offered prayers, led by Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad.
The Iranian president also penned remarks in the visitors’ book, expressing admiration for Allama Iqbal’s contributions to Islamic philosophy and the Pakistan Movement.
Tight security arrangements were in place to ensure the safety of him and his delegation throughout the visit.

PM Shehbaz had met with Pezeshkian during his visit to Iran in late May, which was part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre­ssing gratitude for their support during the conflict with India.
Pezeshkian is the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. Late Ebrahim Raisi had visited the country in April last year, just a month before he died in a helicopter crash.
According to Iran’s state media IRNA, before departing for Pakistan, Pezeshkian emphasised the plan to elevate their annual trade exchanges to $10 billion. The two countries had agreed in April last year to boost trade over the next five years.
The president termed the trade relations between Tehran and Islamabad as “good” and identified boosting trade with Pakistan via land, air and sea as priorities for this trip, the report added.
“Through Pakistan, Iran can connect to the Silk Road linking China and Pakistan, and the route can then extend through Iran to Europe,” he said.
Emphasising that security and border issues were of great importance to both Iran and Pakistan, he stressed that regional security must be achieved through cooperation, according to IRNA.
 
 

Pezeshkian noted that the two neighbours have “enjoyed good, friendly, and deep-rooted relations” since Pakistan’s independence. “The two countries cooperate in economic, scientific, cultural, and border areas, and a deep bond exists between the people of both sides,” he was quoted as saying.
Pezeshkian highlighted that during the recent Israel-Iran war and the United States’ strikes against its nuclear facilities, “Pakistan was among the countries that strongly condemned this aggression and declared its readiness to provide any necessary support for Iran’s territorial integrity, as well as for the government and people of Iran”.
According to IRNA, the president also noted that “the enemy plans to create division among Muslims, but Iran will thwart the enemies’ plots”, adding that Tehran aims to maintain unity and solidarity between Iran and Pakistan.
Pezeshkian had left for Pakistan earlier today, accompanied by a high-level delegation.

In March, Mahrang and other BYC members were arrested for “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order. Last month, the Quetta ATC handed the BYC chief and other organisers of the group into police custody for 15 days.
Advocates Israr Baloch, Shoaib Baloch and Awais Zehri appeared on behalf of the BYC leadership in today’s hearing, presided over by ATC Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen. Israr told Dawn.com that Mahrang, Beebow Baloch and Gulzadi were present in court.
“Dr Mahrang and the other BYC members’ remand was approved. They were handed over to police custody for 20 days,” he said, adding that the police had requested that they be remanded for 30 days.
In a post on X, Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch slammed the extension of remand and said that not only did it violate the fundamental principles of justice, but illustrated a “highly dangerous judicial trend”.
“The court’s decision … is not merely an illegal action but also a reflection of the bitter reality that Pakistan’s judiciary, particularly in Balochistan, has been stripped of its freedom and autonomy,” she wrote.
“The court’s actions — sometimes transferring the case to the Home Department, sometimes dismissing it — are all indicative of constitutional, legal, and moral bankruptcy.”
Sammi noted that the judiciary in Balochistan did not offer justice, reflecting a mindset from the colonial era.
“It is time for the judiciary to recognise its constitutional role, fulfil its duty to protect civil liberties and fundamental rights, and distance itself from this game of oppression,” she wrote.
 






The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang was taken into custody under MPO for a period of 30 days (first term) on March 22. Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
On July 8, a Quetta ATC handed Mahrang and other activists into police custody for 10 days, extending their detention. The other activists were Gulzadi, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Ghaffar Baloch and Beberg Baloch.
While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority, Mahrang is included on its list of proscribed persons.
Constitutional petitions seeking the release of Mahrang and two other activists were rejected by the Balochistan High Court in May.</p><small>2025-08-02 17:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617025-imran-khans-sons-will-get-visas-if-applied-says-talal-chaudhry' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's sons will get visas if applied, says Talal Chaudhry</strong></a><br><p>

Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. His sons, Sulaiman Khan and Kasim Khan, have been protesting his incarceration, but uncertainty remains as to whether they will be visiting Pakistan.
A day ago, Aleema said they had applied for visas and were waiting for approval from the interior ministry. That had prompted Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry to ask why they would need visas if they had the Nicop, as she had previously said.
Clarifying the matter today while speaking to reporters at Adiala Jail, she said: “The Nicop of one [of the brothers] is missing and the other can’t find his card so they’ve submitted two applications: one to issue their Nicop, which is valid for the next six to seven years … and they have also applied for the visa which can be issued within an hour.
“It’s their choice. They have Nicop, they have British passports. So what issue do they (the interior ministry) have in issuing a visa?”
She stated that she had access to tracking numbers for the applications, challenging claims that the applications were not received.
 


Meanwhile, Chaudhry said the siblings would be treated as dual nationals if they arrived on the basis of the Nicop. “If they choose to seek consular assistance as British citizens, they are still entitled to do so regardless of whether they entered on a Visa or Nicop.”
 






Sulaiman, 28, and Kasim, 26, called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Last month, Aleema said they would go to the United States before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release. The siblings visited the US and engaged US lawmakers on the issue of their father’s incarceration.
Earlier this week, the PTI swiftly rubbished media reports claiming that the incarcerated leader told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.
Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran’s sons, Chaudhry previously questioned what, if any, role they would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them. He continued that visas would be issued to them “in less than 24 hours”, provided they stayed within the law.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had told Dawn.com that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.
Malik also said that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.
There were conflicting statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.</p><small>2025-08-02 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616997-north-waziristan-jirga-announces-support-for-army-against-fitna-al-khawarij' target='_blank'><strong>North Waziristan jirga announces support for army against Fitna al-Khawarij</strong></a><br><p>

A press release from the Prime Minister’s Office said the decision was taken to “promote tourism in the country, ensure continuity of business activities and facilitate foreign investment”.
It added that the establishment of the counters would reduce the immigration processing time at the airports.
The statement also said that Pakistanis returning to the country would be able to complete their immigration process in a shorter time after the establishment of separate and designated counters for foreigners.
“The initiative is part of a strategy to make Pakistan more attractive and friendly for global tourists, investors, and business delegations,” the PMO said.
In February, Pakistan won the Best Partner Pavilion Award at the New York Travel and Adventure Show 2025. The two-day event is the largest US travel show organised annually for travel enthusiasts from across the world.

Aamir Khan, spokesperson for the Bannu region police, told Dawn.com that the children found the mortar shell in the field and took it to their village, Sorband, thinking it was a toy.
“The shell exploded, resulting in the deaths of five children and leaving 12 others critically injured,” he said. “The deceased and injured children have been transported to Khalifa Gul Nawaz hospital,” the spokesperson said, adding that the injured children were being provided medical treatment in the emergency ward.
A statement issued by Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan said he visited the hospital to enquire about the condition of the injured.
“He checked on their condition, encouraged them and met with hospital administration to review the provision of treatment, availability of medicines, and other medical facilities in detail.”
It added that the Bomb Disposal Squad arrived at the scene, collected evidence and initiated an investigation.
According to the statement, the RPO vowed that all possible assistance would be provided to the affected families and those responsible would soon be brought to justice. RPO Khan also met with the relatives of the injured and assured them of full support.
Children playing with explosives, thinking they are toys, is not a new phenomenon.
In October 2023, a child lost his life while eight others were injured when a hand grenade exploded in the Zarchain area of Balochistan’s Wadh city.
The month before, nine people, including four children, lost their lives while a woman was injured when a “rocket launcher’s” ordnance exploded in a house in Sindh’s Kashmore district.</p><small>2025-08-02 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616982-how-pakistan-shot-down-indias-cutting-edge-fighter-jet-using-chinese-gear' target='_blank'><strong>How Pakistan shot down India's cutting-edge fighter jet using Chinese gear</strong></a><br><p>

Yunus previously pledged to unveil a “big package” to overhaul democratic institutions.
But efforts to reach agreements have made slow progress as political parties jostle for power ahead of elections, slated for early 2026.
Yunus’s government has warned that political power struggles risk jeopardising the gains that have been made.
On July 29, Yunus said he was working to “build a broad national consensus around a renewed political system — one that delivers inclusive, participatory, and credible elections”.
Yunus’s office said on Saturday that the “July Proclamation” would be “presented to the nation … in the presence of all political parties involved in the mass uprising”.
Hasina’s rule saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents.
Her government was also accused of politicising courts and the civil service, staging lopsided elections and dismantling democratic checks on its power.
Hasina, 77, fled to India, where she has defied court orders to attend her ongoing trial on charges amounting to crimes against humanity.
Protests began on July 1, 2024, with university students calling for reforms to a quota system for public sector jobs.
They culminated on August 5, 2024, when thousands of protesters stormed Hasina’s palace as she escaped by helicopter.</p><small>2025-08-02 11:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0215484549efbc8.jpg?r=161158' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928258/viral-video-of-passenger-slapping-muslim-man-on-indian-flight-sparks-social-media-outrage' target='_blank'><strong>Viral video of passenger slapping Muslim man on Indian flight sparks social media outrage</strong></a><br><p>A passenger slapping a Muslim fellow traveller on an Indian flight sparked outrage on social media when a video of the incident went viral, Indian news outlet Hindustan Times reported on Friday.
Discrimination against Muslims in India has spiked in recent months, amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of their recent military confrontation, sparked by New Delhi’s allegations levelled without evidence against Islamabad over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
According to the Hindustan Times, the passengers were on board IndiGo flight 6E138 from Mumbai to Kolkata.
“The victim appeared to be unwell and was receiving assistance from the cabin crew when another passenger suddenly slapped him without any provocation,” it reported.
The Times of India said that the victim, a Muslim man, had a panic attack, “began sobbing and walking the aisle requesting to de-board as the aircraft taxied, when another flyer struck him”.
A video clip circulating online showed the victim in visible distress after being hit. Another passenger could be heard asking, “Why did you slap him? You don’t have the right to hit anybody, do you understand?”
A crew member was also heard telling the accused, “Don’t do that.”
 






The reason behind the assault remains unknown for now, and investigations are ongoing. However, the video sparked outrage across social media, with many calling for strict action against the attacker.
The consensus across social media was that the victim had been hit because he was a “visible Muslim”, causing the conversation to turn to slamming “hate politics” and religious divides.
According to the Hindustan Times, one user on X wrote, “This isn’t society collapsing, it’s decades of hate politics finally reaching cruising altitude.”
Another commented, “What level of harassment and abuse is this? Just slapping a guy because he was a visible Muslim? What action have you taken against him? He should be behind bars and banned from travelling.”
Another comment said, “What right does that person have to hit anyone? Pathetic!”
Attacker handed over to authorities
Upon landing in Kolkata, the attacker was handed over to security personnel at the airport. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) took the individual into custody for further investigation.
IndiGo condemned the incident and confirmed that it would initiate action under unruly flyer rules, which may include a temporary no-fly ban. The airline emphasised its commitment to passenger safety and respectful conduct on all flights.
The airline declared the individual as “unruly” and stated that relevant aviation security agencies had been informed in line with protocol.
IndiGo said in a post on X, “Such unruly behaviour is completely unacceptable, and we strongly condemn any actions that compromise the safety and dignity of our passengers and crew.”
The airline added, “We remain committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment on all our flights.”
 






In May, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), which is based in New Delhi, reported 184 hate crimes targeted at Muslims all over India between April 27 and May 8 in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report.
The White House, India’s Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump on Wednesday imposed a 25 per cent tariff on goods imported from India starting August 1 along with additional penalties, potentially straining relations with the world’s most populous democracy.
Trump indicated in a Truth Social post that India would face additional penalties for the purchase of Russian arms and oil. However, he later said that he did not care what India does with Russia.
 


On Friday, Trump told reporters that he had heard that India would no longer be buying oil from Russia.
 
 

Two senior Indian officials said there had been no change in policy, according to the NYT report, which added that one official said the government had “not given any direction to oil companies” to cut back imports from Russia.
Reuters had earlier reported that Indian state refiners stopped buying Russian oil in the past week as discounts narrowed in July.
On July 14, Trump threatened 100pc tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil unless Moscow reaches a major peace deal with Ukraine. Russia is the top supplier to India, responsible for about 35pc of India’s overall supplies.
On Monday, Trump said most partners that do not negotiate separate trade deals would soon face tariffs of 15-20pc on their exports to the US, well above the broad 10pc tariff he imposed in April. His administration will notify some 200 countries soon of their new “world tariff” rate.</p><small>2025-08-02 10:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616960-imran-khans-sons-have-applied-for-nicop-as-well-aleema-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's sons have applied for NICOP as well: Aleema Khan</strong></a><br><p>

The Pakistani government has lately seemed willing to fast-track the adoption of crypto currencies for banks, foreign exchange comp­anies and gold trading. In March, the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was launched, which was a government-backed initiative to regulate, foster, and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency innovations into the country’s financial and economic framework.
“A high-level video conference was held between Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain Bilal bin Saqib and Director of the National Investment Agency of Kyrgyzstan Farukht Aminov,” acccording to PTV.
“Both sides emphasised the development of virtual assets, technology exchange, and cooperation in regulatory frameworks,” it added.
The Kyrgyz director highlighted the importance of exchanging information, experiences and best global practices.
Bilal bin Saqib said Kyrgyzstan can become a key partner in innovation and regulation in digital assets. He described Pak-Kyrgyz relations as a strong foundation in the digital economy of the future.
The two countries also discussed the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for formal cooperation in the crypto sector. The participants expressed their commitment to continue bilateral cooperation for the establishment of a secure, transparent and modern digital economy.
The participants of the video conference also agreed that there is a need for regional partnerships to promote blockchain and digital finance in Central and South Asia.
In July, President  Asif Ali Zardari had approved the “Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025” to establish an independent regulator for virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin pioneer Michael Saylor has also previously lauded Pakistan’s efforts to move towards cryptocurrency and digital assets.</p><small>2025-08-02 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0214003519122ed.png?r=140429' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928116/over-20-brands-of-drinking-water-unsafe-for-human-consumption' target='_blank'><strong>Over 20 brands of drinking water unsafe for human consumption</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Council for Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) on Friday declared 23 brands unsafe for human consumption due to microbiological or chemical contamination.
The government of Pakistan had tasked PCRWR with monitoring bottled/mineral water brands on quarterly basis and publicize the results for awareness of public health.
For the second quarter of year 2025 from April to June, 203 samples of mineral/bottled water brands were collected from 21 major cities. Comparison of test results with the bottled water quality standards of Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA) had revealed that 23 brands were unsafe for human consumption due to microbiological or chemical contamination.
Eleven brands such as New Mehran, Aqua 111, Nice Pure Max, Pure Drinking Water, Logic, Himalya Cool, Natural Pure Life, Natural, Forever Bottled Drinking Water, Drinkly Pure Drinking Water, Qudrat Water were found to be unsafe due to the presence of higher levels of sodium.
Four brands — Atco Drinking Water, Aqua nest, Pani, New Mountain — were found to be unsafe due to the presence of higher levels of arsenic.
 
 

One brand labelled Vey Forever was found unsafe due to the presence of a high level of potassium than the permissible limit.
Nine other brands, such as Noble Pure Drinking Water, Aqua 111, Clear, Wah Water, Nice Pure Max, Aqua King bottled water, Maa jee, Freshin drinking water and Iceland, were found contaminated with bacteria and thus were unsafe for drinking purposes.
PCRWR said that the general public was encouraged to look at the detailed report to know about the status of water quality of bottled water brands they consume.

Floods swept across GB last week, causing landslides, leaving many stranded, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure. So far, 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said today that a search operation on Babusar Highway is under way during which many vehicles that were swept away by the floods have been recovered.
“The vehicles were found but we found no clue as to the missing persons,” he said in a statement.
Faraq continued that rehabilitation work has been accelerated in the flood-affected areas.
He said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would be visiting GB in two or three days. “Hopefully, the prime minister’s visit will provide relief to the injured victims.”
PM Shehbaz yesterday expressed his aim to visit GB in solidarity with the affected people. He reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in the flood-hit areas in a high-level meeting that focused on immediate relief efforts, future disaster preparedness and federal assistance to the affected regions.
 






“Water and electricity have been restored in many areas of the region,” the spokesperson said, adding that communication systems on Babusar Highway and other places have also been restored.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
Yesterday, a glacier burst in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Bagrot Valley caused the death of one person when a father and son fell into a ravine and were buried under the debris of the glacier.
More cloudburst-induced floods hit the Ghizer and Hunza districts on Thursday.
Last week, at least four tourists were killed, two others injured and 15 went missing after floods triggered by heavy rain swept through GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district.</p><small>2025-08-02 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02131046d5c0f03.png?r=132544' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928249/spacex-crew-dragon-docks-with-international-space-station' target='_blank'><strong>SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with International Space Station</strong></a><br><p>An international team of four astronauts aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule docked on Saturday with the orbiting International Space Station (ISS).
“Docking confirmed!”, SpaceX posted on social media, along with a video showing the spacecraft making contact with the ISS at 2:27am Eastern Time (11:27am PKT), far above the southeast Pacific Ocean.
American astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan’s Kimiya Yui, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Platonov are joining the ISS on a six-month mission.
They lifted off on Friday morning from Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, their capsule mounted on a Falcon 9 rocket.
It is the 11th crew rotation mission to the ISS under Nasa’s Commercial Crew Programme, created to succeed the Space Shuttle era by partnering with private industry.
 






 






“We have cold drinks, hot food, and us waiting — see you soon,” the ISS crew told the new arrivals shortly after contact, according to the posted video.
“Hello Space Station — Crew 11 is here and we are super excited to join,” Fincke replied.
As part of their stay, the Crew-11 astronauts will simulate moon landing scenarios that could be encountered near the lunar South Pole under the US-led Artemis programme.
Using handheld controllers and multiple display screens, they will test how shifts in gravity affect astronauts’ ability to pilot spacecraft, including future lunar landers.
 
 

Continuously inhabited since 2000, the ISS functions as a testbed for research that supports deeper space exploration — including eventual missions to Mars.
Among Crew-11’s more colourful cargo items are Armenian pomegranate seeds, which will be compared to a control batch kept on Earth to study how microgravity influences crop growth.
The ISS is set to be decommissioned after 2030, with its orbit gradually lowered until it breaks up in the atmosphere over a remote part of the Pacific Ocean called Point Nemo, a spacecraft graveyard.</p><small>2025-08-02 08:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616953-allegations-of-military-control-over-kp-minerals-baseless' target='_blank'><strong>Allegations of military control over KP minerals baseless</strong></a><br><p>

The Aviation Industry Corporation of China had displayed its Z-10 attack helicopter for the first time outside its home country at the Singapore Airshow in February 2024, according to Reuters. It also noted that as of then, the model had Pakistan as the only known export customer, but no sales had been announced at the air show.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir presided over the induction ceremony and later witnessed a firepower demonstration by the “newly inducted Z-10ME helicopters” at the Muzaffargarh Field Firing Ranges, the ISPR said in a press release, without specifying the number of the craft acquired.
“The induction of this potent system marks a major leap in the modernisation of Army Aviation, reinforcing its integrated battlefield response and capacity to deliver decisive effects against potential adversaries,” the military’s media affairs wing noted.
 


In 2021, Defense News reported that China sent three of its Z-10 helicopter gunships for trials in Pakistan, but they failed to sufficiently impress officials and were returned.
However, former Australian defence attaché to Islamabad, Brian Cloughley, had said it was “likely that the Pakistan Army will evaluate the Chinese Z-10ME attack helicopter”.
The ISPR highlighted: “This state-of-the-art, all-weather platform is capable of precision strike operations day and night.
“Equipped with advanced radar systems and cutting-edge electronic warfare suites, the Z-10ME significantly enhances the army’s capability to engage diverse aerial and ground threats.”
Interacting with troops at the Muzaffargarh firing ranges, COAS Munir lauded their exceptional morale, professionalism, and combat proficiency.
He appreciated the “successful demonstration of combined arms tactics, reflecting the army’s firm resolve to maintain a decisive edge in the evolving character of warfare”.
Separately, Field Marshal Munir stressed the importance of national unity and civil-military synergy in countering “hybrid threats”.
 
 

He made the remarks as he engaged with members of academia and civil society during an interactive session, following his visit to Multan Garrison.
“He underscored the significance of national unity, civil-military synergy and a whole-of-nation approach in countering hybrid threats and fostering societal cohesion,” the ISPR statement read.
At the garrison, COAS Munir was briefed on the formation’s operational preparedness and ongoing training activities, the report added. He reaffirmed the army’s “unwavering commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
The army chief expressed satisfaction over the high standards of readiness.</p><small>2025-08-02 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02124840d5d865c.png?r=124939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928166/transport-dept-is-not-responsible-for-red-line-delays-sindh-assembly-told' target='_blank'><strong>Transport dept is not responsible for Red Line delays, Sindh Assembly told</strong></a><br><p>• Sharjeel terms relocating utility connections a major challenge in construction
• Says govt aims to digitise entire transport department by 2026
KARACHI: Replying to lawmakers’ written and verbal queries during the Question Hour in the Sindh Assembly, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon informed the house on Friday that the provincial transport department was not responsible for delays in completion of the much-awaited Red Line-Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project.
Mr Memon, who also holds the portfolios of transport and information department, said every aspect of the Red Line project was being monitored by local experts and international consultants.
He said that work was underway on major development schemes in the city, and progress was being made rapidly on two sections of the Yellow Line BRT with a bridge expected to be completed by August.
In reply to a verbal question raised by Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan Dr Fouzia Hameed, the minister acknowledged that occasional delays might occur due to technical or administrative issues, but overall, the work was progressing smoothly. He stated that relocating utility connections was always a major challenge.
 
 

“Several stages had to be completed to remove the gas line from the Yellow Line BRT route, and at times, unexpected issues also arise,” he added.
Highlighting the provincial government’s efforts to provide top-notch travel facilities to the people of the provincial, the senior minister said that the Peoples Bus Service, which currently transported 110,000 passengers daily, was a testament to this commitment.
“The government plans to introduce more buses to tackle the long-standing transportation issue in the province, including Karachi,” he added.
He said that Pakistan’s first EV-buses had been introduced by the Sindh government and added that EV-scooters would be provided to women free of cost by the end of August.
Responding to another question, he said that the provincial government aimed to digitise the entire transport department by 2026.
“Route permits have already been digitised, ensuring a more efficient and transparent system,” he added.
Replying to a call attention notice by Dr Fouzia Hameed on illegal constructions in the city, Qasim Siraj Soomro said that action had been taken against those involved and the government was working to curb illegal constructions.
Call for separate educational board for Christians
In his call attention notice, minority member Mahesh Kumar said that the subject of ethics had been given to minority children in the textbooks.
“The subject of ethics should be for everyone,” he said and asked the provincial government to replace the subject of ethics with religious studies in the educational institutions.
He also demanded the creation of a separate educational board for the Christian community.
Education Minister Sardar Shah, while responding to the notice, said that a single curriculum was brought during the PTI era, which the Sindh government had opposed.
 
 

He said that at that time Muslim children were being taught Islamiat and non-Muslims were taught ethics. “We reviewed the curriculum in 2022 and work was in progress for replacing the subject of ethics with religious studies.”
In response to a notice from MQM-P’s Najam Mirza regarding admissions of children through the Centralised Admission Policy (CAP), the education minister said that the CAP had been extended to the entire province and admissions were automatically done by computer without any human intervention.
He said that preference was given to A1 grade and A grade in admissions.
The assembly session, chaired by Speaker Owais Qadir Shah, witnessed a unique display of Independence Day spirit, with women members wearing green and white dresses. Later, Speaker Syed Awais Qadir Shah adjourned the house to Monday.

Former chairman of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM), Aamir Allawala, raised concerns during a media briefing at various vending units, stating that used vehicles already account for 25pc of the market — over 40,000 units annually. In contrast, used car market share stands at zero in India, 0.3pc in Vietnam, and 1.2pc in Thailand, he noted.
Allawala said import duties on completely built-up (CBU) units in Pakistan range from 50–100pc, compared to 125pc in India, 52pc in Vietnam, and 80pc in Thailand. The negligible used car imports in these countries are the result of both tariff and administrative measures, he added.
He asserted that used vehicles, as a category, now form the second-largest segment of Pakistan’s car market, trailing only Suzuki, and have overtaken the collective sales of Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Haval, MG, and Changan.
 
 

Highlighting a lack of transparency, Allawala said that imports and sales of used vehicles remain undocumented. “Remittances for imports are routed via hawala, while local sales are largely cash-based, bypassing formal channels,” he said. This informal trade, he warned, severely undermines local assemblers and vendors who rely on documented transactions and taxation compliance.
Based on an average value of Rs4 million per unit, the influx of used cars represents an annual volume of Rs160bn, he said. He estimated that this diverts about Rs60bn in potential revenue away from local auto parts manufacturers — given an average of Rs1.5 million in locally made parts per new vehicle — and could result in the loss of around 40,000 jobs in assembly and vending units.
“If imports are liberalised, global automakers operating in Pakistan may shift to importing completely built units, both new and used, while local parts vendors will be left without a market and forced to shut down,” he warned.
Referring to the Auto Policy 2016–21, he said 10 new entrants joined the market under favourable incentives, including a 50pc duty concession on already localised parts. This brought the total number of assemblers to 13.
However, vendors have suffered as these entrants have achieved minimal localisation. “One such assembler earned Rs36bn profit in FY25 without any localisation,” he claimed, adding that the assembler’s output surpasses that of the established players.
PAAPAM’s Senior Vice Chairman, Shehryar Qadir, urged the government to adopt models followed by Thailand and Vietnam to develop the vendor base and maximise export potential.
Senate panel backs auto sector
Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Industries and Production, Senator Aon Abbas, reaffirmed the government’s commitment to strengthening domestic manufacturing and promoting high-value investment in the auto sector.
During a visit to Indus Motor Company (IMC) on Friday, accompanied by other committee members, Senator Abbas underscored the critical role of the local automotive industry in driving industrial growth and generating employment.
CEO of IMC, Ali Asghar Jamali, expressed concern over the underutilisation of the industry’s production capacity, noting that more than 64pc remains idle despite substantial investments by leading global automotive brands.

“The US Consulate General Karachi received a report of a threat directed at high-end hotels in Karachi,” the department said in a security alert.
“The US Consulate General in Karachi has temporarily limited visits by official US government personnel to these hotels.”
The State Department said it sometimes declares areas in foreign countries, such as tourist attractions, hotels, markets, shopping malls and restaurants, off-limits to official US government personnel in response to such threats.
The security alert urges people to avoid the areas and crowds, keep a low profile and to stay alert in places frequented by tourists and citizens of Western countries.
The State Department currently has a travel advisory in place for Pakistan that advises US citizens to reconsider travelling there due to the risk of terrorism and the potential for armed conflict.
Britain’s foreign ministry on Friday also advised against all but essential travel to parts of Pakistan.

The protest on the Karakoram Highway has halted all Pakistan-China trade and travel through the border crossing, leaving thousands of people, including Chinese nationals and foreign tourists, stranded in the area.
Protesters, who have gained the support of local political, youth and religious parties, argue that the region’s disputed constitutional status exempts it from federal taxation.
“The federal government is reluctant to solve the genuine demands of local people,” said Mohammad Ishaq, one of the protest organisers.

Protesters argue that federal taxes are illegal due to region’s disputed status

“They are just demanding how federal taxes can be collected from the people who are not constitutional citizens of Pakistan and the region is a disputed status area.”
 
 

He added that protesting traders would not back down from their “principle stance of “No taxation without representation”.
The tax dispute has paralysed the local economy for the last eight months, rendering thousands jobless, including transporters, hotel owners, shopkeepers and customs agents.
Ayub Waziri, a member of the GB Assembly, said the issue extends beyond the trading community.
“This is an issue of the GB people,” Waziri said, explaining that because the region is not constitutionally part of Pakistan, all federal taxes imposed there are illegal.
Mr Waziri said that during the last year negotiations, officials from the Federal Board of Revenue had admitted that GB falls in a “non-tariff zone”.
He said the federal government has since formed a committee to resolve the issue and that the GB government is acting as a mediator.
The protest movement intensified on Friday as hundreds of people in rallies from multiple areas joined the blockade to show solidarity.
“The protest movement has awakened GB people for their rights,” said Moulana Sharfuddin, a leader of Tanzeem Ahl-i-Sunnat wal Jamat, GB, expressing his support.
Protesters claim the standoff has left them victims of federal policies.
 
 

Ahmed Nabi, a protester, told Dawn that billions of rupees worth of items imported through the Sost Dry Port have been held up for the last month.
He said many items have expired, while others stored in the open have been damaged by rain because Pakistan Customs officials are not clearing local consignments.
Javed Hussain, another organiser, alleged that speedy clearance of goods is “allowed to only a handful of people”.
“The economic exploitation of local people will never be accepted,” he said.

According to FIR registered with Jaglot Police Station, Javed Iqbal, his wife and children were washing clothes on a river near their home when two men, Afsar Khan and Dar Khan, reached there and allegedly shot Javed Iqbal dead.
The two accused, after killing Javed Iqbal, also killed a married woman in the name of honour.

HRCP denounces second such incident in Tangir area within a week

In the same area on July 21, a man Bareem from Frori village, allegedly shot dead his wife, the mother of four children, and another man in the name of honour.
 
 

The incident sparked protest over social media by rights and civil society activists.
Local community leaders and activists of political parties also condemned these killings and called for immediate, transparent investigation into these incidents. They also demanded effective measures to prevent further honour-related killing in GB.
In a statement issued here, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the brutal ‘honour’ killing of Awami Action Committee vice chairman Javed Iqbal and a married woman in the area.
 






The HRCP said that Javed Iqbal was murdered in the presence of his mother and wife which also shows the barbarity of the act.
“This marks the second such incident in Tangir within a week in which two women and two men were killed in the name of honour.
“We demand an immediate and transparent investigation, swift prosecution of the perpetrators and urgent action to dismantle the culture of impunity surrounding honour-based violence in Gilgit-Baltistan,” the HRCP said.

Judge Muhammad Naeem Sheikh dir­ected the Mianwali police chief to ensure the arrest all 51 fugitives of law within a month and produce them in the court.
The ATC in Sargodha handed down a rigorous life sentence to Mr Ismail for his role in the May 9, 2023 riots, which saw attacks on a judicial complex and other government installations in Mianwali.
The verdict, delivered by Judge Muhammad Naeem Sheikh, also declared 50 other PTI leaders and workers as proclaimed offenders.

Warrants out for arrest of 18 party leaders in Nov 26 protests case

Among those named as fugitives are prominent figures such as former Punjab opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar and sitting MNAs Ahmad Chatha and Bilal Ijaz.
Omar Ayub, the opposition leader in the National Assembly, had previously been declared a fugitive by the court.
Three cases were registered at City Police Station Mianwali against hundreds of PTI leaders and workers for rioting, attacking a Pakistan Air Force base, and damaging public property, including setting fire to court records.
Most parliamentarians and workers were nominated in the FIRs months after the incidents.
Malik Shafqat Abbas Awan, a PTI MNA and counsel for one of the accused, condemned the judgment, calling it “a black spot on the face of the judiciary.”
He noted that Ismail and others had previously been acquitted in two related cases, and accused the court of relying on evidence that had already been rejected.
According to the court’s order, Ismail was convicted under multiple sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act, receiving three life terms, a collective 15 years of rigorous imprisonment, and fines totaling over Rs3.5 million. The court also ordered the forfeiture of his property.
Warrants out for 18 PTI leaders
Separately, an ATC in Rawalpindi issued arrest warrants for 18 senior PTI leaders in a case linked to the Wah Cantt protest on Nov 26, 2024.
Those named include Khyber Pakh­tu­nkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Ganda­pur; Aleema Khan, the sister of jailed ex-premier Imran Khan; former provincial minister Ijaz Khan Jazi; former federal minister Sheikh Waqas Akram; and former MNA Kanwal Shozab.
The court ordered police to apprehend the accused and present them on Aug 8, also summoning the investigating officer with the complete case record.
 
 

Prosecutors told the court that the accused were “deliberately evading arrest and ignoring repeated court summons, thereby obstructing the
legal proceedings.”
Prosecutor Zaheer Abbas argued that the accused’s continued absence was “affecting the judicial process and undermining the rule of law.”
The court also took up an application seeking cancellation of bail for 68 accused in a related case, issuing notices to their sureties and adjourning proceedings until August 5.
The ATC warned that legal action would be taken not only against absconding individuals but also against those who provided bail sureties if the accused fail to appear.

“We have received directives from the home department to launch a fresh drive to repatriate all Afghans… in a respectful and orderly manner,” Meharullah, a senior government official in Quetta, the capital of Balo­chistan province, told AFP.
On Friday, there were “around 4,000 to 5,000 people at the Chaman border” waiting to return, said Habib Bingalzai, a senior government official in Chaman.
Abdul Latif Hakimi, the head of Refugee Registration in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province across the border, said they were aware of an increase in returning Afghans on Friday.
 
 

Millions of Afghans have poured into Pakistan over the past several decades, fleeing successive wars, as well as hundreds of thousands who arrived after the return of the Tali­ban government in 2021.
A deportation drive first launched in 2023 was renewed in April when the government rescinded hun­dreds of thousands of residence permits for Afghans, warning them of arrests if they did not leave.
Analysts say the expulsions are designed to pressure the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan to control militancy in the border regions.
In total, more than a million Afghans have left Paki­stan since 2023, incl­uding more than 200,000 since April this year.
The campaign targeted the more than 800,000 Afghans with temporary residence permits, some of whom were born in Pakistan or have lived here for decades.
However, many Pakistanis have grown weary of hosting a large Afghan population as security and economic woes deepen, with the result that the deportation drive has widespread support.
Pakistan’s security forces are under enormous pressure along the border with Afgh­anistan, battling a growing insurgency in parts of Khy­ber Pakh­tunkhwa and Balochistan.
Last year, Pakistan recorded the highest number of deaths from attacks in a decade and the government frequently accuses Afghan nationals of taking part in attacks.
Iran has launched a similar large-scale deportation campaign of Afghans, which has seen more than 1.5 million sent back across the border.

• Elders assure army, FC of full support for anti-militancy efforts
BAJAUR / NORTH WAZIRISTAN: A complete curfew was imposed across North Waziristan in view of the security situation, while a peace jirga tried to prevail upon local militant leaders to leave Bajaur.
The moves were part of efforts to restore peace to these merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which have witnessed a spike in militant activity of late, especially along the border with Afghanistan.
On Friday, a peace march was held in the Shewa tehsil of North Waziristan district against the deteriorating law and order situation in the area.
Tribal elders, representatives of all political parties, the Utmanzai Jirga, Youth of Kabul Khel, and activists of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) attended the gathering.
Addressing the participants, Utmanzai jirga spok­esman Mufti Baitullah and other speakers expressed concern over rising lawlessness across the district.
 
 

The speakers emphasised that people were living in constant fear, primarily due to the re-emergence of militant elements and poor government strategies, and called upon state institutions to ensure immediate and sustainable peace in the region.
Following the imposition of curfew in the area, the district administration has advised people to stay indoors and avoid travelling on roads.
Jirga efforts
In Bajaur, where ‘Opera­tion Sarbakaf’ was laun­c­hed earlier this week to clear the area of militants, a peace Jirga met local militant leaders to convince them to return to Afghanistan.
But sources said that the local leadership of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have sought another day’s time to consult with their leaders in Afghanistan.
 
 

The meeting, held at a mosque in the Lar Kalan area of Lowi Mamund teh­sil, was attended by a 50-member delegation of the Bajaur Peace Commi­ttee and a group of TTP leaders.
Sources said that Jirga members, led by Sahibzada Haroon Rashid and consisting of local PTI MPAs Dr. Hamidur Rehman, Anwar Zeb Khan, and former PTI MNA Gul Zafar Khan — among others — presented a two-point agenda to the TTP leaders.
The delegation asked the militants to either return to Afghanistan, or go into the mountains rather than staying among the local population, as their presence posed a serious threat to locals, Dr Khailur Rehman, a PTI senior leader who was also a part of the delegation, told Dawn.
He said that the TTP leaders had sought time until noon on Saturday to respond to the Jirga’s demands.
Sahibzada Haroon Rashid also confirmed this, telling reporters after the meeting that the next round of talks would be held today (Saturday).
The meeting with militant leaders followed a similar engagement in Khyber’s Tirah valley, where a Jirga from the Bar Qambarkhel tribe had called upon TTP commanders to quit the area.
That meeting had also had a similar outcome — with the militants seeking time to consult their leadership in Afghanistan.
Bajaur scouts
A separate Jirga held at the Bajaur Scouts headquarters in Khar, said the peace-loving people of Bajaur stand shoulder to shoulder with the Pakistan Army and Frontier Corps to restore peace in the region.
According to the statement issued by the Bajaur Scouts, local lawmakers and senior officials of the security forces, district administration, and police were also in attendance in the jirga, which aimed to finalise a result-oriented strategy to establish durable peace and stability in the district.
Addressing the participants, Frontier Corps (North) Inspector General Major General Rao Imran Sirtaj said that anti-terrorism operations are aimed at establishing long-lasting peace and normalcy in the district, with the goal of enabling the people of the region to live in a peaceful environment conducive to progress and prosperity.

In a detailed report released by the Senate Secretariat, the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs “uncovered significant concerns” regarding NXCC’s (one of the contractors) prior disqualification, arbitration conflicts, payment discrepancies, document manipulation, and collusive bidding practices.
The meeting presided over by Senator Saifullah Abro discussed serious allegations of irregularities, collusive practices, and potential corruption in the awarding of contracts for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Tranche-III corridor project by the NHA.
 






The panel chief said contracts were initially awarded based on auditor sheets without verifying the credentials of M/s Dynamic Constructors, M/s Rustam Associates, and M/s Ningxia Commun-ications Construction Co., Ltd (NXCC).

Senate panel finds ‘collusive bidding, conflicts of interest, manipulation of documents’ in road projects

“The committee maintained that M/s NXCC is a non-performing firm and is currently involved in litigation related to the Multan-Lodhran project”, the report said. “Surprisingly, NHA proposed Mr. Zafar Hussain Siddiqui as an arbitrator, despite his past association with the first lowest bidders M/s Dynamic Constructors and M/s Rustam Associates construction companies”, it added.
Mr Abro presented a money trail with bank statement that “clearly indicated Zafar Hussain Siddiqui’s prior affiliation with the JV partners of M/s NXCC”. However, NHA officials said that it had no prior knowledge of the arbitrator’s connection with either party.
 
 

After thorough discussion, the chairman of the committee recommended that NHA file a petition in the Supreme Court against the award, as the circumstances strongly suggest official malafide intent to clear M/s NXCC from litigation and non-performance issues, ultimately facilitating the award of the ADB CAREC Tranche-III (Rajanpur-D.G. Khan-D.I. Khan) Project.
“The secretary of Ministry of Communications also questioned the concerned NHA officials on how such a situation was allowed to develop,” the report said.
Mr Abro told the committee NHA had submitted incomplete papers. They submitted only the auditor reports of M/s Dynamic Constructors and M/s Rustam Associates, he siad. He alleged the auditor reports prepared by A.B.M & Co. reflected irregularities and signs of collusive practices in ADB CAREC Tranche-III project.
The panel also held a detailed discussion on the Gilgit- Shandur Joint Venture Motorway Project. It noted, according to the auditor’s statement, there were several irregularities and signs of collusive practices in the project. In the Gilgit-Shandur project, M/s Dynamic Constructors and M/s Rustam Associates are partnered in JV with M/s NXCC and NLC serving as the lead partner.
“Surprisingly, the record showed that contractors received payments exceeding their quoted share which was evident from the payment details.” The committee also noted clear signs of document manipulation.
In several cases, the recorded payments were higher than the amounts mentioned in the corresponding work orders“, said the report, adding the panel expressed serious concern over the lack of verification within the NHA, especially for such a large-scale project.
The committee was shocked to learn that contractors had claimed experience and submitted payment documents for work done with FWO, HSSR, and various building and real estate companies.
Referring to the “Hanzol Hydropower Project,” he revealed that the work order was issued on May 7, 2024, and the work completed on May 7, 2025. However, the bid documents for the project were submitted in September 2024 and the same project was included in the audit reports for the financial year 2023–24.
