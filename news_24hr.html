Established in 1971, USC was a state-owned enterprise tasked with supplying essential commodities at subsidised rates, primarily targeting low-income households, and operated over 4,000 retail outlets nationwide. It formally ceased operations at the end of July.
A press release by the government’s finance division today said that the grant represented a “major step in responsibly addressing the longstanding financial burden of USC on the national exchequer”, adding that it also safeguarded the interests of employees affected by the closure.
“By approving severance, compensation and payment of outstanding dues, the government is ensuring that workers receive their entitlements, thereby cushioning the social and economic impact of USC’s winding up,” the press release said.
The committee was chaired by the finance minister, Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb.
Also in attendance were Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan, Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari in virtual attendance, and the special assistant to the Prime Minister for industries and production, Haroon Akhtar Khan, as well as federal secretaries and senior officials from concerned ministries, departments and regulatory institutions.
According to the release, the ECC decided that the Ministry of Industries and Production would further rationalise the financial requirements for the closure of USC.
 
 

“It was further decided that the assets of USC, including properties, shall be disposed of within the current financial year so that the costs of closure are partially met through sale proceeds,” it added.
The cabinet body also underlined the importance of carrying out the closure in an “orderly and transparent manner”, including partially meeting liabilities via the disposal of USC properties.
“The approved financial package underscores the government’s commitment to protecting employees’ welfare while ensuring fiscal discipline in the winding down of USC’s operations,” it said.
Earlier this week, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatisation was informed that the government would ensure the payment of Rs27 billion in dues to USC’s employees and vendors in two phases following its closure, which put 11,000 jobs on the line.
Last week, the Public Accounts Committee urged the government to strengthen the management and controls of USC instead of shutting it down, warning that such a move would render thousands jobless.</p><small>2025-08-28 12:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620791-pm-stresses-urgent-need-for-new-water-storage-infrastructure-to-keep-floods-at-bay' target='_blank'><strong>PM stresses urgent need for water storage infrastructure to keep floods at bay</strong></a><br><p>

The 2026 final will be played at the Puskas Arena on Saturday, May 30.
“An earlier kick-off makes day trips more feasible, reduces travel stress, and allows fans to enjoy the occasion without worrying about late-night logistics,” said Ronan Evain, executive director for Football Supporters Europe, which worked on the subject with UEFA.
 






Unlike the Europa League and Conference League finals, which are played in midweek, the Champions League showpiece has been held on Saturdays since 2010.
“While a 21:00 CET kick-off is well suited for midweek matches, an earlier kick-off on a Saturday for the final means an earlier finish — regardless of extra time or penalties,” said UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin.
Paris Saint-Germain won their maiden European Cup in last season’s final, beating Inter Milan 5-0 in Munich.</p><small>2025-08-28 11:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/28152532faa2ed2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937892/imrans-nephew-shershah-sent-to-lahore-jail-on-judicial-remand-as-police-denied-custody' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s nephew Shershah sent to Lahore jail on judicial remand as police denied custody</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Wednesday sent PTI founder Imran Khan’s nephew Shershah Khan to jail on judicial remand in a case pertaining to the Jinnah House attack during the May 9, 2023 riots.
The Lahore Police arrested Shershah, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from outside his home on August 22. His brother Shahrez Khan, who was picked up the day before, was also handed over to police custody for eight days over the same allegations.
Lahore police presented Shershah before the court of ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill today upon the completion of his five-day physical remand.
Advocate Rana Mudassar Umer, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, and Barrister Taimur Malik appeared as Shershah’s counsel, while Imtiaz Ahmad Sipra was the prosecutor.
Aleema, along with her sisters Uzma Khan and Noreen, appeared in the court, while Shershah was presented amid tight security.
 
 

The prosecution sought a 30-day physical remand, while the defence counsel requested that the suspect be discharged from the case. Judge Gill, rejecting the police request, sent Shershah on judicial remand.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Shershah’s photogrammetry test was conducted, and a “wooden danda (baton)” was recovered from his possession. “Sufficient investigation stands concluded,” it said.
Judge Gill noted: “So far as investigation into the extent of social media accounts is concerned, in the present era of technology as well as digital devices, social media accounts of each and every person could be easily traced and recovered without the support of the accused.
“This court is of the further view that there is no sufficient ground available for further physical remand,” he added.
The judge ordered that Shershah be produced before the court on September 11 and directed the investigation officer to submit the charge sheet by then.
At the outset of the hearing, state prosecutor Sipra informed the judge that a baton was recovered from Shershah. However, he added, Shershah’s mobile, tear gas mask and social media accounts were yet to be recovered.
At this point, Advocate Umer asserted that his client was falsely accused and “his arrest in the case was illegal”. “The court may reject the police’s request for physical remand,” he said.
“After 27 months, Shershah was not served even a single notice to record his statement,” Umer added. He noted that a court had previously discharged PTI senior leader Dr Yasmin Rashid from a case of a similar nature.
“We provided a copy of the same court in which, on similar facts, Dr Yasmin Rashid was discharged from this case,” Barrister Malik said on X.
 






Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan have expressed their concerns over the arrests of Shahrez and Shershah, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
Shahrez’s wife has said her husband was in Chitral with her family on May 9, 2023, sharing purported pictures from the trip. At the same time, the PTI has challenged a video being shared of Shahrez, stating it was from the party’s public meeting in Kahna held on Sept 21, 2024, not from the 2023 riots.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests last week, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.</p><small>2025-08-28 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/28152002fd85d4f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937899/kp-launches-polio-immunisation-drive-aims-to-target-57m-children' target='_blank'><strong>KP launches polio immunisation drive, aims to target 5.7m children</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government on Thursday launched an anti-polio drive, aiming to immunise 5.7 million children in the province amid security risks.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed the progress of eradication efforts. The vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by militants, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan. In 2024 alone, 20 people were killed and 53 were injured during anti-polio campaigns in the KP.
On August 26, two new cases were reported in the south of the province, taking KP’s total polio cases for this year to 15, while the nationwide tally stands at 23.
The immunisation campaign was formally launched today at Peshawar Police Services Hospital, where the KP Adviser on Health Ehtesham Ali, while speaking to the media, said, “We have developed a more organised and strategic approach this time, especially in areas where cases have recently been reported.”
 
 

He noted that out of 15 polio cases in KP, 13 were reported in the south of the province. Detailing the campaign, Ali shared that it will be conducted in two phases.
The first phase of the immunisation campaign will run for four days, starting from September 1, and is set to fully cover Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, and Charsadda, including 16  other districts, while another three districts will be covered partially, according to data provided by the KP health department.
The second phase will run for three days and is set to begin from Sept 15, aiming to target Bannu, Bajaur, and seven districts of the Dera Ismail Khan division.
The seven-day campaign — which aims to immunise 5.7m children — will engage 27,000 polio teams, while 40,000 security personnel are to be deployed for their protection.
Ali highlighted that, “While the world has largely eradicated polio, we are still facing challenges in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.“
“Committees have been formed to engage and convince reluctant parents, and efforts are underway to address local resistance,“ he added.
The health adviser cited misinformation, refusal by parents to vaccinate their children, and particularly security risks as reasons for the slow progress of eradication efforts.
“Insecurity in certain districts has made it difficult to consistently run successful campaigns,” the advisor said, adding that while teams may be facing security issues, the government has planned strategies accordingly.
On that note, he said that the KP government had launched a polio campaign in South Waziristan after two years, adding that the merged districts and the south were regions where polio teams faced the most resistance.
Echoing similar concerns, KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, who was also present at the event, noted that merged districts and the south of the province are where polio teams face the most resistance.
“Our teams are facing real challenges, but the government and the Pakistan Army are actively helping to maintain law and order in these sensitive areas,” he said.
Stressing the importance of routine immunisations, Shah said, “Strengthening overall healthcare services is essential to controlling not just polio, but other preventable diseases as well.”
“When one child contracts polio, the entire family suffers — both emotionally and economically,” he remarked.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-08-28 10:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68af841e24e51.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937734/evacuation-planned-as-sindh-braces-for-high-flood-in-indus-river' target='_blank'><strong>Evacuation planned as Sindh braces for high flood in Indus River</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: As Punjab was severely hit by flooding after heavy rains and excess water released by India from its dams, the Sindh government on Wednesday braced for high flood risk and established ministerial committees comprising elected representatives to deal with the developing situation.
Official sources told Dawn that the Pakistan Peoples Party government mobilised its elected representatives in Sindh, appointing provincial ministers as focal persons to oversee the right and left banks of the Indus River within their respective jurisdictions.
Fearing mass evacuation, the government also instructed the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to arrange necessary logistics such as boats, tents, ration bags, medicines and machinery, the officials said.
The health department has been asked to mobilise medical teams to counter potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases.

KMC asked to arrange safe shelters in Karachi; Guddu and Sukkur barrages face ‘very high flood’ threat from Sept 4 to 5

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah convened a meeting and directed all relevant authorities to remain alert and ensure full implementation of the Provincial Monsoon Contingency Plan 2025, the officials added.
 
 

The chief minister said that the warning of exceptionally high flood levels in the Indus could not be taken lightly. “Our first priority is saving lives and livelihoods, and we must remain in constant coordination with the NDMA and federal agencies,” he added.
The CM also asked all MPAs from districts along the Indus River to remain in their constituencies over the next week and maintain close coordination with the designated focal persons.
The chief minister told the meeting participants that the Flood Forecasting Division of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, in its Weekly Significant Weather Outlook for Rivers’ Catchments (28th Aug–3rd Sep 2025), had warned of very high to exceptionally high flood levels in eastern rivers due to heavy rainfall over the upper catchments and water releases from Indian dams.
He said that the Indus River at Guddu and Sukkur was expected to attain very high flood levels from Sept 4 to Sept 5, which could pose a significant threat to the province.
The chief minister instructed divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), and relevant departments to remain on 24-hour alert and take immediate measures to protect embankments and vulnerable communities.
The health department has been instructed to immediately deploy medical teams and carry out preventive vaccination campaigns against waterborne diseases.
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), local bodies, and rescue officials have been directed to ensure emergency evacuations, provide heavy machinery, and arrange safe shelters for those affected by the floodwaters.
The chief minister emphasised that all institutions must maintain full coordination with the National Disaster Management Authority and federal authorities.
Focal persons
The focal persons will be responsible for directly monitoring the situation, coordinating relief efforts, and ensuring the implementation of flood mitigation measures in their designated areas.
For the area from Guddu to Sukkur, Excise and Taxation Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla has been appointed as the focal person for the right bank, while Agriculture, Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Sardar Muhammad Bakhsh Mehar will oversee the left bank.
For the area from Sukkur to Kotri, Industries and Commerce Minister Jam Ikramullah Khan Dharejo will oversee the right bank, while Energy and Planning Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah will oversee the left bank.
Below Kotri, Religious Affairs, Zakat and Ushr Minister Riaz Hussain Shah Shirazi has been appointed as the focal person for the right bank, while Livestock and Fisheries Minister Muhammad Ali Malkani will oversee the left bank.
Governor
Governor of Sindh Kamran Khan Tessori termed India’s release of water into Pakistan’s rivers as “water terrorism” against the country.
Speaking to the media at Governor House, Governor of Sindh Kamran Khan Tessori, accompanied by senior MQM Pakistan leader Anees Qaimkhani and others, said that India’s “water terrorism” had caused flooding in the Chenab and Ravi Rivers, and its impact will soon be felt at Kotri Barrage in Sindh and other downstream areas.
He appealed to philanthropists and wealthy individuals to reach out to flood-hit areas and extend assistance to the affected families.

In a court order dated Aug 26, seen by Dawn.com, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi said that the prosecution’s evidence was discarded, noting it was “deficient of trustworthiness”.
“The sentence and conviction of the appellant is set aside. He be released forthwith if not required in any other case,” the order read.
In 2010, the suspect’s minor daughter informed her mother and maternal uncle that “her own father had committed rape with her”, according to the order.
It stated that on October 2, 2010, the victim, aged six or seven, went to her mother in tears and disclosed that her father, the appellant, had committed a “wrong act” with her, after which she felt severe pain.
Subsequently, the father was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment under Section 376(1) of the Pakistan Penal Code and a fine of Rs35,000. The sentence was upheld by the Lahore High Court in 2013.
The suspect had approached the SC against the LHC’s decision. The case was heard by a three-member bench today.
The order noted that the mother’s case was that the daughter was “subjected to rape by the appellant at 2:00pm”, but the victim’s statement “creates doubt about her credibility and, therefore, requires strong corroboration”.
It further read, “According to the complainant (mother), the victim was brought to the hospital where she was examined in her presence.
“However, the doctor’s opinion is self-contradictory as in her examination in chief she stated that the victim was subjected to rape but in the cross-examination she categorically stated that on the basis of chemical examiner’s report, no rape was found to have been committed with her.”
Justice Najafi stated, “This leaves the court to a serious question on the credibility of the statement of the victim and the possibility of false implication of the appellant. Why such serious allegations were levelled against the appellant, may be due to the fact came on record that there was a dispute between the complainant and the appellant …”
The judge also mentioned that the trial court did not put the Rationality Test to the victim before recording her statement, stating, “… a child is a competent witness if he/she passes a standard of sufficient maturity of understanding about the facts which were to be narrated by her”.
“A note/observation by the court, based on the relevant questions and their answers would make such statement credible,” the order read, noting that the victim’s statement “needs strong corroboration”.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
Last year, data gathered by Sahil, an NGO working on cases of child sexual abuse, revealed that the overwhelming majority of abusers are acquaintances or neighbours in communities or family members.
In March, four suspects who raped and killed an 11-year-old girl in Bahawalpur were traced as the victim’s relatives, with two of them being maternal uncles.</p><small>2025-08-28 09:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/28131523623636c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937863/2-suspects-allegedly-involved-in-raiwind-brothers-murder-case-killed-in-ccd-encounter-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>2 suspects allegedly involved in Raiwind brothers’ murder case killed in CCD ‘encounter’: lawyer</strong></a><br><p>Two men arrested for torturing two brothers in a Rs30 dispute with street vendors in Raiwind were killed in an “encounter” with the Crimes Control Department (CCD), the victims’ lawyer said on Thursday.
The incident came to light after a video clip showing street vendors subjecting both brothers to torture went viral on social media. The suspected attackers were spotted holding clubs in their hands and beating the victims at a public place in Raiwind. One brother died of severe torture marks at the spot, while the other succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.
Ali Ahmed Awan, the lawyer representing the victims’ father, told Dawn.com a day prior that a total of six suspects were named in the case, out of which three — including the main suspect — had been arrested.
“Two of the suspects, Owais and Shahzad, were killed in a police encounter after their accomplices attempted to attack the police,” Awan said today. “The CCD is still searching for the rest of the suspects.”
No case has been registered regarding the police encounter yet, he said.
On August 22, a first information report (FIR) was filed on the complaint of the victims’ father at the Raiwind City Police Station under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, the incident occurred on August 21 at 5:45pm when the brothers were returning home and stopped to buy some fruit.
“Due to a dispute over money, the owner of the fruit cart … and his brother … began beating my sons and called some other people,” the complainant said.</p><small>2025-08-28 08:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620759-imran-khans-nephew-sent-on-14-day-judicial-remand-in-may-9-case' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's nephew sent on 14-day judicial remand in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>

Under a proposed change, foreigners would not be allowed to stay for more than four years on student visas in the US.
Foreign journalists would be limited to stays of just 240 days, although they could apply to extend by additional 240-day periods — except for Chinese journalists who would get just 90 days.
The US, until now, has generally issued visas for the duration of a student’s educational programme or a journalist’s assignment, although no non-immigrant visas are valid for more than 10 years.
 
 

The proposed changes were published in the Federal Register, initiating a short period for public comment before they can go into effect.
Trump’s Department of Homeland Security alleged that an unspecified number of foreigners were indefinitely extending their studies so they could remain in the country as “‘forever’ students.”
“For too long, past administrations have allowed foreign students and other visa holders to remain in the US virtually indefinitely, posing safety risks, costing untold amount of taxpayer dollars and disadvantaging US citizens,” the department said in a press statement Wednesday.
The department did not explain how US citizens and taxpayers were hurt by international students, who according to Commerce Department statistics contributed more than $50 billion to the US economy in 2023.
The United States welcomed more than 1.1 million international students in the 2023-24 academic year, more than any other country, providing a crucial source of revenue as foreigners generally pay full tuition.
A group representing leaders of US colleges and universities denounced the latest move as a needless bureaucratic hurdle that intrudes on academic decision-making and could further deter potential students who would otherwise contribute to research and job creation.
“This proposed rule sends a message to talented individuals from around the world that their contributions are not valued in the United States,” said Miriam Feldblum, president and CEO of the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration.
“This is not only detrimental to international students — it also weakens the ability of US colleges and universities to attract top talent, diminishing our global competitiveness.”
Backlash
The announcement came as universities were starting their academic years with many reporting lower enrollments of international students after earlier actions by the Trump administration.
But Trump also heard rare criticism within his base when he mused Monday that he would like to double the number of Chinese students in the United States to 600,000 as he hailed warm relations with counterpart Xi Jinping.
His remarks marked a sharp departure from Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s earlier vow to “aggressively” rescind visas of Chinese students.
The State Department said last week it had overall revoked 6,000 student visas since Trump took office, in part due to Rubio’s targeting of campus activists who led demonstrations against Israel.
 
 

Trump has also suspended billions of dollars in federal research funds to universities, with his administration contending they have not acted against antisemitism, and Congress has sharply raised taxes on private universities’ endowments.
In a speech before he was elected, Vice President JD Vance said conservatives must attack universities, which he described as “the enemy.”
Trump, at the end of his first term, had proposed curbing the duration of journalist visas, but his successor Joe Biden scrapped the idea.</p><small>2025-08-28 07:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620760-saeed-ghanis-brother-remand-extended-by-three-days-in-govt-employee-assault-case' target='_blank'><strong>Saeed Ghani's brother remand extended by three days in govt employee assault case</strong></a><br><p>

The contracts, for the first time, have been categorised into Gold and Silver with 20 and 45 players awarded, respectively, PCB said in a statement.
The contracts will run from July 2025 to June 2026, during which a number of domestic and U19 tournaments are scheduled.
“The monthly retainers have been awarded to not just the performers of previous domestic events but also those who have showcased promise and potential in their respective skillsets during this time,” PCB said.
The Women’s National Selection Committee, comprising former Test Cricketer Asad Shafiq and former Pakistan Women’s International cricketer Batool Fatima, recommended the names of the 65 players.
 






“In addition, players outside of this pool can also stake a claim in the domestic contracts list by proving their potential in the upcoming domestic events and regional academy camps,” PCB said.
It has conferred domestic contracts for the third consecutive season maintaining its consistency in a bid to strengthen the player pool at pathway and domestic level.

The committee, chaired by Syed Naveed Qamar, was told by audit officials that the original Toshakhana rules from 1973 had been amended in violation of proper procedures. The Auditor General’s office had previously objected to the repeated changes.
Cabinet Division Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal explained that a new Toshakhana Act was enacted in 2024, which mandates that all gifts, except those of historical or cultural significance, must be auctioned.
“The law does not forbid accepting gifts, but requires their disposal through auction,” he clarified.
 







Probes improper rule amendments, flawed auctions and missing records

Mr Afzal added that a proposal for new amendments has been submitted under which dignitaries would not be allowed to accept gifts from foreign counterparts.
However, Mr Qamar, the acting chairman, noted that a complete ban was not practical. The committee decided to defer the audit objection until new amendments are made and rules are drafted for clarity.
 
 

The PAC also addressed the non-availability of Toshakhana records. The Cabinet Division secretary revealed that all records prior to 1997 were missing.
“As Secretary Cabinet it is also concerning for me that pre-1997, records are untraceable,” Mr Afzal told the meeting. He confirmed that records from 1997 onward have been provided to audit authorities and efforts were underway to trace earlier files through the National Archives.
The Auditor General confirmed that records after 1997 were available. The committee directed the division to present a final report on the missing files within 30 days.
Furthermore, the committee objected to the irregular auctions of Toshakhana items.
It noted the government’s failure to hold public auctions at least twice a year, instead conducting closed auctions for federal government and armed forces organisations.
 
 

Officials also noted these auctions were held without proper appraisals and that no auctions have occurred since 2018.
The meeting was presided over by Mr Qamar after the regular chairman, Junaid Akbar, declined to chair the session, saying he would not lead the proceedings for the day.
PCB audit review postponed
Meanwhile, the PAC postponed a review of audit objections related to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) because of its chairman Moshin Naqvi’s absence.
PCB officials informed the committee that the PCB chief, who is also an interior minister, was in a meeting with a visiting Belarusian delegation. The committee deferred the examination until his presence could be ensured.

Alcaraz, who could meet Djokovic in the semi-finals at Flushing Meadows if the draw follows the seedings, blew away Italy’s Mattia Bellucci 6-1, 6-0, 6-3 in just one hour 36 minutes on the Arthur Ashe Stadium main court.
The 22-year-old Spanish second seed unfurled a stream of 32 winners in a dominant display against the 65th-ranked Bellucci, whose best performance in a Grand Slam came with a run to the third round at Wimbledon earlier this year.
“I played great to be honest, from the beginning until the last ball,” said Alcaraz, who will face another Italian, 32nd seed Luciano Darderi, in the next round.
“The less time I spend on court the better for me, to go to bed early,” he added.
 






Elsewhere on Wednesday, Serbian legend Djokovic kept his dream of a record 25th Grand Slam singles title alive after a four-set defeat of American qualifier Zachary Svajda.
Djokovic though was forced to dig deep after losing the first set before claiming a 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win.
Djokovic, 38, said that while not at his best, he is hoping to play himself into form as the tournament progresses.
“That’s what I’m hoping, the deeper I go into the tournament the better I feel about my game,” he said.
Djokovic’s victory sees him into the third round at the US Open for a record-equalling 19th time, where he will face Britain’s Cameron Norrie, who defeated Argentina’s Francisco Comesana 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, 6-7 (0/7), 7-6 (7/4).
In other men’s action on Wednesday, Norwegian 12th seed Casper Ruud, the 2022 US Open finalist, exited to Belgium’s Raphael Collignon, losing 6-4, 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5.
Fourth seed Taylor Fritz advanced safely, beating South Africa’s Lloyd Harris 4-6, 7-6 (7/3), 6-2, 6-4, while American compatriot Frances Tiafoe, seeded 17, also progressed with a four-set defeat of qualifier Martin Damm.
Tiafoe won 6-4, 7-5, 6-7 (8/10), 7-5.
‘No class’ rant
In the women’s draw, meanwhile, defending champion and world number one Aryna Sabalenka moved into the next round with a workmanlike display to dispatch unseeded Russian Polina Kudermetova 7-6 (7/4), 6-2.
Sabalenka started slowly but after taking the first set on a tie-break, asserted her control to pull away in the second. The Belarusian will play Canada’s Leylah Fernandez in the third round.
“The first set was super-tight, super-aggressive. I was glad I was able to handle that pressure and put it back to her. In the second set I felt much better in the return game.”
 






Elsewhere Wednesday’s Latvia’s 25th seed Jelena Ostapenko was upset 7-5, 6-1 by Taylor Townsend before unleashing a furious on-court tirade at the American.
Townsend said Ostapenko accused her of lacking “class” during her rant.
“She told me I have no education, no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the US,” Townsend said.
“It was unfortunate, but, you know, it’s something I can put on my Tiktok.”
Ostapenko said on Instagram she had been angered by Townsend’s failure to acknowledge a net cord in her favour during the match.
In other matches, Britain’s Emma Raducanu continued her solid start to the tournament after dispatching Indonesian qualifier Janice Tjen in straight sets, winning 6-2, 6-1.
Tjen had become the first Indonesian player to reach the main draw of a Grand Slam in 21 years and followed that up with a first round upset of 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova.
But she was beaten comfortably by Raducanu, who is aiming to recapture the US Open title she won as an 18-year-old qualifier in 2021. Raducanu will face ninth seed Elena Rybakina in the next round.
While Tjen headed for the exit, another player from Southeast Asia, the Philippines’ Alexandra Eala, also saw her tournament come to an end.
Eala, the first player from the Philippines to win a Grand Slam singles match with her defeat of 14th seed Clara Tauson on Sunday, was beaten 6-4, 6-3 by Spain’s Cristina Bucsa.
Fourth seed Jessica Pegula is also into the third round after beating Russian Anna Blinkova 6-1, 6-3.
There was a win too for veteran Victoria Azarenka, the 36-year-old two-time Australian Open champion from Belarus, who defeated Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-3, 6-3.</p><small>2025-08-28 05:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/280901030a4807c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937787/irsa-turns-off-tap-at-tarbela-as-sindh-prepares-for-surge' target='_blank'><strong>Irsa ‘turns off’ tap at Tarbela as Sindh prepares for surge</strong></a><br><p>• Lower riparian takes measures to tackle inflows from swollen Indus tributaries at Guddu Barrage
• Irsa director says flood of about 650,000 cusecs likely at Guddu if current situation persists
HYDERABAD: As Sindh anticipates a very high flood between Sept 1 and 3 at Guddu Barrage — its first barrage on the Indus River — due to the swollen eastern rivers currently wreaking havoc in Punjab, the downstream province has asked the authorities to reduce outflows from Tarbela Dam to help it manage the deluge.
As multiple rivers submerge Punjab, Sindh has reached out to the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) to reduce outflows from Tarbela and retain water at Chashma Barrage — a request accepted by the authority.
The provincial irrigation authorities are keeping an eye on flows generated in the Chenab, Sutlej, and Ravi rivers, as all these rivers converge in the Indus at Mithankot after passing the Panjnad Barrage built over the Jhelum River. At Panjnad, all tributaries of the Indus meet on their way to the sea through Sindh.
“As of today, I foresee a flow of between 650,000 and 700,000 cusecs at Guddu Barrage once the flows start reaching here from the eastern rivers,” Jam Khan, Sindh’s irrigation minister, told Dawn on the phone from Karachi. “Right now it is a guessing game because nobody knows how the rainfall pattern behaves but we are making full preparations and accordingly managing staff at the dykes,” he added.
Zarif Kharif, the Sindh irrigation secretary, said a similar situation was witnessed in 2014 when Khanki Barrage on Chenab reported 947,000 cusecs flow on Sept 7, 2014 and Sindh had received about 475,000 cusecs.
“This time, the situation is a bit different because Guddu passed a high flood of 510,798 cusecs on Aug 24. As of Wednesday, Guddu was still showing an upstream discharge of 335,196 cusecs, he said, adding that the flows would increase once water from Punjab reached the barrage.
 
 

In order to manage the surge, the secretary confirmed that they reached out to Irsa Director Operations Khalid Idrees Rana for controlling outflows at Tarbela. An outflow of 154,500 cusecs was recorded at Tarbela at 6am on Wednesday, which notably increased to 256,200 cusecs at 6pm. This, coupled with the Kabul River, will reach Sindh’s barrages within a few days.
Tarbela Dam had attained the maximum storage level of 1,550 feet on Aug 21. After Irsa started discharging flows, the dam’s level stood at 1549.66ft on Wednesday at 6pm. Against this backdrop, the irrigation secretary asked Irsa to retain water at Chashma so that Sindh could manage its flows from the swollen eastern rivers.
“Yes, we have reduced flows from Tarbela (at Sindh’s request), where 155,000 cusecs outflow was recorded at 8pm Wednesday,” the Irsa operations director told Dawn. He also confirmed that “storage can be taken slightly higher than maximum storage of 1,550 feet. We can take it to 1550.2 or 1550.3 feet for now,” he argued.
He said that a positive sign was that there were no back-up flows in the Chenab. “We are observing nullahs like Palkhu, Basantpur and Bhimber currently,” he said. He pointed out that in view of the current situation, a flood of 650,000 cusecs or so was likely at Guddu and that too may last five to six hours. “We are struggling to manage flows in a way that Guddu’s discharge should remain below 600,000 cusecs.”

According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) data, no gold was imported in June or July. Only nine kilograms of gold worth $927,000 were imported in May — primarily shipments made before the SRO’s suspension.
In contrast, gold imports in July 2024 had stood at $2.2 million.
Jewellery exports have also plunged. PBS data shows exports totalled just $17,000 in July 2025, $27,000 in June, and $617,000 in May — down sharply from $2.6m in July 2024.

FPCCI warns of reputational damage, legal action from global buyers

Industry leaders say the situation has effectively paralysed the sector, with exporters unable to fulfill orders despite having received raw gold under legal contracts from international buyers.
Habib ur Rahman, the former chairman of the Pakistan Gems and Jewellery Traders and Exporters Association, cited an example involving a UAE-based company that had provided 860 grams of pure gold in March for manufacturing purposes. The order was to be delivered within 120 days, but 164 days had passed by August 19 without fulfilment.
The UAE firm has now demanded the return of its gold, warning that payment of $17,268 would only be released upon delivery of the jewellery. In a letter to Pakistan’s ambassador, the company expressed frustration over repeated halts in exports, comparing the situation unfavourably with its uninterrupted trade experience with Indian suppliers.
The disruption is causing international buyers to reconsider sourcing from Pakistan, leading to reduced orders and potential legal action, Mr Rahman warned.
In a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President Atif Ikram Sheikh called for the immediate restoration of SRO 760 to protect the jewellery export industry.
He noted that many exporters had already received raw gold under legally binding contracts and had prepared jewellery for shipment when the notification was suspended without warning. This, he said, had disrupted supply chains and eroded global buyer confidence.
Mr Sheikh said a high-level government committee had reviewed past transactions under SRO 760 and found no misuse or irregularities. A clean report has been submitted, and the Ministry of Commerce has forwarded a summary recommending revival of the SRO, which is currently pending at the PM Office.
Patron-in-Chief of the United Business Group, S.M. Tanveer, warned that delays in reviving the SRO could trigger legal claims from buyers, result in market losses, and damage Pakistan’s reputation in the global gold trade. He urged the Prime Minister to authorise the SRO’s revival at least for pending export consignments.
“This is critical to restoring confidence, preserving Pakistan’s export markets, and protecting the country’s standing in international trade forums,” he said.

Speaking at a conference on “Building a Resilient Public Financial Management Ecosystem”, jointly organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA), Mr Aurangzeb emphasised that implementation, rather than policy debate, is now the government’s primary focus.
The new tax return form, published on the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) website for a 40-day public consultation, is expected to benefit nearly 80pc of salaried taxpayers. “Our goal is to make the tax system more people-friendly,” the minister said, urging stakeholders to provide feedback.
Mr Aurangzeb also announced that tax policy-making functions have been shifted from the FBR to the Ministry of Finance, a move aimed at enhancing strategic coherence and improving fiscal governance.

Aurangzeb unveils simplified returns which will benefit 80pc of salaried taxpayers

He called for rational and predictable taxation, warning against ad hoc measures used to plug revenue shortfalls. “Tax policy must be grounded in sound economic reasoning. Erratic decisions have long challenged the domestic industry,” he noted.
The finance minister outlined plans for a new industrial policy aimed at attracting long-term investment and rebuilding investor trust. “Inconsistent past policies have eroded confidence. We’re committed to delivering stable, forward-looking frameworks,” he said.
As part of ongoing reforms, Mr Aurangzeb reaffirmed the government’s commitment to accelerate privatisation, including the merger or closure of loss-making state-owned enterprises to reduce corruption and enhance institutional efficiency.
On trade, he said tariff reforms were underway to address the impact of excessive protectionism, which has hindered the competitiveness of local industries. “We must recalibrate policies to drive innovation and support global integration,” he said.
 
 

Highlighting broader national challenges, the minister identified population growth and climate change as the country’s most pressing existential threats. “Climate change is already unfolding in Pakistan. This is not a future concern,” he said, calling on the accounting community to support efforts to mobilise financing for sustainable development.
He also emphasised the importance of aligning Pakistan’s financial systems with international standards and pledged to expedite fiscal reforms to enhance governance and institutional accountability.
ICAP President Saif Ullah reiterated the institute’s commitment to transparency and capacity-building in the public sector. He thanked policymakers, development partners, and industry leaders for their collaboration in advancing governance reforms and embedding ESG principles.
Federal Minister for Climate Change Musadik Malik highlighted the need for sustainable practices, while Privatisation Minister Muhammad Ali shared updates on public financial reforms. Ross Smith, Programme and Technical Director of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB), delivered a presentation on promoting transparency through global accounting standards.Other speakers included: ICAP Public Sector Committee Chairman Khalid Rahman; CIPFA Director International Khalid Hamid; SECP Chairman Akif Saeed; Additional Auditor General Dr Iram Anjum Khan; former SBP Governor Shahid Kardar; FBR Member Dr Najeeb Ahmad; former ICAP President Farrukh Rehman; Climate Change Secretary Aisha Humera Chaudhary; SECP Executive Director Musarat Jabeen; State Bank Director Dr Mian Farooq Haq; and Senior Financial Management Specialist Akmal Minallah.

• President asks Sindh to gear up for large flows; Nawaz asks lawmakers to help their constituents
• Minister announces compensation for Danyore nullah victims
ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: The co­­u­­ntry’s federal and provincial lea­d­ership is overseeing a coordinated em­ergency response to the unprecedented flood crisis across the country.
No province or territory has escaped the water’s wrath — be it destruction from flash floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, devastating glacial lake outburst floods in Gilgit Baltistan, crippling rains in Sindh or the overflowing rivers in Punjab.
Chairing an emergency meeting on Wedn­e­sday, Prime Minister She­hbaz Sharif directed the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to take immediate measures to address potential urban floo­ding in Punjab, particularly Lahore, Sialkot, and Gujrat.
 
 

The PM was briefed on high wat­er discharge pressure in the Ravi River at Jastar and Shahdara, and in the Sutlej River at Ganda Singh Wala and Sulemanki, with monitoring stations also tracking conditions at Khanki, Balloki, and Qadirabad.
He emphasised the need to enhance flood and rainfall warning effectiveness, stressing timely information sharing between NDMA and Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) to minimise losses. He instructed key ministers and officials to reach Lahore immediately to ensure uninterrupted power supply, communication channels, and road restoration.
 
 

NDMA Chairman Lt-Gen Inam Haider Malik briefed the prime minister on pre-emptive evacuations, safe relocations, and relief supply delivery, while army personnel and police services have been engaged for damage mitigation in flood-affected Punjab areas.
Zardari directs Sindh preparations
In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed deep grief over the devastating floods, extending heartfelt condolences to families who suffered losses of life, property, livestock, and farms.
While appreciating the “exemplary valor and commitment” demonstrated by armed forces and eme­rgency rescue teams during this crisis, he specifically directed the government of Sindh — ruled by his own PPP — to immediately begin preparations to cope with the massive amount of water that is expec­ted to flow into the province in the coming days.
Expressing confidence in the nation’s resilience, President Zardari referenced Pakistan’s successful response to previous floods in 2010 and 2022, stating the country would overcome this trial with similar determination.
PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif has reportedly directed the party’s federal and provincial ministers and lawmakers to immediately reach their constituencies and actively take part in flood relief activities. The directions came at a Sharif family meeting in Murree, where Nawaz, PM Shehbaz and CM Maryam discussed the devastation caused by the floods.
 
 

Nawaz Sharif reportedly asked the federal and Punjab governments to effectively coordinate with each other to deal with flood devastation and subsequent relief work.
Meanwhile, the Punjab chief mi­­nister spoke to commissioners and deputy commissioners via video link, and directed them to moblise all resources for rescue and relief operations in the areas affected by flood across the province. She asked the participants of the meeting to ensure tents, food and medicines for the people affected by the flood.
CM Maryam also visited Shah­d­ara to review the flood situation and inspect the safety dam and other measures taken by the administration.  The CM directed the administration and other relevant departments engaged in the rescue and relief activities to complete the evacuation process of the population and livestock from the river crossings at the earliest.
Muqam visits GB
Meanwhile, Kashmir, GB and Safron Minister Amir Muqam arrived in Gilgit on a three-day visit to monitor flood rehabilitation and relief activities, highlighting the ongoing threat posed by glacier lake outburst floods in the region.
During his visit, he met families of seven volunteers who lost their lives while attempting to restore water supply in the Danyore nallah. He announced Rs2 million in compensation for each slain volunteer’s family and promised the establishment of a memorial centre.
 
 

GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza briefed the Federal Minister on glacier lake vulnerability, noting that many downstream areas face risks of Glofs. The minister annou­nced that water supply to Danyore, Sultan­abad, and Mohammadabad would be restored soon as rehabilitation work continues.

Both exercises will need to converge on the local sources of Pakistan’s climate vulnerability and financing. The seesawing between the federation and provinces over the distribution of finances has cast a dark shadow over national climate and economic vulnerabilities. With the cost of reconstruction, development, debt and defence increasing, the resource trickle is dwindling further. Are there any lessons in the NFC awards to help respond to the PM’s lament?
 
 

Climate vulnerability at the district level has three basic drivers:
Population growth: In what constitutes Pakistan today, the population has exploded from 33.7 million in 1951 to 242.7m in 2025, and is projected to reach 380-403m by 2050, making it the world’s third most populous nation. This demographic explosion, coupled with economic stagnation and declining per capita income, creates escalating climate vulnerability.
Currently, 108m people, or 42.3 per cent of the population, according to a recent World Bank study, live below the poverty line with limited adaptive capacity.
Under business-as-usual scenarios, 190-200m people could be in poverty by 2050 — nearly half the projected population. In brief, every other child born in Pakistan will now be born to families below the poverty line — leaving them unable to afford climate adaptation and disaster recovery. This vast population spread in the high-risk areas of 169 districts with about 1,200 tehsils represents Pakistan’s most critical vulnerability driver.

Are there any lessons in the NFC awards to help respond to the PM’s lament?

Disproportionate exposure: The second key driver is the disproportionate concentration of the poor in high-risk areas. Data shows that in recent years, 18-26 districts have faced droughts in Balochistan and Sindh, 18 faced glacial lake outburst floods in Gilgit-Baltistan and KP, six faced tropical storms in Sindh and Balochistan and 84 districts were hit by floods across the provinces, not to mention urban flooding, forest fires, landslides and cloudbursts. Each district is exposed to two or more types of climate disasters.
 
 

The vulnerable populations are clustered in regions that are most susceptible to climate shocks, including low-lying floodplains, marginalised farmland and unauthorised settlements on riverbeds and urban peripheries. This geographical alignment guarantees that in the event of a climate disaster, the poor are hit first and the hardest, as their settlements are the most exposed and least resilient.
Limited adaptive capacity: Finally, low per capita income severely limits the adaptive capacity of our population. With a 2024 GDP per capita of just $1,485, and projections suggesting a decline to $1,200-$1,300 by 2050, the poor have virtually no financial buffer to absorb climate shocks.
The massive economic losses from climate events further drain resources, making it nearly impossible for individuals to invest in their assets: housing, livestock, standing crops, lives and microenterprises. This lack of financial capacity creates a vicious cycle of poverty and disaster.
Against this backdrop, what lessons can be drawn to respond to the PM’s remarks?
Incremental changes: Some answers by policy managers can be inferred: more resources for infrastructure to fill the financial gaps for recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitation from previous disasters; early warning systems; financing for the staggering 1,071 pending PC-1s; and upgradation of equipment or building new infrastructure. Other important elements include improved inter-agency cooperation, capacity-building, and access to international climate finance.
Many of these won’t be new lessons, but it is still important for each agency to develop and share its lessons. While these needs are necessary for government efficiency, where are the transformative lessons?
Transformative changes: Several initiatives remain trapped in approval processes: promoting land-use planning to guide human settlements away from low-lying flood-prone regions to designated safer areas; adaptive social protection to invest precious resources in damage prevention rather than post-disaster recovery; creation of sub-national disaster risk financing facilities; adoption of resilient construction standards; mandatory insurance for public sector infrastructure in PC-1 proposals; risk transfer and insurance mechanisms to prevent governments from harvesting unspent funds from development projects; and earnest implementation of climate risk screening for public sector portfolios.
 
 

The delays in their operationalisation and absence of prioritisation erode the synergistic impact necessary for transformative change. All of them, however, establish project-level, not policy-level, programmatic and strategic direction for our safe journey into the future.
Four transformative lessons: Pakistan’s climate adaptation demands structural governance transformation. Top-down interventions have failed to generate ownership. Globally, bottom-up initiatives by elected local governments increase implementation and accountability systems. Four key lessons emerge from entrusting district-level decision-making.
First, local communities, and not distant bureaucrats, must manage land-use planning at the tehsil and district levels. Second, locally developed zoning laws must protect shamilaat, communal and state lands from vested interests and ban high-risk development. Third, reclamation of the encroached commons must be achieved through local-level resilience management action plans that restore the natural flood management capacity. Fourth, districts must develop asset inventories as revenue sources using credible valuation mechanisms for standardised property assessments.
Given this scale, it’s the right time to establish a ‘National Reclamation Commission’ to develop a national framework and provincial guidelines for local actions.
Learning challenge: Learning is expensive. To learn from climate disasters, Pakistan must ‘unlearn’ destructive practices: ending floodplain encroachment and not treating communal lands as private profit centres. This process can be negotiated but requires decisive political pushback against powerful networks.
Despite decades of disasters, Pakistan repeats its mistakes: allowing encroachment, enabling elite capture, treating prevention as an expense rather than an investment. Lessons remain unlearned because learning requires confronting power, not merely studying flood patterns or providing relief assistance.
True climate adaptation demands political consensus and the courage to implement what we already know but refuse to do. Let the NFC award spearhead this transformation.

• ADB president says ready to assist in launch of inaugural Panda Bond, welcomes market diversification efforts
ISLAMABAD: Paki­stan on Wednesday sought deeper collaboration and fresh support for policy-based lending from the Asian Development Bank for vast sectors of the economy, from climate to infrastructure to resource mobilisation, thro­ugh global capital instruments, like green bonds and debt-for-nature swaps, under the new 10-year partnership.
The wish-list for future direct financial support and collaborations for market-based financing instruments was shared by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb with ADB President Masato Kanda — a former finance minister of Japan — during his maiden visit to Pakistan after assuming the charge of his office in February this year.
Senator Aurangzeb discussed “Pakistan’s priorities for deeper collaboration with ADB across key areas, including energy transition, climate resilience, transport and logistics, human capital development, and resource mobilisation”, an official statement said.
The minister also welcomed ADB’s strong medium-term commitment to Pakistan and encouraged enhanced collaboration in policy-based financing, capital markets development, private sector participation, and innovative instruments, such as green bonds, blended finance, and debt-for-nature swaps.
 
 

The finance minister emphasised the importance of ADB’s partnership in supporting the government’s PPP pipeline and sectoral reforms to build long-term resilience. The two sides are currently in the process of 10-year Country Partnership Strategy (2026-35) on the pattern of a similar $20 billion long-term financing collaboration with the World Bank over the 2026-35 period announced in January this year.
The finance minister reassured the ADB president of Pakistan’s strong commitment to reforms in taxation, tariff rationalisation, SOE restructuring, and regulatory modernisation, while appreciating ADB’s role as a dependable and long-standing development partner. The minister “extended an invitation for enhanced collaboration under the upcoming ADB Country Partnership Strategy 2026-2035, aligned with Pakistan’s medium-term development priorities”, the statement said.
In reciprocation, the ADB president expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s economic reforms and resilience, commending the progress achieved in stabilising the economy and advancing structural reforms.
“He assured ADB’s continued support in key areas, including climate change adaptation, population challenges, infrastructure development, and resource mobilisation,” a statement issued by the finance ministry said.
Mr Kanda also welcomed Pakistan’s efforts towards market diversification and pledged ADB’s readiness to assist in the launch of the inaugural Panda Bond and other innovative financing instr­­­­­uments.
The ADB president reaffirmed ADB’s willingness to partner with Pakistan on its reform agenda, emphasising that ADB would continue to work closely with the Government of Pakistan to ensure sustained progress and prosperity.
The minister expressed his gratitude to the ADB president for prioritising Pakistan and choosing to visit it as the first country after assuming office, recalling with appreciation his earlier meetings with the president in Washington in April this year.
He also appreciated the ADB country team led by Emma Fan for their constructive engagement and continued support extended to the Ministry of Finance and the Government of Pakistan in advancing economic reforms and development priorities.
 
 

Senator Aurangzeb briefed the delegation about Pakistan’s steady economic progress despite multiple challenges in recent years, saying Pakistan had successfully stabilised its macroeconomic framework, with inflation declining sharply, a turnaround in the current account, and recent upgrades in Pakistan’s sovereign ratings by international credit agencies, which have helped lower the cost of borrowing.
He also acknowledged ADB’s continued and substantial support to Pakistan in recent years, pointing to the Bank’s strong backing for reforms in resource mobilisation, women’s financial inclusion, disaster risk financing, and the clean energy transition.

The office cited legal lacunas, including the abs­e­nce of a duly signed pow­er of attorney, as the reason for rejecting the plea.
The petition was moved under Article 184(1) of the Constitution which grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction to hear disputes between two or more governments through declaratory judgements.
In his plea, the KP chief minister sought directives for the federal government to allow him to meet the PTI founder for consultation and guidance on matters relating to the governance of the province. The petition contended that Imran Khan has been “illegally detained” in the Rawalpindi prison since August 2023.
The petition named the federal government through the interior ministry, Punjab chief secretary and Adiala Jail superintendent as respondents.
 
 

This was the KP chief minister’s second such attempt. Earlier, on June 25, Mr Gandapur had entered a court proceeding in the middle of a case to seek the urgent attention of senior puisne judge Syed Mansoor Ali Shah over what he described as being denied a meeting with Imran Khan for consultation on provincial budget.
According to media reports, the KP chief minister has not been allowed to meet the PTI founder for several months.
Mr Gandapur had also filed a similar petition before the Supreme Court, seeking a declaration that the respondents — the federal government, Punjab chief secretary and Adiala Jail superintendent — be directed to arrange his meetings with Imran Khan, arguing that denial of regular access to the PTI founder amounted to a violation of articles 9 and 10A of the Constitution.
 
 

The petition had requested the apex court to direct the respondents to ensure compliance with any judicial order regarding visitation rights, stressing that the chief minister’s role necessitated consultation with the party’s founding chairman.
It contended that the restriction on access undermined the democratic rights of PTI members and supporters, who represent over one-fourth of Pakistan’s population, adding that the failure of earlier petitions filed in the Islamabad High Court on the same subject underscored the urgency and necessity of the Supreme Court’s intervention.

LAHORE: Large swa­thes of Punjab are submerged as catastrophic flooding in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers forced hundreds of thousands from their homes, causing significant damage to infrastructure and devastates millions of acres of agricultural land.
The three trans-boundary rivers have swollen to exceptionally high levels due to a combination of heavy rains and the excess water India is releasing from dams, which then flows across the border.
The crisis, which affects central districts, now threatens south Punjab as the combined thrust of four rivers is set to converge on Thursday.
The flooding has prompted the government to call in the army for assistance in eight districts: Sialkot, Narowal, Hafizabad, Sargodha, Lahore, Kasur, Okara and Faisalabad.
 
 

Gujranwala’s commis­sio­ner said in a statement 15 people have lost their lives in the floods, including five in Sialkot, four in Gujrat, three in Nar­owal, two in Hafiza­bad and one in Gujranwala.
Official figures confirm that over 150,000 people and 35,000 livestock heads were shifted to safe places, and relief camps, along with medical and veterinary camps, were established in flood-affected areas.
Punjab estimates that over 600,000 people have been affected, while UN-OCHA said the death toll from this monsoon season is almost three times the fatalities recorded in the same period last year.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said 39,638 people were evacuated from different districts, including Sialkot, Sargo­dha, Chiniot, Gujran­wala, Nankana, Hafiza­bad, Man­di Bahauddin, Guj­rat, Lahore, Narowal, Ka­­s­ur, Okara, Pakpattan, Ba­h­­­a­­walnagar, Vehari, Bah­­a­­w­alpur and Lodh­ran.
As of midnight Thur­sday, three points were classified under “exceptionally high flood”: Khanki Headworks on the Chenab River, with an outflow of 966,427 cusecs and a falling trend; Qadirabad Headworks on the Chenab, with 1,054,883 cusecs on a steady trend; and Ganda Singh Wala on the Sutlej River, recording 261,053 cusecs, also steady.
A cusec is a volume  equ­­­i­valent to one cubic foot, or 28 cubic litres, per second.
The Ravi River at Jassar was in “very high flood”, with a steady outflow of 166,500 cusecs. “High flood” was reported at Marala on the Chenab, with 246,970 cusecs and a falling trend, and at Shahdara on the Ravi, with 99,700 cusecs on a rising trend.
 
 

Meanwhile, “medium flood” conditions were observed at Balloki on the Ravi, recording 82,070 cusecs with a rising trend, and at Sulemanki on the Sutlej, with 109,305 cusecs on a steady trend.
The PDMA on Wednes­day warned of a possible breach at the Qadirabad He­­adworks, raising fears of severe flooding in Hafiz­abad and Chiniot districts.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said water pressure at the headworks had been increasing steadily, creating a critical situation. “If the structure gives way, both Hafizabad and Chiniot will be badly affected,” he cautioned.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia told rep­orters that a major flood surge is moving through the river system, with key infrastructure remaining secure and large-scale evacuations underway in vulnerable areas.
He said the Head Ma­­r­a­­la structure is safe, and water levels there are now receding, while the flood surge is currently passing through Khanki Head­works and is expected to reach the Panjnad area without causing damage.
DG Kathia reported that approximately 150,000 pe­­o­ple have been relocated to secure locations so far. He said the government has allocated Rs 900 million for emergency response.
 


Affected areas
More than 150,000 people have been affected in 333 villages along the banks of the Chenab River. Some 133 villages in Sialkot, 16 in Wazirabad, 20 in Gujrat, 12 in Mandi Bahauddin, 100 in Chiniot and 52 in Jhang have been worst affected due to the flood.
Some 380,768 citizens from 335 villages along the banks of the Sutlej River have been affected by the floods. As many as 104 relief camps and 105 medical camps are functioning to help and provide care to the flood victims.
The cities affected due to the flood in the Sutlej River include Kasur, Oka­ra, Pakpattan, Multan, Vehari, Bahawalnagar and Bahawalpur.
Some 72 villages and 450,000 people in Kasur district, 12 villages in Pakpattan, 23 in Vehari, 75 in Bahawalnagar and 15 villages in Bahawalpur were badly affected by the high level of flooding in the Sutlej River.
The Communication and Works Department rep­or­ted that several highways were submerged in the flood-affected districts, particularly Narowal, Shakargarh and Sialkot.
The Sialkot-Pasrur dual carriageway has been submerged for nearly one kilometre, while at Kotli Cha­hoor, the Naala Dek emb­ankment breach has affec­ted the highway and the Kona Drain Bridge was also damaged.
According to BBC Urdu, the Ravi swelled with wat­er flowing in from Indian-held Jammu and Kashmir, submerging dozens of villages in Narowal district.
According to residents and rescue workers, bet­w­een 35 and 40 villages in Na­­rowal have been subm­erged due to the rising river.
Local journalist Raheel told the BBC that the surge in the Ravi had inundated parts of the Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib complex under several feet of water.
Sikh pilgrims and employees who had come to the gurdwara were trapped in the flood.
Planning Minister Ah­­san Iqbal, Narowal Deputy Commissioner Syed Has­san Raza and Provincial Minister for Minority Affa­irs Punjab Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora supervised the Kartarpur rescue operation and rescued the people trapped in the flood.
Four teams rescued more than 150 Sikh pilgri­­ms and employees of Gurd­wara Darbar Sahib and shi­­­fted them to a safe place.
The Narowal-Shakar­garh road was also submerged along a three- to four-kilometre stretch, leaving surrounding villages completely cut off.
In Zafarwal tehsil of Narowal, dozens of villages were reported underwater due to the overflowing streams. The town of Kanjroor, with a population of nearly 20,000, was said to be at high risk of flooding.
Rising waters in Nala Dek have worsened the sit­uation, with protective em­­bankments breached at se­­veral points and the bri­dge at Hanjli comple­t­e­­ly wa­­s­hed away. The overflowing stream has also inundated parts of rural Sialkot, disrupting the Chawinda-Zafarwal road.
The Ravi’s floodwaters have spread downstream, affecting Sheikhupura, Na­­nkana Sahib and Oka­ra, while also threatening Faisalabad’s Tandlian­wa­­la tehsil and parts of Sahiwal.
In Nankana Sahib, areas including Hira, Jattan Da­­wara, Nawan Kot, Khizra Abad and Lalo Ana were inundated, alongside Shei­­kh Datol, Gujran da That­­ta, Khoh Sadiq, Dera Hak­im and Dera Mehr Ashraf.
In Okara, floodwaters from the Ravi entered Jandran Kalan village, home to more than 30,000 people, as well as Jehdu and Jhandu Manj.
In Faisalabad, authoriti­­es warned that Ravi floodwaters could affect Tand­l­ianwala tehsil, with over 100 settlements at risk, including Basti Jamun Dol­on, Jali Taryana, Jali Fat­yana, Mari Patan, Shi­raza and Thatta Dokaan. Floods in the Chenab Riv­er have impa­cted districts including Sialkot, Mandi Baha­uddin, Sargo­dha, Gu­­jrat, Wazir­abad, Hafiz­abad, Chiniot and Jhang.
Wazirabad-based journalist Aqeel Lodhi told BBC Urdu that Chenab waters had entered parts of the city, severely affecting Sohdra and surrounding areas. In northern Sialkot, the Bajwat region — situated between the Chenab and the Tawi rivers — was heavily inundated, submerging nearly 70 villages. Rescue officials confirmed that access roads linking these villages to Sialkot city were completely cut off.
Rescue, relief operations
A meeting chaired by Pu­­njab Chief Minister Ma­­r­­yam Nawaz was infor­med that some 601,126 citizens of 769 villages of the province had been affe­c­ted due to floods in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers.
Some 263 relief camps and 161 medical camps have been established to help and look after the flood victims, along with providing them with food, medical treatment and temporary shelters.
Food, water and other items are being provided to the flood victims in Sam­­­brial, Sialkot and Pasrur.
An operation has been carried out to relocate citizens from other flood-affected areas, including Kasur, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, and Pulkho Nullah Wazirabad.
Pakistan Army, district administration, police, Rescue 1122, PDMA and other relevant departments are jointly participating in the rescue and relief operation.
