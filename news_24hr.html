DawnNewsTV reported that an armoured police vehicle was impacted by the blast in Tank’s Gomal area.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought an immediate report from the top police officials on the “attack“, a statement from his office said.
He expressed his deep grief and anger, conveying his condolences to the bereaved families of the martyrs.
“The brave men of KP Police embraced martyrdom to protect the lives and property of the people,” Kundi was quoted as saying, adding that he was proud of the martyrs.
“These actions by the Fitna al Hindustan, which is backed by India, cannot dampen our morale,” the governor asserted.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The KP governor urged the PTI-run provincial government to “take practical steps to ensure peace in the province”.

“People are exhausted after the 12-day war with Israel,” he said over the phone. “It’s the uncertainty. You can’t even plan for the near future because things keep changing.”
Iran is buckling under mounting economic pressure. Inflation has exceeded 36 per cent since March. The rial has lost roughly half its value, trading at around 1,390,000 to the US dollar. Sanctions linked to Iran’s nuclear programme have returned, utilities remain strained, and global financial bodies are forecasting a recession in 2026.
Unrest, at the worst possible time
Iran’s most significant protests since 2022 erupted around two weeks ago among traders and shopkeepers in downtown Tehran, triggered by the rapid collapse of the rial, which has driven up prices and left traders unable to restock goods.
Isolated market shutdowns in Tehran’s commercial districts quickly escalated into street demonstrations, drawing in wider sections of the public and prompting security deployments. Like falling dominoes, the unrest spread to other cities, claiming dozens of lives, according to rights groups.
Last week, major Iranian cities were gripped overnight by new mass rallies denouncing the Islamic Republic, as activists expressed fear that authorities were intensifying their suppression of the demonstrations under the cover of an internet blackout.
The crackdown follows what was initially a relatively soft response, with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian calling for a kind and responsible” approach, acknowledging public frustration. The government had also announced cash handouts to ease economic woes.
The regime appears to have shifted its tone since, accusing the US and Israel of orchestrating the protests. “The enemy has infiltrated trained terrorists into the country. Rioters and saboteurs are not the protesting people. We listen to the protesters and have made our utmost efforts to solve their problems,” Pezes­hkian said.
The US, meanwhile, has offered to “help” the Iranian people, and the Trump administration also reportedly discussed the possibility of strikes targeting Iran.
Posting on social media on Saturday, US President Trump said: “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!”
In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of US intervention in Iran, according to Reuters.
Meanwhile, addressing parliament on Sunday, Iran’s speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf warned the US against any miscalculation. If the US attacked, “both the occupied territory and centres of the US military and shipping will be our legitimate targets,” he told lawmakers. The warning came hours before Trump disclosed that Iran’s leadership had called seeking “to negotiate”.
“The leaders of Iran called yesterday,“ Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that “a meeting is being set up … They want to negotiate.”
However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“.
The timing could have hardly been worse.
US jets had just flown into Venezuela and captured President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. Maduro was taken to New York, and footage posted online showed him blindfolded in a grey tracksuit — an unsettling image, regardless of one’s politics.
A cat-and-mouse relationship
Miles away, in Tehran, Venezuela’s anti-American ally felt the pressure.
Could Trump pull a Venezuela on Iran, its longest adversary?
“We know that Donald Trump is not a reliable president, and he doesn’t care about international law,” said Soheili.
Iran and the US have long shared a cat-and-mouse relationship. Washington has consistently viewed Iran’s nuclear programme and its network of regional proxies with suspicion.
In 2020, an American strike killed Iran’s most revered military commander and foreign policy architect, Gen Qasem Soleimani. In June 2025, US jets struck key Iranian nuclear sites as Iran, shaken but defiant, fought a brief war with Israel.
Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which allows non-nuclear states to pursue civilian nuclear energy under international inspections. Tehran insists its programme remains peaceful, a claim disputed by the United States and its allies, who argue that Iran’s enrichment levels exceed civilian requirements. Iran, for its part, has repeatedly accused Washington of selectively enforcing the treaty while ignoring violations by its partners, including Israel.
Following the Iran-Israel war, sweeping UN sanctions lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal were reimposed, while Tehran suspended nuclear inspections, effectively freezing its remaining commitments under the agreement.
Trump’s oil gambit
Iran, no stranger to the consequences of foreign intervention, was quick to condemn Washington’s actions in Venezuela as a “clear violation” of sovereignty and international law.
“In past decades, interventions were justified under slogans such as democracy and human rights,” Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Monday. “Today, they openly say the issue is Venezuela’s oil.”
After Maduro’s capture, Trump promised that American companies would gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. “We’re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground,” he told reporters.
After vowing to “run” Venezuela, Trump later softened his tone, saying the United States would not deploy troops if the country “does what we want.”
Venezuela holds the world’s largest proven oil reserves, accounting for roughly 17pc of the global total, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
That is another point of comparison with Iran.
As the United Nations and states around the world debate the legality of Trump’s move, one thing is clear: the US president has moved on from peacemaker to interventionist. And that shift is making Tehran uneasy.
Iran on edge
Inside the country, the debate has already begun.
Pro-Iran outlets have quietly explored the implications.
“Following the US military attack on Venezuela and … Donald Trump’s threatening remarks … a serious question has emerged: could Tehran be the next target of Washington’s adventurism …,” wrote Nournews, an Iran-based digital news outlet.
Tehran-based foreign policy expert Mohammad Khatibi agrees that there is cause for concern.
“Yes, in light of what has occurred in Venezuela, there is clear reason for concern. Threats of intervention and open advocacy for regime change raise serious questions under international law and established norms,” he told Dawn.
That said, he cautioned against drawing direct parallels.
“From a geopolitical perspective, Iran is a central regional power in the Middle East with deep strategic depth, strong state institutions, and significant influence across multiple regional theatres,” he added.
Khatibi asserted that any attempt to replicate the Venezuelan model in Iran would therefore carry far greater risks of regional escalation and international confrontation.
Iran’s leverage in the Middle East has rested not only on its military capabilities but also on its network of allies and proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. An attack on Iran could create ripples through the region.
Apples and oranges?
Syed M. Ali, a security studies lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, cautioned against overstating the comparison.
“It is somewhat like comparing apples and oranges,” he said. “While the Venezuelan action will be tough for the US to justify internationally, this intervention is motivated by Trump’s desire to reassert hemispheric hegemony, which resonates with the historical Monroe Doctrine (a policy opposing European colonialism in the Americas, asserting that any foreign interference in the Western Hemisphere would be seen as a threat to US interests).”
Iran’s regional position, he added, makes any direct intervention far more complicated. And with the events happening in Gaza, the public perception not just in the Muslim world but also in the West has moved against the nexus between the US deep state and Israel, which act in tandem.
“After Iraq and Afghanistan, there has been little appetite for that kind of operation. Iran is not as isolated as it once was. There has been a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia. These are the reasons why I say Trump’s statement is more rhetorical — intended to increase pressure for change within Iran.”
While comparisons with Venezuela fuel anxiety, Tehran’s regional influence makes any direct foreign intervention unlikely — at least for now.
In turbulent times, hope often becomes a strategy.
Amid internal frustrations, a faltering economy, and the shadow of international pressure, ordinary Iranians are left clinging to the hope that cautious diplomacy, rather than confrontation, will chart the path forward.</p><small>2026-01-12 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12143724dff590c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966524/trump-weighing-tough-response-to-iran-crackdown-on-protesters-tehran-says-ready-for-war-but-also-dialogue' target='_blank'><strong>Trump weighing tough response to Iran crackdown on protesters; Tehran says ready for war but also dialogue</strong></a><br><p>Iran is fully prepared for conflict but also ready for negotiations, its foreign minister said on Monday, as US President Donald Trump said the Iranian leadership was seeking talks after he threatened to intervene militarily over a crackdown on protests and that he was weighing a range of strong responses.
The escalating protests in Iran, which began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, now pose one of the biggest challenges to the government since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Trump has warned Iran’s leaders that the United States would attack if security forces open fire on protesters, while Iranian authorities have accused the US and Israel of fomenting unrest.
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, Trump said the US may meet Iranian officials and was in contact with the opposition, as he weighed a range of strong responses, including military options, to the protests.
He said Iran called to negotiate its nuclear programme, which Israel and the US bombed in a 12-day war in June.
“The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters, adding that “a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.”
However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“.
Trump was to meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a US official told Reuters on Sunday.
The Wall Street Journal has reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources.
“The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options,” Trump told reporters.
Following his statement, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran on Monday that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“.
“We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he said.
Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf earlier warned Washington against “a miscalculation.”
“Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards.

 

Near paralysis
In Tehran, an AFP journalist described a city in a state of near paralysis.
The price of meat has nearly doubled since the start of the protests, and many shops are closed. Those that do open must close at around 4:00 or 5:00pm, when security forces deploy en masse.
There were fewer videos showing protests on social media Sunday, but it was not clear to what extent that was due to the internet shutdown.
One widely shared video showed protesters again gathering in the Pounak district of Tehran shouting slogans in favour of the ousted monarchy.
The protests have become one of the biggest challenges to the rule of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, coming in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic republic in June, which was backed by the United States.
State TV has aired images of burning buildings, including a mosque, as well as funeral processions for security personnel.
Iran has not given an official casualty toll for the protests.
After three days of mass actions, state outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic on Sunday.
Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”.
The Iranian government on Sunday declared three days of national mourning for “martyrs” including members of the security forces killed.
President Masoud Pezeshkian also urged Iranians to join a “national resistance march” Monday to denounce the violence.
Trump says he will talk to Musk about restoring internet in Iran​
Trump also said that he plans to speak with billionaire Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran, where authorities have blacked out services for four days.
“He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response to a question about whether he would engage with Musk’s SpaceX company, which offers a satellite internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran.







Musk and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday.
Son of ousted Iran shah urges security forces to ‘stand with the people’
The US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement in the Islamic Republic.
“Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Reza Pahlavi posted on social media.
Pahlavi, who has emerged as an opposition figurehead, also called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag.
“The time has come for them to be adorned with Iran’s national flag, in place of the disgraceful banner of the Islamic Republic,” he said.
In London, protesters managed to swap out the Iranian embassy flag over the weekend, hoisting in its place the tri-coloured banner used under the last Shah.
The ceremonial, pre-revolution flag has become an emblem of the global rallies that have mushroomed in support of Iran’s demonstrations.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador in Tehran on Sunday over the flag swapping, according to the official IRNA outlet.</p><small>2026-01-12 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644615-extreme-cold-wave-pmd-says-mercury-to-remain-in-normal-winter-range' target='_blank'><strong>'Extreme cold wave': PMD says mercury to remain in normal winter range</strong></a><br><p>

The chief minister is currently on a visit to Karachi, where he staged a rally at the Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday.
In an address to the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) in Karachi on Monday, Afridi thanked all the SHCBA members for their warm welcome and generous hospitality, adding that people from all over Pakistan — including Pashtuns, Kashmiris, Balochis — of every school of thought were present there.
In contrast to this welcome from the public, however, he decried the provincial government’s treatment of him and his guests in Karachi, saying that they had “desecrated” the honour of the Sindhi ajrak and topi.







“I think every Sindhi will fully condemn this,” he said amid an outcry of support from the crowd.
The KP CM also criticised the fact that the constitution and law were being “toyed with,” saying that it was not only damaging institutions but the whole of Pakistan.
“On one hand, they are selling our national assets — they auctioned PIA on OLX,” he said, referring to the recent auction of the national airline. “But here they have sold justice.”
Afridi added that the general public at least had hope that the judiciary would provide them justice and stand with them.
He said that, although three judges in Islamabad had issued an order that he be allowed to meet the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, “the jail superintendent picks up this order and throws it away”.
“We are accused of protest politics,” he added. “But our Constitution allows us to do this, so we will do protest politics.”
He further claimed that the judiciary was not cooperating with the party, adding that he had called the chief justice repeatedly but received no answer.
“We are being put against the wall, so the only way left is for us to protest,” he said.
The chief minister affirmed that he would always stand beside those who turned out in support of the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, saying, “We have to fight for our rights ourselves … we will not get freedom on a plate.
“If we do not raise our voice, then more pressure will be put on us.”
Afridi further said that the passport of one province’s chief minister had been blocked, saying that the people of the province were being discriminated against.
However, he added that his leader, Imran, had always supported peaceful struggle.
Regarding the economy, the KP CM said that it was facing a very bad situation, with people “fleeing” Pakistan while unemployment had risen to 7.1 per cent.
“These people are building their properties abroad,” he said, adding, “These people are bound to answer to us and one day it will definitely happen”.
The chief minister told the crowd that he had come to Karachi as his [Imran] leader had directed him to call for a street movement and that he hoped for “full support” from them.
Expressing his thanks, he said, “I hope the rule of law will come to Pakistan one day.”

India will also be invited to join Pax Silica next month, Gor said, referring to a US-led initiative to build a silicon supply chain from critical minerals to semiconductors and AI.
Trade talks between India and the US fell apart last year and Trump then doubled tariffs on Indian goods in August to 50 per cent, among the world’s highest rates, including a levy of 25pc to punish New Delhi for purchasing Russian oil.
The two nations have been close to a deal on several occasions since they agreed to negotiate in February last year, India said last week.
“Both sides continue to actively engage. In fact, the next call on trade will occur tomorrow,” Gor said in New Delhi as he formally took charge of his position, adding that the two countries will continue to work on issues such as security, counterterrorism, energy, technology, education and health.
The failure to reach a deal has pushed the Indian rupee to a record low and spooked investors waiting for progress in two-way negotiations.
Friends always resolve differences: Gor
Gor’s comments brought some cheer to Indian markets, and the benchmark Nifty 50 recovered 220 points to trade 0.15pc higher as of 12:45pm (12:15pm PKT).
Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal, in comments made elsewhere, also said that New Delhi continues to talk to Washington for a trade deal.
“The United States and India are bound not just by shared interests, but by a relationship anchored at the highest level,” Gor said.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier agreed to target a deal by fall 2025, and more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.

 

To bridge the $47 billion goods trade gap, India pledged to buy up to $25 billion in US energy and boost defence imports.
Reuters has reported that New Delhi and Washington were very close to a trade deal last year but a communication breakdown led to the collapse of any potential pact.
“Real friends can disagree, but always resolve their differences in the end,” Gor said.</p><small>2026-01-12 09:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12132649c591c90.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966550/who-is-reza-pahlavi-and-what-are-his-links-to-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Who is Reza Pahlavi — and what are his links to Iran</strong></a><br><p>While Iran has grappled with widespread deadly protests for the past two weeks, Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, has once again emerged as an anti-government figurehead.
The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, before turning against the authorities in Iran, who have governed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. However, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has expressed defiance and blamed the United States.
Pahlavi has urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement. He has also hinted at his plans to return to Iran at a time that he believed was “very near”.
He has even requested US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to get involved if force is used on protesters, to “be ready to intervene to help the people of Iran”.
So what links does Pahlavi have to Iran’s history, and what are the stakes for him in establishing a role in the ongoing crisis?
Born in Tehran on Oct 31, 1960, as the heir to the late Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza and Empress Farah Pahlavi, Reza Pahlavi was officially named crown prince at the age of seven.
He has lived in exile since his father was ousted by the 1979 revolution, a year before he died.

As per his website, Pahlavi left Iran for jet fighter training in the United States Air Force in 1978. “During this same period, the building unrest in Iran led to the royal family’s departure in January 1979,” his website says about his father’s ouster.
Pahlavi completed his higher education with a degree in political science from the University of Southern California. He volunteered to serve Iran’s military as a fighter pilot during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, but was declined by the Islamic regime.
Pahlavi married Yasmine Etemad-Amini on June 12, 1986. They have three daughters (all of whom he has named as his heirs successively): Noor Pahlavi (born April 3, 1992), Iman Pahlavi (born Sept 12, 1993), and Farah Pahlavi (born Jan 17, 2004).
The late shah’s heir has also authored three books: Gozashteh va Ayandeh (Kayhan Publishing, 2000); Winds of Change: The Future of Democracy in Iran (Regnery, 2002); and Iran: L’Heure du Choix [Iran: The Deciding Hour] (Denoël, 2009).
Ties outside Iran
Pahlavi’s website highlights that he remains in touch with “opposition groups, both inside and outside” Iran, and advocates for the establishment of a secular democracy in the country.
“He calls for regime change through non-violent civil disobedience, and for a free and open referendum on a new government of Iran,” the website reads.
While Iran and Israel are arch-enemies under the current regime, they both enjoyed warmer ties under Pahlavi’s father.
In October last year, Israeli-funded online campaigns in the Persian language used fake social media personas and AI to boost Pahlavi’s and destabilise the Iranian regime, parallel investigations by Israeli newspapers and the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab found.

 

During the 12-day Iran-Israel war last year, Pahlavi urged Khamenei to step down “for the sake of the Iranian people”.
In a similar fashion, during the ongoing protests, the late shah’s son called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag, which protesters briefly succeeded in doing so in London.</p><small>2026-01-12 09:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12134832e911b58.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966554/at-37-kohli-reinvents-himself-to-extend-odi-dominance' target='_blank'><strong>At 37, Kohli reinvents himself to extend ODI dominance</strong></a><br><p>Virat Kohli has tweaked his approach to counter-attack early in his innings and put bowlers under pressure to flip the momentum for India, the batting stalwart said after his match-winning knock in Sunday’s one-day international against New Zealand.
The number three batter crafted 93 off 91 balls as India chased down a target of 301 with one over to spare en route to a four-wicket victory in the opener in Vadodara.
After opener Rohit Sharma fell for 26 in the ninth over, Kohli refused to retreat into a defensive shell.
Instead, he took the initiative in a match-defining 118-run stand with skipper Shubman Gill (56), using controlled aggression to force New Zealand’s attack onto the back foot.
“Well, the basic idea is I bat at No.3,” Kohli said after winning the player of the match award.
“So if the situation is a bit tricky, I back myself to counterattack now rather than just trying to play the situation in because some ball has your name on it.”
Batting great Kohli is active internationally only in the 50-overs format.

His masterclass on Sunday was the 37-year-old’s fifth consecutive 50-plus score in ODIs.
In his 17th year in international cricket, he continues to reinvent himself and said he now aims to make the most of the first 20 deliveries after coming in at first drop.
“There’s no point waiting around for too long. But at the same time, you don’t play outrageous shots. You still stick to your strengths, but you back yourself enough to put the opposition on the back foot,” he said.
“I just felt like if I push hard now in the first 20 balls, then we can probably string in a partnership straight after a wicket like Rohit’s where the opposition is going to go on the back foot.
“That actually ended up being the difference in the game.”
India take on New Zealand in the second ODI of the three-match series in Indore on Sunday.

In a rebuttal issued today, the PMD said, “Certain social media platforms are circulating misleading and unverified forecasts claiming an extreme cold wave across Pakistan during the period from Jan 16-25 with record-breaking temperatures in the country.”
The weather body dismissed the reports of extreme weather, stating that “No such extreme or historic cold wave is expected during the mentioned period”.
“According to the latest analysis of numerical weather prediction models and observational data, temperatures are within the normal winter range, with no indication of widespread or persistent record-breaking conditions,” PMD said.
It urged the public to rely on official forecasts, warnings and advisories issued by the PMD.

Separately, Weather Updates PK, an independent weather agency, took to X and said that the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) “has been indicating a large and rare weather scenario since yesterday” — a polar vortex disruption.
A polar vortex is a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding both of the Earth’s poles, according to the US National Weather Service.
ECMWF is a service that provides global numerical weather predictions.
It said the forecast had drawn attention on social media, with some platforms claiming that “due to severe Arctic cold winds, record-breaking negative temperature anomalies could be observed in southern Pakistan, including Karachi and its surroundings.”







Weather Updates PK clarified that the forecast made by ECMWF was “long range“ and subject to “change with each passing day”.
The weather body said that no other weather models had yet confirmed the forecast, stating that it was “not right to take it seriously”.
It further added: “However, it is true that a western disturbance is expected between January 18 and 20 […] usually, every western system is followed by a cold wave; however, there is no final confirmation about its intensity yet”.</p><small>2026-01-12 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121058504f27e6c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966546/motorways-now-open-for-traffic-say-police-following-partial-closure-due-to-dense-fog-conditions' target='_blank'><strong>Motorways now open for traffic, say police following partial closure due to dense fog conditions</strong></a><br><p>The motorway police have said that all motorways under its jurisdiction have been opened for traffic, after dense fog conditions prompted partial closure of several motorways early on Monday.
In a post on X, the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) said, “All motorways falling under the jurisdiction of the NHMP have been opened for traffic upon improved visibility”.







Earlier, due to dense and persistent fog conditions, the motorway police had partially closed various key motorways, including sections of the M-2, M-3, M-4, M-5, and M-11.
At 10:25am on Monday, NHMP said on its X account that the M-2 motorway had been closed from Thokar Niaz Baig to Sial Mor, the M-3 motorway remained closed from Faisal Pur to Darakhana, and the M-4 motorway is closed from Shershah to Pindi Bhattian.
While the M-5 motorway is closed from Shershah to Zaheer Peer, and the M-11 motorway is closed from Lahore to Sambrial.







Earlier, the NHMP said that Motorway M-5 was closed from Rohri to Rahim Yar Khan, but it had now been opened due to “improved visibility”.







According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department’s fog forecast, the M-2 (Pindi Bhattian-Lahore), M-3 (Lahore - Abdul Hakim), M-11 (Sialkot - Lahore), M-4 (Pindi Bhattian - Faisalabad), and M-5 (Multan - Sukkur) were expected to remain in “dense“ fog situation till 11am.



Last week, three people were killed, and 34 others were injured in fog-related accidents in various parts of Punjab.
On January 7, dense fog paralysed road traffic across large parts of Punjab, prompting authorities to close several key motorways.
According to a spokesperson for the NHMP Central Region, the M-4 Motorway from Gojra to Abdul Hakeem and the M-11 Lahore-Sialkot Motorway were closed for all traffic due to severely reduced visibility.</p><small>2026-01-12 08:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121221216509650.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966548/australia-moves-india-3-other-countries-to-highest-risk-category-for-student-visas-media' target='_blank'><strong>Australia moves India, 3 other countries to ‘highest risk’ category for student visas: media</strong></a><br><p>Australia has tightened checks for student visa applicants from India, moving it to the ‘highest risk’ category along with Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan, according to Australian and Indian media.
The Times of India reported on Sunday that the re-rating of the countries was out of cycle, quoting Australian media, while the administration said this was triggered by “emerging integrity risks”.
According to the TOI report, the administration did not cite any specific reason for which India had been assigned to a new category. However, it added that the move came after reports of “fake degree busts” in India which had reached international media.







“India alone accounts for almost 140,000 of Australia’s 650,000 international students, and the four nations represent nearly one-third of 2025 enrolments,” the Indian outlet said.
Impact on students
Assessment levels influence not only the documentary burden but also how easily prospective students can plan to study in Australia, according to The Australia Today.
“Higher levels typically require more extensive proof of finances, English proficiency and genuine temporary entrant intentions, among other criteria. These changes can slow processing times, increase applicant costs and discourage applicants if perceived as overly burdensome,” it said.
It added that international education stakeholder groups had stressed that clarity and predictability are essential, especially for countries that contribute significant student numbers and economic activity.
India, in particular, is one of Australia’s largest source markets for international students, it added.
According to the Australian outlet, experts say the latest changes may lead to closer scrutiny of applications from South Asia, but also stress that genuine students still have pathways to study in Australia.
The Australian Department of Education and Home Affairs is expected to publish detailed guidance for providers and agents explaining the basis for the updates and how documentation requirements will be implemented in practice, it said.
“The sector will be watching closely for official documents that could explain whether the Assessment Level changes are temporary or if they signal a longer-term shift in how Australia manages risk across major international student source markets,” it added.
Fraudulent applications
“Authorities have seen evidence of a rise in suspected fraudulent documentation — both financial and academic — from certain source countries during recent visits to South Asia,” The Australia Today said.
Australia’s Minister for International Education Julian Hill, reportedly described Australia as having become “the least worst country of choice amongst the Big Four” destinations for international students — referring to global competitors such as the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.
Hill said that this had prompted a stronger emphasis on documentary evidence and risk filtering to protect visa integrity, the Australian outlet reported.
Meanwhile, The Times of India said that according to experts, Australia now remained the only option among these destinations, as the US, UK and Canada were shutting their doors to foreign students.
“It recently became obvious that student applicants who couldn’t get into those other three countries are increasingly applying to come to Australia, and in many cases we’ve seen an increase in fraudulent financial and academic documents,” TOI quoted Phil Honeywood, chief executive officer of the International Education Association of Australia (IEAA), as saying.
“By placing a number of these countries into the highest risk rating level, it automatically enhances any filtering of the student visa applicants to ensure bona fide study motivation.”
Concerns over ambiguity
While some in the sector acknowledge the importance of maintaining rigour against fraud, the sudden jump in assessment levels — particularly the broad move of multiple large source countries such as India and Bangladesh to AL3 — has prompted questions about how risk is being measured and communicated.
The Australia Today reported that Honeywood had raised concerns about the timing and frequency of assessment level changes.
He said that ambiguity around shifting risk categories was affecting education providers at a critical point in the academic calendar during the first intake of 2026.
According to the outlet, he said that he had had a “long discussion” with Minister Hill about the sector’s concerns, “primarily with two aspects of the assessment level changes”.
“First and foremost, the frequency of change is causing confusion among providers here and agents offshore. Secondly, at the very time we are trying to ensure a good start to the year intake, we appear again as though we are not quite sure which countries we seek to recruit from.”
Honeywood added that educational institutions needed stability and clear policy signals to properly plan recruitment efforts, liaise with agents and support prospective students trying to understand evolving visa requirements, the outlet added.</p><small>2026-01-12 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644569-who-got-what-fresh-toshakhana-records-emerge' target='_blank'><strong>Who got what: Fresh Toshakhana records emerge</strong></a><br><p>

The threatening social media post drew an angry retort from Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who said “no one” would tell his country what to do.
Washington has imposed economy-crippling sanctions on its island neighbour for decades, but Trump has ramped up the pressure in recent days.

 

US special forces seized Maduro and his wife this month in a lightning raid that left dozens of the ousted Venezuelan president’s security personnel dead — many of whom were Cuban.
Though Maduro’s allies have become interim leaders, Trump has claimed the United States now actually controls Venezuela through a US naval blockade of its vital oil sector.
“THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
“I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.”
He said, “Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services’ for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!” “Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last week’s U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn’t need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years.”







Trump provided almost no details about what potential deal he referred to, or what such an arrangement would achieve.
Asked about it later on Sunday, Trump told reporters travelling with him on Air Force One that he wanted people forced out of Cuba or who “left under duress” to be taken care of.
“Most importantly, right now, we’re going to take care of the people that came from Cuba, that are American citizens, or in our country,” Trump said, without clarifying how this would be achieved under a deal with Havana.
‘Ready to fall’
A week ago, Trump stated that “Cuba is ready to fall,” noting that the island’s economic crisis was worsening and it would be difficult for Havana to “hold out” without receiving heavily subsidised Venezuelan oil.
Earlier on Sunday, the president reposted a message that jokingly suggested US Secretary of State Marco Rubio — a child of Cuban immigrants who concurrently holds the posts of national security advisor, acting head of the US archives, and acting international aid administrator — could also become the president of Cuba.
Trump shared that post with the comment: “Sounds good to me!” Cuba’s president rebuffed Trump’s threatening language, saying the Caribbean island’s residents were “ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.” “Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation. No one tells us what to do,” Diaz-Canel wrote on X.
Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez also weighed in to stress that Cuba is within its rights to import fuel from any willing exporter, “without interference or subordination to the unilateral coercive measures of the United States.”
‘Talk, talk, talk’
A Cold War-era US trade embargo has cinched Cuba’s economy beginning in 1962, and since 2000 Havana has increasingly relied on Venezuelan oil provided as part of a deal struck with Maduro’s predecessor, the firebrand leftist Hugo Chavez.
On Sunday in the streets of Havana, retiree Mercedes Simon seemed to dismiss the US leader’s latest bluster.
“Trump is not going to touch Cuba,” the 65-year-old told AFP.
“All the presidents talk, talk, talk” about Cuba, for decades, “but they don’t act.” Marcos Sanchez, a 21-year-old working in the restaurant business, said the two countries should find common ground, “without resorting to violence.”
Trump’s provocative language on Cuba comes as the emboldened American leader has hinted he has other countries in his sights after capturing Maduro.
Trump, who had openly sought last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, has recently threatened Colombia, Mexico, Iran and Greenland.
Some Republican US lawmakers on Sunday lauded Trump for his aggressive comments on Cuba, including Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart from Florida.
“The tyranny in Cuba will not survive the second term of President Trump,” Diaz-Balart posted in Spanish on X, “and Cuba will finally be free after decades of misery, tragedy, and pain.”

However, he was unaware that the wedding ceremony of his younger son would bring lifelong pain and grief, costing him almost all his close relatives.
An explosion reportedly caused by gas leakage killed at least eight people, including four of Mr Masih immediate family members, in Sector G-7 of the federal capital and left several others injured on Sunday morning.

Talking to media persons, Hanif said he was in a room constructed adjacent to the house, while all other family members were inside the main house.

What began as a wedding celebration for Hanif Masih ended in tragedy when a gas blast in G-7 sectordestroyed his family

“At around 7:15am, I heard a blast. I rushed towards the house and saw that everything had been destroyed. A large number of guests were already present because of my son’s marriage ceremony. Due to the blast, I have lost many relatives, including my newlywed son, his wife, my wife and my other daughter-in-law, while my daughter has been seriously injured,” he said.
Replying to a question, he said that since the guests had remained awake until around 3am, most of them were sleeping at the time of the incident.

Sohail Romi, who was present at the site of the incident, told Dawn that both the bride and groom were his relatives.
“The baraat had arrived from Gujrat on Saturday night at 66 Quarters in G-7/2, Islamabad, and the walima reception was scheduled for Sunday noon. To my knowledge, the gas remained open during the night, and in the morning someone lit a matchstick, which caused the gas to catch fire and led to the explosion,” he said.
Mr Romi, who is also the General Secretary of the PPP Minority Wing Rawalpindi, said the bride’s family had already booked a bus from Gujrat to attend the walima and had planned to take the bride with them for a few days.

“However, after receiving the tragic news, they delayed their departure from Gujrat and reached Islamabad by 3pm in the same bus. It was decided to bury six bodies on Sunday at the Christian graveyard in Sector H-8. The remaining two bodies were to be buried on Monday [today],” he said.
William Pervez, a resident of the area, told Dawn that the worst affected was Yaqoob Masih, a resident of a neighbouring house, who lost his two sons.
“Yaqoob was out of the city. His two sons were sleeping in their house when the roof suddenly collapsed due to the blast, killing both on the spot. It was decided that the burial of Yaqoob’s two sons would be held on Monday [today],” he said.

Body cameras, or bodycams, are wearable audio and video recording devices used to capture footage of official action for evidence.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Friday announced her decision to make bodycams mandatory for nurses, ward boys, security guards, and pharmacy staff, except doctors, upon receiving complaints from the public regarding the behaviour and negligent attitude of hospitals.
Last month, Lahore’s Nishtar Hospital sacked a doctor working as an additional house officer for misbehaving with a patient’s family, a video of which had gone viral on social media. An inquiry committee was also formed to probe the incident.
‘Unbelievable’ move
Officials have taken strong exception to the move, terming it hasty, ill-conceived, and a direct violation of patients’ fundamental rights.
“This is unbelievable. If at all this is decided and practically applied, it will not be a useful technique to improve the health delivery system,” Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) President Dr Izhar Ahmed Chaudhry told Dawn. “It will bounce back and give a bad name to the government.”
He maintained the government had not consulted anyone or any forum at any level and termed the decision “illogical, impractical and insane,” which was “against fundamental rights of patients as well as the health professionals.“
“It violates essential privacy of patients and professional liberty and confidentiality of the health professionals during treatment, which is mandatory and cannot be violated under the law,” he added.
In Chaudhry’s view, instead of taking measures to improve the current deteriorating conditions in the health sector and make it free for all, the government was creating situations and endangering lives and the very existence of health professionals.
He said that the government decided “to sell out the health institutions and deliberately make the working conditions miserable with each passing day.”
‘Useless act’
For Young Doctors Association (YDA) Punjab President Dr Shoaib Niazi, the decision was a “useless act” for which he was “not consulted”.
“I was not consulted at all. This decision came from the higher-ups, and it’s a useless act,” he said, adding that similar decisions, for example, a prohibition on the use of mobile phones on duty was imposed on hospital staff, but it was not implemented.
“This move will compromise patient privacy and confidentiality. For example, in the gynaecology and labour wards. The footage will go to the IT department, and anyone can access it with patients’ consent,” Niazi said.
Raising questions on the source of funding for the bodycams, Niazi said the “security guards have not been paid salaries for the last three months in Mayo Hospital. How will the government provide bodycams? How will they implement such a structure? Where will the money come from?”
He further said that there would be no “honest opinion” because of body cameras, adding that the government had taken the decision without consulting him, and it was expected that the next step would be make bodycams mandatory for doctors.
The YDA Punjab president said he would hold a press conference related to the issue soon, and he would speak in detail about it.
‘Unable to understand use, but will follow orders’
According to the Punjab Young Nurses Association Member and a staffer at Children’s Hospital Lahore, Muqaddas Tasneem, nurses were a major stakeholder in the decision, but none of them were consulted.
“The govt didnt consult us at all and decided on its own. However, we have to follow the orders and act upon the directions,” she said.
Junaid Tariq, the president of Allied Health Sciences — an alliance of ward boys and other staff members, except nurses at the Lahore General Hospital — voiced similar concerns, saying he or other members from the alliance were not informed or consulted at all.
“The govt has not consulted stakeholders. We are unable to understand the purpose of this order. It fits in with the responsibilities of security guards, but it will compromise the privacy of patients. It will compromise the confidentiality of patients’ medical records. The nature of our work does not relate to security,” he said.
‘Inconceivable decision’
Speaking to Dawn, former Punjab caretaker minister for health and ex- vice-chancellor of the University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Dr Javed Akram said he did not have any knowledge of the decision, saying it was “not possible that something like this will happen as it was inconceivable. How will they do it to so many people?”
Dr Akram raised multiple questions on the practical aspect of the decision: “How will they watch or analyse those [healthcare officials] with bodycams? What if the employees with cams have to go to rest rooms? Will they take the cam off each time?”
Worldwide practice limited to security staff
There are very few countries in the world that allow bodycams to be used or trialled for hospital staff, but it’s not widespread and is usually limited to security staff or situations with high risks of violence, not everyday clinical care.
For example, New South Wales (NSW) Health in Australia is running official trials of body‑worn cameras in public hospitals, equipping security staff with them in selected hospitals to record incidents of aggression or violence for safety and deterrence.
In the United Kingdom, some NHS trusts in England, including East Sussex cases like Conquest Hospital and Eastbourne District General Hospital, have trialled body‑worn cameras for staff (mostly security and senior nurses) to deter abuse and violence. However, such a blanket decision has not been announced anywhere in the world.</p><small>2026-01-12 05:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12094434790bf94.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966544/bannu-ctd-kills-two-terrorists-in-ibo' target='_blank'><strong>Bannu CTD kills two terrorists in IBO</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: During ongoing operations against militants in Bannu, the Counter-Terrorism Department’s Bannu region, in coordination with local police, carried out a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO), killing two terrorists.
According to police, the operation was conducted within the jurisdiction of Mirakhel Police Station on Jhandokhel Road near Shagi Machankhel.
Acting on credible intelligence, CTD Bannu’s Special Weapons and Tactics teams, along with Bannu Police, cordoned off the area and launched the operation. During the action, the terrorists opened fire, prompting effective retaliatory fire by the police and CTD personnel.
Following an exchange of fire, two terrorists were found dead during a search operation. They were identified as Suhail Khan alias Sangri and Ismail alias Usman.
Police stated that both terrorists were involved in attacks on Sheikh Landik and Fateh Khel police check posts, in which eight police constables were injured. They were also involved in attacks on security forces’ convoys and an IED attack on the under-construction Rescue 1122 building.
Weapons and ammunition recovered from the slain terrorists included two Kalashnikov rifles, one pistol, multiple rounds of ammunition, a motorcycle, two mobile phones, two national identity cards, and a card belonging to the proscribed TTP.
Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Zulfiqar Hameed, along with the Additional IG CTD, commended the Bannu Police and CTD SWAT teams for the successful operation.
The IGP KP stated that intelligence-based targeted operations will continue uninterrupted across the province until terrorism is completely eliminated.
In a separate incident, militants launched an attack on the Nala Kasho police checkpost, using light and heavy weapons.
However, the attack was foiled after retaliatory action by police personnel.
As soon as information about the attack was received, police contingents from Domel and Town Police Station, along with other security forces, immediately reached the site of the incident.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during 2025, according to the “Pakistan Security Report 2025” report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS).
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.</p><small>2026-01-12 04:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/69646ddea5ced.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966531/macabre-concessions-at-sost-dry-port' target='_blank'><strong>Macabre concessions at Sost Dry Port</strong></a><br><p>Despite complaints by some disgruntled residents, the Pakistani government has always endeavored to take cognizance of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) issues and resolve them. Sost Dry Port in GB is a crucial trade hub, primarily facilitating trade between China and Pakistan.
Recently, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) issued statutory regulatory order (SRO) 2488 ostensibly to placate the protests of some residents of GB. The SRO states, “Sales tax, income tax, and federal excise duty payable on imports covered under this notification shall not be levied”.
The notified SRO — which could damage the textile sector — was issued on January 1, 2026. As per the SRO, “The benefit of non-levy of sales tax, income tax, and federal excise duty shall be extended by the Collector of Customs on a ‘first come, first serve’ basis within the approved quota limit for goods imported for consumption within the GB region”.
The icing on the cake is that “The GB government shall ensure that all goods imported under this notification are exclusively used within [its] territory”. How? Does GB administration have the critical mass to ‘ensure’ that the facility will not be abused? In addition, “Special procedures shall also be devised by the FBR to effectively identify, track, and clear goods which are imported via Sost for the rest of the country from the goods cleared under this notification.” But, how effective have policies like this been in the past?

‘Past experience clearly demonstrates that similar region-specific tax concession regimes have been repeatedly misused’

The SRO covers every item and gives carte blanche to GB traders to buy whatever they want from China and get it cleared at Sost Dry Port. Notwithstanding the fact that bilateral trade figures between Pakistan and China are heavily tilted in favour of China, this new open permission could further widen the trade gap.
The SRO specified, “The cumulative amounts of sales tax, income tax, and federal excise duty as chargeable under the Sales Tax, 1990 (VII of 1990), Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, and Federal Excise Act, 2005 shall not exceed the limit of Rs4 billion in a fiscal year, as calculated in the Customs Computerised Clearance System.” A generous and merciful assurance for the trade and industry of Pakistan.
Facilitating and encouraging residents are responsibilities of the state, but the modus operandi should always be that other provinces or areas should not be affected. The draft SRO was issued at the fag end of 2025 and, surprisingly, the FBR only allowed three days for objections or comments (25th was a national holiday, 26th was a Friday when establishments in many areas remained closed or worked half the day, and 27th was a Saturday).
Trade and Industry representatives are up in arms and term this SRO as sounding the death knell for Pakistani industries. Take textile, for example. There are 236 importable textile items. Anwer Aziz, Regional Chairman, All Pakistan Textile Processing Mills Association, took exception to allowing textile products, especially those manufactured domestically and sold to local and foreign customers. As an example, he remarked that unbleached and bleached fabrics will enjoy the benefits of the SRO.
Mr Aziz asked, “How many textile processing mills are based in GB?” He added that despite so-called firewalls to check the inflow of imports, there is no guarantee that these fabrics would not find a way to Faisalabad, Lahore, or Karachi, as is the norm under the Afghan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement.
Although facilitating GB traders is welcomed, the point is that this facility should also be provided for local manufacturers to sell to GB under exempted sales tax and other taxes. If the cap of Rs4bn is enforced, then local goods could be categorised as ‘exports’ to GB and enjoy the exemptions. There is always the apprehension that this cap could be enhanced in the future to mollify protestors. A senior industrialist noted that the Rs4bn exemptions translate into imports of Rs16–18bn, about $65m. Do GB denizens have the capacity to buy this imported quantity?
Anjum Nisar, former chairman of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry, said, “Past experience clearly demonstrates that similar region-specific tax concession regimes have been repeatedly misused. Earlier exemptions granted to erstwhile federally and provincially administered tribal regions were also subject to conditions and monitoring requirements, yet duty- and tax-free goods found their way across the country, damaging local industries, and causing significant revenue losses.”

Usually, temperatures drop to minus degree Celsius in the twin cities in December and January, but this year it remained between 1 and 2 degrees. However, Sunday was the coldest day recorded so far in the current season by Pakistan Meteorological Department.
The coldest ever day in Islamabad was recorded on December 15, 1984, when the temperature dropped to -4.3 degrees.
“It was the coldest day of this winter season as temperature dropped to zero degree Celsius on January 11,” said the forecasting officer at Met Office while talking to Dawn.
She said that the temperature was likely to rise in the next 24 hours due to clouds and fog. Frost and fog are likely to grip the twin cities in different patches.

Temperature drops to zero degree in twin cities

She said there were no chances of further cold wave from the north, adding the intensity of the cold would decrease in coming week.
“Continental air is prevailing over most parts of the country, whereas a shallow westerly wave is likely to prevail over western and upper parts of the country on Monday,” she said.

 

The official said mainly cold and dry weather was expected over most parts of the country, while very cold in hilly areas. However, she said partly cloudy weather was expected in upper parts with chances of light rain/light snow in Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir and adjoining areas.
“Moderate to dense fog is likely to persist over Punjab, upper Sindh and plain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Frost may occur at isolated places in Potohar region and Kashmir during morning hours,” she said.
The Met Office recorded the lowest minimum temperature in Skardu -14 degrees - Leh -13, Astore -11, Gupis -09, Gilgit -08, Ziarat, Qalat -07, Kalam, Hunza -06, Dera, Rawalakot and Parachinar -04 degree Celsius.
Meanwhile, the residents faced problems due to low gas pressure in many parts of the garrison city. Many people were using gas compressors, adding to hardships of others.
Due to the biting cold, children and elderly people are getting fever and other cold ailments.
Meanwhile, the number of people complaining of cold-related ailments has also shot up in the last few days. Doctors say most of the patients were children and elderly persons.
According to doctors, people should increase intake of liquid, especially soup and cover their heads and ears to beat the cold. On the other hand, the cold wave has increased the sale of winter dishes and other edibles.
However, unlike the past years when stalls of traditional food items at Bhabara Bazaar, Saddar and Commercial Market pulled crowds, no such rush has been seen in these areas due to high prices.

The project titled “Punjab Affordable Housing Programme (PAHP)” — a World Bank-funded hybrid housing scheme worth US$250 million over five years, has been designed to strengthen housing institutions and significantly enhance the quantity and quality of affordable housing in Punjab.
“The PAHP targets delivery of 37,000 housing units, of which 20,000 units will be constructed on state land using World Bank financing, while the remaining units will be delivered through private sector engagement, ensuring a blended and sustainable delivery model,” says an internal report presented to the Punjab government.
The project implementation is being carried out through a structured institutional arrangement by Urban Unit and the Punjab Housing & Town Planning Agency (PH&TPA) via the Programme Management & Implementation Unit (PMIU). To ensure implementation readiness, 41 state-owned sites across Punjab have been identified with the help of land record and revenue authorities.
Comprehensive field verification has been completed whereas district administrations have also been taken on board as required under the World Bank protocols for establishing a strong foundation for phased execution.
The report further states that in a bid to raise the depleting water table, the government, in principle, has decided to construct as many as 1,000 groundwater recharge wells across the province this year.

41 govt-owned sites identified across province for the WB-funded hybrid project

The construction of wells will be initiated by the Water and Sanitation Agencies (Wasas) in all districts. The initiative introduces modern engineering solutions to address declining groundwater tables caused by urbanisation and excessive extraction.
The programme has already been initiated in Lahore as a pilot project and is planned for expansion across all districts under a phased manner, ensuring province-wide impact. In Lahore, three recharge wells have already been made functional and more than 15 locations would soon have more wells.
The report states that the Parks and Horticulture Authorities (PHAs) in several districts have been assigned the task to lower greenbelts — a smart engineering approach to address urban flooding challenges associated with conventional greenbelt designs. In Lahore, the work has been kicked off formally.
“Traditionally, the elevated greenbelts along roads and highways have unintentionally contributed to waterlogging during heavy rainfall, as excessive height restricts natural drainage and causes rainwater to accumulate on road surfaces. Recognising this challenge, the government has shifted towards scientifically designed greenbelts that support effective storm water management,” the report explains, adding that all new greenbelts developed across Punjab will be constructed at optimised, lower levels, in accordance with international best practices, to facilitate natural water flow and reduce urban flooding risks. “This approach ensures that environmental objectives are achieved without compromising existing infrastructure or causing avoidable disruption.”
It says that the work on Lungs of Lahore & Ring Road Forestation project —a pioneering, environment-friendly initiative aimed at combating smog, improving air quality, and promoting sustainable urban development has been accelerated, as it reflects a proactive and science-based response to Lahore’s long-standing environmental challenges.
The project envisages the creation of a forest-like green boundary around Lahore through large-scale ring forestation, establishing a natural environmental buffer against air pollution and unchecked urban sprawl.
“This project is designed to serve as a permanent ecological asset for the city, positioning Lahore among global cities adopting nature-based solutions for environmental resilience,” the report reads. The project is also planned to be replicated by the PHAs in other districts.
It further states that Punjab’s flagship housing initiative, Apni Chhat Apna Ghar (ACAG), has achieved a major milestone with the completion of over 50,000 homes in 2025, marking a significant step toward addressing Punjab’s long-standing housing deficit for low-income families. The programme provides zero-interest, zero-fee housing loans, reflecting a strong commitment to affordability and financial inclusion. It has demonstrated social outreach, with widows, persons with disabilities, and minority community families among direct beneficiaries.
It mentioned that the Apni Zameen Apna Ghar (AZAG) programme has also been launched to secure land ownership for landless families. The digital-first approach enabled as many as 367,000 people to apply online across Punjab. The programme entered its implementation phase with first-digital balloting of 2,000 free residential plots across 19 districts including Kasur, Faisalabad, Attock, Sargodha, Jhelum, Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin Chiniot, Jhang, Okara, Bhakkar, Khushab, Layyah, Vehari, Lodhran, Sahiwal, Rajanpur, Bahawalpur and Bahawalnagar.

“Once normal supply levels resume, pressure tightness is anticipated to ease, restoring full service to households across Sindh and Balochistan,” it said.
A gas utility spokesperson said that as an unexpected cold snap swept across Pakistan, households in Sindh and Balochistan faced a sudden surge in natural gas demand, pushing the SSGC into emergency measures to protect the domestic supply.
She said that the winter spike, driven largely by increased use of geysers and space heaters, raised overall consumption by roughly 10per cent. “To bridge the gap, SSGC diverted about 90MMCFD of reliquefied natural gas into the network,” she said.
However, the spokesperson said a rapid temperature drop in recent days caused a further, unanticipated rise in household demand, extending cooking hours and intensifying morning and evening peaks.
She said that an upstream technical issue cut supply by an estimated 30MMCFD, compounding the situation and creating a shortfall that lowered distribution pressures in several tail-end localities.
“In response, SSGC activated its government-approved load management plan, which includes curtailing gas to fertiliser plants and enforcing weekly industrial closures to prioritise residential consumers,” she added.
The spokesperson said that domestic supply remained the gas utility’s first priority, in line with the prime minister’s directives and the approved load management framework. “The company pledges to maintain uninterrupted service from 5 am to 10pm daily, while deploying special 24-hour teams to address low-pressure complaints across the franchise areas,” she added.

Speaking at a party workers’ convention at Kamoke, around 50km from Lahore, he said that the IPP has launched a movement for creation of smaller provinces as an immediate and sustainable solution to problems of people living in far-flung areas.
“We will not change the names of provinces; new provinces should be created like in Punjab as North, South, West, and East Punjab. For this purpose, political parties must rise above narrow-mindedness and show magnanimity as it is in everyone’s own interest,” he said.

 

Welcoming support from MQM and other political parties for the proposal of new provinces, he said this would save people’s time and energy and allow their issues to be resolved closer to their doorstep.

Parties must show magnanimity to back the proposal: Aleem

He said that not only Punjab, but Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should also be divided into four provinces each with a new name.
The IPP leader announced linking cities of Kamoke and Gujranwala with the Lahore-Sialkot-Kharian Motorway which will provide these cities access to Islamabad via the Motorway network.
He also announced widening of this Motorway from four to six lanes which will benefit Gujranwala division in general and Kamoke city in particular.
The minister said that the prime minister would be invited to Kamoke and Gujranwala to inaugurate the link Motorway. He said the communications department has carried out important development works in Kamoke, including U-turns and that further projects will be added in future.
He demanded fixing of the minimum price of wheat for farmers at Rs4,000 per maund. He said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should take personal interest in reducing tax rates for the business community so that wheels of industry can move faster.
He said the youth are our future and providing them with dignified employment is our national responsibility.
If all-round development takes place, jobs will be created for the youth through the private sector for which business activities must be accelerated.
The minister also praised the leadership of the Pakistan armed forces for humbling the enemy and earning global respect for the country.

The significant delay in utilising the loan is mainly due to the failure of the Tranche III road project to begin, resulting from controversies in the bidding process discussed in five parliamentary standing committee meetings.
Without immediate acc­ele­ration by the National Highway Authority (NHA), the funds will expire without the completion of the Tranche-III road project, which involves widening sections of the N55 Highway.
In a letter seen by Dawn, the ADB warned the economic affairs division that based on current progress, there was a significant risk the approved $360m under the Multi-tranche Finan­cing Facility (MFF) would not be fully utilised by the expiration date of Dec 31, 2027.
The project has been stalled for eight months following controversies surrounding the bidding process.
Although bids were opened in February 2025 and approved by the ADB shortly thereafter, the process faced scrutiny from five parliamentary panels and Public Procurement Regulatory Authority.
Despite the administrative hurdles, the Islamabad High Court recently ordered that work be awarded without further delay. The court noted that continued stalling could result in loan cancellation, cost escalation and “serious reputational damage” to the national exchequer.
The total of the project cost is estimated at Rs170bn, which includes land acquisition, consultancy and taxes while the lowest bid received by the NHA for the project was of Rs147 billion.
The ADB covers Rs108bn of the total, with the government of Pakistan funding the remaining balance.
Officials indicate the NHA is in a difficult position regarding fund utilisation. Rebidding is considered unfeasible, as obtaining new approvals from the ADB and Ecnec would take more time, while the ADB stressed that its 2027 deadline is “firm, with no possibility of extension”.
“We seek EAD’s support in assisting NHA to expedite implementation, complete pending procurements, and ensure full utilisation of the loan proceeds within the MFF period,” the ADB stated.
The Ecnec has approved the bids from a joint venture comprising NXCC, Dynamic Constructor and Rustam Associates even though parliamentary committees and the PPRA expressed concerns.
The NHA defended the choice, stating that allegations of non-performance against the lead partner “did not reach finality in accordance with the procedure and rules”, and the firm was never blacklisted by any agency.
The ADB confirmed it has no objection to awarding the contracts to the lowest evaluated bidder across four specific lots:
Lot 1: Rajanpur to Jam­pur (57.5km) for Rs23.5bn; Lot 2: Jampur to Dera Gh­azi Khan (64km) for Rs29.1bn; Lot 3: Dera Ghazi Khan to Tibi Qaisrani (111.7km) for Rs52bn; Lot 4: Tibi Qaisrani to Dera Ismail Khan (96.2km) for Rs42bn.
IHC rejected PPRA’s petition on the Rs172bn Carec Tranch-III award to JV. In its verdict, the court warned that the regulator’s recent decisions “may also lead to the refusal of the finance facility agreed by the ADB,” and declared the petitions infructuous.

PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident.
The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted.
At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage.
The authorities had provided the video clips and the pictures of CM Afridi, former provincial ministers Taimur Saleem Jhagra and Kamran Bangash, and two other PTI leaders, Irfan Saleem and Amir Khan Chamkani, for analysis. None of them had been nominated in the case.
In the report, the PFSA gave its opinion on two points: whether the videos in the USB were genuine and whether the persons whose profile pictures had been shared appeared in the clips. It said the five individuals, including the CM, were seen in the clips, but did not clarify if the videos were related to the Radio Pakistan attack or any other event.
It, however, said the clips were not edited except for the merger of multiple video clips of different camera views.
A legal expert, privy to the case, said the investigating officer, after this ‘evidence’ could nominate more accused through a supplementary report to the ATC. However, the court can also take cognisance of the matter. Similarly, the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) could also submit an application for the inclusion of the accused persons in light of the forensic report.
‘Unrelated clips’
Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad.
PTI leader Taimur Jhagra said it was interesting that this campaign was against the CM and other individuals never nominated in this case. “The posts with screenshots are very interesting because they have nothing to do with Radio Pakistan. I believe the Punjab lab is simply commenting on whether it thinks the videos are genuine or not. My first video screenshot is of a video that is not even shot in Peshawar… The video is of my condemnation of Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, while in Islamabad,” he mentioned.
The ATC has fixed Jan 26 for the next hearing in the trial.
The ATC is conducting the trial, with 75 accused, including some present and former lawmakers, being indicted on June 3, 2025, on multiple counts. The FIR was registered at the East Cantonment police station on May 10, 2023.
‘Irrefutable evidence’
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that the incidents involving arson attacks on Radio Pakistan and toll plazas by the PTI in Peshawar were part of a well-planned conspiracy, and “irrefutable evidence” has surfaced in the forensic report.
Ms Bokhari said the report included a complete forensic analysis of the Peshawar incidents, supported by videos and photographic evidence. She stated that all this evidence was admissible in any court of law, and those involved in rioting would be brought to justice.

The opposition leader issue is expected to resurface after PTI’s Omar Ayub withdrew his petitions in the Supreme Court and high courts against his removal.
Before the petition was withdrawn, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said he couldn’t begin the appointment process as the issue was sub judice.

 

With the summoning of the assembly, Speaker Sadiq is expected to ask the opposition to follow the process for appointing a new leader.
The opposition has repe­atedly accused the government of delaying the appo­intment process and nominated Pasht­unkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Achakzai as the opposition leader.
Rule 39 of the “Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly 2007” confirms it is the sole prerogative of the speaker to ask the opposition at any time to submit a name, after which the opposition may present it.
However, the opposition has already submitted the name of Achakzai to the speaker’s office rather than presenting it to the speaker personally.
The rule also states the speaker must verify the signatures of all opposition members voting in favour of the candidate.
Rule 39, titled “Decla­ration of Leader of the Opposition,” states that after each general election — and at any time thereafter — the National Assembly speaker must declare the opposition leader as soon as possible following the election of the prime minister.

• Seeks tariff overhaul to lift exports beyond $60bn in three years
• Highlights cross-cutting barriers across 20 export products
• Notes ‘policy unpredictability’ undermines investor, buyer confidence               
ISLAMABAD: A body constituted by the prime minister and led by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal has called for urgent reforms to improve the ease of doing business and for a serious restructuring and rationalisation of tariffs — both energy prices and trade duties — to more than double exports to over $60 billion within three years.
The committee was formed to devise a strategy for avoiding another IMF programme once the current $8.4bn arrangement expires at the end of 2027, amid mounting pressure from persistently weak economic indicators.
According to synopses compiled after week-long consultations with public and private sector stakeholders from Jan 5 to 9, the panel concluded that the current state of affairs was not capable of driving a fast-growing population of 250 million towards sustained prosperity because of cross-cutting constra­ints affecting “all 20 priority export products and six export drivers”.
Ironically, most of these constraints are generally well known, but the government’s inability, despite special interventions here and there, including through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), to create a conducive working environment in a fair, equitable, rule-based and transparent manner, has hampered sustainable growth path beyond stabilisation under a restrictive programme volunteered to the IMF.
The plan proposed easing electricity and gas prices through debt refinancing and rationalising price build-ups. It was found that “export competitiveness is undermined by high and volatile energy costs, with electricity and gas tariffs remaining above regional benchmarks and subject to frequent changes”.
It warned that volatility was inflating production costs across manufacturing, agro-processing, minerals, fisheries, and services, eroding margins and diverting orders to competing countries.
The Planning Commission also pointed out that the cost of doing business in Pakistan remained “structurally high due to fragmented and distortionary taxation, inverted input tariffs, advance income tax deductions, delayed sales tax refunds and persistent working capital lockups”.
It said these issues disproportionately affected exporters and were particularly binding for small and medium enterprises across manufacturing and agri-based value chains.
The panel said that policy unpredictability was also weakening investment and buyer confidence. “Frequent changes in tax policy, energy pricing, tariff structures, export incentives and regulatory regimes, often announced late in the business cycle, constrain forward planning, capacity expansion and scaling, particularly around annual export order booking cycles,” it said.
The synopses also highlighted institutional fragmentation and regulatory burdens. They said inconsistent definitions of SMEs across the State Bank of Pakistan, SMEDA, the Federal Board of Revenue and provincial authorities restricted access to finance, incentives and support schemes. Overlapping mandates, discretionary enforcement, excessive audits and weak inter-agency coordination increased compliance costs and uncertainty, the panel said.
Moreover, exporters also faced weak domestic quality, testing and compliance infrastructure, increasing reliance on overseas laboratories for certification and testing, it said, adding: “This raises costs, lengthens lead times and elevates rejection risks in regulated export markets, constraining movement into higher value products and destinations.”
Limited access to affordable finance was also highlighted as a constraint on upgrading and value addition. The panel said export credit, insurance, guarantees, and long-term financing instruments remained underdeveloped, while high interest rates, collateral requirements, and liquidity constraints curtailed SME investment in technology, compliance, and scaling.
The committee also questioned the implementation of export facilitation and input schemes, including the Export Facilitation Scheme, saying procedural delays, higher input costs and working-capital pressures were limiting effective sourcing of raw materials and intermediate inputs.
In addition, it cited logistics and trade facilitation bottlenecks, including high inland freight costs, underutilised rail, port congestion, slow customs clearance, inadequate cold-chain infrastructure and weak courier and postal systems for SMEs.
It noted that at Port Qasim, the absence of dedicated export terminals, limited handling infrastructure, inadequate covered storage and constrained evacuation arrangements increased dwell time, handling costs and shipment uncertainty. It also pointed to skills gaps, low value addition and weak branding as barriers to moving into higher-value segments.
Based on consultations, the Planning Commission is now collecting additional information through a private-sector survey to refine inputs and develop a data-driven, sector-specific technical roadmap to enhance exports under the Uraan Pakistan strategic plan.
“Pakistan’s development, economic sovereignty and even national security now hinge on one thing: how fast we can grow our exports and move to an export-led growth model,” Mr Iqbal said at the conclusion of the consultations.
He added that “the only way to break free from foreign crutches and avoid the next IMF programme is to rapidly increase our exports and build strong foreign exchange reserves”.
The 20 products covered during these engagements included copper, gems and jewellery, software and IT services, fish and fish preparations, rice, fruits and vegetables, meat and meat preparations, guar gum and its products, handicrafts, textile and apparel, sports goods, leather and leather products, surgical instruments, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cement, carpets and rugs, engineering goods, footwear, plastic material and cutlery.
Pakistan currently exports about $30-35bn worth of goods, against Planning Commission estimates of an untapped annual potential of over $60bn.
The findings and recommendations will be consolidated into product-wise diagnostics and a targeted facilitation framework for submission to the prime minister. Their implementation would be subject to clearance under the tight requirements of the IMF conditions.

The Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah. However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, announced a change in venue, saying it would stage the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid.
During the day, PTI supporters gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the police employed shelling. Disturbances were also reported near Numaish Chowrangi as police dispersed crowds, while media vehicles were also vandalised.
“I am deeply grateful to all Pakistanis and the people of Sindh for honouring us with enormous respect and esteem,” CM Afridi said while addressing a huge crowd near Mazar-i-Quaid late on Sunday night.







“We can never forget the respect we received from the people of Sindh. But you all must not forgive the Sindh government for the disrespect they have shown towards the Sindhi cap and Ajrak,” the PTI leader added.
“We will not allow anyone to steal our mandate, to snatch our rights, or to further keep our leader Imran Khan sahib in prison wrongfully,” Afridi said.
The KP CM said: “Those who used to say ‘we will end PTI’ and who were thinking that Imran Khan’s politics will be eradicated, they should come here and see these youngsters here.
“They should consider that these people have come for only a jalsa, then what will happen the day my leader (Imran Khan) issues a formal call for a street movement,” he added.
“You must stand prepared against this oppression and fascism. Whenever my leader issues a call, we will act as per his wishes,” the PTI leader said.
Afridi reiterated his claims of the Sindh government “leaving us stranded on deserted roads in the dark of the night” while returning from Hyderabad to Karachi.
However, a provincial minister refuted the claims, saying that a police accompanied the KP CM on his way to Karachi via the “safest routes”.

 

“Shelling was also done at our sisters, children, workers here […] all routes were blocked, police baton-charged [supporters],” CM Afridi claimed in his brief address.
The chief minister further alleged that “they (authorities) also damaged the media’s vehicles”.
Afridi said the Sindh government “repeated” what its Punjab counterpart had done when he visited Lahore last month, calling both governments “fake”.
The gathering was a part of the KP CM’s four-day visit to Sindh, who is leading his party’s street mobilisation movement.
“God willing, our next stop will be Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and we will continue the same momentum in various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” CM Afridi announced.
The KP CM also raised slogans of “every chowk is D-Chowk”.



‘Delays due to obstructions, public welcomes’
Earlier at 7:44pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh said CM Afridi’s convoy was facing delays “due to obstructions at various places, and the public’s affection, welcomes and responses at numerous places”.
At around 9pm, Sheikh said the KP CM would reach the venue in five minutes, and lashed out at the Sindh police and government for their actions. At around 10:30pm, he shared footage of the caravan at Numaish Chowrangi, where Afridi also addressed the crowd.







The PTI also shared visuals of the welcome accorded to the party caravan by their supporters in Baldia Town and Ittehad Town‘s Khyber Chowk.







At around 6:40pm, the PTI said the Sindh police had “attempted to prevent” CM Afridi’s convoy from moving forward, but the party leaders “had the path reopened with the help of party workers”.
The video showed party leaders, including Shafiullah Jan, speaking to the police before the convoy’s vehicles were allowed to move ahead.







The PTI also shared videos of hundreds gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah by the evening, with supporters chanting “Jiye Imran” and “Tera yaar, mera yaar, Qaidi No. 804”.







In a video recorded while on his way to the venue, Afridi said his convoy would reach Mazar-i-Quaid after going through Baldia Town, Keamari, Banaras Chowk, Golimar and Gurumandir so PTI supporters could join the caravan.
Former MNA Faheem Khan said, “Ten of our vehicles were intercepted. But no worries; I am reaching the rally venue with another vehicle equipped with a sound system.”







In a statement on X, the PTI hailed the public for its “historic display of public power and expression of love for Imran Khan”.
“Despite all the fascism, violence, arrests and obstructions by the Sindh government through its police, thousands of people have gathered inside and around Karachi’s Bagh-i-Jinnah and on the surrounding streets at the moment,” it said.
“This is the scene that serves as a clear message to those with fascist mindsets that public power cannot be stopped by walls and batons,” the PTI asserted.
“This gathering is a renewal of the pledge that we are ready to give every sacrifice for Imran Khan, Pakistan, true freedom, supremacy of the Constitution and law, independence of the judiciary, and our basic rights.”







Shelling, roadblocks at venue: PTI
Shortly after 4pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared a video on X wherein a woman said police have resorted to shelling at party supporters at “Mazar-i-Quaid’s garden”.







Video footage aired by DawnNewsTV showed multiple police vans at Bagh-i-Jinnah and cops employing shelling, with people gathered there retaliating by pelting stones.



Pictures from Numaish Chowrangi showed cops with batons detaining multiple individuals as PTI supporters gathered to make their way to Bagh-i-Jinnah.

A video shared with Dawn showed dozens gathered at an unknown location, with people pushing aside containers that had been placed to block a route.

The Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) — an ally of the PTI under an opposition alliance — also said its leader Allama Sadiq Jafri and others had reached “Jinnah Ground”, possibly referring to Bagh-i-Jinnah.







PTI spokesperson Mohammad Ali Bozdar told Dawn that police had blocked roads and were not allowing party workers to enter Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the government had previously allowed the party to hold the rally.
He reiterated his allegation that police had blocked roads in various areas and were preventing PTI workers from reaching the new venue of Mazar-i-Quaid’s VIP gate as well.
Bozdar said CM Afridi would pay his respects at the mausoleum and later on, he would address party workers from a truck, the arrangements for which had been completed.
‘Attack’ on mediapersons
Separately, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took notice of an “attack“ on Aaj News’ vehicle near Gurumandir Chowrangi.
He also directed the East district senior superintendent of police (SSP) to immediately provide details on “police action”.
“Miscreant elements will be dealt with firmly. We will not let anyone sabotage law and order,” Lanjar asserted.
The minister said the perpetrators would be arrested by tracing them using the modern monitoring system.

In a statement, PTI’s Bozdar also condemned the attack on mediapersons and said action should be taken if someone had “attacked the media”.
“The PTI’s workers are peaceful. No one is allowed to take the law into their hands,” he stated. “The media is the public’s voice; attacks on media will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he added.
The board members of Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the “attack of a charged crowd on media; violence against journalists, cameramen and staff; and damage caused to DSNGs”.
“How can this group declare themselves pro-democratic after attacking the media?” said a joint statement by KUJ President Ejaz Ahmad and others.
“What message did they try to convey by targeting the media?”
The KUJ demanded that the Sindh government trace the perpetrators through CCTV footage and bring them to justice.
The Crime Reporters Association (CRA) also strongly condemned the vandalism incidents, adding that there was a “clash between political workers and police” during coverage at Bagh-i-Jinnah.
“Media representatives busy in fulfilling their duties got caught in the middle of this chaos and were targeted, while the vehicles (DSNGs) and equipment of many media houses were damaged,” the CRA stated.
Sindh government spokesperson Sadia Javed, in a statement, said there were “attacks on multiple news channels’ vehicles and pelting”. The vehicles of GNN and Aaj News were among those damaged, while a worker of Channel 5 was reportedly assaulted.
In his statement, PPP Karachi General Secretary Rauf Ahmed Nagori alleged that PTI workers “vandalised citizen vehicles during their protest”.
PTI changes rally venue
The PTI had initially planned to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah, and the PPP-led Sindh government had even issued a no-objection certificate for it despite objections from the PML-N.
But the party blamed the Sindh administration for “wasting their time” and announced that the public meeting would now be held in front of the Quaid’s mausoleum.

In a video statement, Sheikh criticised the Sindh government for allegedly blocking the rally. He recalled that Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani had welcomed the KP CM at the Karachi airport and presented a Sindh cap and Ajrak to him.
“Was that a pretence?” he questioned, slamming the Sindh government for its “shamelessness”.
On the party’s decision to hold a gathering outside one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid, he said, “Holding a rally at a public gate does not block any route.”
Sheikh alleged the NOC for the rally had been deliberately delayed, further questioning that when the Sindh government had granted permission for the rally, “why was our vendor beaten and made to flee?”
He decried that the PPP was no longer late prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s party.







“Police brutality and blocking of roads cannot dampen the morale of the people,” PTI Karachi President Raja Azhar said in a statement, adding that the rally would prove to be the “public’s referendum against cruelty”.
Similarly, party member Faheem Khan urged people to participate in the rally and termed the alleged blocking of roads “an attack on the rights of the people”.
Late on Saturday, Sheikh said that while the PTI had announced Mazar-i-Quaid as the venue as the NOC had not been issued by then, the party had again decided to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah after getting the permission.







PTI alleges arrests at Bagh-i-Jinnah
Separately, the PTI alleged that authorities had raided Bagh-i-Jinnah, subjected its workers to violence and also arrested several of them.
Party spokesperson Bozdar, while speaking to Dawn, alleged that when workers reached Bagh-i-Jinnah around 2am on Sunday for rally arrangements and preparations, around 15 to 20 police mobiles reached the spot and law enforcement personnel resorted to baton-charge. They detained over a dozen PTI workers, he claimed.
At around 2:30am, PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui posted on X that the Sindh government wasted their time as the deputy commissioner East had issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) on Saturday evening at 6:30pm.
“The public power witnessed in Karachi yesterday has frightened them; they can’t decide what to do now. The people of Karachi will be at the Mazar-i-Quaid public gate at 2pm with our guest, the chief minister of KP, Sohail Afridi. We will hold a public meeting at the VIP gate at 2pm,” she stated.
But the Sindh home minister warned of strict action if any public meeting was held on the road. “No one is allowed to challenge the writ of the government,” Lanjar said in a statement.
In one of her posts at around 4:30am, Siddiqui said that containers had been parked around Jinnah Ground and police personnel were present at the site in large numbers.







In another post, she alleged police had “attacked” Bagh-i-Jinnah, arrested several PTI workers, and their belongings had been confiscated.







Similarly, Sheikh said in a post on X at around 2:30am that “this fascism against peaceful workers was unfortunate. The PPP and Sindh government, which harp about democracy, should feel ashamed“.







In other posts, he decried the alleged police raid at Bagh-i-Jinnah and claimed PTI workers had been subjected to violence.







PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, speaking to the media at Karachi Press Club today, decried the “barbarity” that PTI members had been subjected to.
“Cars were smashed, and two dozen members have been detained unlawfully. A lawyer of ours was detained this morning at Bagh-i-Jinnah. It is cordoned off by police right now,” he said, adding that the PTI had the NOC for the rally.
“So the rally will happen,” he asserted.
In response to a Dawn query, police sources denied detaining any PTI workers this morning and said they just removed them from Mazar-i-Quaid. The sources said police took action to disperse the party workers, alleging that they had blocked a main road.
The sources also said that while there would be no restriction on the movement of KP CM Afridi, PTI workers would not be allowed at Mazar-i-Quaid.
KP CM claims routes blocked from Hyderabad to Karachi
Earlier on Sunday, CM Afridi claimed in a post on X that “upon my return from Hyderabad, all routes for me and my entire team have been blocked. For the past four hours, I’ve been switching between different routes. At 4:23am, we’ve now set off toward Karachi on a deserted road“.
“The Sindh government is not only playing with my life but also with the lives of my team members,” he said, warning that the precedent of such treatment being meted out to the CM of one province in other provinces would “prove highly detrimental in the near future”.
“Pakistan belongs to all of us. Do not spread hatred here to such an extent that it becomes impossible to return from that point. Fake democratic forces are not leaving any stone unturned in this. This is extremely shameful,” he said.







However, Hyderabad SSP Adeel Chandio told Dawn that “no obstruction was created in the convoy and rally of KP CM in Hyderabad until he left the city”. “And he left the city safely,” he added.
Later, in a video message shared on PTI’s X account, the CM said: “We reached Karachi around 7:15pm […] We will definitely hold a rally today. It took us seven and a half hours to reach Karachi from Hyderabad.
“They had blocked the route at different places and we were compelled to travel on a deserted route. This was tantamount to putting my and my team’s lives at risk, as anything could have happened there.”
He urged Karachiites to come out for the rally today, adding that “they (the Sindh government) are afraid of the rally, but it will be held”.







Raja also posted on X that he had reached Karachi from Hyderabad after “seven hours, driving through jungles in the CM KPK’s vehicle”.
“Motorway closed. The fascist state lost its nerve after seeing the massive response of the people, given two days of freedom and human dignity,” he said.







PTI not abiding by assurances, claims Sharjeel Inam
From the Sindh government, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon maintained that his provincial government had warmly welcomed Afridi and provided him with complete security.
“The post of chief minister is a constitutional post and constitutional posts have been fully respected,” he said in a statement, maintaining that the PTI was in constant touch with the Sindh government.
He then accused the opposition party of “not abiding by the assurances” it had given, but did not specify any guarantees.
“It was clearly said on the very first day that they are allowed to hold a rally. It is inappropriate to make allegations against the Sindh government despite this,” he said, maintaining that no one had stopped the PTI from holding a rally in the ground.
However, the manner in which rallies and processions were being taken out on the roads was causing severe traffic disruption and common citizens were facing difficulties, he said.
“Karachi is a metropolitan city; traffic problems arise here even when a few hundred people gather,” he said. “We want the KP chief minister to complete his visit in a peaceful manner.”
He said that PTI workers should not take the law into their own hands and should follow the guidelines given by the government. The movement of common people should not be affected and violation of laws should be avoided, he added.
Memon said a security alert had also been issued regarding the rally, and a security plan had been devised.
“Unfortunately, the security plan is not being followed,” he claimed, further maintaining that complete security had been provided by Sindh police in connection with the rally.
“In view of security concerns, the instructions of the Sindh government should be followed, and only routes allocated by the government should be used,” he said.
Memon claimed that the route designated for the PTI in Hyderabad had not been followed and they took a route of their own choice.
“It is not correct to say that the convoy of the chief minister of KP was stopped on its return from Hyderabad,” he said. “The place where the convoy faced difficulty is the National Highway Authority bridge, where traffic congestions are frequent.”

His statements came after the PTI claimed its convoy was facing hurdles while on its way to Mazar-i-Quaid for a rally, and CM Afridi said he had to use risky routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad.
“I personally apologise if something [unpleasant] happened somewhere, as this should not happen,” Shah said during Geo News’ programme ‘Naya Pakistan’.
’’He is the chief minister of a province and whatever we did, the welcome and all, was in respect of the people of KP as he had their mandate,“ the PPP leader added.
Asked about the apparent change in the Sindh government’s attitude, Shah highlighted that the guests were “welcomed and taken care of”. He noted that the PTI sought permission to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah from the Sindh government “even though it falls under the federal government’s jurisdiction”.
He acknowledged that the PTI “adopted the proper procedure” to seek a no-objection certificate (NOC), which he said also caused delays. Then, the minister said, the issues arose when the NOC got delayed by about 1-1.5 hours, and the PTI announced that they would “hold the rally on a road”.
Shah added that the Sindh government had even offered the PTI to connect them to their vendors if the preparations were lacking.



The minister then pointed out CM Afridi’s “certain” statements, including one about President Asif Ali Zardari’s politics.
“There are no differences. Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari sahib and President Asif Ali Zardari sahib are our PPP, the Sindh government. There is one stance,” he asserted.
Shah added that if President Zardari did not wish so, the PTI guests would not have been welcomed at the airport or facilitated. He said the PTI started making harsh statements, which also upset party members who noted the criticism despite offering them support.

 

Asked about the police action against PTI workers at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the early hours of Sunday, Shah said an inquiry was underway about what led to it.
He said the PTI was being urged to arrange the setup in the ground, but they were insistent on holding a gathering on the road.
On CM Afridi’s claims about his convoy being forced to take dangerous routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad, Shah said: “He had complete protocol, and as per the security threat issued, he was brought via the safest routes.
“Those were the safest routes, and police protection was with him,“ the PPP leader asserted.
“How could he have returned if there were pickets and if roads were blocked?” Shah asked rhetorically.
“As per the reports the administration has given, this protocol was adopted for their security and safety,“ the minister replied to a question about the police pickets set up.
On reports of shelling at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the day despite the NOC, Shah said, “Something unpleasant happened there.”
Criticising Zardari is our democratic right: Qaiser
Responding to Shah on the same show, senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser said, “We think that Sindh’s people and government respect democracy and […] they respect their opponents.”
He acknowledged that the PTI had differences with the PPP and concerns about it. “In our opinion, the illegitimate government in power right now is so because of their support,” he said.
“The legislation that they are doing. [Criticising it] is our stance. It is our democratic right to have whatever stance we want,” Qaiser stressed.
To a question raised by the host, Qaiser responded: “You and he (Shah) both understand what is happening from where. Will a democratic political party take instructions in this manner? Will we not have a say?”
Qaiser said the PTI respected the PPP, adding: “Even if you say that we criticised Zardari sahib, that is our democratic right.”



“Will this attitude continue? Is this democracy? […] Tell me, what unlawful [incident] has occurred over the past two days?“ Qaiser asked. He stressed the vendors needed two to three days to make arrangements at the venue, adding that there was “no lighting” at Bagh-i-Jinnah and that the Sindh government would be responsible for any unfortunate incident.
Responding to Qaiser, Shah pointed out the welcome accorded to CM Afridi on Friday, asking if it would have been given “if there were some instructions from somewhere”.
Shah also denied that the PPP “changed its strategy” because of the PML-N reportedly being criticised for its attitude towards the KP CM during his Lahore visit.
Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — also undertaken for mass mobilisation — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.</p><small>2026-01-11 20:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644543-passengers-appreciate-recently-launched-electric-bus-service-in-jhelum-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Passengers appreciate recently-launched electric bus service in Jhelum: minister</strong></a><br><p>

“Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards.
With the country’s government facing the biggest demonstrations since 2022, Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if force is used on protesters.
Authorities intensify crackdown
The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices. Authorities accuse the US and Israel of fomenting unrest. Iran’s police chief Ahmad-Reza Radan said security forces had stepped up efforts to confront “rioters”.
The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday.
Footage posted on social media on Saturday from Tehran showed large crowds marching along a street at night, clapping and chanting. The crowd “has no end nor beginning,” a man is heard saying.
In footage from the northeastern city of Mashhad, smoke can be seen billowing into the night sky from fires in the street, masked protesters, and a road strewn with debris, another video posted on Saturday showed. Explosions could be heard.
Reuters verified the locations.
State TV aired footage of dozens of body bags on the ground at the Tehran coroner’s office on Sunday, saying the dead were victims of events caused by “armed terrorists”.
Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing for the possibility of any US intervention.
An Israeli military official said the protests were an internal Iranian matter, but Israel’s military was monitoring developments and was ready to respond “with power if need be”.
An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment.Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June last year, which the United States briefly joined by attacking key nuclear installations.
Iran retaliated by firing missiles at Israel and an American air base in Qatar.
Iran denounces ‘rioters and terrorists’
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a TV interview, said Israel and the US were masterminding destabilisation and that Iran’s enemies had brought in “terrorists … who set mosques on fire …. attack banks, and public properties”.
“Families, I ask you: do not allow your young children to join rioters and terrorists who behead people and kill others,” he said, adding that the government was ready to listen to the people and to resolve economic problems.
Alan Eyre, a former US diplomat and Iran expert, thought it unlikely the protests would topple Iran’s ruling establishment.
“I think it is more likely that it puts these protests down eventually, but emerges from the process far weaker,” he told Reuters, noting that Iran’s ruling elite still appeared cohesive and there was no organised opposition.
Iranian state TV broadcast funeral processions in western cities such as Gachsaran and Yasuj for security personnel killed in protests.
State TV said 30 members of the security forces would be buried in the central city of Isfahan and that six more were killed by “rioters” in Kermanshah in the west.
Us ready to help, says Trump
Trump, posting on social media on Saturday, said: “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!”
In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of US intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source present for the conversation.
Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a prominent voice in the fragmented opposition, said Trump had observed Iranians’ “indescribable bravery”. “Do not abandon the streets,” Pahlavi, who is based in the US, wrote on X.
Netanyahu, speaking during a cabinet meeting, said Israel was closely monitoring developments. “We all hope that the Persian nation will soon be freed from the yoke of tyranny,” he said.
Pakistan embassy in Tehran establishes crisis cell
The Pakistan embassy in Tehran has established a crisis management unit to facilitate its citizens, Pakistan’s envoy to Iran Mudassir Tipu said on X.

World number three Orfi was up against Malaysia’s Sivasangari Subramaniam, who she demolished 3-0 to take an expected victory with a scoreline of 11-8, 11-2, 11-7.
“The final is never an easy match,” the 18-year-old said after her 38-minute match that saw her win her fourth title of the season.
“Me and Siva have played several times this season, I know how dangerous she is; I just have to prepare in this sport very well.
“Thanks to the fans for supporting us, they’ve built the atmosphere and it made me happy to see the crowd here today cheering for both of us,” Orfi said.

         View this post on Instagram            

Her compatriots stayed true to saving the best for last as Zakaria and Aly Abou Eleinen put on a show for the crowd in a dazzling 100-minute match.
The first game saw Eleinen prevail 11-9 after a series of minutes-long rallies that saw the two slipping on their own sweat.
Zakaria was trailing Eleinen 7-3 in the second game but finally found his rhythm and won 11-9 against his 26-year-old opponent, despite a break in play for a cut on his knee to be attended to by courtside medics.
Victory belonged to Zakaria in the third game as well – or so he thought. He had removed his protective eyewear and exited the court but Eleinen had already called for a player review that proved inconclusive. The two were neck-and-neck in the lengthy game that lasted 27 minutes before Eleinen switched gears and won 14-12 in a brutal, high-quality rally that delighted the crowd on Sunday evening.
Both players seemed tired by the time the fourth game rolled around, but Zakaria took the game 11-7 to level the score 2-2.
Eleinen was cramping up in the fifth game that saw Zakaria pull ahead, but not before hitting three costly errors. He nevertheless finished strong to seal his victory 11-7, not once, but twice. Another player review from Eleinen at the final point saw the referee shushing the crowd that cheered for Zakaria’s championship win.
The seconds ticked by, Zakaria had already dropped his racket and glasses to the floor and was waiting for a verdict when the referee upheld his decision that saw Zakaria win the biggest title of his career so far.
“I made it to the fifth game and I wasn’t tired, so I’m most impressed with my physical side this time because I’ve worked really hard on it,” Zakaria said after the match.
“I just won my first gold level event at 18 so I’m over the moon,” the ginger-haired teenager said to applause from the crowd.
“I grew up playing with Aly in Alexandria, so this was a proud moment for us to be playing a major final together,” Zakaria said.
Speaking to Dawn after the final, Eleinen echoed the same sentiment of Zakaria, “who I consider my younger brother.
“I’m eight years older but we grew up together and it’s amazing to see him doing so well,” Eleinen said of the teenager, who achieved his career-best ranking of 11 just last month.
“We always dreamed of playing major finals together, and today is hopefully a good step towards more battles that people can enjoy, and I’m sure people back home are proud of us.”</p><small>2026-01-11 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644518-72-students-leave-for-pakistan-amid-protests-in-iran-confirms-envoy' target='_blank'><strong>72 Pakistani students head home as protests rage in Iran, confirms envoy</strong></a><br><p>
