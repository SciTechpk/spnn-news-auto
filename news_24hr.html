Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
According to the latest data provided by KP PDMA, the total death toll from rain-related incidents this monsoon season stands at 71, out of which 40 are children, 17 men and 14 women.
Swat district recorded the highest number of lives lost, at 22, during heavy rains. According to PDMA, most of the deaths occurred due to floods, landslides and infrastructure collapse.
On June 27, 17 people, mostly tourists, went missing after unprecedented flash floods struck areas of Swat and Malakand divisions. 12 bodies were recovered, four people were rescued, and the dead body of one person remains missing, according to PDMA. The delay in rescue efforts sparked outrage across the country.
According to the PDMA report, on July 21, a woman died after drowning in a nullah while two children were swept away and reported dead. The same day, three children died after the roof of their house collapsed in the Bahrain tehsil of Swat.
The total death toll, broken down district-wise, currently stands at: Swat (22), Buner (4), Malakand (5), Charsadda (3), Upper Dir (3), Torghar (2), Mansehra (3), Hangu (2), Khyber (3), Abbotabad (5), Shangla (2), Bajaur (3), Lower Kohistan (2), Lakki Marwat (3), Battagram (2).
Karak, Haripur, Upper Kohistan, Nowshera and Kohat recorded one death each.
The report estimated that a total of 86 people have been injured in rain-related incidents across the province, including 38 men, 15 women and 33 children.
Detailing the infrastructure damage, the report recorded the total number of houses damaged at 358, out of which 54 were destroyed completely. The highest number of houses destroyed was in Swat at 63, followed by 38 in Karak and 22 in Buner.
The number of cattle that perished as a result of the rain was 142.
Meanwhile, PDMA has issued a rainfall alert for KP today, forecasting isolated rainfall and thunderstorms over the next 12 -24 hours in parts of the province, including Chitral, Dir, Swat,  Kalam, Mansehra, Battagram, Abbottabad, Haripur, Swabi, Mardan, Noshwera, Peshawar, Charsada, Kohat, Lakki Marwat, Parachinar, Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan.
In a statement issued on Sunday,  KP PDMA directed the district administrations and other relevant organisations to remain on high alert as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast more intermittent to heavy rains, wind, and thunderstorms across KP from August 4 to 7.</p><small>2025-08-06 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06135119250e5ad.jpg?r=135638' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929082/psx-witnesses-record-intraday-high-of-over-144000-on-strong-corporate-results' target='_blank'><strong>PSX witnesses record intraday high of over 144,000 on ‘strong’ corporate results</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its record-setting rally for a fourth consecutive session on Wednesday on “strong” corporate results, soaring past 144,000 points during intraday high.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,041.24 points (0.73 per cent) to reach 144,078.40 points at 1:29pm, from the previous close of 143,037.16 points.
The market reached an intraday high of 144,285.74 points at 11:37am, gaining 1,248.58 points (0.87pc) from yesterday’s close.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told Dawn.com: “The market rallied on strong corporate results, along with hefty payouts in the banking and fertiliser sectors.
“Moreover, expectation of clearance of circular debt during the next week has rejuvenated interest in companies having exposure in coal-based power plants, distribution companies of oil and gas, and upstream exploration and production companies,” he added.
 
 

The interest in the oil and gas sector follows an agreement between Pakistan and the United States that will allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan’s vast oil reserves.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also said the market was “up as corporate results are expected to be better”.
A key factor behind the market’s upbeat performance was also the release of Pakistan’s fiscal data for FY25. The government reported a nine-year low fiscal deficit of 5.38pc, with revenue growth of 36pc year-on-year (YoY), outpacing an 18pc rise in expenditures.
This performance surpassed both the government’s and the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) forecast of a 5.6pc GDP deficit. The positive fiscal data, along with market optimism over fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability, is expected to fuel further market momentum in the coming sessions.
India’s central bank holds rates amid US tariff battle
Meanwhile, India’s central bank maintained its key interest rate at 5.50pc as US President Donald Trump ramped up threats to raise tariffs on New Delhi because of Russian oil purchases.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept steady the repurchase rate, the level at which it lends to commercial banks, after a unanimous vote by a six-member panel.
 
 

Bank governor Sanjay Malhotra said global trade challenges remained but that the “Indian economy holds bright prospects in the changing world order”.
“We have taken decisive and forward-looking measures to support growth,” he said in a statement.
The RBI cut rates for the first time in nearly five years in February and followed up with two other reductions in April and June.
Trump’s announcement on Tuesday to “substantially” hike tariffs on Indian imports because of New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil has added pressure on India.
Before that threat was made, the existing 1pc US tariff on Indian products was already due to rise to 25pc on Thursday. Malhotra acknowledged that “the uncertainties of tariffs are still evolving” even though “growth is robust”.

Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Four security personnel including a driver were martyred when unknown assailants attacked a Federal Constabulary (FC) vehicle in the Garagri area of Karak, which the provincial chief minister and governor strongly condemned.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur directed relevant authorities to arrest those involved in the incident as he expressed condolences to the families of those martyred.
“We salute the security personnel and their families who sacrificed their lives for the country and the nation,” said a statement today from the office of the press secretary to the KP CM.
Governor Faisal Kundi also condemned the incident, saying: “The sacrifice of those martyred in the war against terrorism will not go in vain.”
In a separate incident on Tuesday night, three people died in a gun attack on Peshawar’s Warsak Road, including police inspector Ali Hussain.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Peshawar Masood Ahmed told Dawn.com that Hussain was travelling in a car with two friends last night when four assailants on two motorbikes opened fire on the car, killing all three.
“A pistol and submachine gun (SMG) was used in the attack,” he added.
“We are investigating the incident, and geofencing work is ongoing as well.”
Kundi condemned the “unfortunate and inhumane” incident as he expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased.
Last month, a police official was martyred in Karak while deployed at a police post in the Koh-i-Maidan area, which borders the Lakki Marwat and Mianwali districts. He embraced martyrdom while the assailants fled into the mountains.</p><small>2025-08-06 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06112345b14bbe1.png?r=131119' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929068/missed-signals-lost-deal-how-india-us-trade-talks-collapsed' target='_blank'><strong>Missed signals, lost deal: How India-US trade talks collapsed</strong></a><br><p>After five rounds of trade negotiations, Indian officials were so confident of securing a favourable deal with the United States that they even signalled to the media that tariffs could be capped at 15 per cent.
Indian officials expected US President Donald Trump to announce the deal himself weeks before the August 1 deadline. The announcement never came.
New Delhi is now left with the surprise imposition of a 25pc tariff on Indian goods from Friday, along with unspecified penalties over oil imports from Russia, while Trump has closed larger deals with Japan and the EU, and even offered better terms to arch-rival Pakistan.
Interviews with four Indian government officials and two US government officials revealed previously undisclosed details of the proposed deal and an exclusive account of how negotiations collapsed despite technical agreements on most issues.
The officials on both sides said a mix of political misjudgment, missed signals and bitterness broke down the deal between the world’s biggest and fifth-largest economies, whose bilateral trade is worth over $190 billion.
The White House, the US Trade Representative office, and India’s Prime Minister’s Office, along with the External Affairs and Commerce ministries, did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
India believed that after visits by Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal to Washington and US Vice President JD Vance to Delhi, it had made a series of deal-clinching concessions.
New Delhi was offering zero tariffs on industrial goods that formed about 40pc of US exports to India, two Indian government officials told Reuters.
Despite domestic pressure, India would also gradually lower tariffs on US cars and alcohol with quotas and accede to Washington’s main demand of higher energy and defence imports from the US, the officials said.
“Most differences were resolved after the fifth round in Washington, raising hopes of a breakthrough,” one of the officials said, adding negotiators believed the US would accommodate India’s reluctance on duty-free farm imports and dairy products from the US.
It was a miscalculation. Trump saw the issue differently and wanted more concessions.
“A lot of progress was made on many fronts in India talks, but there was never a deal that we felt good about,” said one White House official. “We never got to what amounted to a full deal — a deal that we were looking for.”
Over-confidence and miscalculation
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who visited Washington in February, agreed to target a deal by fall 2025, and more than double bilateral trade to $500bn by 2030.
To bridge the $47bn goods trade gap, India pledged to buy up to $25bn in US energy and boost defence imports.
But officials now admit India grew overconfident after Trump talked up a “big” imminent deal, taking it as a signal that a favourable agreement was in hand.
New Delhi then hardened its stance, especially on agriculture and dairy, two highly sensitive areas for the Indian government.
“We are one of the fastest growing economies, and the US can’t ignore a market of 1.4bn,” one Indian official involved in the negotiations said in mid-July.
Negotiators even pushed for relief from the 10pc average US tariff announced in April, plus a rollback of steel, aluminium and auto duties.
Later, India scaled back expectations after the US signed trade deals with key partners including Japan, and the European Union, hoping it could secure a similar 15pc tariff rate with fewer concessions.
That was unacceptable to the White House.
“Trump wanted a headline-grabbing announcement with broader market access, investments and large purchases,” said a Washington-based source familiar with the talks.
An Indian official acknowledged New Delhi wasn’t ready to match what others offered.
South Korea, for example, struck a deal just before Trump’s August 1 deadline, securing a 15pc rate instead of 25pc by offering $350bn in investments, higher energy imports, and concessions on rice and beef.
 

This range plot displays US President Donald Trump’s tariff rates or the most recent previously announced or threatened tariff rates for the US’s top trading partners on Aug. 1, 2025.

Communication breakdown
“At one point, both sides were very close to signing the deal,” said Mark Linscott, a former US Trade Representative who now works for a lobby group that is close to the discussions between the two nations. “The missing component was a direct line of communication between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi.”
A White House official strongly disputed this, noting other deals had been resolved without such intervention. An Indian government official involved in the talks said Modi could not have called, fearing a one-sided conversation with Trump that could put him on the spot.
However, the other three Indian officials said Trump’s repeated remarks about mediating the India-Pakistan conflict further strained negotiations and contributed to Modi not making a final call.
“Trump’s remarks on Pakistan didn’t go down well,” one of them said. “Ideally, India should have acknowledged the US role while making it clear the final call was ours.”
A senior Indian government official blamed the collapse on poor judgment, saying top Indian advisers mishandled the process. “We lacked the diplomatic support needed after the US struck better deals with Vietnam, Indonesia, Japan and the EU,” the official said. “We’re now in a crisis that could have been avoided.”
Trump said on Tuesday he would increase the tariff on imports from India from the current rate of 25pc “very substantially” over the next 24 hours and alleged that New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil were “fuelling the war” in Ukraine.
Way forward
Talks are ongoing, with a US delegation expected in Delhi later this month and Indian government officials still believe the deal can be salvaged from here.
“It’s still possible,” one White House official said.
The Indian government is re-examining areas within the farm and dairy sectors where concessions can be made, the fourth official said. On Russian oil, India could reduce some purchases in favour of US supplies if pricing is matched.
“It likely will require direct communication between the prime minister and the president,” said Linscott.
“Pick up the phone. Right now, we are in a lose-lose. But there is real potential for a win-win trade deal.”</p><small>2025-08-06 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/061253149747894.jpg?r=125728' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929075/dg-ispr-rubbishes-rumours-of-army-chief-becoming-president' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR rubbishes rumours of army chief becoming president</strong></a><br><p>Military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has rubbished rumours of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president.
His statement follows a similar rebuttal by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi early in July, when he clarified that no idea existed “about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency”.
Gen Chaudhry, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, told The Economist that “talk of his boss becoming president is ‘nonsense’”.
The Economist noted that COAS Munir’s popularity has surged since the May conflict with India. It added that the ruling coalition’s recently acquired two-thirds majority in the parliament needed for a Constitutional Amendment “ignited rumours that the army chief could become president too”.
 






The government, as well as the military, have repeatedly warned about “fake news and propaganda” proliferating on social media, with Gen Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “digital terrorism” under the laws.
On July 10, Naqvi asserted that President Asif Ali Zardari “enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces”.
He quoted the president as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”
Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of COAS Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.
In May, President Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally decorated COAS Munir with the rank of field marshal for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.
 
 

The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — Gen Ayub Khan — by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.
In a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during Marka-i-Haq against India.
The next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, hailed the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.</p><small>2025-08-06 08:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/061236433d65954.png?r=123659' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927409/what-will-it-take-for-pakistan-to-break-through-the-glass-ceiling' target='_blank'><strong>What will it take for Pakistan to break through the glass ceiling?</strong></a><br><p>Every year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) publishes its Global Gender Gap Report, and every year Pakistan finds itself near the bottom. This year, however, Pakistan was ranked last — at 148th out of 148 countries. Instead of being seen as a predictable outcome of a historically entrenched pattern of gender inequality, the result triggered immediate defensiveness — not only from sections of the government and state but also from ‘progressives’ and ‘dissenters’.
Women-focused projects make up only 0.2 per cent of the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) in FY 2025–26, based on the Rs1 trillion federal development budget — a decline from previous years. Gender ‘tagged’ components still amount to just 0.57pc investment in female-centred education and health. The Pakistan Time Use Survey (TUS) has not been updated, and despite years of gender situational analyses and mapping by consultants, we still lack a cohesive or standardised nationwide, provincial, or district-level picture of gender gaps, let alone a domestic gender gap index.
Since the 1990s, and more intensely in the post-9/11 era, feminist discourse in Pakistan has often been mired in defensiveness around identities, culture, and religion. This dynamic has historically deflected critical feminist analysis from addressing urgent economic, legal, and material rights. Much of this pivot has come from within the feminist movement itself, especially from diaspora feminists who have enjoyed the freedoms of Western societies and whose activism remained limited to slogans and social media-led cancel politics.
Since 9/11, there has been a growing emphasis on cultural abstractions — such as the veil, Islamic feminism, queer identities, sexual harassment, and piety politics — at the expense of material and structural concerns. These debates eventually reached a turning point when pietist movements launched direct attacks on the more radical demands for sexual and gendered freedoms championed by the Aurat March in 2018. Despite injurious complaints about state biases (as if that was something new and original), the losses from academic and activist preoccupation with what became essentialist feminism, has eclipsed sustained engagement with systemic economic injustices, or the stagnant legal landscape for women — issues that had been the central focus before 9/11.
 
 

Generational shifts
The older generation of feminists/ male activists, many aligned with NGOs buoyed by Western funding, has retreated predictably — either retiring into WhatsApp politics or repeating projects funded by dull donors who dare not question or challenge the current authoritarian hybrid government. Meanwhile, the millennial feminists — many having migrated or married into Western societies — have distanced themselves from frontline activism, leaving a burden of performative activism and muddled political analysis to the Gen Z cohort. This generational shift has left the movement fragmented, with younger activists navigating a legacy of institutional fatigue and political paralysis, albeit far more bravely than their predecessors.
The failure to build solidarity on issues beyond identity politics has also contributed to a loss of feminist engagement with crucial regional and protest politics, such as Palestine or electoral justice. Notably, feminists’ unwillingness to support dissenting women within Imran Khan’s party, due to opposition to his authoritarianism, cost them a chance to defend women’s political participation and right to protest — a critical component in the WEF report.
Even today, when women’s reserved seats have effectively been usurped in the aftermath of the contested 2024 elections, there is a defeatist silence. This fracturing reveals a movement struggling to balance principled politics with pragmatic solidarity, ultimately weakening feminist influence on Pakistan’s broader socio-political trajectory.
Millennial accusations that any critical analysis of religious politics amounts to Islamophobia, cultural imperialism, or Western attempts to impose alien values have ultimately served the authoritarian state — more so than even the sycophantic liberals who once cozied up to General Musharraf. More recently, the same generation of the political left and right in Pakistan, unsurprisingly, have found themselves bedfellows amid the fresh surge of nationalism triggered by the latest conflict with India.
Despite their supposed ideological differences, both camps have rallied around nationalist rhetoric, often sidelining critical discourse on human rights, democratic accountability, and peace so as to present a unified front that prioritises national solidarity over substantive debate. Rarely have we seen this collaborative spirit on issues of underage marriage, property rights, minority persecution, or taxation. Yet, both ends repeat their collusive criticism of gender gap indices and secular feminist politics.
Valid critiques and local accountability
Dismissing the index without reflection is a missed opportunity. The WEF’s numbers may be imperfect, but they reflect real, measurable gaps in economic participation, political representation, health outcomes, and educational attainment. According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2025, Pakistan’s score for women’s economic participation and opportunity stands at a dismal 34.7pc (ranking only above Sudan and slightly below Iran, which, despite recent admiration among some Muslim men for its perceived female public visibility, scores only marginally higher at 34.9pc).
Pakistan’s female labour force participation stands at a meagre 22pc, and political empowerment is reflected by women holding only 20pc of parliamentary seats and zero ministerial roles. Health and survival disparities place Pakistan at 131st globally. Literacy rate for women is still under 50pc; science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills are non-existent/ not reported, and unmet family planning needs are high.
 
 

These stark numbers align with findings in research by several Pakistani feminists and experts who argue that economic frameworks systematically exclude gender concerns, failing to account for unpaid care work and women’s social reproduction roles. Feminist activist and former ombudsperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Rakhshanda Naz, echoes this in her work dealing with women’s labour and landlessness, while others have highlighted unpaid domestic labour’s invisibility in policy and its impact on women’s empowerment.
Criticism of the WEF’s methodology is valid and has been pointed out. The index’s reliance on formal employment data often ignores the informal sector where many women work, and unpaid care labour is invisible in these statistics. Moreover, the one-size-fits-all global criteria fails to account for subnational disparities and intersecting identities such as class, ethnicity, and rural-urban divides.
Researchers have demonstrated how federal budgets and resource allocations reproduce rather than reduce gender inequality. However, similar debates have taken place in India, ranked 131st, where scholars and policymakers critique the index’s limitations but also use it as a lever to improve gender policies. Pakistan must develop its own rigorous, transparent yardsticks instead of simply rejecting international benchmarks outright.
Logically, this should be the primary work of the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW), tasked with monitoring gender equality, but historically, the Commission has steered in an NGO mode and in fire-fighting as guided by UN funds and project directives, rather than charting a local feminist agenda. Increasingly, it shows a lack of political will or institutional power to confront entrenched patriarchy and leans towards governance feminism. It must cultivate a steel spine to report truthfully on Pakistan’s abysmal gender indicators, cutting through the political white noise and defensive posturing.
NGO-isation
Civil society too bears responsibility. Many NGOs chase donor funding by repeating workshops and empowerment programmes that produce visibility without systemic change. This numbers game of project cycles and reporting often prioritises metrics over meaningful transformation. Several researchers, such as Uzma Mushtaq, have pointed out the futility of project templates that do not aim for systemic transformation and, ironically, repeat the same ineffectual methodologies they criticise the WEF and government over.
Others, such as Nadia Naviwala, have highlighted how the aid economy in Pakistan has fostered an ecosystem of elite NGOs driven by donor-defined performance metrics that prioritise visibility over meaningful outcomes. This critique now extends to a new generation of women development practitioners working within the UN system and other donor agencies, whose emphasis on polished performativity is often reflected in ChatGPT-generated, design-heavy reports that mimic corporate aesthetics while evading substantive accountability.
The withdrawal or reduction of US Agency for International Development (USAID) funding should serve as a catalyst for NGO leadership to finally move from decades of critique to concrete action by formulating an independent, sustainable roadmap that is not donor-dependent but grounded in local economic priorities and long-term accountability. In any functioning corporation, such dismal outcomes as reflected starkly in Pakistan’s WEF gender ranking would warrant serious performance reviews, if not mass firings. Yet in the development sector, including donors, the impulse is to deflect blame onto the state and “culture” rather than interrogate internal failures.
 
 

Economic recovery
Pakistan’s low ranking is not an isolated anomaly. Bangladesh (ranked 24 — up by 75 places) leads the region, primarily due to over 22pc women in political ministerial positions over the last three years. Sri Lanka (130th), Nepal (121st), and even India (131st) outperform Pakistan significantly. Yet, Pakistan’s responses to these comparisons range from denial to conspiracy theories, instead of learning from regional successes.
My recent articles in Dawn Business and Dissent Today argue that economic reform in Pakistan must centre gender justice. Unfortunately, male economic elites who agree in principle, then retreat to the same traditional framework of women’s empowerment prescribed by NGO women leaders with no political depth or radical practical vision.
Most elite-led, infrastructure-heavy policies have historically excluded women and the informal economy. Gender-responsive recovery requires investment in care infrastructure, cash transfers, and reforms in discriminatory laws, especially around inheritance and citizenship.
Recently, the Government of Pakistan’s proposal to tax lavish weddings echoes feminist demands to redistribute economic resources and curb excessive consumption that entrenches inequality. But there is no group or collective devoted to such initiatives, as many stay on the safer, well-rehearsed but ineffectual project gravy train on violence against women and endless empowerment training.
Women are already ‘doing’ business in Pakistan, but they need direct access to technology, and bank account drives should be on a scale similar to voter registration campaigns. Women are already economic actors, but they require financial literacy and instruments, as well as issuance of national tax number (NTN) numbers. Women need banking services, but there has to be ease in opening bank accounts, and there must be customised schemes that provide easy loans and mortgages for women. The State Bank of Pakistan has to be committed to such policies.
Women also want to be in tech-related occupations but tend to be scared of it, and men seem to distrust women’s access to means of communication. A gendered communication strategy that closes these trust deficits is imperative.
Improvement in agricultural productivity is directly related to Pakistani women, since this is their main occupation — 67.91pc of all employed females work in this industry — but they are the lowest paid and earn less than half of the minimum wage. Only four out of 100 women qualified for agricultural loans, according to a 2018 UN report. There is no regulatory provision, outrage, or advocacy movement for such blatant violation and exploitation.
The political economy of marriage
Marriage in Pakistan is, unfortunately, not just a cultural tradition but a political and economic institution that often becomes central to women’s material inequality. Feminist scholar Saba Gul Khattak has critically examined how Pakistan’s political economy shapes gendered violence and structural inequality, with a focus on the intersections of gender, power, and economy. Amar Sindhu in Hyderabad and some activists of the Women’s Action Forum have curated their own records of cases and analysis, without donor support, over the connections of capitalism, violence, religious politics, marriage, and denial of property and economic opportunities against minorities and working-class women.
But we remain stuck on singular cases across provinces, and while ethnic discrimination is serious and odious, for feminists these issues are intersectional and collusive, and we cannot expect solutions to come from within these same sources of patriarchal control.
Why then are we investing so much hope, research resources, and activist energies on identity or ethnic-based struggles from our armchairs? Other such projects that invoke ‘culture’ as a vague obstacle to women’s equality do not specify that these are symptomatic, and so, they too do not tackle patriarchal structures that deny women property and financial rights.
 
 

I have argued, and continue to advocate, for policies like taxing weddings, not as a punitive measure but as a practical tool to address economic inequalities reproduced through marital rituals. Yet such taxation must be paired with supporting reforms to marital asset laws and inheritance to ensure women’s material equality within marriage.
This necessitates challenging the opposition to reforming and secularising family and inheritance laws, instead of re-interpretive efforts that have been exhausted, or shrugging in a defeatist manner over the Islamic nature of the state. This is not to suggest there is some simple correlation, but that it needs deeper scrutiny — Bangladesh has an extremely high rate of underage marriages, yet manages to score higher on wage equality, and as feminists there point out, such scores and technicalities do not translate into protection or justice for women, but at least some analytical clarity can emerge from in-depth study of such reports.
Pakistan’s family laws have seen incremental changes: judicial rulings and legislation like the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (1961) and the Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act (2006) have acknowledged women’s rights to maintenance and inheritance. The Supreme Court, in cases such as Shahida Parveen v Federation of Pakistan (2016), has emphasised women’s rights to equitable support within marriage. However, the law still falls short of equalising marital assets or dismantling patriarchal control over family wealth.
Similarly, underage marriage is a topic of serious contestation but should not be treated by Unicef or scholars as isolated from property rights and marital assets. There needs to be a cohesive feminist strategy for such issues beyond incentivising education and health or looking for progressive religious edicts — these are material issues at stake. Addressing marriage as a political economy issue, and not merely as a cultural practice, is crucial for advancing women’s economic empowerment and material justice.
Engage, reform, and transform
Pakistan stands at a crossroads. It can either dismiss global gender indices as imperialist interference and technically flawed, or use them as tools to highlight failures and demand change. The WEF Gender Gap Index is not a flawless measure, but it is one of the few internationally comparable tools available to hold Pakistan accountable — to itself, at the very least.
To move beyond symbolic gestures and address its entrenched gender inequality, Pakistan must commit to structural reforms rather than rely on donor-driven optics or performative advocacy. This includes investment in public care infrastructure, enforcement of family laws that guarantee women’s financial rights, and the formal recognition of unpaid domestic and reproductive labour in national economic planning.
The political economy of marriage must be squarely addressed: taxing patriarchal consumption through levies on extravagant weddings and dowry-related expenditures, and reforming marital property regimes to ensure equitable division of assets upon divorce or widowhood. Not only would this redistribute wealth and reduce women’s economic dependency, it would also broaden the tax base — a crucial fiscal consideration in a debt-ridden economy.
 
 

As Zeenia Shaukat has argued, labour market reform is equally urgent. This means going beyond establishing clear benchmarks for wage equality and social protections in the agricultural and informal sectors, and setting up rigorous regulatory practices and maintaining and publishing these records.
Women must become owners of agricultural properties too, and only an agricultural tax can enable redistribution across gender and class. This must be scrutinised by the NCSW and feminist collectives. This is not just about the top percentage of women on boards or CEOs (which is important), but also documenting the progress on maternity leaves, sexual harassment policies, gender-equal wages, and the issues with vertical and horizontal segregation.
In manufacturing and services, women have very different challenges and experiences, and different sets of gender-based benchmarks need to be developed for them, while in the informal and domestic services sector, where a majority of working-class women are concentrated, a different set of standards and practices need to be regulated.
Social protection schemes must be universal, portable, and tailored to the realities of informal and seasonal work. They must not reinforce gender stereotypes or be made palatable to the comforts of patriarchs who guard the religious or political order. Gender-responsive budgeting should be institutionalised, with dedicated allocations for affordable housing for single women, legal aid, public transport, and health services. Political representation must not be selectively defended; feminists must stand by women across the ideological spectrum when their rights to participate are under threat.
Equally vital is a redirection of research and advocacy priorities. The absurd notion of men as heads of households needs to be redefined. The dominance of identity-focused agendas has often sidelined the urgent task of confronting material inequality. These can continue low-key, while feminist scholarship and development programming must now centre redistribution, land and labour rights, fiscal justice, and structural economic reform. Without this shift toward a material and political feminist economy, Pakistan’s gender gap rankings will continue to expose a state and society unwilling to deliver substantive equality.
Problem isn’t the score-card
Real progress demands not only that we critique the numbers but that we change the very systems and gender-blind policies that keep them stagnant. Most of all, political empowerment is where our index position was strongest due to reserved seats, and women politicians’ remarkable progress in leveraging these despite elite capture of national representation.
However, in the recent reserved seats case (Sunni Ittehad Council through its Chairman, Faisalabad and another v Election Commission of Pakistan through its Secretary, Islamabad and others, July 2024), a mockery has been made of this affirmative action policy, but complicated by the plaintiffs and their anti-feminist politics. This needs serious discussion among pro-democracy thinkers.
The NCSW must reclaim its mandate as a fearless watchdog. NGOs must shift from project cycles to structural advocacy. The government must adopt gender-responsive fiscal policies, including innovative measures, incentives, and protections for women, combined with family law reform — not selectively nor randomly.
Finally, Pakistani feminists and scholars must develop local yet rigorous metrics and frameworks to complement and contest global indexes. Until then, ignoring the mirror that the Gender Gap Index holds up will only delay the urgent reforms Pakistan’s women deserve.</p><small>2025-08-06 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06122102aedc7b0.png?r=122140' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929071/planning-minister-stresses-pakistans-interest-in-utilising-chinas-tech-progress-for-evs' target='_blank'><strong>Planning minister stresses Pakistan’s interest in utilising China’s tech progress for EVs</strong></a><br><p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal stressed Pakistan’s interest in benefitting from China’s technological progress for the development of electric vehicles (EVs), state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Wednesday.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure — with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.
Speaking to the media in Beijing during an official visit, the planning and development minister expressed Pakistan’s “desire to benefit from Chinese technological advancements”, according to Radio Pakistan.
This includes the development of next-generation batteries, such as sodium-ion batteries, which offer advantages over traditional lithium technology.
 
 

Iqbal also reaffirmed Pakistan’s interest in developing the EV sector in partnership with China, noting electric vehicles as a “key area of future cooperation between Pakistan and China”.
He stressed that establishing EV manufacturing in Pakistan would offer cost advantages for Chinese companies, adding that it would also help Pakistan to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.
The planning minister is currently on an official visit to China, where he is conducting meetings with officials to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries and advance plans for economic cooperation and development.
Last week, Iqbal met with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong in Beijing, where the two parties discussed the second phase of CPEC, industrial development and business-to-business cooperation.
On Sunday, he met with the president of China’s Development Research Centre and Centre for International Knowledge on Development, Lu Hao. During the meeting, Iqbal stated that strong economic collaboration between Pakistan and China was key to national development.
 
 

Separately, the government yesterday approved a five-year subsidy scheme for the rollout of 116,000 electric bikes and 3,170 electric rickshaws/loaders, with an estimated cost of around Rs100bn.
The scheme is part of efforts to encourage the adoption of EVs in Pakistan, reduce oil imports, and foster environmental sustainability. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to launch the initiative on August 14 formally.</p><small>2025-08-06 07:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06110516daf0917.png?r=113513' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929066/indian-army-searches-for-scores-missing-after-deadly-himalayan-flood' target='_blank'><strong>Indian army searches for scores missing after deadly Himalayan flood</strong></a><br><p>The Indian army brought in sniffer dogs, drones and heavy earth-moving equipment on Wednesday to search for scores missing a day after a deadly Himalayan flash flood.
At least four people were killed and around 100 are unaccounted for — including 11 soldiers — after a wall of muddy water and debris tore down a narrow mountain valley, smashing into the town of Dharali in Uttarakhand state.
“Additional army columns, along with army tracker dogs, drones, logistic drones, earthmoving equipment etc, have been moved… to hasten the efforts”, the army said today.
Military helicopters were working to bring in “essential supplies, medicines and (for the) evacuation of the marooned”, it added.
Uttarakhand State Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the flood was caused by an intense “cloudburst” of rain, and that rescue teams had been deployed “on a war footing”.
Videos broadcast on Indian media showed a terrifying surge of muddy water sweeping away multi-storey apartment blocks in the tourist region on Tuesday afternoon.
 


Several people could be seen running before being engulfed by the dark waves of debris that uprooted entire buildings.
Minister of State for Defence Sanjay Seth told the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency late on Tuesday that he had reports of “four deaths and around 100 people missing”.
‘Extreme event’
Torrential monsoon rains continue to pour down.
“Residents have been moved to higher reaches in view of rising water levels due to incessant rains”, the army added.
Government weather forecasters said on Wednesday that all major rivers in Uttarakhand were flowing above the danger mark.
Images released by the army, taken from the site after the main torrent had passed, showed a river of slow-moving mud.
A large part of the town was swamped by mud, with rescue officials estimating it was 15 metres deep in places, swallowing some buildings entirely.
Deadly floods and landslides are common during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say climate change, coupled with urbanisation, is increasing their frequency and severity.
 
 

The UN’s World Meteorological Organisation said last year that increasingly intense floods and droughts are a “distress signal” of what is to come as climate change makes the planet’s water cycle ever more unpredictable.
Expert hydrologist Manish Shrestha said the 270 millimetres of rain within 24 hours reported in the flood zone “counts as an extreme event”.
Shrestha, from the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, said such rain in mountains has a “more concentrated” impact than on flatter lowlands.
“Such intense rainfall events are becoming increasingly common, and could be linked to climate change”, he said.</p><small>2025-08-06 06:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/06111114d8e8c40.jpg?r=111125' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928939/ttp-agrees-not-to-use-civilians-as-human-shield-in-tirah' target='_blank'><strong>TTP agrees not to use civilians as human shield in Tirah</strong></a><br><p>KHYBER: The leaders of banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) agreed on Tuesday that they would not use civilians as a human shield in their armed struggle against security forces, nor would they extort money from anyone in the name of Zakat and Ushr in the restive Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district.
Written in Pastho on the letterhead of TTP and duly stamped by its ‘supreme council’ (Rahbari Shura), a Bar Qambarkhel elder read out the five-point agreement in front of a gathering of local tribesmen in response to their demand for ending hostilities against ordinary tribesmen and a pullout from Tirah to restore peace.
There was, however, no mention of a pullout from Tirah in the agreement inked between local elders and TTP. The leaders banned TTP vowed to continue their armed resistance against security forces and also punish those, who supported forces or found guilty of spying against them.
 
 

“Our sole purpose is an armed struggle (jihad) against anti-Islam forces and their collaborators for which we desperately need sympathies and assistance of Muslim population. We consider our involvement in internal and personal affairs of local people as inappropriate and have thus strongly refrained our volunteers from doing so,” said the agreement.

Agreement inked between local jirga and banned outfit

The agreement made it clear that TTP members would not take shelter in private houses or use it as a bunker against security forces, but they would resist any effort by forces to either capture or eliminate them at any such private building.
It claimed that none of TTP members was allowed to demand any type of money from locals in the name of Ushr and Zakat and would take strict action against those, who were found guilty of doing so if locals registered any complaint against them.
 
 

The TTP leaders, through the agreement, also agreed that no one would be abducted or tortured by them as they consider it an irresponsible act, which was harming their ‘sacred armed struggle’
It was also agreed that TTP would investigate in accordance with Sharia the killing of innocent locals and abduction or torture by unidentified armed men for which its members were blamed and local elders would be required to provide evidence of such incidents.
The Tuesday’s agreement was reached between TTP and a representative jirga of Bar Qamberkhel tribe of Tirah in Bar Bagh area. The first round of the parleys was held between them on July 28 during which TTP local commanders sought time till August 5 for conveying the demands of jirga to their leadership in Afghanistan.
Captured on video footages, the Bar Qambarkhel elders explicitly demanded an end to all types of hostilities against innocent locals and a complete pullout of all the militant groups from Tirah after a girl child was killed in a firing incident after refusal of Ushr by her parents while two handicapped bothers were also critically injured in a similar incident in July.
Both the incidents sparked widespread protests among local tribesmen in the valley with a procession of hundreds of Bar Qambarkhel tribesmen besieging a Markaz (centre) of TTP while holding the Holy Quran in their hands and pleading them to leave their area.
The Bar Qambarkhel jirga had then announced a fine of Rs5 million on those, who would pay any illegal money to TTP, and another Rs500,000 on those, who would not side with it against militant groups.
Reacting on social media, many a Tirah and Bara residents termed the agreement an eyewash, saying there was no mention of TTP leaving its ‘ground’. Some questioned as to why security forces failed to locate TTP leaders in Tirah and launch a targeted operation against them while the Bar Qambarkhel jirga met them twice and held negotiations with them.
The agreement was by and large lauded by majority of Tirah residents with the hope that they would not be harmed and harassed by militant groups as was pledged in the agreement.

• Move seen as a response to China and Russia’s joint plans to build an automated nuclear station on the Moon by 2035
US space agency Nasa will fast-track plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030, according to US media.
It is part of US ambitions to build a permanent base for humans to live on the lunar surface, reports BBC.
According to Politico, the acting head of Nasa referred to similar plans by China and Russia and said those two countries “could potentially declare a keep-out zone” on the Moon.
But questions remain about how realistic the goal and timeframe are, given recent and steep Nasa budget cuts, and some scientists are concerned that the plans are driven by geopolitical goals. Nations including the US, China, Russia, India and Japan are rushing to explore the Moon’s surface, with some planning permanent human settlements.
“To properly advance this critical technology to be able to support a future lunar economy, high power energy generation on Mars, and to strengthen our national security in space, it is imperative the agency move quickly,” US transport secretary Sean Duffy, who was appointed temporary head of Nasa by President Donald Trump, wrote to Nasa, according to the New York Times.
Mr Duffy called for proposals from commercial companies to build a reactor that could generate at least 100 kilowatts of power. This is relatively small. A typical on-shore wind turbine generates 2-3 megawatts.
The idea of building a nuclear reactor as a power source on the Moon is not new. In 2022, Nasa issued three $5 million contracts to companies to design a reactor.
And in May this year, China and Russia announced they plan to build an automated nuclear power station on the Moon by 2035.
Many scientists agree that it would be the best or perhaps only way to provide continuous power on the lunar surface.
One lunar day is equivalent to four weeks on Earth, made up of two weeks of continual sunshine and two weeks of darkness. That makes relying on solar power very challenging.
“Building even a modest lunar habitat to accommodate a small crew would demand megawatt-scale power generation. Solar arrays and batteries alone cannot reliably meet those demands,” suggests Dr Sungwoo Lim, senior lecturer in space applications, exploration and instrumentation at the University of Surrey.
“Nuclear energy is not just desirable, it is inevitable,” he adds.
Lionel Wilson, professor of earth and planetary sciences at Lancaster University, believes it is technically possible to place the reactors on the Moon by 2030 “given the commitment of enough money”, and he highlights that there are already designs for small reactors.
“It’s just a matter of having enough Artemis launches to build the infrastructure on the Moon by then,” he adds, referring to Nasa’s Artemis spaceflight programme that aims to send people and equipment to the Moon.

The hearing, scheduled for Aug 8 in the Supreme Court, follows an application filed by two residents of the India-occupied territory.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government revoked occupied Kashmir’s limited autonomy and brought it directly under federal control.
The move was accompanied by mass arrests and a communications blackout that ran for months as India bolstered its armed forces in the region to contain protests.
The removal of Article 370 of the constitution, which enshrined the India-occupied state’s special status, was challenged by political parties, the local bar association and individual litigants.
In Dec 2023, the Supreme Court upheld removing the occupied territory’s autonomy, but added that it be restored to statehood and put on a par with any other Indian state “at the earliest and as soon as possible”. “We have moved an application seeking a definitive timeline for the restoration of statehood,” said the petitioners’ lawyer, Soayib Qureshi.

“In case of imposing a major penalty, the principle of natural justice requires that a regular inquiry should be conduc­ted and opportunity of defence as well as personal hearing should be provided to the civil servant,” Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abba­si observed in a six-page order he authored.
Justice Abbasi emphasised that in cases involving public funds, extra caution and due care is required to be obse­rved to prove the charge of embezzlement or misappropriation whereas proper inqu­iry needs to be conducted in a fair and transparent manner to ensure that the public funds, so misappropriated, could be retrieved and the civil servant involved in such offence, be punished accordingly.
He was a member of the Justice Musarrat Hilali-led bench that had taken up Malik Muhammad Ramzan’s appeal against the order of the Punjab Service Tribunal, Lahore, issued on Jan 24, 2022.
The controversy concerns the dismissal from service by the District Coordination Officer/District Collector Mianwali who proceeded against Malik Muhammad Ramzan under Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act, 2006 (PEEDA) on the charges of fraud and embezzlement of funds. Malik Ramzan had allegedly raised the amounts of cheques through forgery after getting them signed by the relevant authorities.

Reinstatement of civil servant ordered, along with fresh inquiry

The petitioner filed departmental ap­­p­eal before departmental authorities, but the appeal was rejected on Nov 11, 2016. He filed a revision petition, which was also rejected on March 2, 2018 and against that order the petitioner preferred an ap­­peal before the tribunal. The tribunal, however, dismissed the plea on Jan 24, 2022. The petitioner finally approached the Su­­p­­reme Court against the tribunal’s order.
Loopholes
The apex court in its judgement held that the allegations of embezzlement/misappropriation of funds by altering the amount in cheques, which were neither authored nor signed by the petitioner, were required to be proved with conclusive evidence by confronting the petitioner with specific details.
However, Justice Aqeel observed, no such exercise appears to have been taken, nor the cheques, which were allegedly altered by the petitioner, were sent to any handwriting expert for verification.
The judgement noted that the Investi­gating Officer (IO) and the complainant before the anti-corruption department was the same person i.e. Ghulam Mustafa Sheikh, who was also the author and signatory of the cheques, which were allegedly altered by the petitioner.
It appeared that no departmental action was taken against him, therefore, the bias of the IO and the possibility of false implication of the petitioner in the instant matter could not be ruled out, the judgement said.
The Supreme Court regretted that caution and due care had not been taken in the present case and the respondent department failed to even place on record the enquiry proceedings, nor could refer to any concrete material or confidence inspiring evidence against the petitioner.
Moreover, the petitioner was not given any opportunity of being heard whereas, a major penalty of dismissal from service has been imposed upon the petitioner without conducting any regular inquiry.
The apex court held that the judgments passed by the tribunal and the orders of the lower fora were contrary to law and violative of the principles of natural justice as no regular inquiry had been conducted while imposing major penalty of dismissal from service.
Reinstatement ordered
While accepting the appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the tribunal’s order with a direction to the respondents to reinstate the petitioner into service.
The case, however, was remanded back to the departmental authority to conduct de novo inquiry into the allegations levelled against the petitioner while providing him sufficient opportunity of being heard in terms of Sections 9 and 10 of the PEEDA.
The SC expected that such inquiry would be concluded preferably within a period of three months from the date of receipt of this order, the judgement said.

• Non-tax revenue up by 68pc
ISLAMABAD: The overall tax-to-GDP ratio increased by a record 3.2 percentage points in fiscal year 2025 to reach 15.7pc — the highest in over two decades.
The record earnings came on the back of heavy taxes imposed by the government to implement strict conditions outlined in the IMF loan programme and last-minute windfalls from non-tax revenue (NTRs).
During FY2024-25, the non-tax revenue grew by 68 per cent against a 26pc growth in tax revenues, indicating the government’s focus remained more on revenue numbers than tax reforms.
According to the fiscal operations data released by the Ministry of Finance on Monday, the tax-to-GDP ratio has hit a 21-year peak of 15.7pc.
The previous high was 18pc in FY04. Since then, the ratio has been faltering between 10 to 15pc, except for 15.5pc and 15.2pc in FY17 and FY18, respectively and then again at 15pc in FY20 — all under IMF monitoring.
The growth of 3.2 percentage points in the overall tax-to-GDP last fiscal year was also the highest single-year increase. The previous record was 2.3pc in FY20 when the then government had imposed massive taxes as part of the IMF loan programme.
Record non-tax revenue
The non-tax revenue collection stood at Rs5.27tr for FY25. It amounted to 4.6pc of GDP, the highest in 16 years. Non-tax revenues include levies like the State Bank profit, markup collection from public sector entities, passport fee, oil and gas royalties, Gas Infrastructure Develop­ment Cess, Petroleum Development Levy, etc.
The non-tax revenue also surpassed the budget target of Rs4.84tr.
The ministry attributed the increase in revenues mainly to 68pc growth in non-tax collection as a consequence of higher collection of SBP profit and PDL.
The MOF had reported petroleum levy collection at Rs1.16tr in the 2026 budget.
However, updated data has now put the figure at Rs1.22tr, showing a windfall of about Rs60bn.
Another Rs108bn windfall came in the shape of markup collection from public sector entities. It was reported to be at Rs150bn in budget documents but finalised at Rs258bn. These windfalls reduced the fiscal deficit to a 9-year low of 5.4pc in FY25, about 1.4pc lower than 6.8pc of FY24.
The primary fiscal surplus — difference between total revenues and expenditures except interest payments — stood at 2.4pc of GDP or Rs6.17tr.
It was the highest since this new indicator was adopted for fiscal monitoring about a decade ago.
The Ministry of Finance had revised the FBR’s final revenue collection to Rs11.74tr against estimates of Rs11.9tr in the 2026 budget and the original target of Rs12.97tr.
This translated into a tax shortfall of Rs1.23tr, the country’s highest ever tax shortfall.
Total expenditure stood at 21.1pc of GDP (or Rs24.16tr), the highest since FY21.
Total federal mark-up payments and debt servicing for FY25 stood at Rs8.89tr, of which Rs7.98tr was for domestic debt servicing and Rs890bn for external debt servicing.
The total primary current expenditures for FY25 were recorded at Rs12.64tr, of which the federal portion amounted to Rs6.81tr, while provincial governments accounted for Rs5.83tr.
In FY25, total development and net lending expenditures was Rs2.97tr, including Rs786bn for the federal PSDP, including Rs2.12tr for provincial development.
The total statistical discrepancies were reported at negative Rs329bn, comprising Rs193bn from the federal government and Rs136bn from the provinces.

Shortly after the issuance of a short order by the division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif, NAB Rawalpindi announced fresh auction of six properties of Bahria Town at NAB office in Islamabad’s Sector G-6/1.
The properties are being auctioned after Malik Riaz was declared an absconder in the £190 million Al-Qadir Trust case.
Reacting to the development, Bahria Town Chairman Malik Riaz Hussain said they were willing to participate in any arbitration and implement its decision, if they are granted a chance to “return to serious dialogue and a dignified solution”.
In a post on his official X account, he claimed government agencies had been exerting unprecedented pressure over the past few months, which included the arrest of dozens of staff members, the freezing of the company’s bank accounts, seizure of vehicles and other stringent measures, which had paralysed all of the Bahria Town’s operations across the country.

“The situation has reached a point where we are being forced to completely shut down all Bahria Town activities across Pakistan,” said the statement attributed to Malik Riaz.
“Trillions of rupees of investment by millions of Pakistanis in Bahria Town from Karachi to Lahore and Islamabad have been frozen,” he claimed.
 






Court proceedings
Representing Bahria Town in court, senior lawyer Farooq H. Naik earlier argued that NAB’s auction notice was “illegal, deceptive, and issued with mala fide intent”.
He said the properties were being wrongfully targeted as Bahria Town was not a party to a plea bargain agreement. He said Bahria Town was also not named as an accused in any reference related to the £190 million case. He warned that the auction would set a dangerous precedent, undermining due process and investor confidence.
However, NAB prosecutor Rafay Maqsood contended that Bahria Town’s chairman and his son Ali Riaz defaulted on payments after entering into a plea bargain under the £190 million settlement. As a result, NAB initiated steps to recover the outstanding amount under Section 33E of the NAB Ordinance, 1999, by auctioning the pledged properties.
Mr Maqsood said the petitioners approached the IHC after a trial court had dismissed a similar plea. He said the high court had initially stayed the auction on June 12, the same day when the sale was scheduled. Subsequently, NAB filed an application to vacate the stay against the auction.
Bahria Town’s legal team had consistently argued that the company was not involved in the £190 million corruption case, which originated from a 2019 settlement between the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and Malik Riaz.
With the verdict now issued, the auction will go ahead as planned on Aug 7.
Auction tomorrow
After the vacation of the stay order issued by the IHC against the auction in June, the NAB announced the auction of the six properties on Thursday.
According to the anti-graft watchdog, successful bidders would have to pay 5pc of the value of the properties on the auction day, 10pc in a month and remaining 85pc in three months.
In a notification issued on Tuesday, NAB listed the six properties including corporate offices on Plots 7-D (having estimated value of Rs871m) and 7-E (estimated value of Rs881m) in Bahria Town’s Phase-II, Rawalpindi; Rubaish Marquee and Lawn in Islamabad (Rs488m), Arena Cinema (Rs1.1bn), Bahria Town International Academy (Rs1.07bn) and Safari Club (Rs1.2bn), in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi.
The accountability watchdog also filed a reference against Malik Riaz, some Sindh politicians and others in February over the transfer of land to Bahria Town.

The National Disaster Manage­ment Authority (NDMA) has issued a hydrological alert for flooding in the Sutlej river due to increased water discharge after rainfall in catchment areas.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) has issued an alert for flooding in Chen­­ab, Sutlej, Ravi and adjacent rivers from Aug 5 to 8.
The National Emergen­cies Ope­ra­tion Centre (NEOC) of NDMA has said monsoon currents are “actively penetrating” upper and central parts of Pakistan, and a “westerly trough persists over the northern areas”.
On Thursday, the discharge of water in the Sutlej river downstream of Ferozepur (Ganda Singh Wala) increased sharply from 28,657 to 33,653 cusecs within an hour.
While this intake is normal, the water flow is anticipated to increase due to heavy rainfall over Sutlej and Beas catchments in Uttarakhand, Hi­­machal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh regions of India and the occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
India is also releasing water from the Pong Dam built on the Beas river in Himachal Pradesh. The Bhakra Dam — on Sutlej river in Himachal Pradesh— and Pong Dam are currently at 55 per cent and 56 per cent storage capacity, respectively.
According to Indian media, the water level in the reservoirs is increasing and may lead to additional releases in the coming days.
This could lead to a low-level flood in the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala during the current week.
Urban flooding
The Pakistan Meteorological Dep­artment (PMD) has also warned that moderate and intermittent rainfall is expected to increase river levels to low-flood conditions.
According to the PMD’s flood bulletins, the Indus river is currently in a low-flood state at Tarbela, Guddu and Sukkur, while other major rivers have normal flow levels.
The nullahs (streams) of the Ravi river may reach low to medium flood levels in the next 36 hours, the PMD said, warning of possible urban flooding in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore and Islamabad over the next two days.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia emphasised the need for all relevant departments, including local government, agriculture, irrigation, health, and transport, to stay on high alert.
Fresh rainfall
The PMD stated that due to heavy rainfall on Aug 6, an increase in water flow is expected in local nullahs and streams in Dir, Swat, Shan­gla, Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbott­ab­­ad, Murree, Galiyat and Kashmir.
Heavy falls may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Peshawar and Nowshera in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Meanwhile, landslides and mudslides are expected in vulnerable hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir, Murree and Galiyat.
The sixth spell of monsoon rains is expected to persist until Aug 7, with gradual weakening thereafter, the Met Department said.

• KP meeting discusses implementation of repatriation plan
PESHAWAR: The federal government has informed the provinces that the formal repatriation and deportation of over 1.3 million Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards will begin on Sept 1.
The decision follows the interior ministry’s announcement on July 31 that PoR cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
A letter from the interior ministry, dated Aug 4, was sent to the chief secretaries and police chiefs of the four provinces, as well as Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, detailing the implementation of the ongoing Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
“It has been decided that the voluntary return of PoR cardholders shall commence forthwith, while the formal repatriation and deportation process will take effect from Sept 1, 2025,” the letter said.
Besides, the ministry said that repatriation of illegal foreign nationals, including Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders, would continue as per the earlier decision under the IFRP.
 
 

In the letter, the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON were instructed to provide databases of PoR cardholders to provincial, divisional and district committees. The National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) will facilitate the deregistration of returning Afghans at transit areas and border terminals, with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) supporting repatriation at designated border crossings.
The ministry also directed provincial governments and relevant agencies to map all PoR cardholders and devise action plans for repatriation. It called for designated transit areas for deportees, along with transportation and financial arrangements.
IFRP’s implementation
Meanwhile, a meeting of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Steering Committee (PSC) took place on Monday to discuss the IFRP’s implementation. Acco­rding to the minutes, the committee directed district administrations, police and Special Branch to form teams and hold jirgas with Afghan elders to encourage voluntary repatriation. Additi­onally, deputy commissioners across the provinces were tasked with remapping PoR cardholders.
The PSC decided that Nadra and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) should reestablish the Peshawar and Landi Kotal transit points to full operational capacity.
The forum also recommended that the Commissionerate of Afghan Refugees de-notify the refugee camps, as they no longer serve any purpose. It requested the Commissionerate to provide details on registration categories and the number of individuals still residing in the camps.
Regarding local transit points for deportation, the PSC clarified that the relevant deputy commissioner, with military authorities’ advice and Nadra’s guidance, should decide the fate of local deportees. The meeting stressed that these points would only be used for local deportees, with Torkham remaining the primary exit point.
Official sources told Dawn that Pakistani authorities had informed their Afghan counterparts earlier in March this year that PoR cards would not be extended beyond June 30, 2025.
 
 

According to the UNHCR, over 1.3 million Afghans were living in Pakistan as of June 30, 2025. Of this, over half (717,945) were in KP, while 326,584 resided in Balochistan, 195,188 in Punjab, 75,510 in Sindh, and 43,154 in Islamabad.
In 2004-05, the Pakistani government, with assistance from the UNHCR, issued PoR cards to Afghan refugees, and in 2016, Afghan Citizenship Cards (ACC) were introduced through an amendment to the Foreigners Act 1946.
UNHCR voices concern
Meanwhile, UNHCR, in a statement, expressed concern over Pakistan’s intention to forcibly return Afghan refugees holding PoR cards. “Over the past days, UNHCR has received reports of arrests and detention of Afghans across the country, including PoR cardholders,” it said.
The UN agency said it acknowledged and appreciated Pakistan’s generosity in hosting refugees for over 40 years amid its own challenges. However, given that those holding PoR cards have been recognised as refugees for decades, their forced return is contrary to Pakistan’s long-standing humanitarian approach to this group and would constitute a violation of the principle of non-refoulement.

• Foreign minister says internationally recognised dispute can’t be settled through amendments to local laws
KARACHI: Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has expressed the apprehension that India is likely to make occupied Jammu a separate state, adding that any such move would be in violation of international conventions and UN Security Council resolutions.
He expressed the fear while addressing a rally at Islamabad’s D-Chowk on Tuesday, held to mark six years since India unilaterally changed the special status of occupied Kashmir and bifurcated the region into the union territories of Jammu and Kash­mir, and Ladakh.
The move allowed the BJP government in New Delhi to control the disputed region through its lieutenant governor.
In recent days, the Indian media has been reporting a plan by the BJP government to give the occupied region of Jammu the status of a state.
The Hindustan Times reported that a meeting of top Indian government functionaries, including the president, prime minister and home minister, took place recently, leading to speculation about an impending move on the region’s statehood.
The paper quoted a senior BJP leader as saying that statehood for Jammu and Kashmir was “a promise that the government has already made… and it will be done when the time is right”.
However, he refused to comment on speculation that a decision will be taken in the next few days.
Amid the speculation, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said in a post on X: “I’ve heard every possible permutation & combination about what to expect in J&K tomorrow so let me stick my neck out and say nothing will happen tomorrow — fortunately nothing bad will happen but unfortunately nothing positive will happen either.”
 






Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two union territories after the Indian parliament, on August 5, 2019, passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill and abrogated Articles 370 and 35 (A) that gave special powers to the region.
‘Subservient govt’
In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr Dar said that New Delhi may take another rash step in the next few hours, or days. He called the Aug 5, 2019, measures India’s attempt to “usurp Kashmir”.
“India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and took it under the direct control of New Delhi,” he said, adding that the move was further consolidated by the Supreme Court’s decision in 2023, which gave “stamp of approval” to the con­troversial decision. Mr Dar said Jammu and Kashmir was an internationally recognised dispute and it can’t be settled through amendments in local laws.
In the last six years, he said, the BJP government had amended local laws governing Kashmir; the powers of the lieutenant governor have been increased and the delimitation of the region’s legislative assembly changed to “influence the representation of Muslims in Kashmir”.
He said non-Kashmiris have been allowed to obtain domicile, purchase properties and become part of the voter list.
“All these steps were taken to make Kashmir a separate state and form a government in Srinagar which is subservient to New Delhi.” “This is unacceptable to Pakistan and its people,” the foreign minister warned.

An exceptionally-large group of the UN-mandated experts voiced grave concerns over the GHF’s operations.
The private organisation began distributing food in Gaza Strip in May as Israel began easing a more than two-month aid blockade on the Palestinian territory that had exacerbated existing shortages.
 
 

“The GHF … is an utterly disturbing example of how humanitarian relief can be exploited for covert military and geopolitical agendas in serious breach of international law,” the experts said in a joint statement.

Allege Israel is exploiting aid for covert military and geopolitical agendas

“The entanglement of Israeli intelligence, US contractors and ambiguous non-governmental entities underlines the urgent need for robust international oversight and action under UN auspices. Calling it ‘humanitarian’ adds on to Israel’s humanitarian camouflage and is an insult to the humanitarian enterprise and standards.”
On July 22, the UN rights office said Israeli forces had kil­led more than 1,000 Palesti­nians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the GHF started operations — nearly three-quarters of them in the vicinity of GHF sites.
“Without clear accountability, the very idea of humanitarian rel­ief may ultimately become a casualty of modern hybrid warfare,” the special rapporteurs said.
“The credibility and effectiveness of humanitarian assistance must be restored by dismantling the GHF, holding it and its executives accountable, and allowing ex­­perienced and humanitarian actors from the UN and civil society alike to take back the reins of managing and distributing lifesaving aid.”
The joint statement was signed by Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur on the rights situation in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.
The statement was also signed by 18 other special rapporteurs, plus other UN experts and members of UN working groups — a notably large number for such statements.
Special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the UN Human Rights Council to report their findings. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself.

Sources said his three-day trip to Islamabad as part of the renewed effort to reset relationship between the two countries had to be delayed due to UN Security Council sanctions and travel ban.
He is one of the senior Taliban figures on the sanctioned list but had been granted waiver to travel. He has led high-level diplomatic delegations to Moscow and Beijing, but this is the first time that the Afghan Taliban foreign minister has been disallowed to travel abroad.
 
 

Other senior Taliban figures too have been barred from tra­velling abroad. Analysts say this is the first time that the foreign minister was denied permission, apparently, to exert pressure on the regime on a host of issues of concern to the international community.
Sources said that Islamabad was working to get permission from the UNSC to facilitate Mr Muttaqi’s visit. Pakistani officials had cited “technical reasons” for the last-minute change, but sources said that the real reason was the UNSC travel ban.
A Foreign Office spokespe­r­son told Dawn both sides were still in the process of wo­rking on finalising dates. “There is no question of delay or cancellation.”

• Speaker cautions Sheikh Waqqas over continued absence
• Talal insists no new military offensive in Bajaur
ISLAMABAD: Treasury members in the National Assembly relentlessly taun­ted and criticised the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday over its “failed protest call”, while renewing their offer for talks on national issues.
The dialogue offer was extended by government ministers and Speaker Ayaz Sadiq during a debate on the Kashmir issue, as the nation observed Kashmir Exploitation Day to mark the anniversary of India’s controversial Aug 5, 2019, amendment, which altered the disputed status of the region.
In response, PTI members welcomed the offer for talks but questioned the government’s authority to initiate dialogue.
Pressure mounted on PTI, already weakened by the disqualification of several of its lawmakers by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) following their convictions in the May 9 rioting cases, when the speaker issued a warning to PTI’s vocal MNA from Jhang and the party’s information secretary, Sheikh Waqqas Akram.
Mr Akram was cautioned that his seat could be vacated for being absent from the House for 40 consecutive sittings without prior notice.
PTI’s Chief Whip Aamir Dogar protested the speaker’s warning, claiming that Mr Akram had regularly submitted leave applications.
Achakzai slams PPP
The most hard-hitting speech came from Mehmood Khan Achakzai, chief of the Pashtoonkhwa Mili Awami Party (PkMAP), who declared Imran Khan as the “greatest leader” and criticised the speaker for not taking a stand to defend the members of the House.
Mr Achakzai said that the opposition had no enmity with the armed forces, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif or PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, stressing that they should all apologise for their past roles, move forward after pardoning each other and start new politics.
The PkMAP chief specially targeted the Pakistan Peoples Party, stating that he felt sorrow after seeing the PPP supporting the government in “violating” the Constitution.
Responding to Mr Achakzai’s speech, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq stressed the need for political dialogue among all parties, reiterating that both the prime minister and government ministers had already offered talks. “We will have to sit together if we want to resolve Pakistan’s issues. You all will have to do negotiations,” he said.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar also called for meaningful dialogue between all political forces to address the country’s national challenges. He stressed that differences should be resolved through consensus, not confrontation.
Sardar Latif Khosa, another firebrand PTI MNA, termed it a welcome offer, but said it had come after wrongfully denying reserved seats to the opposition.
‘No new military operation’
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Int­e­rior Talal Chaudhry clarified that no new military offensive was being launched in Bajaur or any other region. However, he insisted that both armed and non-armed components of the National Action Plan (NAP) were still in effect.
He emphasised that political backing for security forces was crucial in combating terrorism in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
The minister expressed satisfaction over the recent cooperation with Iran, following the visit of the Iranian president.“

• Asks federal, provincial govts to maintain reform momentum
• New Urdu tax forms expected to benefit over 80pc of filers
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday directed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to ensure the full implementation of reforms by removing bureaucratic hurdles and institutional barriers.
Chairing a weekly review meeting on proposed reforms within the FBR, PM Shehbaz also expressed satisfaction over the increase in the country’s tax-to-GDP ratio, which rose from 8.83 per cent in FY24 to 10.24pc in FY25, its highest level in 23 years. He attributed the improvement to the implementation of structural reforms in the tax machinery.
An official announcement said the premier reaffirmed that he, along with the federal government, will fully support and safeguard the reform initiatives undertaken by the relevant authorities.
The premier was informed that the FBR has achieved its tax collection target for the first month (July 2025) of the current fiscal year and is expected to achieve its targets in the coming months as well.
Officials also briefed the meeting on the updated income tax return form, now available online in Urdu via the FBR website. The new form is designed to be more user-friendly and accessible, which is expected to benefit approximately 84pc of return filers.
According to the announcement, PM Shehbaz also stressed the need for uniform and effective enforcement of “revolutionary” customs clearance reforms across the country.
 
 

The prime minister emphasised that integrating technology into the customs clearance reform agenda should substantially reduce procedural delays and improve institutional efficiency.
He urged both federal and provincial governments to maintain close coordination and adopt a unified strategy to preserve the momentum in tax collection achieved through FBR-led reforms in the upcoming fiscal year. He noted that the effective enforcement of existing tax measures would be critical to further boosting revenue.
The premier directed the formulation of a comprehensive strategy — developed in consultation with the FBR, relevant federal agencies and provincial authorities — to continue improving the tax-to-GDP ratio. He reaffirmed the approved timeline for FBR’s tax collection targets and reform milestones will remain unchanged.
The PM underscored the need to strengthen the institutional capacity of both FBR and the customs clearance system. He instructed the information ministry to raise public awareness about the reform agenda and its long-term benefits.
The meeting was informed that digital enforcement stations for customs clearance are being prioritised nationwide. The complete implementation of the Centralised Assessment Unit and faceless customs system is expected to significantly enhance efficiency and transparency.

He also said a “zero tariff” offer for imports of US goods into India was not good enough, alleging that India was “fuelling the war” in Ukraine.
Trump’s threat to India over its purchases of Russian oil started on July 31, when he announced a 25pc tariff for Indian goods, along with an unspecified penalty.
“They’re fuelling the war machine, and if they’re going to do that, then I’m not going to be happy,” Trump told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday, adding that the main sticking point with India was that its tariffs were too high.
“Now, I will say this, India went from the highest tariffs ever. They will give us zero tariffs, and they’re going to let us go in. But that’s not good enough, because of what they’re doing with oil, not good.”
An Indian government source said that India’s purchases of Russian oil have helped to stabilise global oil prices by easing the pressure on supplies from other regions.
India, which is the world’s third biggest oil importer and consumer, buys more than a third of the oil it needs from Russia.
India hits back, markets slide
Meanwhile, in a show of political unity, India’s ruling party and main opposition condemned the US president’s threat.
Manish Tewari, a member of parliament and leader of the opposition Congress, said Trump’s “disparaging remarks hurt the dignity and self-respect of Indians”.
“The time has come to call out this constant bullying and hectoring,” he added.
BJP Vice President Baijayant Jay Panda quoted Henry Kissinger – the most powerful US diplomat of the Cold War era – in a post on X: “To be an enemy of America can be dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal.”
 






India’s Foreign Ministry said the country was being unfairly singled out over its purchases of Russian oil, and highlighted continued trade between Moscow and both the United States and the European Union, despite the war in Ukraine.
“It is revealing that the very nations criticising India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia,” it said in a statement issued late on Monday.
It also accused the United States and the European Union of a double standard, saying it is being unfairly singled out by them over its Russian oil purchases when they both trade extensively with Moscow despite the war in Ukraine.
But the Indian rupee, which was expected to drop to an all-time low against the dollar, was rescued by a likely intervention from the Reserve Bank of India.
The rupee closed at 87.8000 to the US dollar, down 0.2pc from Monday’s close of 87.6550. The currency fell to a low of 87.8850 on Tuesday, just shy of an all-time low of 87.95 hit in February. The Reserve Bank of India helped absorb some tariff-related pressure on the rupee through interventions conducted by state-run banks, a trader at a state-owned lender said.

• Barrister Ali Zafar slams ‘disqualification spree’, says decision ignores ‘final judicial determination’
• Commission reverses Muzaffargarh by-poll order after LHC ruling
ISLAMABAD: Following their conviction by an anti-terrorism court in May 9 cases, the Election Commission of Pakistan on Tuesday disqualified nine lawmakers, including opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate.
This latest move, described by a PTI leader as a ‘disqualification spree’ by the commission, takes the number of lawmakers ousted in less than two weeks to over a dozen.
Those sent home on Tuesday included NA Opposition Leader Omar Ayub, Senate Opposition leader Shibli Faraz, MNAs Zartaj Gul, Rai Haider Ali Khan, and Rai Hassan Nawaz Khan. Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza — a key PTI ally — was also disqualified, besides three Punjab MPAs Muhammad Ansar Iqbal, Junaid Afzal Sahi, and Rai Muhammad Murtaza Iqbal.
One-third of the nine lawmakers disqua­lified by the ECP hail from Faisalabad.
A notification issued by the commission confirmed their disqualification and declared their seats vacant, on which by-elections will likely be held.
Last week, an anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad sentenced 108 individuals to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots sparked by the arrest of Imran Khan in a corruption case.
On the other hand, PTI parliamentary leader in the Senate Barrister Syed Ali Zafar slammed what he called a ‘disqualification spree’ and said the recent wave of “illegal moves” targeting specific PTI lawmakers was without any procedural consistency or final judicial determination.
“This raises the spectre of selective accountability and institutional overreach by the ECP, whose constitutional role is to be an impartial arbiter in electoral matters — not a substitute trial or appellate court,” he said, claiming such actions were “politically motivated and legally unsustainable”.
He was of the opinion that the ECP had violated due process and fair trial guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution. According to Senator Zafar, disqualification under Article 63(1)(h) takes place if a person has been convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude and sentenced to more than two years, unless a period of five years has elapsed since release.
“Clearly, the conviction must be final and not sub judice. A mere trial court conviction does not attain finality if an appeal is pending before a higher court,” he said. He recalled that the Supreme Court in the Mohammad Nawaz Sharif v. ECP case (2018) held that disqualification under Article 63(1)(h) required that the conviction must have attained finality.
“Unless a conviction is upheld by the highest appellate forum, the ECP cannot assume the disqualification has materialised. In addition, Article 10A guarantees fair trial — the essential ingredient of which is that a person retains the presumption of innocence until all remedies are exhausted.”
If the ECP begins to disqualify persons based on non-final convictions or FIRs/investigations, it amounts to pre-judging guilt, which is unconstitutional, he said, adding that the election watchdog had no original jurisdiction to determine disqualification. He said the ECP was an administrative/quasi-judicial body under Article 218(3) and relevant statutes and could act only after a final conviction or declaration was passed by a competent court.
Barrister Zafar said the “use of ECP to target politicians before their legal process was complete undermines the democratic order and judicial independence” and puts at risk public confidence in constitutional institutions.
According to the senator, “The legal framework, constitutional interpretation by the Supreme Court, and principles of natural justice all require that convictions must be final (i.e., all appeals decided) and disqualifications under Article 62(1)(f) must be based on a judicial declaration.”
It may be noted that before these nine lawmakers, Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Malik Ahmad Bhachar, MNA Abdul Latif from Chitral, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, and MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chattha had already been disqualified in the last week of July.
On July 15, Jamshed Dasti was also disqualified over “fake academic credentials”.
The commission had also announced a schedule for a by-election on the seat it had declared vacant following his disqualification, which it had to reverse on Tuesday in light of a Lahore High Court order.
