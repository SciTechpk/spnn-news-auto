According to the United Nations’ International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef), Pakistan is home to over 19 million child brides, with nearly 1 in 6 young women married before the age of 18 and as many as 4.8m girls married before the age of 15.
“In view of the fact that the alleged detenue has attained puberty and appears to have given free and voluntary consent, she shall be at liberty to reside with the petitioner,” read a verdict issued by Justice Muhammad Azam Khan for a hearing held on July 11.
The verdict was issued on a plea filed by Muhammad Riaz, challenging a June 23 order by an Islamabad-East district judge that denied the recovery of the girl after her family members allegedly “forcibly” took her away from the man’s house on June 21.
According to the order, the birth certificate, which was registered after the marriage, said the girl was aged 15 at the time of solemnisation of her Nikkah on May 30. However, the Nikahnama “vaguely records her age as ‘almost 18 years’”, and the court noted it was not empowered to “conclusively decide the question of age”.
 
 

The girl was presented before the court on July 11, when she “unequivocally
affirmed that she had contracted marriage with the petitioner of her own choice and expressed her desire to reside with him, explicitly declining to return to her parents”, the order stated.
“It is noteworthy that even during her stay at the Crisis Centre, Islamabad, she has consistently maintained this position.”
Justice Khan observed that the trial court “overlooked” that the petitioner’s counsel had highlighted that there was “great apprehension to the life, honour and dignity of the detenue” if she remained in the custody of the respondents.
Justice Khan noted that while a marriage wherein either or both of the parties were under 18 was “not void under the Shariah, it is nonetheless punishable by law and treated as contrary to public policy, especially where it undermines the minor’s physical, emotional, and educational development”.
The order delved into the legal definitions of “child”, “child marriage” and “child abuse”, and considered various questions, including whether a marriage “valid under the Islamic law/Shariah can be considered void under the statutory law, particularly in light of the Act of 2025”.
 
 

The IHC order also mentioned the Islamabad Child Marriage Restraint Act 2025 (ICMRA) passed in May, which raised the minimum marriage age for girls from 16 years to 18 years.
However, the judge pointed out that the ICMRA “does not render the marriage itself void” but has been “enacted merely to punish the party contracting, arranging and/or solemnising a marriage with a child”.
“This bifurcation, where the marriage is considered valid under one body of law but criminal under another, creates a legal paradox that risks frustrating the very objective of the statute, which is to act as a deterrent against child marriages and protect minors from premature unions that could harm their physical, emotional, and educational well-being,” Justice Khan wrote.
On the question of whether child marriage would fall within the definition of
Sections 375 and 377A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and thereby constitute “rape”, the judge observed that prior precedents do not consider consummation within such a marriage as “rape”. The “element of lawful relationship and consent within marriage fundamentally distinguishes” underage marriages from rape cases, he added.
The petitioner’s counsel, Advocate Shumaila Rafique Awan, cited previous Supreme Court orders from 1970 and 2021 to “assert that the marriage contracted is valid under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO, 1961), therefore, the petitioner has the right to recover his wife and protect their lawful union”.
Advocate Mirza Irfan Ghazanfar, the counsel for two of the respondents, contended that the earlier order did not “call for any interference” and that the girl was not sui juris (of age) at the time of the Nikkah.
The respondents’ lawyers, as per the order, cited a 2022 IHC ruling to “contend that marriages contracted between a minor and an adult are considered void ab initio, as the same constitute a criminal offence under the Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929”.
Legal clarity urgently needed to ‘safeguard minors from harm’
Despite constitutional protections, disparities in legal marriage age persist across provinces, with only Sindh and the Islamabad Capital Territory enforcing 18 as the minimum age for girls — a gap that continues to expose millions to early pregnancies, domestic violence, and educational exclusion.
Given the sensitive nature of the case, the court made “certain recommendations in aid of legislative clarity and institutional consistency”.
These included urging the federal government to undertake a legislative review to get rid of “inconsistencies across various statutes qua the
determination of age”.
 
 

“It is recommended that the federal government adopt a clear statutory
stance regarding the marriage contracted involving minors, even if they
have attained puberty and show signs of mental maturity. It is necessary
to do so in order to protect children of tender age.
“To uphold Constitutional rights and safeguard minors from harm, statutory clarity is urgently needed,” the judgment stressed.
The judge listed various discrepancies in different statutes, including the PPC, Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance 1979, Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939, Guardian & Wards Act 1890, Majority Act 1875, National Commission on the Rights of Child Act 2017, Juvenile Justice System Act 2018, and the Islamabad Capital Territory Child Protection Act 2018.
Justice Khan strongly recommended that the federal government “launch a sustained and comprehensive awareness campaign to educate citizens, public officials, Nikkah registrars, and community leaders about the harmful consequences and legal implications of child marriages”.
The judge stressed that the district administration and licence-issuing authorities shall ensure that all Nikkah registrars are fully informed about the provisions and penal consequences under the ICMRA, and that they must be trained to “strictly avoid solemnising or registering any marriage involving a
minor”.
 
 

To prevent the registration of underage marriages, Justice Khan called on the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) and relevant marriage registration authorities to integrate the Birth Registration Certificate into their systems, ensuring verification of age before issuing a Marriage Certificate.
The court further directed that “all Guardian Courts, Family Courts, and Courts exercising jurisdiction under Section 491 [of the Code of Criminal Procedure] must engage Child Protection Officers (CPOs) under the Islamabad Child
Protection Act 2018 to conduct a statutory welfare assessment”.
“The CPO’s report should be treated as an essential aid in determining
custody, care, or marital status of the minor,” the order added, emphasising that the approach would ensure child-centric, evidence-based decision-making in line with Constitutional protections under Articles 9 (security of person), 14 (inviolability of dignity), 25 (equality of citizens), and 35 (protection of family, etc).
The judge also urged that “all courts dealing with cases involving alleged child marriages adopt a participatory, protective and trauma-informed approach, one that treats the minor not merely as a subject of parental or spousal authority, but as a rights-bearing individual whose voice must guide
the inquiry and whose welfare must define the outcome”.
In view of the recommendations, the judge ordered that copies of the judgment be sent to the law, human rights and interior ministries, the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, the Islamabad chief commissioner, the Nadra director general, the Council of Islamic Ideology (CCI) secretary, as well as all district and sessions judges.</p><small>2025-10-01 11:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011626285738823.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945848/more-ingredients-for-life-discovered-in-ocean-on-saturn-moon' target='_blank'><strong>More ingredients for life discovered in ocean on Saturn moon</strong></a><br><p>The ocean hidden under the icy shell of Saturn’s moon Enceladus harbours complex organic molecules, a study said on Wednesday, offering further evidence that the small world could have all the right ingredients to host extraterrestrial life.
Just 500 kilometres (310 miles) wide and invisible to the naked eye, the white, scar-covered Enceladus is one of hundreds of moons orbiting the sixth planet from the Sun.
For a long time, scientists believed Enceladus was too far away from the Sun — and therefore too cold — to be habitable.
Then the Cassini space probe flew past the moon several times during a 2004-2017 trip to Saturn and its rings, discovering evidence that a vast saltwater ocean is concealed under the moon’s kilometres-thick layer of ice.
Since then, scientists have been sifting through the data collected by Cassini, revealing that the ocean has many of the elements thought to be needed to host life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide, and phosphorus.
When the spacecraft passed over the moon’s south pole, it discovered jets of water bursting through cracks on the surface.
These jets were propelling tiny ice particles — smaller than grains of sand —  into space. While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon’s surface, others collected around one of Saturn’s many rings.

When Cassini flew through Saturn’s outermost “E” ring, it was “detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,” Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space Agency.
By looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules — including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.
But these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years —  or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.
So the scientists wanted to look at some fresh ice grains.
Luckily, they already had access to some.
When Cassini flew directly into the spray spewing from the moon’s surface in 2008, grains of ice hit the spacecraft’s Cosmic Dust Analyser at around 18 kilometres a second.
But it took years to complete a detailed chemical analysis of these particles, which was the subject of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.
Back to the moon?
Study co-author Frank Postberg said the research proves that “the complex organic molecules Cassini detected in Saturn’s ‘E’ ring are not just a product of long exposure to space, but are readily available in Enceladus’s ocean”.
French astrochemist Caroline Freissinet, who was not involved in the study, told AFP that there was “not much doubt” that these molecules were in the moon’s ocean.
But this confirmation provides “another piece in the puzzle,” she added.
It also shows that recent technology, such as artificial intelligence, allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.
But to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.
The European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.
After all, “Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,” the agency said in the statement.
Khawaja added that “even not finding life on Enceladus would be a huge discovery, because it raises serious questions about why life is not present in such an environment when the right conditions are there.”</p><small>2025-10-01 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011441176509c96.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945843/man-allegedly-guns-down-brother-3-family-members-in-abbottabad-police' target='_blank'><strong>Man allegedly guns down brother, 3 family members in Abbottabad: police</strong></a><br><p>A man allegedly shot dead his brother, sister-in-law, and their two daughters in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Abbottabad district on Wednesday, according to the police.
Abbottabad Police Spokesperson Azam Mir Afzal told Dawn.com that the incident took place in the Bandi Attai area of Havelian.
“The suspect allegedly killed his brother along with his family members, but the motive behind the murders could not be immediately ascertained.”
He said a police team had been dispatched to the area and a first information report (FIR) was being registered at the Havelian police station.
According to the spokesperson, the suspect killed his brother, his sister-in-law, and two nieces before fleeing the scene.
The spokesperson added that police had reached the spot and the bodies of the victims were shifted to the Havelian hospital for post-mortem.

“Additionally, it noted a shutdown of cellular services on election night, which reduced the transparency of the process and impacted the efficiency of receiving results,” a COG press release said on Tuesday.
The report had been the subject of some controversy after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had buried the report after finding the elections to be riddled with problems.
The COG noted areas for improvement and provided recommendations for strengthening the independence of the country’s democratic institutions, the press release said.
A “Letter of Transmittal”, written by COG Chairperson Dr Goodluck Jonathan and included in the report, noted the denial of election symbol to the PTI, the  consecutive convictions of the party’s founder Imran Khan, and limitations on freedom of association and assembly.
It then said: “When looked at in isolation, some — though not all — of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party’s ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”
The COG chairperson wrote: “We noted with concern a number of factors in the pre-election period that significantly impacted the level playing field, most crucially the non-allocation of the bat symbol to PTI and the registering of PTI candidates as independents.
 
 

“While the for this decision had a basis in law, the negative consequences of this decision appeared vastly disproportionate to the offence this decision sought to address.”
The Supreme Court had revoked the PTI’s bat symbol just weeks before the elections over not holding its intra-party polls, forcing the party’s candidates to contest as independent candidates without a unified symbol.
Other “issues of concern” noted by the COG included Imran’s convictions in three separate cases days before the election. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the group said.
It also noted “limitations on journalistic freedoms, including in relation to freedom of speech and a culture of impunity for perpetrators of violence against journalists, which may have led to self-censorship”.
Forms-45 ‘may have been altered’
The 161-page report also mentioned the Forms-45 controversy that has been at the heart of rigging allegations levelled by the PTI during those elections.
“In several constituencies, the Group reviewed documentation that suggested that Form 45s may have been altered to change the total number of votes received by candidates, and that these altered forms were used to compile the tabulated results on Forms 47, resulting in some candidates being illegally returned as elected,” the COG report read.
 
 

It said the COG was informed that, in many cases, the Forms-45 submitted to the Returning Officer (RO) differed from the copies of Forms-45 “received at the polling station by agents of independent candidates and other party agents”.The COG also “reviewed documentation that appeared to show that a significant number of Forms 46 had been altered”.
Providing its assessment of the English-language media coverage, the COG noted that the mainstream media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting”.
“However, some sections of the media covered some candidates and political parties more favourably than they did others, with PTI-affiliated independent candidates receiving less positive coverage in national mainstream media.”
The report pointed out that state-owned PTV News “lacked balance, with the majority of its coverage concentrated on PML-N and the PPP — especially the former” — while PTI-affiliated independent candidates were not given as much coverage.
The COG said it was “informed that broadcasters were prevented from saying Imran Khan’s name, instead being instructed to refer only to the chair of PTI”.
 
 

Moreover, the group noted that “some English language newspapers published obvious campaign messages of PML-N and its leader on 7 February” despite the campaign period ending the day before.
The report also detailed the COG’s assessments on the pre-poll activities; the voting, counting and results process; the inclusion of women, youth, the transgender community and religious minorities; and the legal environment, including certain recent rulings and a letter by judges alleging interference.
“Jurisprudential inconsistencies in two of the most significant and consequential cases in the pre-election period had severe impacts in terms of the level nature of the playing field,” the COG said, specifying the SC’s reversal of the lifetime ban for politicians, and the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision, later upheld by the apex court, to withhold the bat symbol from PTI.
Reduction in voter registration gender gap
In its report, the COG also “commended the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) efforts to ensure inclusive elections”.
“It noted the ECP’s expansion of its Gender and Social Inclusion Wing as a worthwhile endeavour, which contributed to a reduction in the voter registration gender gap from 12 per cent in 2013 to 7.7pc in the 2024 election.
“The group further noted the establishment of the ECP’s gender hotline for reporting election-related harassment and intimidation. There was also an improvement in youth voter turnout.”
The press release, citing the report, added that despite challenges, the “potential for improving future polls was encouraging”.
“The potential of Pakistan’s democracy is enormous. Pakistan has a vibrant and diverse media; women and the youth are more engaged than ever; and Pakistan’s CSOs play a critical role in the democratic life of the country, continually pushing for reform and improvement.”
The report proposed reforms to various aspects of the electoral process, including the legal framework and its interpretation, election administration, and laws impacting political rights, women’s participation, pre-election campaigns, and the role of the media,  the press release said.
The COG noted areas for improvement and provided recommendations for strengthening the independence of the country’s democratic institutions, the press release said.
It further stated: “The group highlighted, among others, the conditions which appeared to limit fundamental political rights and impacted one party’s ability to fairly contest the election. Additionally, it noted a shutdown of cellular services on election night, which reduced the transparency of the process and impacted the efficiency of receiving results.”
The report concluded that these developments may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process”.
‘Delayed’ report
According to the letter of transmittal appended to the report, it was submitted by the COG to the Commonwealth Secretary General on Nov 20, 2024. A press statement issued alongside the report did not explain the inordinate delay in its publication.
In September, the PTI had called on the COG to release this report, claiming that it laid bare “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting of PTI and its founder, Imran Khan”.
However, in a statement issued on Sept 14, the COG said it was aware that a version of its report on the 2024 Pakistan general elections was circulating online, but that they did not comment on leaked documents as a matter of policy.
“The government and the Election Commission of Pakis­tan have already received the report. The full report, as we had communicated earlier, will be released later this month, along with a number of COG reports currently in the publication pipeline,” the COG statement said.
The PTI’s demand came after a recent report by the independent news outlet Drop Site News claimed that the COG had “buried their report” after finding the Feb 8 general elections to be riddled with problems.
Although the group’s report on Pakistan was yet to be officially released back then, media outlets claimed to have obtained leaked copies of the report.</p><small>2025-10-01 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0114524624df35a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945844/have-never-apologised-to-bcci-nor-will-i-mohsin-naqvi-hits-back-at-indian-media-reports' target='_blank'><strong>‘Have never apologised to BCCI nor will I’: Mohsin Naqvi hits back at Indian media reports</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Asia Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday refuted claims by Indian media that he had apologised to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the trophy handover issue at Sunday’s Asia Cup final.
The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from the ACC chief, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. Subsequently, Indian skipper Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup.
Later, Indian media alleged that Naqvi had himself refused to hand the trophy over to the Indian team.
Today, several Indian outlets, including IndiaToday, Financial Express and Hindustan Times, reported that Naqvi had now apologised to the BCCI, but that he still refused to hand them the trophy.
Responding to an India Today post about their report on social media platform X, Naqvi stated, “Indian media thrives on lies, not facts. Let me make it absolutely clear: I have done nothing wrong and I have never apologised to the BCCI nor will I ever do so.”
He called the claims “fabricated nonsense” and “cheap propaganda”, saying it was aimed at misleading Indian people.
The PCB chairman slammed India for continuing to “drag politics into cricket, damaging the very spirit of the game”.
“As ACC chairman, I was ready to hand over the trophy that very day and I am still ready now,” he said. “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.”
 






During the Asia Cup, Naqvi had previously expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” from the Indian side after Yadav seemingly politicised the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May.
Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention. Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The PCB had lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Yadav’s remarks, leading to him reportedly being fined 30 per cent of his match fee after being found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct.
Meanwhile, pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were also reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against India.
Following the final, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on winning the match, calling it a continuation of India’s Operation Sindoor.
Naqvi had also responded to Modi’s post on X, saying: “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”.
“Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he had said.</p><small>2025-10-01 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011340284c8f3c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945837/islamabad-court-recalls-non-bailable-arrest-warrants-as-imaan-mazari-husband-appear-in-court' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court recalls non-bailable arrest warrants as Imaan Mazari, husband appear in court</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad District and Sessions Court on Wednesday recalled the non-bailable arrest warrants issued against prominent human rights defenders and lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chatha  after the two appeared in court for their hearing.
Arrest warrants had been issued for the two lawyers yesterday for failing to appear before the court in a case related to controversial tweets. A junior lawyer informed the court that Mazari and Chatha had left for another appearance in Rawalpindi after marking their attendance earlier in the day.
The case was heard by Judge Mohammad Afzal Majoka, with police deployed outside the courtroom for tight security.
While the couple appeared in court today, they did not respond with a confirmation or denial when their indictment was read out to them.
“We, the lawyers, will do it, and then we can respond to the court in this regard,” Chatha said. “There is a new request regarding our documents … No charges can be filed until this application is decided.”
Judge Majoka directed the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to provide documents to the accused and adjourned the hearing until 11:30am.
Later, when the documents were provided, the prosecution expressed ignorance regarding the first written statement. The accused had applied to obtain the written statement submitted to the Federal Investigation Agency.
Former High Court Bar president Riyasat Ali Azad, District Bar president Naeem Gujar, and former District Bar president Qaiser Imam also appeared before the court.
The court wrote a decision on a miscellaneous petition filed regarding the statement of 161 and other documents. The two decided to challenge the current phase of the charge frame.
The lawyers representing Mazari and Chatha requested the court for more time, which was granted. The hearing has been adjourned until October 7.
The court recorded its order on a miscellaneous application regarding statements under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)
and other documents. The section deals with the power of the police to examine witnesses orally during an investigation and to reduce their statements into writing.
Initially, the prosecution expressed ignorance about the written statements, but once the court began dictating its order, the statements were handed over. Mazari and Chatha had earlier applied for access to their written statements submitted before the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
Subsequently, their counsel decided to challenge the framing of charges at this stage and requested additional time from the court. The request was accepted, and the hearing was adjourned until October 7.
Last week, Mazari filed a grievance letter over “inaction” on her workplace harassment complaint against Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar.
Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had issued condemnatory statements and called for the judge’s dismissal from the post of the IHC top judge.
Mazari approached an inquiry committee of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against IHC Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar earlier in September following the altercation between them the previous week.</p><small>2025-10-01 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0112314082e1b36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945826/did-muslim-countries-agree-to-a-different-version-of-trumps-gaza-plan-heres-what-we-know' target='_blank'><strong>Did Muslim countries agree to a different version of Trump’s Gaza plan? Here’s what we know</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday unveiled a 20-point plan for Gaza. Subsequently, eight Arab or Muslim-majority nations — Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt — “welcomed the role of the American president and his sincere efforts aimed at ending the war in Gaza”.
In Pakistan, the government’s so-called approval of the plan had drawn flak from politicians, journalists and activists alike, who termed the deal a “two-state surrender’’ with the scales weighing heavily in Israel’s favour.
Subsequently, signs began appearing that not everyone was happy with the draft made public by the White House. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar seemingly distanced Pakistani decision-makers from the plan. He also made it clear in so many words that the US peace plan for Gaza would not be acceptable if the am­e­ndments — jointly pro­posed by eight Muslim co­u­n­tries — were not included.
This came after Trump had previously claimed that both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir were behind the plan “100 per cent”. However, in yesterday’s presser, Dar said the “document has been issued by the US” and that it was “not our document”.
The question that has arisen after these developments is whether the Muslim countries, whose leaders had met Trump last week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss a possible deal on Gaza, had backed a plan that looked different. Here’s what we know:
‘Deal significantly different’
According to US news outlet Axios, the deal now before Hamas is significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention.
“Trump presented the situation as straightforward,” Axios reported. “Israel, the US and its Arab partners were all aligned on a final plan, and Hamas had to agree or face annihilation.”
However, the publication stated that behind the scenes, reality was murkier.
While Trump and Netanyahu were discussing the plan on camera at the White House, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani was presenting it to Hamas leaders in Doha, Axios reported, citing a knowledgeable source.
 
 

“Officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey were furious over the changes, according to sources with knowledge,” it reported. It further said that the Qataris had tried to convince the Trump administration to not release the plan due to these objections but the White House did so anyway.
It noted that while the eight Muslim and Arab countries had welcomed the deal in an initial statement, the “Qataris told the other countries that after that generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details,” the report quoted one source as saying.
‘Netanyahu secured key edits’
Meanwhile, The Times of Israel reported that during the extensive meeting with Trump, Netanyahu had managed to secure “significant 11th-hour changes” to the proposal regarding the scope and nature of Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, along with the disarmament of Hamas.
The publication stated: “Point 3 of what was then a 21-point plan obtained by The Times of Israel stated that “Israeli forces will withdraw to the battle lines as of when the [US special envoy Steve Witkoff’s] proposal was presented to prepare for hostage release.”
The Times of Israel noted that the previous version did not specify which Witkoff proposal and the plan published on Monday stated that “Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed-upon line“ without any further elaborations. It stated, however, that it appeared to refer to a “new map” that was “included in the updated version that illustrated three phases of Israeli withdrawals from Gaza”.
The report further said that the map shows that “Israeli troops will be able to remain in the majority of the Gaza Strip even after the first pullback of Israel Defence Forces (IDF) troops in preparation for all of the hostages to be released”.
“They will then be able to remain in those positions until the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) of Arab and Muslim countries is prepared to deploy and fully operate to disarm Hamas, the plan states. Even after the second phase of the withdrawal, the IDF will remain in over a third of the Strip, the map indicates,” the report said.
“The third withdrawal will clear the final troops out of Gaza, but the map shows that a security buffer zone will be established along the perimeter of the entire Strip, another Israeli demand aimed at mitigating the threat of another October 7-like invasion,” it said.
 

Map released by the White House.

Further, the report said that point 16 of the original US plan simply stated that the IDF “will progressively hand over the Gaza territory that [it] occup[ies].”
It added that the updated version added two lines that “further qualify the nature of the withdrawal in Israel’s favour”, stating that IDF “will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarisation that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the US“.
“Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat,” the plan announced on Monday states.
Concessions on disarmament
The Times of Israel further stated that Netanyahu managed to secure concessions regarding disarmament during a meeting with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and top adviser Jared Kushner at his hotel in New York on Thursday and Sunday.
“Whereas last week’s version granted amnesty to ‘Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence’, the plan published Monday adds that those members also have to ‘decommission their weapons’,” the publication said.
It further noted that point 13 of the plan originally stated: “There will be full commitment to destroy and stop building any offensive military infrastructure.”
However, the updated version goes into much greater detail on the issue, stating that “all military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt,“ it reported.
“There will be a process of demilitarisation of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy-back and reintegration program, all verified by the independent monitors,” the plan released on Monday said.
‘Arab mediator less bullish than Netanyahu’
The Times of Israel quoted a diplomat from one of the mediating countries as saying that while Arab and Muslim leaders met Trump last week, Netanyahu managed to secure “the last word”, convincing Washington to make additional changes to the plan at a point in the process when it was much harder for them to intervene.
“Speaking to Trump last also allowed Netanyahu to secure something of a concession from the US president,” the report said. It quoted the diplomat as saying that it would be difficult for Egypt and Qatar to convince Hamas to accept the US proposal as is and it would likely take them several days to respond.
Qatar says ‘clarification’ needed
Meanwhile, Qatar, a key mediator, has also said that further talks were needed over details of Trump’s peace plan. The Associated Press quoted three Arab officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, as saying that changes had been made in the original proposal that Arab and Muslim countries had worked out with Trump — changes in favour of Israel.
The Arab officials who spoke to the AP expressed frustration with the White House’s 20 points. “This is not what we agreed on,” said one. “This is the Netanyahu plan,“ the publication reported the official as saying.
Separately, the Qatari prime minister has also told Al Jazeera that there were certain things within the plan that needed “clarification” and “discussion and negotiation”.
 


“The main focus is how we protect the people in Gaza. In the end, we are a mediator. When we started the plan last week [..] we delivered it to Hamas, the negotiating delegation and the discussions with them were in generality.
“We hope that everyone will look at the matter constructively and we tried to make use of the momentum now to end the war in Gaza. I believe that should be the primary priority,” he said.

In a lawsuit filed in August, xAI had said that Apple would have no reason to refrain from more prominently featuring the X app and the Grok app in its App Store if not for its “exclusive” deal with OpenAI.
Musk’s company sought billions of dollars in alleged damages.
“Apple and OpenAI’s agreement is expressly not exclusive, and it is public and widely known that Apple intends to partner with other generative AI chatbots,” lawyers for Apple said in a court filing on Tuesday, while asking the judge to dismiss the case.
Musk’s AI startup xAI and social media X do not “plausibly allege” that the integration of ChatGPT into Apple devices harms competition, they added.
Apple in partnership with OpenAI has integrated ChatGPT into its operating system for iPhones, iPads and Macs.

“Ten terrorists were killed during an exchange of fire between them and the CTD team in the Aghbarg neighbourhood of Quetta,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
“CTD carried out the operation after receiving a tip-off from intelligence agencies,” he said, adding that “upon reaching the area, they were attacked by the terrorists but promptly retaliated.”
“Heavy ammunition and weapons were recovered from the slain terrorists,” as per the statement.
The spokesperson said that the “terrorists had previously been involved in attacking security forces and belonged to a banned terrorist outfit.”
“The slain terrorists have not yet been identified,” the spokesperson said, adding that their “bodies have been transferred to a hospital for identification purposes.”
“Further investigation into the matter is underway,” the statement said.
The development comes a day after 10 people, including four security personnel, were martyred in a suicide car blast near the headquarters of the Frontier Corps (FC) in Quetta.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks.

The atmosphere was highly charged following the death of one person and injuries to several others a day earlier.
Although government offices remained open, attendance was thin for want of transport. Banks were also open but hardly saw any client. All private businesses and shops, including medical stores, remained closed. Even street vendors were nowhere to be seen.
Angry youngsters, some carrying batons, blocked intercity roads in many areas of the state capital till afternoon by placing different obstacles and torching bushes.
Nevertheless, some private vehicles and motorcycles were seen running through the roads sporadically, without facing serious resistance from the activists.
On receiving information about blockades, police personnel swiftly rushed to clear the road obstacles.
 



Skirmishes reported between activists of JKJAAC and law enforcers in Muzaffarabad; angry youngsters block inter-city roads in many areas

According to witnesses, at several such places they lobbed tear gas shells to quell disturbance and also made arrests.
In some areas, law enforcers were also pelted with stones from the mountain slopes, forced them to retreat to safety.
On Tuesday, there were reports of minor casualties on both sides, but these could not be verified as government officials refrained from sharing anything with the media.
Authentic figures of detainees could not be obtained either.
This correspondent tried to reach out to a number of senior officials, but their staff said “they were busy in meetings and unable to take calls”. One senior police official did attend the call after several attempts, but declined to confirm or contradict the number of detainees.
By the afternoon, thousands of people gathered at Muzaffarabad’s Lal Chowk where Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) leaders, including Shaukat Nawaz Mir, addressed them.
“A state is like a mother, but unfortunately ours has turned out to be a witch that killed its own children,” fumed Mr Mir.
On Monday, Muhammad Sudhir, a 30-year-old shopkeeper belonging to Neelum Valley, was killed in Muzaffarabad after sustaining gunshot wounds.
The JKJAAC alleged the shots were fired by the participants of a government-backed rally, led by Raja Saqib Majeed of Muslim Conference.
Late on Monday night, relatives and other activists had placed his body on the main artery in Chehla Bandi negibourhood to press the authorities for registration of an FIR against Mr Majeed and other accused.
The body was removed only after their demands were met.
“We have full recording evidence as to who fired upon peaceful protesters and at whose behest,” Mr Mir said.
Reports from Rawalakot said that thousands of people had assembled at Tourism Chowk, but police avoided confronting them.
According to local journalists, the participants might start a march on Wednesday either to some entry points or straight to Muzaffarabad.
In Dadyal, where tensions had escalated immensely in a similar protest in May last year, thousands of people threw huge containers into the river from Palaak Bridge where they had been placed by the administration, apparently to block movement between Kotli and Mirpur district.
Media affected
Meanwhile, the absolute suspension of internet and mobile phone services since Sunday hit the journalist community hard as no local newspaper could be published for the second consecutive day on Tuesday.
Many of those working for the national and international media, as well as some of the vloggers, had to travel to Garhi Habibullah in the neighbouring KP, from where they filed their stories and uploaded the stuff on Sunday and Monday.
But on Tuesday it was learnt that internet services had also been snapped in Garhi Habibullah, forcing some of the journalists to travel up to Mansehra for filing reports.

It is the first shutdown since the longest in history — lasting 35 days — almost seven years ago, and will stop work at multiple federal departments and agencies, affecting hundreds of thousands of government workers.
Trump blamed Democrats over the stalled talks and threatened to punish the party and its voters during the stoppage by targeting progressive priorities and forcing mass public sector job cuts.
“So we’d be laying off a lot of people that are going to be very affected.
And they’re Democrats, they’re going to be Democrats,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
 






He said a “lot of good can come down from shutdowns”, and suggested he would use the pause to “get rid of a lot of things we didn’t want, and they’d be Democrat things”.
Government operations began grinding to a halt at 12:0am (9:01am PKT), after a frenetic but ultimately failed bid in the Senate to rubber-stamp a short-term funding resolution already approved by the House of Representatives.
Hopes of a compromise had been hanging by a thread since Monday, when a last-gasp meeting at the White House yielded no progress.
The gridlocked Congress regularly runs into deadlines to agree on spending plans, and the negotiations are invariably fraught. But Congress usually avoids them ending in shutdowns.
Democrats, in the minority in both chambers of Congress, have been seeking to flex their rare leverage over the federal government eight months into Trump’s barnstorming second presidency that has seen entire government agencies dismantled.
Trump’s threat of new job cuts added to anxieties in the federal workforce sparked by large-scale firings orchestrated by tycoon Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year.
Health care under threat
The 100-member Senate requires government funding bills to receive 60 votes — seven more than the Republicans control.
Republicans had proposed to extend current funding until late November, pending negotiations on a longer-term spending plan.
But Democrats wanted to see hundreds of billions of dollars in health care spending restored, particularly in the Obamacare health insurance program for low-income households, which the Trump administration is likely to eliminate.
Almost all Senate Democrats voted against a House-passed, seven-week stop-gap funding measure hours ahead of the midnight deadline.
It remains unclear how long the shutdown will last.
The federal government has shuttered 21 times since 1976, when Congress enacted the modern-day budget process.
Some stoppages have lasted only a few hours — not long enough to affect government operations.
The longest began on December 22, 2018 when Democrats and Trump found themselves at an impasse over $5.7 billion the president was demanding for a border wall during his first term.
Around 380,000 federal employees were furloughed and another 420,000 worked without pay.
Senators can move quickly when inclined by waiving the normal procedures that tend to hold up legislation.
The upper chamber was due back in session on Wednesday, but a House recess lasting all week means it will not be able to rubber stamp any quick deal agreed by the Senate.
The Senate will be out on Thursday for the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur, but will be back on Friday and possibly in session through the weekend.
The shutdown will not affect vital functions like the Postal Service, the military and welfare programs like Social Security and food stamps.
But up to 750,000 workers could be sent home each day and would not be paid until the shutdown was over, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p><small>2025-10-01 07:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/010955025483093.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945820/philippines-quake-death-toll-rises-to-69-official-says' target='_blank'><strong>Philippines quake death toll rises to 69, official says</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from a 6.9-magnitude earthquake that hit the central Philippines has risen to 69, a disaster official said on Wednesday as the government mobilised agencies to search for survivors and restore power and water supplies.
In Bogo city in the north of Cebu province, which was near the epicentre of the shallow quake that struck off the coast just before 10pm on Tuesday, the hospital has been “overwhelmed,” Civil Defence official Raffy Alejandro told reporters.
The death toll of 69 was based on data from the Cebu provincial disaster office and was subject to validation, said Jane Abapo, an information officer at the regional Civil Defence office. Another official said more than 150 people were injured.
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr assured survivors of swift assistance, saying cabinet secretaries were on the ground directing relief operations, as he expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones.
Cebu, one of the Philippines’ most popular tourist destinations, is home to 3.4 million people. Despite the damage, Mactan-Cebu International Airport, the country’s second busiest gateway, remained operational.
Another hard-hit town, San Remigio, was placed under a state of calamity to help the response and relief efforts. Vice Mayor Alfie Reynes appealed for food and water for evacuees, as well as heavy equipment to aid search and rescue workers.
“It is raining heavily and there is no electricity, so we really need help, especially in the northern part because there’s a scarcity of water after supply lines were damaged by the earthquake,” Reynes told DZMM radio.
In the nearby town of Pilar, resident Archel Coraza said most of his family were asleep when their house began to shake violently.
“I woke them up and we all rushed outside into the street,” he told DZMM. Coraza, who lives close to the shoreline, said he saw seawater recede after the tremor.
Local media posted videos of people rushing out of their homes as the ground shook and buildings collapsed, including a church that was more than 100 years old.
Reynes said among the deceased were some people who had been playing basketball in a sports complex in San Remigio when it partially collapsed due to the quake.
Earthquake monitoring agencies put the quake’s depth at around 10km and recorded multiple aftershocks, the strongest having a magnitude of 6. There was no tsunami threat following the quake.
The Philippines lies in the Pacific “Ring of Fire“, where volcanic activity and earthquakes are common. The country had two major earthquakes in January, with no casualties reported. In 2023, a 6.7-magnitude offshore earthquake killed eight people.</p><small>2025-10-01 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011155170a9f313.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945830/china-launches-visa-to-attract-foreign-tech-talent' target='_blank'><strong>China launches visa to attract foreign tech talent</strong></a><br><p>China kicked off a new visa programme on Wednesday to attract foreign talent in science and technology. This is part of ongoing efforts to position itself as a world leader in those sectors ahead of the United States.
The Chinese measure, announced in August, starkly contrasts with recent US policy, with the Trump administration suddenly introducing new and expensive changes to its skilled worker visas last month.
China’s new K visa significantly simplifies the immigration process for those eligible, according to state media.
“Against the backdrop of some countries retracting, turning inward, and sidelining international talent, China has keenly seized this important opportunity and promptly introduced this policy,” state newspaper People’s Daily said in a comment piece on Tuesday.
In contrast to many other visa categories, the K visa does not require a domestic employer or entity to invite the applicant.
“K visas will offer more convenience to holders in terms of the number of permitted entries, validity period, and duration of stay,” state news agency Xinhua reported in August.
The official description for those able to apply is “young foreign scientific and technological talents”, but the exact age, educational background, and work experience requirements needed are as yet unclear.
Xinhua said visa-holders will be able to “engage in exchanges in fields such as education, culture, and science and technology, as well as relevant entrepreneurial and business activities”.
Across the Atlantic, the US tech industry has been rattled by unexpected changes made by the Trump administration to the H-1B visa procedure.
H-1Bs allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills — such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers — to work in the United States for three years, with a possible extension to six.
Such visas are widely used by the tech industry, but the new H-1B visa policy now requires a one-time $100,000 fee.
Indian nationals account for nearly three-quarters of the permits allotted via a lottery system each year.
The People’s Daily article on Tuesday pushed back at what it called “strange rumours” around the new visa, creating “immigration problems” in China.
“The so-called ‘immigration crisis’ will not materialise, we should have cultural confidence,” it said.</p><small>2025-10-01 07:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/01111136f7a9345.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945827/32-magnititude-earthquake-jolts-parts-of-karachi-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>3.2-magnititude earthquake jolts parts of Karachi: PMD</strong></a><br><p>A 3.2-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Karachi on Wednesday morning, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said.
According to PMD, the earthquake was recorded seven kilometres north west of Malir at 9:34am, with a depth of 10km.
In June, the metropolitan city recorded a series of low-intensity tremors — starting from June 1 and ending on June 22  — mostly near Malir. Their intensity ranged from 1.5-magnitude to 3.8-magnitude on the Richter scale.
According to experts, the fault lines passing along the areas of Landhi, Quaidabad, Gadap and Malir had become active after several decades and were releasing accumulated energy in the form of low intensity earthquakes in areas close to them.
Previously, experts have often warned that a powerful seismic hazard can put the lives of thousands at risk and damage critical infrastructure.
The city’s close proximity to several seismic faults, including the Allahbund fault, which runs parallel to Sindh’s coast, and the junction of the Indian, Arabian and Eurasian plates, makes it susceptible to natural seismic activity.</p><small>2025-10-01 06:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/011046380a70231.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945823/pakistan-repays-500m-eurobond-on-schedule-reflecting-fiscal-discipline-stronger-economy' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan repays $500m Eurobond on schedule, reflecting ‘fiscal discipline, stronger economy’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has repaid its $500 million Eurobond on schedule, with the government saying the timely servicing reflects fiscal discipline, stronger reserves, improved ratings, and a more sustainable debt profile.
The bond, meant to raise funds from global investors, was issued in 2015 with a 10-year tenor and matured on September 30 this year.
Taking to the X platform, Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad announced the development, saying, “Timely debt servicing remains business as usual, reflecting the country’s commitment to financial discipline.”
 






He said the development was encouraging as it comes at a time when external buffers and liquidity have improved, sovereign ratings have been raised, and investor confidence is rising, with Pakistan’s bonds recently trading at a premium.
Schehzad further said that the debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio had improved from 77 per cent in FY20 to 70pc in FY25.
“External debt’s share in total public debt has declined from 38pc to 32pc in FY25, reducing FX vulnerability,” Schehzad added. “Debt growth has moderated sharply in FY25 versus in earlier years.”
Looking ahead, easing global borrowing costs, alongside stronger fundamentals, position Pakistan to access markets on more competitive terms and continue building a more sustainable debt profile, he said.
“This is a steady step forward — repayment as expected, but with stronger fundamentals, improved investor sentiment, and a more resilient outlook.”
Pakistan faced a prolonged economic crisis over the last few years, marked by critically low foreign exchange reserves, an acute balance-of-payment crisis, and the looming risk of default in 2023. The crisis was averted after the International Monetary Fund released a crucial loan tranche, while support from friendly countries, including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, also played a key role.
After averting default, Pakistan has undertaken tough IMF-prescribed reforms to stabilise its economy and bolster macroeconomic indicators. This year, global credit rating agencies like Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P Global raised Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating.</p><small>2025-10-01 06:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626420-child-marriage-not-invalid-but-facilitators-to-face-punishment-rules-ihc' target='_blank'><strong>Child marriage not invalid but facilitators to face punishment, rules IHC</strong></a><br><p>

No Wikipedia entry, no history, no headlines. Yet a Shutterstock result labelled “serene” shows photos with a backdrop of half-eaten mountainsides and a disappearing landscape.
The culprit? Mining.
In this forgotten village, a small storm has been brewing. Not of weather, but of will. A young man named Hashim Jadoon, just shy of 30, had returned home after studying law at the University of London in 2022. He had done his time in Islamabad’s legal circuit, working the grunt roles young lawyers are usually handed, and received his high court licence. “I wanted to do something more,” he said. He left Islamabad, unaware that what he was wishing to pursue was waiting for him at home, in humble Ghumawan.
 
 

The stage
For decades, the residents of Ghumawan valley have lived under the shadow of machines. Stone crushers roar throughout the day and detonate through the night at 180 decibels (comparable to the sound of a rocket launching). They spew dust, fracture homes, poison waterways, choke lungs, and shatter the peace and silence that once defined the village.
The land in question is Shamlat, a community grazing ground designated under the category of ‘Wajib ul Arz’. Though Wajib ul Arz is steeped in history and cultural tradition, Shamlat is also backed by law. As communal land, no one person or group can lay claim to it — certainly not without compensation.
Yet in 1984, the land was quietly leased out, without the community fully grasping what this meant. Over time, a dangerous myth took root: the leaseholder was now considered the “owner.” Few remembered the Shamlat. Fewer dared to challenge the ownership. No one spoke up, no one questioned. Perhaps it was inertia, perhaps a paralysing mix of fear and confusion. Unfortunately in Pakistan, all too often, the thinking goes: why take on a losing battle?
Adnan, a local resident who supported Jadoon and even filed one of the cases under his own name, blames complacency. “People are as much to blame as local governance. They are afraid of being isolated by the community. Afraid they won’t be invited to weddings and funerals. As a small community, some of the mines were even run by relatives.”
The issue ran deeper than law; it was about confronting and breaking a silence that had become suffocating. Jadoon’s journey began with truth-seeking. He called a jirga at the village hujra [a traditional multi-purpose space, exclusively for men], where landowners, villagers, leaseholders, and even the mining operators sat together to discuss the nuisance of the stone crushing operations.
He listened. Then he argued. The law, he reminded them, isn’t just a theoretical concept; it lives in justice, in the air we breathe, and in the future we are mortgaging away. The stone crushers, drunk with power, dared him to challenge them. “This is Pakistan,” they scoffed, “here, the law only lives in books,” and walked out.
Emboldened, Jadoon retorted after them: “If you can’t see how this is wrong, why not sell drugs? Both kill society. One just does it with more noise!”
The challenge was accepted.
The backdrop
According to a pre-feasibility study conducted by Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA) in 2016, demand for stone crushing increased as the construction sector grew at a sizeable rate, providing budding businessmen at the time with investment insight, and promising a return of 29 per cent in three years.
Since then, Pakistan’s construction sector has contributed approximately 2.5pc to the GDP in the fiscal year 2024, employing almost 8pc of the total labour force and stimulating over 40 industries, according to the Board of Investment (BoI). GlobalData has further prophesied that the industry is expected to grow at an average annual growth rate of 4.6pc from 2026 to 2029.
“There was a time there was nothing but the jungle in Dhodial and beyond,” recalls Adnan, “There were wild hares and partridges that frequented our orchards. Google satellite imagery of 1990 can show you the devastation.”
 
 

Stone crushers produce 20mm, 16mm, 13mm, 10mm, or 5mm stone chips to supply the ever-expanding construction industry. The material primarily consists of hard limestone and granite, though no exact geological mapping exists. According to SMEDA, “tens of billions of tonnes” are available across the country. These can be extracted either through powered mining — blasting mountainsides — or through riverbed mining, which involves fishing out large stones from rivers.
Regulatory standards dictate environmental protection measures, such as ensuring stone-crushing units maintain a 500-metre distance from residential areas, avoid blocking traffic, and do not pose safety hazards. These concerns are largely tied to byproducts such as effluent (liquid waste discharged into waterways) and asbestos, a naturally occurring toxic fibre with carcinogenic silicate minerals that is present in dust particles.
Further guidelines recommend the use of coagulation solvents, sedimentation tanks, and measures to prevent effluent from mixing with waterways. They also call for dust containment enclosures and tarpaulins to limit aerosol loading, along with the enforcement of proper safety standards and provision of protective equipment for miners.
However, according to a study conducted by Syed Yawar Ali in 2012 at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), stone crushing largely makes use of manual labour (usually rural to urban migrants, and unskilled labour). Ali posited that the industry remained largely unorganised and undocumented, giving high leeway to bypass environmental and social welfare regulations.
Conducting interviews and questionnaires with local residents, he uncovered that most stone crushing units in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) were within residential or commercial areas. One in 10 had an official licence, most labourers did not have personnel safety gear and suffered numerous diseases including cancer, asthma and other respiratory issues.
Cancer incidence in the KP region accounted for about 20.2pc of cases in a 1994–2021 study by Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital.
“I have only recently been operated on for kidney stones, and someone else I know just came out of surgery,” says Adnan. Research suggests exposure to heavy metals, such as those found in mining environments, can be a risk factor for developing kidney stones.
 
 

The case
The environmental and health costs were undeniable. The crush plants operated up to 18 hours a day. Aerosol loading was blatantly apparent, waterways were poisoned, and forests were disappearing. Noise pollution was loud enough to cause permanent hearing damage.
A girls’ high school stood right behind a mine; its foundations cracking. Roads were destroyed by 40-tonne trucks, denying locals their ability to work and live comfortably. The illegalities of the law were evident. The case wrote itself.
“They consistently dump in our natural water channels, which not only pollutes our fresh water, but raises the river beds, to flood surrounding fields,” claims Adnan.
In June 2022, Jadoon filed his case before the Environmental Protection Tribunal. The process, predictably, was anything but smooth. Hearings were delayed, and the case before the Tribunal was adjourned indefinitely. A writ petition had to be filed before the high court just to resume the case. Since the court was proving to be a very slow process, the villagers and other local affectees sought the assistance of the district administration. More than 60 affectees petitioned before the deputy commissioner and asked him to seal the crush plants. The district administration took swift action, sealing the plants and halting the sale and transport of their material on March 10, 2023. The first win.
This led to a new round of litigation between the crush plant owners, the district administration, and the people. Jadoon, who was formerly the litigator, became the people’s lawyer.
Stone crushers fight back
The crush plant owners were aggrieved by the court’s order and filed a review petition. This legal battle led to a series of purposeful delays. The crush plant owners preyed on the weakness of the judicial system and filed another writ petition.
One of the petitioners who opposed the sealing order, had filed a case against the AC/DC (assistant and deputy commissioners). In a cruel twist of fate, he suffered a fatal heart attack while walking up the very road his own activities had helped destroy. The incline, carved by heavy trucks and rendered impassable, had left his vehicle behind. He passed before reaching his destination.
The miners, unphased, still opposed the district administration’s sealing order.
Misinterpretation of the law, change of judges, playing victim, blatant violations and misinterpretation of court orders, led to a year-long cat-and-mouse game between the crush plant owners and Jadoon. When they failed in one court room, they would file writ petitions in different names and argue the same case in another court room. The stone crushers walked away with interim relief.
Ultimately, the case found its way to the court of the Chief Justice (CJ) of the Peshawar High Court (PHC). Jadoon had informed the CJ of the various inexplicable delays and the CJ directed the crush plant owners and their counsel to conclude the matter at the next date of hearing. Despite the CJ’s order, the crush plant owners failed to appear on the next date and the review petition was dismissed for being baseless and without merit.
As of March 11 2025, the PHC, Abbottabad Bench, dismissed multiple constitutional petitions filed by various stone crushing plants challenging an Environmental Protection Tribunal. This restrained their operations for lacking the mandatory Environmental Approvals (EAs) under Section 13 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Protection Act, 2014 (KPEPA).
The crush plant owners once again challenged the stay order of the Tribunal before the PHC. Here things took a sensational turn.
The twist
On May 19 2025, Justice Syed Mudasser Ameer passed a landmark 31 page judgment (Writ Petition (WP) number (no.) 316-A/2025) — the judgment that ultimately destroyed all crush plants.
The verdict declared that Pakistan’s pride — its mountains — were being destroyed at an unprecedented speed, while holding the Environment Protection Department (EPD) and the government for not accounting for the disappearing landscape. The court opined that until and unless the government could strategise to preserve the mountains, no crush plant owner should be granted environmental approval to operate.
In open court, Justice Mudasser stated that crush plant owners need to look to other lines of business. He urged them to look toward global innovations such as building roads out of plastic and recycled products.
As the miners continued to oppose and play various games, a similar case unfurled in Haripur (also represented by Jadoon), which made it to the Supreme Court (SC).
 
 

A parallel ruling
On July 11, 2024, the Supreme Court, led by Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, delivered a precedent-setting ruling, directing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue Environmental Protection Orders (EPOs) against more than 900 illegal crush plants operating across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In this landmark victory, Justice Shah — a staunch advocate for environmental justice — championed a bold shift in how courts approach environmental litigation. He called for a proactive, inquisitorial, and sustainability-driven model of judicial intervention.
He asserted that the environment itself, not just the litigants, must stand at the heart of every decision, to be treated as a third party in the courtroom. In his words and actions, he made clear: in every environmental dispute, the ultimate winner must be the planet.
As of July 17, 2025, all mining leases have been suspended. The court held that none of the plants in question possessed a valid Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), rendering their operations illegal from the outset. It further ruled that procedural objections could not legitimise activities explicitly prohibited by law.
The role of EPD
All these developments raise the pertinent question of the purpose of the EPD which previously did little more than draft reports. Why has it lacked the power to shut down illegal or harmful activity without a court order? How could it issue licences without proper environmental assessments? Should the agency’s role and jurisdiction be fundamentally rethought? The case also revealed that the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) have not been updated since 2010.
Emphasising the constitutional right to a clean environment (Articles 9 and 9-A), the “precautionary principle,” and prior SC jurisprudence, the SC ruled that environmental protection overrides business rights under Article 18. It affirmed that the EPD has both the authority and the duty to halt unlawful operations in order to prevent irreversible ecological harm. The Court further directed the department to strictly enforce the KPEPA, act against all violators without discrimination, and ensure that no environmentally harmful activity proceeds without lawful approval.
The spark of a movement
Jadoon’s crusade has grown into a movement. His name now echoes in legal circles — not merely as a litigator, but as a defender of the commons. He has taken on cases against illegal hotels in Nathia Gali, unapproved mining in Haripur, environmental degradation in Sooraj Gali, unlawful taxes on small hotel owners, and even property taxes unlawfully collected by the Cantonment Board.
Yet, he laments: “I represent one village, one municipality. What of the others? The law should be the deterrent, not me.”
Undeterred, Jadoon has filed two new writ petitions, arguing that crush plants have long operated illegally, flouting repeated court orders and violating explicit SC directions that no stone crushing may take place without environmental clearance.
Through sheer persistence, he has shed light on systemic blind spots in environmental governance that demand urgent reform.
“The crux of the issue is a lack of awareness. It takes millions to invest in mining, but it takes trillions to repair the damage. Hashim bhai [Jadoon] was truly a one man army, and for that I am eternally grateful,” Adnan reflected.
It all began with one village. One jirga. One young man willing to ask: “If we don’t fight for our land, who will?”

The annual report, released in Washington, reviews efforts by governments worldwide to combat human trafficking, which the State Department defines as modern-day slavery involving forced labour, sexual exploitation, and other forms of coercion.
The report identifies Pakistan as a destination for men, women, and children subjected to forced labour, particularly migrants from Afg­hanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Traffickers also exploit women and girls — and to a lesser extent, boys — from Afghanistan, Iran, and other Asian countries in sex trafficking within Pakistan.
The report notes that individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual remain highly vulnerable to exploitation. Since Pakistani law criminalises same-sex conduct, these groups face systemic discrimination and violence, further heightening their risk of being trafficked.
Civil society organisations told US officials that large-scale violence against women and girls, including so-called “honour killings,” leaves women especially susceptible to trafficking networks. The report highlights that refugees and stateless persons are among the most vulnerable. This includes Afghans without proper documentation, sta­teless people of Bengali, Bihari, and Rohingya origin, as well as religious and ethnic minorities such as Christians, Hindu Dalits, and Haz­aras. Many of these groups are trapped in bonded labor schemes.
Afghans — both undocumented migrants and registered refugees — face additional risks due to frequent harassment by authorities and the threat of deportation. Lacking legal protections, many turn to the informal economy for work, where they are easily exploited.
The report also criticises Pakistan for not having a clear definition of “statelessness”. International orga­nisations estimate that hundreds of thousands of stateless people in the country lack access to basic identity documents and essential services, leaving them particularly vulnerable to traffickers.
“Traffickers exploit Rohingya ethnicity stateless persons and Afghans in forced labour in Pak­istan,” the report warns.
The report also keeps India in Tier 2 — countries making efforts but falling short of minimum sta­ndards. India, it says, demonstrated “overall increasing efforts” compared to the previous reporting period. Positive steps included greater funding for specialised courts handling child-related cri­mes (including trafficking), preve­ntion campaigns, and the repatriation of Indian nationals exploited in online scam operations in Sou­th­east Asia.
The Indian government also expanded awareness pro­gr­ams on safe overseas employment and improved victim identification procedures through the Railway Protection Force. Advisories were issued to state governments to curb trafficking and ensure foreign victims were not wrongly punished for immigration violations stemm­ing directly from being trafficked.
New Delhi failed to provide comprehensive national data on investigations, pro­s­ecutions, and convictions of traffickers. Victim services remained insufficient and varied widely from state to state, while courts rarely awarded restitution to victims, leaving many waiting years for compensation.
The absence of an inter-ministerial committee to coordinate anti-trafficking policies further undermined efforts. Moreover, law enforcement often misclassified cases, particularly those involving bonded labour, and corruption among some government officials fueled a perception of impunity for traffickers.

The Dublin-based out-of-court dispute settlement body, Appeals Centre Europe, was created as part of the Digital Services Act (DSA), the European Union’s landmark content moderation law that has come under fierce US scrutiny.
The DSA demands companies protect EU citizens against illegal content, but also requires platforms to allow users to challenge any content decisions — such as account or post removals — via an out-of-court mechanism.
The centre, however, found that platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram as well as TikTok often dragged their feet, refusing to engage with the body sufficiently — and singled out YouTube as the worst culprit.
When disputes arise, the panel seeks information from the platforms about deleted content or suspended accounts to adjudicate. In cases where no details were provided, it often ruled in the users’ favour.
“In some cases, we’ve succeeded despite platforms, not because of them,” said Thomas Hughes, leading the panel.
For example, the centre said it received no content from YouTube — meaning it was only able to make decisions on 29 of the 343 eligible disputes submitted.
“As such, we are concerned that YouTube’s EU users are being denied meaningful access to out-of-court settlement,” Appeals Centre Europe said.
Covering the period between November 2024 to August 2025, it is the first transparency report since the body’s creation last year.
The panel said dispute-settlement bodies were currently “Europe’s best-kept-secret” — but that it was working for that to change.
The centre said it received nearly 10,000 disputes and has already issued around 1,500 decisions in more than 3,300 cases that were within its scope.
Other platforms under the centre’s scrutiny include Pinterest and Meta-owned Threads.
The DSA is currently in Washington’s crosshairs.
US President Donald Trump’s allies accuse the DSA of being a tool of “foreign censorship”, but the EU rejects such accusations.
There are currently multiple EU probes ongoing under the DSA into platforms including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and tech billionaire Elon Musk’s X.</p><small>2025-10-01 05:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68dc5e18e6979.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945776/suicide-attack-on-fc-hq-in-quetta-claims-10-lives' target='_blank'><strong>Suicide attack on FC HQ in Quetta claims 10 lives</strong></a><br><p>• Four security personnel among those martyred as explosive-laden van explodes at well-guarded entrance to Hali Road
• Four terrorists ‘in FC uniforms’ gunned down while trying to breach security installation
QUETTA: At least 10 people, including four security personnel, were martyred and over 30 others sustained injuries in a suicide car blast near the headquarters of the Frontier Corps, while five terrorists were killed while trying to breach the heavily guarded facility.
Police officials said a suicide bomber driving an explosive-laden van  attempted to enter the well-guarded Hali Road from the Khojak Road area of Modal Town on Tuesday. At the entrance to Hali Road, the vehicle hit spikes and a barrier installed near the picket and exploded.
The blast claimed the lives of six civilians, while four personnel were martyred, they added.
Ten people lost their lives in the blast and 33 were injured, six of them seriously, Minister Health Bakht Muhammad Kakar told Dawn. There were at least two women among the seriously injured, he added.
Shortly after the blast, four alleged terrorists in FC uniforms entered Hali Road attempted to breach the FC headquarters amid heavy firing.
But security personnel foiled the atte­mpt. A gun battle with the terrorists ens­u­ed, who were armed with modern wea­pons and hand grenades, but they were gunned down by security personnel.
“In all, five terrorists have been killed. One in an explosive-laden vehicle and four were eliminated by the FC personnel in the gun battle,” said a senior official of the home department while talking to Dawn.
He disclosed that the attackers were wearing FC uniforms to dodge security.
“No terrorist could reach up to the gates of the FC headquarters,” security officials said.
They said that four AK-47 rifles, three grenade launchers, 15 grenades, hundreds of bullets and other items were recovered from the terrorists.
An eyewitness said that all the attackers were very young. “The FC snipers sitting on a nearby building targeted the attacks from the roof,” he told Dawn, adding that the attackers also lobbed hand grenades at the security men.
Security posts on both sides of Hali Road were destroyed in the huge explosion, and a large portion of a protective concrete wall was also damaged, while windowpanes and doors of nearby buildings, including the PTV Quetta Centre, MPAs’ hostel, bureau offices of private TV channels and newspapers were also shattered.
The security guard of a TV channel also sustained injuries in the blast, witnesses said.
They said the many of the victims were pedestrians and those travelling on the road at the time of the blast.
Following the incident, police and rescue workers rushed to the site and shifted the injured and the bodies to civil hospital, where the health minister had declared a state of emergency.
“Six seriously injured people were shifted to ICU,” hospital sources said, describing the condition of others “mostly stable”.
No one has claimed responsibility of the suicide attack so far.
But interestingly, the president and PM attributed differing identities to the terrorists who carried out the attack in Quetta.
A  statement issued by the President’s Secretariat said President Asif Ali  Zardari “strongly condemned the suicide attack in Quetta carried out by the Fitna-al-Khawarij, the misguided extremists acting on  India’s agenda”.
However, the federal government posted on X that Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif had commended the security forces for killing the “terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan” who carried out the attack.
 






Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned  Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Fitna al Hindustan refers to the  allegedly India-backed Baloch separatist groups.
Balochistan Inspector General Mohammad Tahir visited the blast site along with senior police officers and was briefed on the initial evidence, the nature of the blast, the situation at the scene, and the progress of the investigation.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the “terrorist attack”. A Balochistan government post on X, formerly Twitter, quoted him as saying that security forces gave a swift and effective response, eliminating four terrorists.
“The terrorists cannot weaken the nation’s resolve through cowardly acts. The sacrifices of the people and security forces will not go in vain. We remain committed to making Balochistan peaceful and secure. I express solidarity with the families of the martyrs, pray for the elevation of their ranks, and for the speedy recovery of the injured,” the CM stated.

According to provisional figures released on Tuesday, the FBR collected Rs2.884tr in the first quarter against a target of Rs3.083tr. However, the collection marked a 13 per cent increase from Rs2.558tr collected during the same period last year. The shortfall was most pronounced in September, when revenue collection reached Rs1.228tr-Rs155bn below the target of Rs1.384tr. Despite this, the September figure represented an 11pc increase from Rs1.105tr collected in September FY25.
The decline in domestic sales tax is attributed to multiple factors, including a slowdown in business activity following widespread flooding and a drop in taxable utility consumption. The shift toward solar energy and ongoing power outages have also impacted tax collected through electricity and gas bills.
In the income tax segment, FBR collected Rs1.363tr in the July-September quarter, missing the Rs1.459tr target by Rs96bn. This was 11pc higher than Rs1.225tr collected in the same quarter last year.

Slower sales tax growth, power outages and solar uptake contributed to shortfall despite year-on-year gains

Sales tax collection stood at Rs1.019tr, falling short of its Rs1.141tr target by Rs122bn, though it registered a 13pc year-on-year increase from Rs905bn. Customs duty rose to Rs312bn, surpassing the Rs295bn target by Rs17bn, up 13pc from Rs276bn last year. Federal Excise Duty (FED) reached Rs190bn, exceeding the Rs188bn target and showing a 26pc increase from Rs151bn last year.
Refunds and rebates issued during the first quarter amounted to Rs157bn, compared to Rs147bn a year ago. The FBR has so far received around 4m income tax returns by the end of September.
In the previous fiscal year (FY25), the FBR missed its revised target by Rs163bn, collecting Rs11.737tr against the target of Rs11.9tr. Nonetheless, the collection showed a 26.2pc rise from Rs9.301tr in FY24.
To meet commitments under the IMF programme, the government introduced revenue measures worth Rs1.05tr in the FY26 budget. These include Rs655bn in new taxes and Rs400bn through stricter enforcement. The overall collection target for FY26 has been set at Rs14.131tr.
The budget aims to broaden the tax base, ensure fair burden-sharing, and enforce compliance. Initiatives include digital taxation, carbon levies, and expanded coverage of e-commerce and digital transactions to align with global standards.
FBR expects an additional Rs200bn in super tax next month, which could partially offset the current shortfall.

According to the press release issued by the Finance Division, the petrol price now stands at Rs268.68 per litre from Rs264.61 per litre. Meanwhile, the price of diesel has jumped to Rs276.81 per litre from Rs272.77 per litre.
It added that it decided on these new rates upon the recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the relevant ministries.
Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households. HSD fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods.
The government currently imposes no GST on petroleum products, but char­ges significant levies. These include Rs79.50 per litre on diesel and Rs80.52 per litre on petrol and high-octane products, which also cover Rs2.50 per litre under the CSL.
In addition, customs duties of around Rs16-17 per litre apply to both petrol and diesel, regardless of whether the products are imported or locally produced.
Meanwhile, Ogra on Tuesday also notified a decrease in the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs.6.70 per kilogramme for the month of October. After the reduction, a 11.8kg cylinder of LPG, which cost Rs2,527.47 in September, will now be sold for Rs2,448.33, down by Rs.79.14 or 3.13 per cent.
In a statement, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Ogra said: “The LPG producer price is linked with Saudi Aramco-CP and US dollar exchange rate. As compared to previous month Saudi Aramco-CP has decreased by 3.78pc. The average dollar exchange rate has slightly increased by 0.23pc.“</p><small>2025-10-01 03:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0108055090ad828.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945783/india-plans-mega-dam-to-counter-china-water-fears' target='_blank'><strong>India plans mega dam to counter China water fears</strong></a><br><p>RIEW: On a football field ringed by misty mountains, the air rang with fiery speeches as tribesmen protested a planned mega-dam, India’s latest move in its contest with China over Himalayan water.
India says the proposed new structure could counteract rival China’s building of a likely record-breaking dam upstream in Tibet by stockpiling water and guarding against releases of weaponised torrents.
But for those at one of the possible sites for what would be India’s largest dam, the project feels like a death sentence.
“We will fight till the end of time,” said Tapir Jamoh, a resident of the thatch-hut village of Riew, raising a bow loaded with a poison-tipped arrow in a gesture of defiance against authorities. “We will not let a dam be built.”
Jamoh’s homelands of the Adi people are in the far-flung northeastern corner of India, divided from Tibet and Myanmar by soaring snowy peaks.

Beijing, which lays claim to Arunachal Pradesh, says its project will have no ‘negative impact’ downstream

Proposed blueprints show India considering the site in Arunachal Pradesh for a massive storage reservoir, equal to four million Olympic-size swimming pools, behind a 280-metre (918-foot) high dam.
The project comes as China presses ahead with the $167 billion Yaxia project upstream of Riew on the river known in India as the Siang, and in Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo.
China’s plan includes five hydropower stations, that could produce three times more electricity than its vast Three Gorges dam — the world’s largest power station —though other details remain scant.
Beijing — which lays claim to Arunachal Pradesh, rejected by India — says it will have no “negative impact” downstream.
“China has never had, and will never have, any intention to use cross-border hydropower projects on rivers to harm the interests of downstream countries or coerce them,” Beijing’s foreign ministry said.
Chinese reports hint at a tunnel-diversion project, while India eyes Riew for its mega-dam. Locals like 69-year-old Jamoh say damming the Siang would erase their culture and identity.
Despite a thaw between New Delhi and Beijing, the two most populous nations have multiple areas of disputed border manned by tens of thousands of troops, and India has made no secret of its concerns.
The river is a tributary of the mighty Brahmaputra, and Indian officials fear China could use its dam as a control tap — to create deadly droughts or release a “water bomb” downstream.
China rejects that, saying that the “hype surrounding the Yaxia Hydropower Project as a ‘water bomb’ is groundless and malicious”.
But Arunachal Pradesh state Chief Minister Pema Khandu said protective action against China’s dam is a “national security necessity”, and sees India’s dam as a safety valve to control the water.
“China’s aggressive water resource development policy leaves little room for downstream riparian nations to ignore it,” said Maharaj K. Pandit, a Himalayan ecology specialist at the National University of Singapore.
India’s dam could generate up to 11,600 MW, becoming its most powerful and cutting reliance on coal.

FRESH breaches have inundated villages to the east of Lodhran, Jalalpur Pirwala and Uch Sharif.—Dawn

• Irrigation dept says water levels receding after four of seven cracks fixed
• Flood survey teams collect data of 27,500 affected people in three days
LAHORE: Flood devastation continues to grip southern Punjab as three breaches at the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the Sutlej River have inundated 28 mouzas across Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts, displacing thousands and causing extensive damage to infrastructure.
Meanwhile, the flood survey teams collected the data of 27,500 affected people in Punjab in the first three days since the launch.
The Noraja Bhutta embankment, which initially broke at seven locations 20 days ago due to heavy water flow, has left several villages submerged under six to eight feet of floodwater.
These villages include Noraja Bhutta, Bahadurpur, Jhangra, Kotla Chakar, Tarut Basharat, Basti Lang, Basti Kanu, Depalpur, Khairpur Dha, Kandeer, Jhaiyu, Deepal, Daily Rajanpur, Belaywala, Dunyapur, Muradpur, Soiwala and Sabra. The persistent pressure has led to widespread destruction of homes and property.
The breaches have severely impacted the M5 motorway and Gilani Road, with floodwater crossing the motorway and forming a lake between the two routes. Damage has been reported at five to six points along the motorway, prompting authorities to execute a controlled breach at Gilani Road to divert water toward the Chenab River and prevent further deterioration.
As a result, the M5 motorway has remained closed from Uch Sharif interchange to Jalalpur Pirwala for the past 15 days, disrupting traffic between southern and central Punjab, stranding thousands of vehicles and forcing commuters onto hazardous alternate routes.
A district administration official told Dawn on condition of anonymity that floodwater continues to flow from the three breaches, although the water level has begun to recede slightly due to a drop in Sutlej River flow from 80,000 to 20,000 cusecs.
He said that many affected residents remain in relief camps near Lodhran, Ahmadpur and other areas, awaiting the complete closure of the breaches.
He said that the floodwater is currently crossing the M5 motorway through culverts and moving towards the Chenab River.
Multan Irrigation Department Chief Engineer Nawaz Bajwa said that four of the seven cracks at the Noraja Bhutta Flood Bank in Jalalpur Pirwala have been repaired, with work on the remaining three progressing rapidly.
Punjab Minister for Irrig­ation Kazim Ali Pirzada also noted that the restoration of the flood bank is underway and that water levels are gradually receding in the affected areas.
He said that a loss assessment survey is being conducted and that relief packages will be distributed accordingly.
Flood survey
The Punjab government on Sunday kicked off a survey to assess the losses suffered by people in the province due to recent floods but refrained from giving any timeline for completing the exercise or for the start of compensation payments to the more than four million affected residents.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was informed at a meeting on Tuesday that flood survey teams have collected data of 27,500 people. The teams have also completed the survey of 48,071 acres of flood-affected land, besides obtaining data of 8,305 houses destroyed by the flood.
The teams also obtained records of 1,712 livestock killed during the flood. She was also briefed that 1,429 flood survey teams had been mobilised in flood-affected areas in 26 districts of Punjab.
She directed the commissioners, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners to support and monitor the survey teams.
The Punjab government said that 2,200 survey teams comprising 10,000 members of the Pakistan Army, revenue, agriculture, and livestock departments, and district administration would carry out the survey.
Full compensation to the affected families — Rs1 million for a destroyed house, Rs500,000 for a partially damaged house, Rs500,000 for loss of livestock, and Rs20,000 per acre (up to 12 acres) for farmers — will be provided based on the survey report, it said.

• Finance ministry says economic activity remains ‘broadly stable’
• Insists economy maintains trajectory of stabilisation, growth
ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday warned that the supply chain disruptions caused by ongoing floods could temporarily increase inflation despite improved fiscal and industrial performance.
“Due to ongoing floods in 2025, the agriculture sector is expected to suffer,” said the Ministry of Finance in its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for September 2025. “Flood-related disruptions may exert pressure on food supply chains, leading to an uptick in prices. As a result, inflation is expected to rise temporarily but remain contained within the 3.5-4.5 per cent range in September 2025,” it added.
 
 

The finance ministry, however, expressed satisfaction that despite these disruptions, economic activity remained broadly stable. “The rebound in large-scale manufacturing, supported by encouraging trends in cement dispatches, automobile production, and allied industries, indicates strengthening industrial momentum in the months ahead,” it said.
The ministry expected the external sector to remain stable, with the current account deficit projected to stay manageable despite higher import demand. Remittances continued to provide strong support while exports showed early signs of recovery. The declining global commodity prices may help ease the import bill, it said.
Overall, the report said the economy maintained its trajectory of stabilisation and growth during the first two months of the current fiscal year, with moderating inflation, strengthening large-scale manufacturing, and contained fiscal imbalances despite the severe floods since July 2025.
It said the assessment of Kharif crops and livestock damages was currently in progress while the government had declared climate and agriculture emergencies nationwide to tackle escalating climatic challenges and support farmers impacted by the severe floods.
 
 

The report noted that large-scale manufacturing registered a significant year-on-year growth of 9pc in July 2025 and 2.6pc on a month on-month basis. Overall, 16 out of 22 sectors recorded positive growth, including textiles, wearing apparel, coke and petroleum products, non-metallic mineral products and pharmaceuticals.
Inflation measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI) moderated to 3pc in August 2025 and stood at 3.5pc during July-August FY26 as compared to 10.4pc last year.
The Ministry of Finance said the government would further improve fiscal performance in FY26, building on the strengthened fiscal accounts that delivered “an eight-year low fiscal deficit and a 24-year high primary surplus”.
The government also promised effective resource mobilisation and a prudent expenditure management strategy. Yet, it said the net federal revenues increased by only 7.7pc in July, supported by 23.9pc growth in non-tax revenues and 14.8pc in tax revenues.
Non-tax revenues in July were largely attributed to higher receipts from petroleum levy, dividends and defence.
During July-August FY26, FBR’s net collection expanded by 14.1pc while expenditures grew by 28.8pc. “Consequently, the fiscal deficit was contained at 0.2pc of GDP, while the primary surplus improved to Rs228.9 billion (0.2pc of GDP) compared to Rs107.1bn (0.1pc of GDP) last year.”
The current account posted a deficit of $624 million during July-August FY26, increasing from $430 million recorded last year.
Goods exports rose 10.2pc to $5.3bn, while imports increased 8.8pc to $10.4bn, resulting in a trade deficit of $5.1bn compared to $4.8bn. Remittances were up 7pc to $6.4bn, led by inflows from Saudi Arabia (24.6pc share) and UAE (20.6pc).
Net FDI inflows were recorded at $364.3 million, down 22pc. However, private and public portfolio investment recorded net outflows of $74.8 million and $11.8 million, respectively. As of Sept 19, foreign exchange reserves stood at $19.8bn, including $14.4bn with the State Bank, compared to $9.5bn total reserves as of the same period last year.
The finance ministry said that monetary conditions remained stable, and the stock market sustained its bullish momentum, reflecting investor confidence.
Although flood-induced disruptions pose temporary risks to inflation, the overall outlook signals a stable macroeconomic environment, with supportive trends in industry, external inflows and fiscal management expected to underpin sustainable growth going forward, it concluded.

Irrigation Minister Aqi­b­­ullah Khan and Educ­ation Minister Faisal Khan Tarakai, whose removal was reportedly approved by Imran Khan in the meeting with the CM, shared their ide­n­t­ical resignation letters on social media.
“With utmost res­p­ect, I, Faisal Khan Ta­r­­akai, hereby tender my resignation from the office of mi­­n­i­ster for elementary and secondary ed­u­c­a­t­ion, gov­e­rnm­ent of Khyber Pak­h­t­u­nk­h­wa,” Mr Tarakai said.
He said it had been an honour to serve in this capacity, entru­sted to him by Imran Khan and he “remai­ned highly indebted to him for confidence as well as for the opp­o­rtunity to contribute to the transforma­tion and uplift of the education department and system in KP”.
Mr Tarakai said that he performed to the best of his abilities to ensure and implement Imran Khan’s vision of transparency, efficiency and merit during his tenure as the minister. He said he would remain committed to the cause and vision of Imran Khan, while reiterating  his commitment to the PTI as a worker.
Both former ministers were not available for comment when appr­oached by Dawn.
A PTI source told Dawn that there were rumours of the reshuffling of at least five ministers, including the two who stepped down. These rumours had been circulating for quite some time, but the resignation was still unexpected.
“The chief minister had informed both Qaiser and Shahram about the de-notification of their younger siblings; however, both said the ministers would resign ins­tead,” another source said.
Both ministers, hailing from Swabi district, are siblings of two senior party leaders. Aqibullah Khan is Asad Qaiser’s brother, while Faisal Khan Taraki is the younger brother of MNA Shahram Khan Tarakai, who had served as the provincial health minister in the Mahmood Khan government.
Sources told Dawn that Imran Khan green-lig­hted the removal of both ministers. Mr Gandapur had initially bristled at the prospect, saying it would further aggravate his problems. They alleged Mr Tarakai was “ineffective, irresponsive and not fully in control of his department”.
A Tarakai House spokesperson told Dawn that Mr Tarakai resigned because he was “not all­owed to work”. “The truth is that Mr Tarakai is a hard-working person, and when he was not allowed to work, he had no other option (but to step down),” the spokesperson added.
About Aqibullah Khan, sources claimed that his ministry was being run by his brother Asad Qaiser.
Asad Qaiser, however, denied meddling in his brother’s ministry. He said that he had been to his brother’s office only once for a briefing along with other party lawmakers. “This was my only visit to my brother’s office and there is no question of influencing or interfering with his ministry aff­airs,” Mr Qaiser added.
A senior PTI leader alleged that CM Gan­dapur had developed a ‘grudge’ against the ministers for their successful Swabi power show in February this year. The source claimed that the chief minister was unh­appy with the minister for supporting the public meeting arranged by PTI KP President Junaid Akbar Khan.
In a video message, CM Gandapur said he and Imran Khan had discussed reforms in the government almost six mon­ths ago and he had also spoken to Asad Qaiser and Shahram Tarakai about cabinet changes. He said in the Monday meeting, the cabinet reshuffle was discussed again and he later met Mr Faisal and Mr Aqib to inform them about the decision. He said more changes were in the pipeline, terming them a routine affair.

ISLAMABAD / WASHI­N­GTON: A day after US President Donald Trump unveiled his ambitious plan to end the war in Ga­za, signs have began to emerge that not everyone is happy with the draft made public by White House.
This was evident from Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s presser on Tuesday, where he made it clear in so many words that the US peace plan for Gaza would not be acceptable if the am­e­ndments — jointly pro­posed by eight Muslim co­u­n­tries — were not included.
The “document has been issued by the US”, he said, seemingly distancing Pakistani decision-makers from the plan, even though Trump has previously claimed that both PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir are behind it ‘100pc’.
“This is not our document, which we sent to them. There are some key areas that we want covered… If they are not covered, they will be covered,” he said.
Consider Trump’s anno­u­ncement of the 20-point plan as “an announcement from their side”, he said.
Mr Dar, who is also the deputy prime minister, added that Pakistan owned the joint statement given on behalf of eight Muslim countries. “If there is a difference, we will go by this,” he said.
In response to a question, the foreign minister said the plan put forward by Trump envisions an independent technocrat government of Pales­tinians, to be overseen by an international body — mostly comprised of Palestinians.
He was also guarded about the possibility of sending troops to become part of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF).
“On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies… there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan’s leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.
Mr Dar maintained that this would be a special force for Gaza alone, and the arrangement for its deployment would be documented at the UN Security Council.
Road to deal
During the presser, Mr Dar expounded on the diplomatic process that led to the finalisation of the pea­ce plan, saying that one of the main purposes of attending the UN General Assembly was to work with some “like-minded countries” on trying to end the misery in Gaza as a “member of the Muslim ummah”.
Eight countries, including Pakistan, agreed to take up this matter very proactively with President Trump during the US visit, he said.
Dar said a preparatory meeting was held before the Muslim leaders’ huddle with Trump.
The meeting with Trump was meant to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid to the strip without any hurdles, stop the forced displacement of Pales­tinians and make arrangements for the return of those displaced from the Gaza, plan for Gaza’s reconstruction and stop Israel’s attempts to annex the West Bank, he said.
“These objectives were conveyed to him (Trump), and he was asked to work with us on achieving them,” Dar said, adding that the US president then proposed that his team would devise a “workable solution” with the foreign ministers of the eight Muslim countries that participated in the meeting.
He said it was decided that the details of meetings held in this regard would be “secret” and “classified”.
After sharing further details of how the proposal for ending the Isr­aeli onslaught in Gaza was finalised, Dar said he had received messages from the Saudi foreign minister.
“He told me that five countries had reached a consensus on joint statem­ent [regarding the Gaza plan] and that our agreement was needed on this matter as well, and that they had also reached out to Indonesia and the UAE.
“I then consulted the foreign secretary and proposed some changes. I spoke to the Saudi foreign minister again … as I had some objections … He then send me a revised version … and the joint statement was released.”
When asked to assure that “you still believe in the two-state solution”, he said there was no change in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine. “And I rather would say the seven other countries are also with us on this.”
The repeated reference to the Mus­lim bloc’s joint statement is being seen as a ‘mild protestation’ over cha­nges to the terms of the deal, which were ostensibly carried out at Israeli PM Benjamin Netan­yahu’s request.
Changes to the draft
According to US news outlet Axios, the deal now before Hamas is significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention.
The main stumbling block, it seems, were the last-minute edits secured by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu when he held a six-hour meeting with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
These included the conditions and timetable for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, and the proposal ties Israel’s withdrawal to the progress of disarming Hamas, and gives Israel a veto over the process.
Even if all conditions are met and three phases of withdrawal are completed, Axios reported that Israeli forces would still remain within a security perimeter “until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.
Although there was no push-back publicly, officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkiye were furious over the changes behind the scenes, Axios reported.
According to the report, the Qat­a­ris even tried to convince the Trump administration not to release the det­ailed plan on Monday due to those objections. The White House relea­s­­ed it anyway, and pushed the Arab and Muslim countries to support the plan. The eight Muslim countries then issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s announcement, but without expressing full support for it. The Qataris told the other countries that after the generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details, sources told Axios.
Quoting a senior Arab official involved in the negotiations, the Axios report said that while Netanyahu had managed to change the text, it still has a lot of very positive elements for the Palestinians.
Deadline for Hamas
After Qatar and Egypt shared the 20-point plan with Hamas on Monday, President Trump gave the group “three to four days” to accept the proposal, or meet “a very sad end”.
Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said Israeli and Arab leaders had already endorsed the plan and that “were just waiting for Hamas” to make its decision.
“Hamas is either going to be doing it or not, and if it’s not, it’s going to be a very sad end,” Trump said as he left the White House. Asked whether there was scope for further talks on the proposal, he replied: “Not much.”
A source close to Hamas told Reu­t­ers the plan was “completely biased to Israel” and imposed “impossible conditions” that aimed to eliminate the group.
Qatar’s foreign ministry has said Hamas is studying the White House proposal “responsibly”.
However, a senior Hamas figure told the BBC that the group is likely to reject Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, saying it “serves Israel’s interests” and “ignores those of the Palestinian people”.
The source said the group is unlikely to agree to disarming and handing over their weapons.
