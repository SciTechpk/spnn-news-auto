The PPP will shortly hold a meeting of its Central Executive Committee (CEC) at the Bilawal House to discuss the proposed 27th Amendment.

Afridi has been seeking a meeting with the former premier, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, since he was sworn in as the KP CM on October 15. He has been denied access to the PTI founder at least four times since then, despite the IHC’s directives to implement its March order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for Imran.
Addressing reporters outside the prison, CM Afridi lamented that he was unable to meet the party founder and the chief justice of the IHC, the latter of whom he had waited 90 minutes to meet before leaving empty-handed.
“As you all know, there have been continuous efforts through constitutional and legal means; this is the fifth time,” he said, referring to how frequently he was denied a meeting with the PTI founder.
“After waiting for an hour and a half, we couldn’t meet the IHC chief justice, so we came here. I was again denied permission for a meeting [with Imran]. You are seeing this system in place, which was exposed by my leader, Imran Khan.”
He said that people with “clouded judgment” levelled allegations that the PTI was trying to incite and protest, but stated that he has “continuously tried to remove the fog clouding their judgment”.
“Some people have become more powerful than institutions, because people are telling us they cannot do anything unless they receive orders from the top,” CM Afridi said, adding that he did not know who was issuing the orders.
 






Meeting denials
A day after he took the oath as the chief minister on October 15, Afridi secured protective bail from the Peshawar High Court (PHC) till November 18 and went to Adiala to meet Imran, but failed to do so despite a two-hour wait.
CM Afridi had also filed a separate plea in the IHC seeking permission to meet Imran, on which notices were issued to Adiala jail’s Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum and others.
Then, on October 23, after the IHC ordered the jail superintendent to implement the twice-a-week meeting schedule, Afridi headed to Adiala jail but could not meet the imprisoned ex-premier again.
 
 

The KP CM then visited Rawalpindi on October 28 but was denied access to Imran for the third time, compelling the PTI founder to issue directives that Afridi pick his KP cabinet.
Afridi again was not able to meet Imran on October 30, marking the fourth such occurrence, following which he finally named his provincial cabinet.</p><small>2025-11-06 14:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06190450571e0ec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953511/vibe-coding-named-word-of-the-year-by-collins-dictionary' target='_blank'><strong>‘Vibe coding’ named word of the year by Collins dictionary</strong></a><br><p>“Vibe coding”, a word that essentially means using artificial intelligence (AI) to tell a machine what you want instead of coding it yourself, was on Thursday named the Collins Word of the Year 2025.
Coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, the word refers to “an emerging software development that turns natural language into computer code using AI”, according to Collins Dictionary.
“It’s programming by vibes, not variables,” said Collins.
“While tech experts debate whether it’s revolutionary or reckless, the term has resonated far beyond Silicon Valley, speaking to a broader cultural shift towards AI-assisted everything in everyday life,” it added.
Lexicographers at Collins Dictionary monitor the 24 billion-word Collins Corpus, which draws from a range of media sources, including social media, to create the annual list of new and notable words that reflect our ever-evolving language.
 
 

The 2025 shortlist highlights a range of words that have emerged in the past year to pithily reflect the changing world around us.
“Broligarchy” made the list in a year that saw tech billionaire Elon Musk briefly at the heart of US President Donald Trump’s administration and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos cosying up to the president.
The word is defined as a small clique of very wealthy men who exert political influence.
‘Coolcation’
New words linked to work and technology include “clanker”, a derogatory term for a computer, robot or source of artificial intelligence, and “HENRY”, an acronym for “high earner, not rich yet”.
Another is “taskmasking”, the act of giving a false impression that one is being productive in the workplace, while “micro-retirement” refers to a break taken between periods of employment to pursue personal interests.
In the health and behavioural sphere, “biohacking” also gets a spot, meaning the activity of altering the natural processes of one’s body in an attempt to improve one’s health and longevity.
Also listed is “aura farming” (the deliberate cultivation of a distinctive and charismatic persona) and the verb “to glaze” (to praise or flatter someone excessively or undeservedly).
 
 

Although the list is dominated by words linked to technology and employment, one from the world of leisure bags a spot — “coolcation”, meaning a holiday in a place with a cool climate.
Last year’s word of the year was “Brat”, the name of UK singer Charli XCX’s hit sixth album, signifying a “confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude” rather than simply a term for a badly-behaved child.</p><small>2025-11-06 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06145627c53230e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953505/fia-director-general-says-looking-into-reports-of-workers-being-offloaded-at-airports' target='_blank'><strong>FIA director general says looking into reports of workers being offloaded at airports</strong></a><br><p>Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Riffat Mukhtar said on Thursday that the agency is investigating reports of workers being offloaded at airports, during a meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain, a statement from the agency said.
Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports on grounds of suspicion, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions follow Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s directive to crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives.
The development took place during a high-level meeting today presided over by the minister, in which he was briefed on such incidents. DG FIA Mukhtar, officials Ministry of the Overseas Pakistanis, and a delegation from the Pakistan Overseas Employment Promoters Association were also in attendance.
DG FIA Mukhtar informed the meeting participants that incidents of workers being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.
“If any FIA officials are found involved, strict action will be taken against them,” the statement quoted him as saying.
While addressing the participants, Minister Hussain pointed out that workers were offloaded at different airports despite having work visas and protection certificates.
“Pakistanis going abroad for employment are highly respected by us, and no one will be allowed to unlawfully stop workers at airports,” the minister said, per the statement.
Overseas Pakistanis, he said, send foreign remittances to Pakistan, which drives the national economy.
The minister directed the DG FIA to immediately resolve the issue and instructed that no work visa holders be offloaded at airports in the future.
Per the statement, no new conditions have been imposed by the FIA for those travelling abroad on work visas, nor has any new requirement been introduced for obtaining an affidavit from a government officer.
A new digital system will soon be introduced, through which workers can complete their immigration online before departure.
Federal Minister Hussain stated that to prevent such incidents in the future, the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and FIA officials were preparing standard operating procedures (SOPs).
In December of last year, four Pakis­tani citizens were among those killed in migrant shipwrecks off the coast of Greece, as confirmed by the Foreign Office.
A high-level committee was formed to examine the tragedy, overseen by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. In January of this year, the former FIA DG, Ahmed Ishaque Jehangir, was removed from his position and Mukhtar appointed to replace him in early April.</p><small>2025-11-06 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0615235165b5b1a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953507/president-secretary-general-of-aircraft-engineers-body-dismissed-from-pia-service-amid-ongoing-tiff' target='_blank'><strong>President, secretary general of aircraft engineers’ body dismissed from PIA service amid ongoing tiff</strong></a><br><p>Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP) President Abdullah Jadoon and Secretary General Awais Jadoon were dismissed from service on Thursday amid an ongoing tiff with the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).
PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafiz confirmed the development to Dawn. The national flag carrier also issued two dismissal notices to the engineers, copies of which are available with Dawn.
Abdullah’s role was stated as an aircraft engineer (PG-VI), while Awais was an aircraft engineer (PG-VIII).
The dismissal letters said that notices were issued to the SAEP president for conducting a press conference without prior authorisation and for disclosing official information to the media, and to the SAEP secretary general, for the unauthorised disclosure of confidential operational information and PIA images.
“In order to enquire into the allegations/charges communicated to you via the aforesaid showcause notice, an enquiry was conducted wherein you failed to participate despite providing ample opportunities to appear and defend your case,” the notices said.
“After examining the available evidence and statements of prosecution witnesses, the enquiry committee found you guilty of the charges levelled against you,” they added. They further said that both the SAEP officials were provided two opportunities to appear before the chief executive officer, but failed to do so.
“Keeping in view your entire disciplinary case, the management has decided to dismiss you from the service of Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited,” the notices said, adding that these dismissals would go into effect immediately.
 
 

The dismissals come amid an ongoing tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP, with the protesting engineers refusing to issue clearance certificates to aircraft — a move that has disrupted flight operations in recent days.
The engineers have been protesting for two-and-a-half mont­­hs, seeking pay hikes among other demands, according to SAEP officials.
While the PIA has claimed that the engineers are on “strike”, the SAEP maintains that its engineers were on duty but were not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks.
Earlier, the PIA spokesperson had highlighted that the Essential Services Act was in force in PIA under which strikes or abandonment of work was a legal offence. “All elements involved in or supporting such actions as part of a conspiracy will face legal action,” he had warned.
For his part, Awais Jadoon had earlier said that the two officers were on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances.”
He had also clarified that the engineers were not on strike and said that they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying.
In response to a question about a meeting with the PIA management, he had said that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them.
Meanwhile, the PIA has alleged that the engineer’s protest is aimed at sabotaging the national flag carrier’s privatisation.
Flight disruptions
The matter came into the spotlight when hund­reds of air travellers were reported to have been stranded at three major airports on Monday night due to the aircraft engineers’ protest, which delayed at least six flights of the national flag carrier.
Similar delays have been reported at nearly all major airports in the country during the last two months.
On Tuesday, the PIA claimed to have restored flight operations through alternative arrangements. A PIA spokesperson said that the management had used alternative means and worked overnight to restore operations, mitigating the impact of already delayed flights on subsequent operations.
Yesterday, too, the PIA said it had managed to “partially restore its flight operations”.</p><small>2025-11-06 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061401317e38574.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953502/27th-constitutional-amendment-on-the-agenda-as-pm-shehbaz-holds-flurry-of-meetings' target='_blank'><strong>27th Constitutional Amendment on the agenda as PM Shehbaz holds flurry of meetings</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held meetings with the delegations of multiple parties on Thursday in what appears to be efforts by the government to prepare the ground to get a 27th Constitutional Amendment approved by Parliament.
Among those he met was a seven-member delegation of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), which was led by party Convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.
A statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said “discussion and consultation took place on the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment” during the meeting.
The delegation also included Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, Members of National Assembly Dr Farooq Sattar, Jawed Hanif Khan, Syed Aminul Haque and Khawaja Izharul Hassan, the statement added.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah were also present in the meeting.
They were also present in PM Shehbaz’s meetings with the delegations of the  Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q).
 






A separate PMO statement said party President and Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan and Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry were part of the IPP delegation that held a meeting with PM Shehbaz and discussed the proposed 27th Amendment.
 






Another statement by the PMO said the premier also met a delegation of the PML-Q, which was led by Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain, and discussed the proposed constitutional amendment.
The PML-Q delegation also included Senator Kamil Ali Agha and MNAs Mohammad Ilyas Choudhary and Farukh Khan.
A day earlier, the MQM-P had demanded that local governments (LGs) be given autonomy in the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment after the PPP revealed key features of the proposed amendment for which the PML-N-led government sought its support.
The party said that after provincial autonomy had been granted under the 18th Amendment of 2010, the “next step naturally is local autonomy, so it’s turn must come”.
“The important thing that we also said at the time of the 26th Amendment, that our constitutional amendment package be included,” MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar said yesterday during a presser, referring to its agreement with the PML-N to empower local governments.
“But it did not happen,” he lamented, calling for the matter to be included in the 27th Amendment.
The government had last year passed a 26th Constitutional Amendment. It was passed by parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation.
The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
Even though the 26th Amendment remains mired in controversy and faces challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad remained abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to insiders, will further “fine-tune” the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.
In August, however, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar had said during a press conference that the country was “running well” and experiencing stability and economic improvement, adding that there was no need for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Bilawal had also previously dismissed talk of any potential legislation regarding a 27th Amendment as “baseless rumours”.
But, the ruling coalition now seems to be steering in a different direction.
The matter of the proposed legislation had reportedly come up during an Oct 27 meeting between Bilawal and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
The two leaders had met to discuss the prevailing political situation and formulate a joint strategy on key national issues.</p><small>2025-11-06 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061801444a84dbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953515/federal-govt-accepts-ptis-invitation-to-kp-peace-jirga' target='_blank'><strong>Federal govt accepts PTI’s invitation to KP peace jirga</strong></a><br><p>Federal Minister for Frontier Affairs Amir Muqam announced on Thursday that the federal government would take part in the upcoming peace jirga called by the PTI.
The announcement was made as Muqam held a joint press conference alongside PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser in Islamabad.
Earlier this week, the PTI decided to convene a peace jirga in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly (KPA) on November 12 to discuss the volatile law and order situation in the province.
“We have conveyed our requests to the federal government and are grateful that they accepted our invitation,” Qaiser said while jointly addressing reporters after the meeting.
“We have come together and we know what policy we want. Whatever it is, the province’s people and leadership need to come together to create a concerted plan of action,” he added.
In response to a question, Muqam said that the PTI presented “the reason why we are here” and that the government accepted it.
“They said they wanted peace and that we are all one,” he added.
Meanwhile, Qaiser wrote a post on X announcing that a delegation he led also met with National Awami Party Chairman Aftab Sherpao today.
“The delegation invited Aftab Ahmad Sherpao to attend the peace jirga organised by the KP provincial government on November 12,” he wrote.
 






In another post, Qaiser wrote that Sherpao was an “important leader of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and has also served as chief minister”.
“We desire that he inform the provincial government of his views and experiences. Peace and security are our common issues, which transcend politics,” Qaiser wrote.
 






ANP to hold ‘consultations’ before accepting jirga invitation
President of the ANP’s KP chapter, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said that he will hold consultations and then inform the PTI and the press about accepting the invitation to the peace jirga.
He made these remarks at a joint press conference flanked by PTI leader and Adviser to the KP chief minister, Shafiullah Jan.
“The jirga we held was successful and we formed an organising committee with all political parties,” he said in response to a question. “To look after it, we implemented a procedure.
“When we called an All-Parties Conference, we made a decision, and the ANP called another conference in Islamabad,” he added. “After the floods, we decided to suspend that decision under the situation improved.”

Hussain said that there has been no contact with some parties, adding that ANP President Aimal Wali Khan told KP CM Afridi that the party would only make a decision after consultations.
“We are grateful for their (the PTI) invitation and we will reply once we have had consultations,” he stated. “You will find out who is going [to the jirga].”
The PTI’s KP Secretary General, Ali Asghar Khan, took the floor and said that the previous jirga was called by the chief minister, and the party had reservations about being part of a jirga with the federal government.
“This time, the jirga has been called by the [KP] speaker,” he stated. “He formed a committee and will hold meetings with parliamentarians from all parties. He has done so because we, as a party, have come to extend the speaker’s invitation and to ask that you positively respond.”</p><small>2025-11-06 13:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061729307bc7522.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953492/british-army-chief-meets-coas-munir-both-discuss-enhancing-bilateral-defence-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>British army chief meets COAS Munir; both discuss enhancing bilateral defence cooperation</strong></a><br><p>The British Army’s Chief of the General Staff (CGS) Gen Sir Charles Roland Vincent Walker on Thursday met Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir in Rawalpindi, where the two discussed boosting bilateral defence cooperation.
The meeting between the army chiefs took place at the General Headquarters (GHQ), a press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
“During the meeting, matters of mutual interest, regional security and measures to further enhance bilateral defence cooperation were discussed,” it said.
“Both sides reiterated the need for continued collaboration to ensure peace and stability in the region,” the military’s media affairs wing added.

Gen Walker “appreciated Pakistan Army’s achievements and sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and its efforts for regional peace and stability”, according to the ISPR.
Upon his arrival at the GHQ, the British CGS laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-i-Shuhada to pay homage to the martyrs. He was presented with a guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army.
 






The field marshal’s meeting today comes about two weeks after his visit to Egypt, where he held discussions with the Egyptian Armed Forces’ Chief of Staff Lt Gen Ahmed Khalifa Fatehi and Minister of Defence and Defence Production Gen Abdul Maged Saqar.
COAS Munir had last met with Gen Walker during his five-day official visit to the United Kingdom in February, where he attended and delivered a keynote address at the annual 7th Regional Stabilisation Conference at the Royal Military Academy in Sandh­urst.
During his visit, the army chief had also engaged with the UK’s then-chief of defence staff Admiral Toney Radikin and National Security Adv­i­ser Jonathan Nicholas Powell, and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss shared security challenges and the importance of enhanced collaboration between the two nations.
 
 

In May 2024, then-CGS Gen Sir Patrick Sanders had paid a visit to Pakistan, where he met COAS Munir, with Gen Walker present as well as the CGS-designate. Gen Sanders had also addressed the sixth Pakistan-UK Regional Stabilisation Conference at Islamabad’s National Defence University.
COAS Munir and then-CGS Gen Sanders had also met in May 2023 as the latter visited Rawalpindi, where he acknowledged the Pakistan Army’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism.
CJCSC vows to boost defence cooperation with Brunei
Separately, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has held meetings with the sultan of Brunei Darussalam and other officials during an official visit to the country, expressing the commitment to “further strengthen military-to-military ties and defence cooperation”, the ISPR said today.

According to the ISPR, apart from meeting the sultan of Brunei, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah Ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar ‘Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddien, General Shamshad also held meetings with  Yang Berhormat Pehin Datu Lailaraja Major General (Retired) Dato Paduka Seri Awang Haji Halbi bin Haji Mohd Yussof, Brunei’s minister at the PM’s office and minister of defence-II, as well as Major General Dato Paduka Seri Haji Muhammad Haszaimi bin Bol Hassan, commander of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.
During the meetings, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional security environment in the meetings, the ISPR statement said, adding that the CJCSC “underscored Pakistan’s cordial relations with Brunei Darussalam and expressed his commitment to further strengthen military-to-military ties and defence cooperation”.
The CJCSC also visited the ship KDB Darulaman at Muara Naval Base and the Defence Academy of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.
At the defence academy, he “delivered a talk on ‘Pakistan’s contributions to regional peace and stability’ and interacted with the students of command and staff course, including officers from 19 foreign countries”.
According to the ISPR statement, the sultan and civil-military leadership of Brunei Darussalam “appreciated [the] high professional standards of Pakistan’s armed forces and their achievements and sacrifices in [the] fight against terrorism”.
The statement also said that upon his arrival at the Royal Brunei Armed Forces headquarters, “a smartly turned-out military contingent presented a ‘Guard of Honour’” to the CJCSC.
The CJCSC’s Brunei’s visit comes roughly around a week after his trip to Bangladesh, where he called on Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman at Army Headquarters in Dhaka. The two leaders expressed appreciation for the “positive trajectory” of growing defence cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh during the meeting, the ISPR said.
During the visit, the CJCSC also met with Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Mohammad Nazmul Hassan, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan and Principal Staff Officer (PSO) of the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen S.M. Kamrul Hassan.</p><small>2025-11-06 13:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06160050898cccc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953509/amid-lifetime-ban-and-legal-fiasco-arshad-nadeems-coach-to-travel-with-him-for-islamic-solidarity-games' target='_blank'><strong>Amid lifetime ban and legal fiasco, Arshad Nadeem’s coach to travel with him for Islamic Solidarity Games</strong></a><br><p>Arshad Nadeem’s coach Salman Butt will travel with him for the upcoming Islamic Solidarity Games next week despite having been slapped with a lifetime ban by the Athletics Federation of Pakistan (AFP) which prohibits him from participating in any athletics activities.
The ban, which the federation imposed on Salman on October 12 “for gross violations of the AFP Constitution”, barred Salman from participating in any athletics activity “whether as an athlete, coach, official, or office bearer, at both national and international levels, inside or outside Pakistan.”
AFP cited “illegal and unconstitutional” elections held on August 31 by the Punjab Athletics Association — of which Salman was president till August 6 — as the primary reason for the ban.
The ban came just days after AFP asked Salman to explain Arshad’s 10th-place finish at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo in September.
The matter descended into the legal sphere when Salman approached the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) on Oct 14 to hear the case that he was appealing. PSB appointed Senator Pervaiz Rashid as adjudicator to the case.
According to a notice of hearing on the matter, a copy of which Dawn has seen, Rashid sent a questionnaire to AFP and held the first hearing on November 3, but the federation objected to the matter being sent to an adjudicator instead of arbitration.
PSB, citing its constitution, as well as hearings from both the Supreme Court and Islamabad High Court, said it “possesses ample jurisdiction and authority to hear and decide the present matter”, and that the objection raised by AFP regarding jurisdiction was “rejected and set aside.”
The notice of hearing directed all parties to appear for the next hearing on Nov 6 (today), but after the AFP requested more time, the hearing has been scheduled for Nov 13 instead, a source close to the matter told Dawn.
Separately, Arshad had written to the Pakistan Olympics Association (POA) on Oct 17, who in turn confirmed its continued support and safeguarding oversight.
Arshad was a recipient of the POA’s Olympic Scholarships for athletes bound for the Paris 2024 Olympics, where Arshad won gold and broke the Olympic record with a 92.97m throw.
In the POA’s response to Arshad, a copy of which Dawn has seen, it confirmed that Salman “as per your patent right, preference and performance record, shall continue to serve as your Athlete Support Personnel for all training, rehabilitation, and competition activities including those conducted under the Pakistan Olympic Association and within the scope of the IOC Olympic Solidarity Programme.”
The association reaffirmed its full commitment to Arshad’s “professional development, mental welfare, and safeguarding.
“You will continue to train and compete within a safe, dignified environment free from external interference,” the letter read.
It further stated that a follow-up consultation would be convened to review his ongoing and future programmes, and the IOC would be informed of the situation “to protect your rights under the Olympic Charter and, in consultation with you, jointly engage with World Athletics at the appropriate time.”</p><small>2025-11-06 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632381-pia-dismisses-president-secretary-general-of-aircraft-engineers-body-amid-ongoing-dispute' target='_blank'><strong>PIA dismisses president, secretary general of aircraft engineers' body amid ongoing dispute</strong></a><br><p>

The top market for US farmers, China has turned its vast appetite for crops into a powerful trade war bargaining chip, largely avoiding US wheat and soybeans in favour of other supplies, after rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs.
Chinese buyers have booked two cargoes of US wheat, the first such purchases since October last year, two traders said on Thursday, while a sorghum shipment has been sent from the US to China, a US industry official said.
The deals to import US agricultural goods come as Beijing confirmed on Wednesday that it suspended retaliatory tariffs on US imports, including duties on farm goods, although shipments of US soybeans still face a 13 per cent tariff.

The purchases of about 120,000 tonnes for December shipment include one cargo of US soft white wheat and one of spring wheat, the sources said.
 
 

“This is more of China showing commitment to buy US grains as US wheat is not the cheapest,” said a Singapore-based grains trader with direct knowledge of the wheat deals. “So it is more of [a] political move to buy these cargoes.”
On Thursday, Chinese state grains buyer COFCO held a soybean procurement signing ceremony during a major import fair in Shanghai, the head of a Chinese agriculture business association said, but no details were given.
Cheaper Brazilian soybeans
The White House has said China would buy at least 12m tonnes of US soybeans in the last two months of 2025 and at least 25m tonnes in each of the next three years, but Beijing has yet to confirm those figures.
China’s decision to leave intact a tariff of 13pc on soybeans makes US shipments too expensive for commercial buyers compared to Brazilian cargoes, traders and analysts said.
Chinese importers recently bought 20 cargoes of cheaper Brazilian soybeans as South American prices eased on expectations that US sales would resume, while COFCO took three US cargoes ahead of the Trump-Xi meet.</p><small>2025-11-06 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06162024b16fbed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953510/bangladesh-election-campaign-turns-violent-as-1-killed-in-shooting-at-rally-of-khaleda-zias-party' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh election campaign turns violent as 1 killed in shooting at rally of Khaleda Zia’s party</strong></a><br><p>Gunmen on motorbikes attacked a Bangladesh political rally, killing one person and wounding two others, including a candidate, officials said on Thursday, after parties began campaigning for landmark elections.
Major parties opened their campaigns on Wednesday for the elections slated for February 2026, the first since a deadly uprising last year toppled the autocratic government of former ruler Sheikh Hasina.
Campaigning turned violent almost immediately.
The shooting took place at a rally on Wednesday for the powerful Bangladesh National Party (BNP) attended by hundreds in the port city of Chattogram, police said.
Senior BNP leader Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said, “It was an attempt to destabilise politics and disrupt the election”.
Major parties have unveiled their candidate lists, with the BNP saying this week that 80-year-old leader and three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia will run again, as well as her son, Tarique Rahman.
The BNP are widely seen as the frontrunner in the polls.
Police said the gunmen opened fire quickly on a crowd of hundreds at the rally but insisted that the BNP candidate was not the target.
“The miscreants … shot their target, and fled in a flash,” senior police officer Hasib Aziz told reporters late on Wednesday.
Candidate Ershad Ullah was shot and wounded, along with a supporter. A third man was killed.
“We would urge candidates to inform the police station at least 24 hours prior to any election campaign, so that more police can be deployed,” Aziz said.
‘Show restraint’
The South Asian nation of about 170 million people has been in political turmoil since Hasina was overthrown by the student-led uprising in August 2024.
Campaigning is technically unofficial because the election commission is not expected to announce the voting day until December.
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner serving as chief adviser, has repeatedly promised the elections will be held in February.
Yunus has ordered an investigation into the shooting, his media team said in a statement.
The interim government “calls on all political actors and their supporters to uphold calm, show restraint, and ensure that the February general election takes place in an atmosphere of peace, dignity, and fairness”, it said on Thursday.
Bangladesh police offered cash rewards yesterday for the surrender of more than 1,300 machine guns, rifles and pistols looted during last year’s uprising.
Lieutenant General Md Mainur Rahman told an army news conference on Wednesday that the military would provide security to ensure peaceful polls and that they would return to barracks after the election.
“We hope stability will be strengthened, law and order will remain normal, and we will return to the cantonment once the election is held,” Rahman said.
Bangladesh’s largest Islamist political party, Jamaat-i-Islami, said it had finalised a preliminary candidate list and was “engaging with other parties on the prospect of seat-sharing”, senior leader Abdullah Mohammad Taher told AFP.</p><small>2025-11-06 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632376-controversial-tweet-case-court-withdraws-imaan-mazari-husbands-warrants' target='_blank'><strong>Controversial tweet case: Court withdraws Imaan Mazari, husband's warrants</strong></a><br><p>

Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday. The talks are expected to continue for two days.
In this round, Pakistan’s delegation is being led by Lt Gen Asim Malik, director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence, and includes senior officials from the military, intelligence agencies, and the Foreign Office.
The Afghan Taliban’s delegation, meanwhile, includes General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq, Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani, Qahar Balkhi, Zakir Jalali and Afghanistan’s chargé d’affaires in Ankara.
Focus of the talks
A joint statement was released by the Turkish foreign ministry following the last round of talks between the two sides. It said that “all parties have agreed on continuation of ceasefire” and “to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and impose a penalty on the violating party”.
The communique further stated that “the principals” from both sides would reconvene in Istanbul on November 6 to discuss implementation.
Earlier, a diplomat from one of the mediating countries said while speaking to Dawn on the condition of anonymity that the two sides will review the implementation of the commitments reached during the previous round of talks and attempt to finalise the modalities for the monitoring and verification mechanism agreed in principle last week.
Meanwhile, officials in both Islamabad and Kabul have kept expectations low about the upcoming dialogue.
Pakistani military and intelligence officials have stated that Islamabad’s position remains unchanged, that Afghan soil must not be used for terrorism against Pakistan — a longstanding demand of Islamabad.
“The Pakistan military and intelligence service have a single-point agenda — the end of terrorism,” military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said earlier this week.
Another security official, speaking on anonymity, said while speaking to Dawn that Islamabad seeks “concrete, verifiable guarantees”.
From borders clashes to talks
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on Oct 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
The information minister had said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by India-abetted“ terrorists.
“The Afghan Taliban regime has been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar had stated.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6 (today).</p><small>2025-11-06 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06152256b1c233f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953506/islamabad-court-withdraws-non-bailable-arrest-warrants-issued-against-imaan-mazari-spouse' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court withdraws non-bailable arrest warrants issued against Imaan Mazari, spouse</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad court on Thursday withdrew non-bailable arrest warrants issued a day earlier against human rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, in a social media posts case, a day after.
The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCIA) had registered a case against Mazari and Chattha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.  Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka had indicted the two in the case last week, in which both denied the charges.
At yesterday’s hearing, the court issued non-bailable arrest warrants to the couple over repeated non-appearance. However, the accused alleged that they had appeared in front of the court and termed the hearing a “sham trial”.
Today’s hearing, presided over by ADSJ Majoka, was called twice in the morning —first at 8:45am and later at 10:16am— but the accused did not appear, after which the hearing was adjourned.
However, later, the couple appeared before the court, and the hearing resumed.  During the hearing, Mazari requested the court to allow her time to hire legal counsel.
“Time should be given to appoint a lawyer,” she said, adding that the rapid pace at which the case was being conducted was “violating our rights.”
She further stated, “We are being punished for speaking the truth.”
Mazari also requested that the indictment be read out to them in court.
In response to this, ADSJ Majoka said that the indictment had already been read three times, including in the presence of legal representatives.
Chattha — whose power of attorney had been submitted earlier by Advocate Samiullah Wazir — also requested the court to remove the state counsel appointed for him.
To this, the court clarified that it had not appointed the state counsel and that only the relevant committee responsible for the appointment could remove them if required.
On the other side, the prosecutor was against granting the accused any more time. He went on to argue that statements of witnesses should be recorded and, if necessary, a state counsel could continue representing the accused.
On the matter of Mazari’s legal representation, ADSJ Majoka directed that the power of attorney for Mazari’s counsel be submitted on Saturday.
He adjourned the hearing to Saturday as well.
He also stated that arguments regarding the continuation or removal of the state counsel will also be heard on Saturday, after which the court will decide the matter.
Over the appearance of both of the accused, the court suspended the arrest warrants against the couple.
Separately, in a post on X, Mazari alleged that “she had only been given one day to hire legal counsel,” adding that “charges against them had not yet formally been framed.”
She further alleged that “despite Hadi submitting power of attorney, the court remained persistent that he should be represented by state counsel.”
Mazari went on to note: “The court adjourned the hearing to Saturday in this case, while many other trials usually stretch on for 2-3 weeks.”
 






In a separate tweet detailing yesterday’s hearing, Mazari had alleged that the judge had  “flatly refused” to read the charges to her.
He “[began] recording of evidence without charge being framed and my plea,” she added.
Mazari continued: “This is not an independent or impartial court but a party to the case. The bias is clear, and this Judge should no longer hear this case.
“This is a sham trial.”
 






At yesterday’s hearing, heated exchanges took place between the accused and the court.
Mazari objected to the court’s previous order, calling it “baseless” and claiming that the record incorrectly stated she had been indicted.  As the hearing resumed after a brief adjournment, Chatha expressed no confidence in the court, alleging bias.
“This court is biased and should not hear this case,” he said.
ADSJ Majoka replied that such an application should have been filed before the indictment. “Had you expressed no confidence before the indictment, I could have transferred the case. Now, this power lies with the High Court,” the judge remarked.
Chatha then alleged that the judge was “under pressure,” which the judge firmly denied.
On October 29, Chattha was arrested outside the courtroom for non-appearance, despite Mazari claiming that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom”.
Social media case
According to the first information report (FIR) of the case, registered by the NCIA, Mazari and Chattha were accused of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts.
It also accused the two of implying that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
The FIR was registered under the following sections of law: Sections 9, 10, 11 and 26 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016.
The FIR alleged that they held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It stated that Mazari and Chattha had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p><small>2025-11-06 10:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06130407e5f6539.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953498/only-sohail-afridi-can-make-decisions-for-peace-in-kp-says-cms-aide' target='_blank'><strong>Only Sohail Afridi can make decisions for peace in KP, says CM’s aide</strong></a><br><p>Shafiullah Jan, the special assistant to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on information and public relations, said on Thursday that only the provincial chief executive could make decisions for ensuring lasting peace in the province.
“We have the mandate. Any decision for lasting peace in the province will be made by the chief minister, and the provincial government will implement it,” Jan said while addressing a news conference in Peshawar.
 






He said law and order was the biggest challenge for the provincial government, adding that the KP government was making efforts to address the issue.
Jan further said that a multiparty conference was scheduled to be held next week and that the finalised terms of reference (ToRs) would be presented to the chief minister for further discussion with the stakeholders, to decide a future course of action for lasting peace in the province.
Meanwhile, PTI Provincial Secretary General Ali Asghar requested all the political parties to share their suggestions, adding that PTI founder Imran Khan and his party were against any military operation in the province.
“The consequences of military operations are faced by the locals who vacate their homes,” he said.
The PTI has been opposing plans to conduct anti-terrorism operations across the province, with its incarcerated founder Imran Khan in August telling then-KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur not to allow the Centre to conduct any military operations.
Imran had made a similar demand in September as well.
However, Gandapur had deviated from the party line while he was the CM and justified the use of mortar shells, drones and fighter jets against terrorists as the constitutional right of the military.
It was against this backdrop that Imran decided to remove Gandapur as the provincial chief executive and nominated Afridi for the post, who was elected as the chief minister on October 13. Imran’s this decision is also being linked to his opposition to military operations in the KP.
Three days before Afridi’s election, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had addressed a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters.
He was asked on the occasion about the Pakistan government’s past engagement with the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the change in the KP leadership.
In his response, the DG ISPR had said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists)? […] Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations?
‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations? It is for everyone to see that today […] who is that person and the political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’
For his part, Afridi announced following his election that a jirga would be held in his hometown of Bara in the Khyber district on Oct 25 to establish enduring peace in the restive province and resist decisions made without the input of residents. He also asserted that the provincial government stood by the ideology of Imran and the interests of the KP residents.
In his first official high-level meeting as the CM on Oct 20, he had maintained that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.
More recently on Oct 29, he used stronger words to criticise military operations in KP while speaking to the media in Peshawar, saying that civilian deaths during security operations constituted a “war crime” and not collateral damage.</p><small>2025-11-06 10:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632356-sindh-launches-student-attendance-system-to-enhance-school-management' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh launches student attendance system to enhance school management</strong></a><br><p>

SAMRS, an initiative of the school education and literacy department (SELD), has been developed under the Sindh Early Learning Enhancement through Classroom Transformation (SELECT) project. It will be rolled out in 600 schools across 12 districts.
In a statement on X, the Sindh information department said the initiative represented a “significant step toward greater transparency and the promotion of data-driven education across the province”.
 






Addressing the launch ceremony in Karachi today, CM Murad stressed the need for Pakistan to have proper databases due to an increase in the population. “The numbers have become so large that you can’t just keep track.”
Underscoring the need to utilise digital platforms, the chief minister said the SAMRS was the “perfect way of doing it”.
“I have said that we will go to the union councils and make it the responsibility of elected representatives to identify children in their villages to assign them a digital ID,” CM Murad said.
Murad noted that the SAMRS has been rolled out in 600 schools as of now, while the province had a total of more than 40,000 schools.
Stressing that each and every child should be incorporated into the SAMRS, the chief minister proposed that the subsequent data should be compared with that of the latest census.
He said the system would be used to gauge the number of out-of-school children, acknowledging that the current reported figures were “scary to say the least”.
CM Murad noted that the SAMRS will also aid in figuring out the number of school dropouts. Last month, he had directed the school education department to make full use of the technology to monitor students’ attendance, reduce dropout rate and address the causes of absenteeism.
Sindh had a 54pc dropout rate for children at the post-primary level in 2024, according to government figures, while 47pc of children across the province — a staggering 7.81 million — were out of school as per the 2023 census.
 
 

The chief minister highlighted the importance of educating children to create a well-civilised and democratic nation.
“Our mines, our minerals, our arms and ammunition — they all go to zero if we don’t have an educated nation,” CM Murad said.
He said the system will first be implemented in schools, then colleges and eventually universities. He also called for “open access” to the system so that educationists and experts can provide their input.
CM Murad noted that the SELECT project was being carried out in collaboration with the World Bank, and the SAMRS was a part of it. He added that the Asian Development Bank and other international agencies were aiding in rebuilding schools.
 






“We’re going to spend more than Rs125 billion this year in rebuilding schools that were affected during the floods,” the chief minister stated.
Murad noted that there had been grievances that the education department was not implementing its development portfolio properly, but “we have seen an improvement compared to last year”. “Still not satisfied, still a long way to go, but yes, it has become better.”
Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah and World Bank Country Director in Pakistan Bolormaa Amgaabazar were among the attendees at the event.
Shah, as per a statement from CM Murad’s spokesperson Abdulrasheed Channa, said teachers will be trained in the initial stages of SELECT to improve teaching quality and that a transparent system will be implemented under the supervision of a Reform Support Unit.
On the SAMRS, Shah said the reasons for students’ absences will be identified and “timely corrective action” will be taken.
He pointed out that the SAMRS would also enable online monitoring of teachers’ attendance and registration. He added that the system will have “full functionality” with geo-fencing and an offline mode.
 


Providing details of the SAMRS, the minister said out of the 600 schools where the system was initially being rolled out, 120 were primary, 480 were middle, and 79 were high schools.
“There are a total of 137,000 pupils registered, including 79,730 girls and 57,501 boys,” Shah said. He listed that illness was the top reason for absenteeism (44 per cent), followed by domestic circumstances (21pc) and family emergencies (16pc).
According to the education minister, there has been a 16pc improvement in school attendance from April to May this year, while the share of students with “high risk” of dropping out has declined from 32.5pc to 23pc.</p><small>2025-11-06 09:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632352-pm-shehbaz-assures-mqm-p-of-local-govt-reforms-under-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz assures MQM-P of local govt reforms under 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

Watch parties surfaced across all five boroughs, pulsing with celebratory music, jubilation, and a sense of endless possibilities. The city itself seemed to hum with electric energy. The air, undeniably different, charged with the promise of something new.
At a time when voter turnout and overall faith in politics have been at record lows, 34-year-old democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, a Queens native and the son of Ugandan-Indian immigrants, has emerged as a ray of hope, not only for New Yorkers but progressives all over the world.
His win signifies a new era for reformists, younger voters, and immigrant communities who poured their hearts out into his campaign, canvassing neighbourhoods, phone-banking, and donating generously. Nearly 70 per cent of his voter base was under the age of 30.
“Seeing someone who shares similar values, background, and culture in a position of power feels very grounding and affirming. It shows that we belong here and that our voices matter,” said Dr Sayali Karke, 27, a medical professional and an immigrant from India.
The mayoral election drew more than two million voters — a turnout last seen in 1969, according to the city’s Board of Elections, when 2.46 million people came out to vote for incumbent Mayor John Lindsay, who, after losing the Republican primary, was reelected on the Liberal line.
Mamdani’s meteoric rise over the past year — from a lesser-known assemblyman to now the 111th mayor of New York, defeating well-established rivals such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa in both the Democratic primary and the general election — is nothing short of monumental.
He’s coming for Trump and we’re here for it
Running on a platform of progressive politics, Mamdani has pledged to prioritise five key policies: universal free childcare, a rent freeze on the city’s one million rent-stabilised apartments, rebuilding ties with his critics, reimagining the police department, and standing up to President Donald Trump’s attacks on the city.
In his first speech as mayor, Mamdani addressed the president directly.
“This is not how we stop Trump; this is how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up,” declared Mamdani, eliciting thunderous applause.
A historic day indeed, to see a Muslim politician challenge the president of the United States on the world’s stage.
And Trump was, in fact, watching. “AND SO IT BEGINS!”, he responded on his Truth Social platform.
Mamdani now faces significant challenges as mayor in reconciling his ambitious agenda with the realities of governance amid deep political hostility and division. Trump has already launched a slew of scornful attacks on social media and threatened to halt federal funds to New York City.
“If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
Aside from the fact that Mamdani has clarified on multiple occasions that he is not a communist but a democratic socialist, the president does not have the authority to withhold federal funds from states. Under the US Constitution, that power lies with Congress.
When Islamophobia met its match
The scourge of Islamophobia presents yet another battle Mamdani and his Muslim supporters will continue to encounter. His campaign team, which included many Muslim staffers, endured harassment and discrimination but continued to press forward with unwavering resolve.
“I was canvassing outside a mosque in Brooklyn, handing out fliers, when a group of young white men walked past, hurling Islamophobic insults because I was wearing a keffiyeh,” recalled a resident of Brooklyn, Zarah Shujjah, who is also an immigrant. “That incident gave me more conviction that we need a Muslim mayor. So, I showed up again the next day, and the next, and the next.”
Throughout the campaign, Mamdani’s candidacy endured waves of racially charged attacks, from criticisms about his lack of experience to outright anti-Muslim slurs. Ellie Cohanim, a former deputy envoy in the first Trump Administration, posted a picture of the burning Twin Towers from September 11, 2001, captioned: “Never forget …. Vote Andrew Cuomo & save our city”. The New York Post ran headlines that conflated Mamdani with terrorism, and Cuomo himself engaged in Islamophobic remarks in an interview with the conservative radio host Sid Rosenberg.
As Islamophobia persists across the United States, Muslim Americans finally feel a sense of solace and pride knowing that when Mamdani is sworn in on January 1, he will be the most powerful Muslim elected official in the country.
“It’s shocking that I have seen a Muslim mayor in my 20s. It feels like a response to the polarising state of the country. We’re going to see more Trumps and Kirks pop up, but we’ll also see more Mamdanis. That’s both exciting and concerning. It’s a reality that represents the current state of US politics,” said Maria Mir, who moved to Brooklyn from Pakistan.
The line between hope and hype
While it’s tempting, and often politically useful, to glorify a newly elected leader in an age of virality, such adulation should be seen with caution. The internet has a way of turning people into symbols, often faster than they can grow into the roles those symbols demand.
Elevating a figure as esteemed as Mamdani creates expectations: promises made on the campaign trail become moral contracts with voters, and supporters rightly expect those contracts to be honoured. It will be important to hold him accountable to his commitments and to the faith of those who propelled him to victory.
That said, accountability and optimism for change are not mutually exclusive. Transitioning from campaigner to the daily grind of city leadership is a radical shift — from setting agendas to balancing budgets and operating within institutional constraints. In a city long dominated by wealth and entrenched interests, the odds are stacked against him. He must be afforded the leeway to falter as he transitions to his new role.
Yet, for now, New Yorkers, and many others around the world can revel in this renewed sense of faith and watch as new beginnings start to unfold.

Cathay said late on Wednesday that the Doha-based carrier had approached it about selling its entire 9.7 per cent stake, and it would repurchase the shareholding through a buyback at HK$10.8374 per share, roughly a 4pc discount to its last closing share price.
The Gulf carrier had bought the stake in November 2017, making it the third-largest shareholder in Cathay after Swire Pacific and Air China.
Cathay is paying roughly a 35pc premium over the price Qatar Airways originally paid for the stake to buy it back. The Hong Kong carrier said it would fund the deal through internal resources and existing credit lines.
“I don’t think there’s anything special to read into it [buying back from Qatar]. I think it’s more likely about Qatar Airways having their own cash needs,” said Kenny Ng Lai-yin, securities strategist at China Everbright Securities International.

Kenny said the deal should be good for Cathay’s stock price as there would be fewer shares floating in the market, which would mean less selling pressure.
Shares of Cathay rose 4.8pc on Thursday, while the Hong Kong-listed shares of Air China climbed 4pc and Swire Pacific’s stock was up more than 1pc.
Based at the world’s busiest cargo airport, Cathay is one of Asia’s largest cargo carriers and has benefited from rising volumes of e-commerce out of China.
Exit strategy allows for ‘long-term growth’
Cathay was Qatar Airways’ first major investment in an Asian airline and was aimed at boosting its global influence and increasing traffic through its Doha hub. There were no Qatar-nominated directors on Cathay’s board, meaning it had little influence over the Swire Pacific-managed airline.
Prior to Qatar Airways’ investment, Cathay flew between Hong Kong and Qatar’s Doha hub as part of a codeshare arrangement between 2014 and 2016, but the route was axed “for commercial reasons”.
Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said the exit reflected the company’s disciplined portfolio strategy and followed a period of strong results, allowing the company to optimise investments and position itself for long-term growth.
The Middle Eastern airline has pursued a strategy of investing in airlines worldwide to strengthen its competitive position, including in British Airways parent IAG, South American carrier LATAM and Virgin Australia .
Cathay Chairman Patrick Healy said the stake buyback reflected “strong” confidence in the company’s future. The airline has laid out an investment plan of HK$100bn over seven years that includes fleet renewal, cabin products and lounges.
Cathay suffered prolonged losses during the Covid-19 pandemic, with Hong Kong one of the last global destinations to end travel restrictions.
 
 

Cathay’s business is recovering, with the airline and budget subsidiary HK Express carrying 20pc more passengers in September than a year earlier.
If the buyback of the Qatar Airways stake is approved, Swire Pacific’s stake in Cathay will rise to 47.69pc from 43.12pc, while Air China’s shareholding will increase to 31.78pc from 28.74pc.
Cathay and Qatar Airways said they would continue their partnership through the oneworld Alliance.</p><small>2025-11-06 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06083701a518a49.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953380/is-k-commander-gunned-down-in-kps-karak' target='_blank'><strong>‘IS-K commander’ gunned down in KP’s Karak</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: A key commander of the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) militant group was killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak in a late-evening police operation, sources told Dawn.

Four policemen were also wounded in the shootout, that lasted around four hours.
According to sources, Hakim was believed to be the mastermind of a failed suicide bombing targeting the JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.

Chasing 264, Pakistan won a tense first ODI by two wickets on Tuesday with only a couple of balls to spare on a pitch that assisted spinners in the later stages of both the innings.
Having elected to field first, the Shaheen Shah Afridi-captained hosts were facing a tough situation when Matthew Breetzke’s South Africa reached 98-0 as their openers dominated the proceedings. Later, the tourists were 191-3 in 33 overs before they suffered a late collapse as the home spinners took charge.
The pitch is likely to favour batsmen early on though spinners could again play a key role in the later stages of the match at the traditionally dry surface.
For South Africa, the focus will be on adapting quickly to the conditions and countering Pakistan’s bowling which has depth as well as variety.
The touring batsmen, in particular, will be looking to build partnerships and produce a better show with greater discipline against the likes of Shaheen, Naseem Shah, Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz and part-time spinner Saim Ayub, who earned the player-of-the-match award for his all-round show – 2-39 in eight overs and 39 runs – in the first game.
The South African players attended a training session at the Iqbal Stadium on Wednesday while the Pakistan team opted to rest.
The tourists participated in warm-up exercises followed by batting, bowling and fielding practice drills.
‘CREDIT TO BATTERS’
Earlier, talking at the post-match ceremony, Shaheen lauded the batters for their match-winning show in the series opener.
“Our bowlers came back in the last 10 overs to restrict South Africa to a reasonable total. But I will give credit to our batters who played well on a wicket that had both turn and swing [in the latter stages of the innings],” Shaheen said.
“They handled the situation well.”
Replying to a question regarding the tense victory in the series opener, the Pakistan skipper said, “That always happens in cricket but we’ll try to make it not happen again.”
Speaking at a news conference after the first ODI, Pakistan wicket-keeper/batter Mohammad Rizwan defended the hosts’ decision to bowl first.
“The decision to bowl first was taken by us while keeping in view the prevailing situation [at the ground]. It was a combined decision by us,” Rizwan told reporters while answering a question.
“Plus there was the dew factor. All of us had the same opinion that we should bowl first keeping in mind that dew will come into play in the latter stages of the day. The batting looked easy early on in the first innings but then came the dew factor.”
Responding to a question, Rizwan said that the hosts should have wrapped up the match earlier as Pakistan were well set at 196-3 in the 39th over with Rizwan (55) and Salman Ali Agha (62) at the crease.
“Yes, we [Salman and Rizwan] should have finished the game. Actually, the wicket was behaving awkwardly where the ball was skidding, gripping and bouncing and we were set.
“We will try not to repeat the mistakes and finish the game in future.”
Regarding the historic international match that the Iqbal Stadium hosted after 17 years, Rizwan said, “On our part, wherever we play at home — including Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, Rawalpindi or Faisalabad — we get the same support from the crowd.
“It is what message the other [visiting] teams get from our crowds matters the most.”
Talking to reporters after the first match, South African pacer Corbin Bosch said that the wicket was good for spinners.
“It was a new ball wicket, and was tough [to bat on]. The ball [particularly in the latter stages] turned and spinners played a crucial role for both the teams,” Bosch told reporters.
The pacer believed that South Africa were slightly short of setting Pakistan a winning target, saying, “We were perhaps 15 runs short on this wicket”.

“In eight months I ended eight wars, including Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda … Pakistan and India,” he said during a speech at the American Business Forum in Miami late on Wednesday.
“I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them. And then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper — I won’t mention the newspaper because it’s usually fake news — but I heard they are going to war. Eight planes, seven planes were shot down — an eighth was really badly wounded [sic]. But eight planes were shot down essentially,” he said.
 


He reiterated his previous claims that he threatened not to make trade deals unless the two countries agreed to peace.
“I’m not trading with you; we are not making any deals with you if you are at war with each other,” he said.
“A day later, I get a call, ‘We made peace’. They stopped. I said, ‘Thank you, let’s trade’. Isn’t that great? Tariffs did that. Without tariffs that would have never happened.”
The US president has previously stated on several occasions that five to seven planes were shot down during the May conflict between the two neighbouring countries. He had also reiterated his praise for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asum Munir, both of whom he met in Washington in September. Just last month, he had said that seven “brand-new, beautiful planes were shot down” during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India.
India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.
The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.</p><small>2025-11-06 07:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06112308e225cac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953488/trump-administration-has-revoked-80000-non-immigrant-visas-us-official-says' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration has revoked 80,000 non-immigrant visas, US official says</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s administration has revoked around 80,000 non-immigrant visas since its inauguration on January 20 for offences ranging from driving under the influence to assault and theft, a senior State Department official said on Wednesday.
The extent of the revocations, first reported by the Washington Examiner, reflects a broad immigration crackdown initiated when Trump came into office, deporting an unprecedented number of migrants, including some who held valid visas.
The administration has also adopted a stricter policy on granting visas, with tightened social media vetting and expanded screening.
Around 16,000 of the visa revocations were tied to cases of driving under the influence, while about 12,000 were for assault and another 8,000 for theft.
“These three crimes accounted for almost half of revocations this year,” said the senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
In August, a State Department spokesperson said Washington had revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and breaking the law, including a small number for “support for terrorism”.
The department also said last month that it had revoked the visas of at least six people over social media comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in May said he had revoked the visas of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people, including students, because of involvement in activities that he said went against US foreign policy priorities.
Directives from the State Department this year have ordered US diplomats abroad to be vigilant against any applicants whom Washington may see as hostile to the United States and with a history of political activism.
Trump administration officials have said that student visa and green card holders are subject to deportation over their support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel’s conduct in its offensive in Gaza, calling their actions a threat to US foreign policy and accusing them of being pro-Hamas.</p><small>2025-11-06 06:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0610164365090d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953480/elon-musks-starlink-to-start-services-in-indias-maharashtra-state' target='_blank'><strong>Elon Musk’s Starlink to start services in India’s Maharashtra state</strong></a><br><p>India’s Maharashtra state, home to the financial hub Mumbai, will be the first to roll out Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service in the world’s most populous country, the state’s chief minister said.
The launch of Starlink, which provides high-speed internet to remote locations using low-orbit satellites, has sparked fierce debate in India over issues ranging from predatory pricing to spectrum allocation.
India — projected to have more than 900 million internet users by year’s end — granted Starlink a licence in June.
Maharashtra was “poised to become the first Indian state to formally collaborate with Starlink”, the state’s Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on the Musk-owned platform X late Wednesday.
“This collaboration … will ensure the state leads India in satellite-enabled digital infrastructure.”
In March, India’s biggest telecom service providers — Jio Platforms and its rival Bharti Airtel — announced deals with SpaceX to offer Starlink internet to their customers.
Starlink’s business operations Vice President Lauren Dreyer said she was “excited” to further India’s digital vision.
“Looking forward to connecting schools, medical facilities, and beyond in the most remote and unconnected areas once Starlink receives final approvals”, Dreyer said in a statement.
Major technology firms looking to court users in the world’s fifth-largest economy have made a flurry of announcements about expanding into the country this year.
In October, Google announced it will invest $15 billion in India over the next five years to build a giant data centre and artificial intelligence base there, the largest AI hub it is investing in outside of the United States.

On Monday, Washington circulated the document among several Council members, proposing a mandate of at least two years, until December 2027, along with the possibility of extensions.
Diplomats privy to developments told Dawn that President Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan is attached to the resolution that all UN Security Council members formally received on Tuesday afternoon.
The resolution, one source said, contains several ambiguities.
The draft does not seek a UN mandate for the proposed ISF, which will operate under the newly proposed Board of Peace.
The ISF is also expected to disarm Hamas, but will have no authority over Israeli military activities. The resolution also makes no reference to a “pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” although the concept is included in Trump’s 20-point plan.
Pakistan was among the parties that received the draft resolution last week, although it has not yet taken a public position on it. Even Indonesia has conveyed that it will not send troops to Gaza if the objective is “only to disarm Hamas”.
Jakarta, like the rest of the eight-nation Muslim bloc, is also seeking a UN mandate for the mission — if not for the force — and wants the UNSC to have a role.

• Rahul hopes to repeat his UP success in Bihar with Lalu’s party
NEW DELHI: Two-stage state polls for the 243-seat Bihar assembly starting today (Thursday) are being seen as critical for the durability of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s minority government.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) party crucially shores up the Modi government, in which the BJP stands reduced to 240 seats from the 2024 general elections, well below the halfway mark of 272 in the Lok Sabha.
Mr Kumar’s JD(U) with 12 MPs and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu with 16 Telugu Desam MPs hold Mr Modi’s fate in their palms. Mr Modi, heading the ruling National Democ­ratic Alliance (NDA), has merely 21 MPs above a simple majority, and the two allies from Bihar and Andhra Prad­esh together add up to 28 MPs.
 
 

The NDA is widely seen as being held together in a quid pro quo arrangement whereby Mr Modi’s BJP supports the minority government of Nitish Kumar in Bihar, and he supports Mr Modi. Any setback to Mr Kumar’s hold over Bihar in the assembly polls — a scenario not being ruled out by pollsters — could adversely impact Mr Modi’s hold on Mr Kumar’s support for him. Mr Naidu too is a hard bargainer who began his political career as a Youth Congress leader.
However, much more is making the Bihar state polls on Nov 6 and 11 so crucial for everyone in the fray.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi made a significant comeback for his party in 2024, a gain that elevated him as the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha. But the laurels were won in lockstep with allies, chiefly in Uttar Pradesh where, together with the Samajwadi Party, the Congress was able to pare down Mr Modi’s numbers drastically.
Uttar Pradesh was principally responsible for the BJP’s loss of majority under Mr Modi’s watch. Rahul Gandhi is hoping for an encore, to upset the BJP in Bihar, this with the alliance he has formed with former chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav’s son. To their advantage, Bihar is the only Hindi-speaking state where the BJP has not been able to take power from its allies.
The question is, given the dire threats and pressures on both sides, would the BJP allow the opposition to gain the leg up. Mr Gandhi not for the first time may have put the finger on the nub of the matter. He has accused the election commission of working in cahoots with and for the BJP to steal the Bihar election.
 
 

He asserts this with the support of what appears to be the election commission’s fudged voters lists in recent state polls in Haryana where the Congress was unexpectedly trounced and in Maharashtra, where a Congress alliance was allegedly robbed of victory, were rigged with the connivance of the election commission.
The core of the charge concerns the excessively powerful election body’s drive to carry out a nationwide Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter’s list like the one that was carried out amid controversy in poll-bound Bihar. Mr Modi had changed the rules for nominating the election commissioner thereby giving himself a freehand to choose his man.
The opposition alleges that the election commission is helping the BJP by deleting voters perceived to be opposed to the BJP, primarily Muslims. The issue has galvanised opposition governments in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala who have joined hands with the Congress to widen the allegation into a movement.
The most threatened by any arbitrary act to tweak the voter’s list is West Bengal where the Mamata Bannerjee government enjoys more than a handy support of Muslims. Curiously, the BJP-ruled states of Assam and Tripura have been left out of the coming round of revision of the voter’s list. Opposition has cried foul over the exclusion.
So, what is going to happen in Bihar? Its caste arithmetic is as crucial as it is murky. The state abuts Nepal with which it shares an open border. Recent events in the landlocked country are being watched in Bihar. Gen Z voters are at the heart of this election campaign in Bihar: the state has India’s largest proportion of youth population.
“Nearly 58 per cent of Bihar’s population is under 25 years of age and hence belong to the Generation Z cohort,” says The Wire. “In terms of voters, one in every four voters is a Gen Z. Of them, 1.47 million are first-time voters.”

According to a quarterly report released by the Power Division, the new fiscal year began with Rs1.614tr, compared with Rs2.467tr in the same period last year. It said payables to power producers increased to Rs944bn at the close of September, up from Rs861bn at the start of the fiscal year on July 1. The payables to power producers had amounted to Rs1.688tr as of end-September last year.
The report said past debt parked in the Power Holding Company of the Power Division remained unchanged at Rs660bn during the first quarter of the fiscal year. It stood at Rs683bn by the end of the first quarter last year.
The power division reported that circular debt increased by more than Rs170bn due to inefficiencies and inadequate bill recovery by the Distribution Companies (Discos). However, this was significantly lower than the Rs239bn under the same account and period of the last fiscal year.

Power Division blames Rs79bn rise on inefficiencies, seasonal factors

The report showed that circular debt had increased by Rs73bn in the first quarter of last year, compared to Rs79bn this year. This was despite the fact that the finance ministry had disbursed Rs19bn in budgeted subsidies, compared to Rs28bn in unreleased subsidies during the same period last year. This was on top of Rs178bn in additional recoveries from consumers due to prior-year adjustments.
Excluding the above Rs198bn in additional funds from subsidies and prior-year adjustments, the circular debt would have increased by Rs276bn on account of Rs67bn in interest charges, Rs5bn in pending generation costs, Rs87bn due to distribution companies’ inefficiencies, and Rs84bn in under-recoveries.
The report claimed Rs229bn in receivables from K-Electric as of end-September 2025, including a principal amount of Rs42bn and about Rs187bn in markup.
 
 

The power division in a statement, however, tried to dispel the impression caused by its own report that an increase in circular debt by Rs79bn in the first quarter of the new fiscal year was a renewed upward trend, contrary to the government’s commitment to contain circular debt accumulation.
A Power Division spokesperson said the increase of Rs79bn in the first quarter “should be viewed in full context”. It said during the same quarter last year, circular debt had increased by Rs73bn, but by the end of that fiscal year, the overall stock of circular debt was reduced by Rs780bn. “The current quarterly rise is therefore attributable to seasonal and operational factors that typically influence monthly flows and are expected to reverse over the course of the year,” he said.
Importantly, Disco’s inefficiencies (losses and low recoveries) during July-September were reduced by Rs67bn to Rs171bn, compared to Rs239bn in the same period last year, underscoring the government’s firm commitment to improving operational performance and maintaining financial discipline in the power sector.
