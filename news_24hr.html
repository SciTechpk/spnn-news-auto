“The government has really destroyed all of us economically. I can simply say it has killed us,” deplores a shopkeeper while talking to Dawn on Thursday.
“The LDA officials brought heavy machinery early on Wednesday morning and started razing all shops — 152 in total. They didn’t even care for several innocent birds and animals that were also killed after being buried under debris,” he said.
According to another trader, the shopkeepers were constantly in contact with the LDA, DC office and others through their representatives. And the officers were in favour of giving compensation to the shopkeepers first and then demolish the structure. But in the wee hours of Wednesday, the teams entered the area and started demolishing shops without giving ample time to the shopkeepers to at least shift their precious birds worth millions to safe place.
According to a spokesman for LDA, the shops had been built unlawfully at 16-kanal state land that was included in the Bhati chowk remodeling project aiming to get rid of the constant traffic mess and increasing noise and dust pollution in the area. “There are no reports of birds killed during operation, as the shopkeepers had already taken out all of them and other goods from their shops. And if they have any solid proof, show us,” he added.

The announcement came after Trump said he had held a call with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.
“We will soon announce a signing ceremony to make it official, and there are many more countries trying to join this club of STRENGTH,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
 






The Kazakh government said in a statement that the matter was in the final stage of negotiations.
“Our anticipated accession to the Abraham Accords represents a natural and logical continuation of Kazakhstan’s foreign policy course grounded in dialogue, mutual respect, and regional stability,” it added.
Kazakhstan already has full diplomatic relations and economic ties with Israel, meaning the move would be largely symbolic, something Secretary of State Marco Rubio pushed back against on Thursday.
“It’s an enhanced relationship beyond just diplomatic relations,” he said.
“It is … with all the other countries that are part of the accord. You’re now creating a partnership that brings special and unique economic development on all sorts of issues that they can work on together.”
Trump met with Tokayev alongside four other Central Asian leaders from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan at the White House on Thursday as the US seeks to gain influence in a region long dominated by Russia and increasingly courted by China.
“Some of the countries represented here are going to be joining the Abraham Accords … and those announcements will be made over the next little while,” Trump said.
Witkoff returning for announcement
US special envoy Steve Witkoff said earlier at a business forum in Florida that he would be returning to Washington for the announcement, without naming the country.
Axios first reported that the country would be Kazakhstan.
A second source familiar with the matter said the United States hopes that Kazakhstan’s entry will help reinvigorate the Abraham Accords, the expansion of which has been on hold during the Gaza conflict.
Trump has repeatedly said he wants to expand the accords that he brokered during his first term in the White House.
The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain established ties with Israel in 2020 under the Trump-brokered Abraham Accords. Morocco established ties with Israel later the same year.
Trump has been upbeat about the prospects that regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia will finally join the accords since a ceasefire went into effect in Gaza last month, but Riyadh has shown no willingness to move ahead without at least a pathway to Palestinian statehood.
Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is expected to visit the White House on November 18.
Other Central Asian countries such as Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, both of which have close ties with Israel, have also been seen as potentially joining the Abraham Accords, which is considered a signature foreign policy achievement of Trump’s first term.</p><small>2025-11-07 04:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/690d59c086dc5.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953638/laws-and-rights-in-transition' target='_blank'><strong>Laws and rights in transition</strong></a><br><p>AS Martin Luther King once said, “An unjust law is no law at all.”
In recent years, Pakistan has witnessed constitutional changes and amendm­e­nts whose effects have rippled across the country, particularly in Balochistan.
These amendments have reshaped the structure of judicial authority and introduced laws that suppress fundamental rights under the guise of national security.
Every democratic state rests on the independence of its three pillars: legislature, executive and judiciary. But the 26th Constitutional Amendment disrupted this balance by directly interfering in the judiciary’s independence, effectively turning it into another arm of the executive.
This violates Article 175(3) of the Constitution, which states, “The judiciary shall be separated progressively from the executive”. Before the 26th Amendment, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan was composed mostly of judges: the chief justice of Pakistan (chairman), the four senior-most Supreme Court judges, a former Supreme Court judge nominated by the CJP, the federal law minister, the attorney general, and a senior advocate of the Supreme Court.
The 26th Amendment, however, amended Article 175(A), expanding the commission to include political members — two senators, two MNAs (one each from treasury and opposition), and a representative nominated by the Speaker. It also allowed the chief justice to be appointed from among the top three judges through a parliamentary committee.
These changes forced the judiciary to share its core function of appointing judges with political representatives, eroding its independence. The am­endment also curtailed the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers, while the new constitutional be­­n­­ch has since issued controversial rulings — permitting military trials of civilians, upholding jud­icial transfers, and denying PTI reserved seats.

Laws meant to uphold justice are being reshaped into instruments of control.

Last month, the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench heard petitions challenging the 26th Amendment. The matter is now fixed for hearing on Nov 10, when the court will decide whether the same bench will continue or a full court should be constituted to examine its legality.
While the legality of the 26th Amendment remains under challenge, the government is preparing to table the 27th constitutional amendment bill in the Senate. The proposed amendment seeks to create a federal constitutional court, effectively curtailing the Supreme Court’s powers and striking at the spirit of the 18th Amendment. If passed, there may be no constitutional bench left by the time the case resumes.
Ironically, the very bench constituted under the 26th Amendment is now tasked with examining its own legality. The judges had a chance to exercise damage control by referring the matter to a full court of judges appointed before the 26th Amendment — an act that could have restored public confidence. That opportunity was not taken. And now, before any formal order has been issued, the 27th amendment looms, threatening to fundamentally alter the judicial structure by introducing a parallel court system.
The erosion of judicial independence and the violation of fundamental rights did not stop there. This year, the Balochistan Assembly passed the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Act 2025, granting sweeping powers to law enforcement, including detention of individuals for up to 90 days without informing families or granting a fair trial. This di­­­rectly violates Article 10, which requires a deta­inee to be produced before a court within 24 hours.
The amendment raises a constitutional issue: the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 is a federal law — can a province amend it? Under Article 143, federal law prevails in case of conflict. The federal Act mandates that detainees be presented within 24 hours, while the provincial amendment allows 90-day detention, clearly violating constitutional protections. Similar amendments have now been introduced at the federal level, further expanding the state’s power to curtail individual liberty.
These measures also undermine the principle of the presumption of innocence. Across the wor­ld, individuals are presumed innocent until pro­ven guilty. But under these amendments, the people of Balochistan are treated as guilty by default, forced to prove innocence during detention.
Both the 26th and proposed 27th amendments and the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Act in Balochistan are unjust and unconstitutional. Both seek to institutionalise executive control by reducing the Supreme Court’s role as the final arbiter of constitutional interpretation. The Balochistan Bar Council, human rights groups, and international organisations such as Amnesty International and the UN have warned that these measures violate covenants like the ICCPR and undermine fundamental freedoms.
Recently, another anti-terrorism amendment act in Balochistan has been debated, though its text is yet to be published. From reported provisions, it appears even more draconian: a Grade-21 officer will have the power to choose judges for trials from names sent by the chief justice of the Balochistan High Court — giving final authority over judicial assignments to the executive.
It also introduces secrecy: judges, prosecutors, and lawyers will operate under codes rather than in open court. How can trials be considered fair when justice is hidden from public view? Such measures undermine the principle that ‘justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done’.
Together, the 26th and proposed 27th amendments and the provincial anti-terrorism amendments reveal a disturbing trend — weakening judicial authority and eroding constitutional protections. Laws meant to uphold justice are being reshaped into instruments of control, suppressing dissent and undermining democracy.
So where does this leave us? Are these laws meant to strengthen democracy, or are they shaping a system that bends under its own weight? Can a society call itself free when its courts answer to politics and its citizens can be silenced without trial?
Perhaps the deeper question is not about law at all, but about power: who truly holds it — the people, the Parliament, or the silence written into law?

• UN chief says corporate interests are leading the world to ruin
BELEM: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tore into nations for their failure to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, delivering a blistering critique as Brazil hosted world leaders for a summit ahead of the COP30 climate conference.
Speaking at a high-level summit, Mr Guterres said that too many political leaders had become “captive” to fossil fuel interests, while companies continued to profit from environmental destruction.
“Too many corporations are making record profits from climate devastation, with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress,” he said. “We can choose to lead — or be led to ruin.”
The summit opens at a stark moment. Scientists now expect the world to cross the 1.5C warming limit as early as 2030, a threshold long described as a line between severe climate disruption and irreversible harm. Yet governments still spend more than $1tn a year subsidising fossil fuels.
Outside the venue, indigenous communities sang and marched, urging delegates to protect the Amazon and other critical forests. A larger flotilla of indigenous leaders travelling down Amazon river routes was delayed and is expected to arrive next week.
Around 150 heads of state, regional leaders and international organisations are addressing the gathering on Thursday and Friday. But the leaders of the US, China, India and Russia — four of the world’s top polluting countries— are notably absent.
 
 

Only the European Union president is scheduled to attend, prompting some observers to suggest the summit may allow more candid exchanges in their absence.
Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the summit host, used the session to call for a “just transition” away from fossil fuels and the restoration of damaged ecosystems.
“We need a roadmap to undo deforestation, overcome fossil fuels and mobilise the resources needed for those aims,” he said.
Lula also warned that extremist political movements were undermining climate action for electoral advantage, trapping societies in outdated economic systems that fuel inequality and environmental collapse.
Calls for shared responsibility and financial fairness were echoed throughout the summit.
China’s vice premier, Ding Xuexiang, urged states to “strengthen solidarity” and maintain commitment to multilateral climate cooperation, while Britain’s Prince William described the moment as “pivotal in human history”, demanding courage and cooperation to safeguard the planet.
Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric, criticised the resurgence of climate denial, referencing a recent false claim by the US president at the UN that contradicted scientific consensus.
‘Second or third hottest year on record’
The summit coincided with a grim assessment from the UN’s weather and climate agency, warning that this year will likely be the second-or third-hottest ever recorded — part of more than a decade of extraordinary heat. Concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to hit record highs, “locking in” future warming.
Together, the developments “mean that it will be virtually impossible to limit global warming to 1.5C in the next few years without temporarily overshooting the Paris Agreement target”, WMO chief Celeste Saulo told leaders in Belem in northern Brazil.
The 2015 Paris climate accords aimed to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — and to 1.5C if possible.
Mr Guterres, on the other hand, underscored the urgency. Every year above the 1.5C threshold, he warned, would deepen inequality, damage economies and lead to irreversible losses in ecosystems.

Since we do not have any details, it is not clear what ‘taking back’ education means but we need to have clarity on what it should or should not mean.
Before the 18th Constitutional Amendment, education was a shared responsibility between the federation and the provinces. Will the 27th amendment take it back to sharing or will education be solely the centre’s domain?
Teacher recruitment, posting, transfer, teacher training and teacher management have always been a provincial subject. As have been school management and administration. Textbook publishing has also been a provincial subject. Examination boards are and have been under provincial governments as well, although there is a federal body that ensures compatibility across boards.
The only thing that was at the federation level, prior to the 18th Amendment, was the curriculum and this was devolved after the amendment’s passage. Will the 27th amendment take it back to the federal level?
 
 

It clearly does not make sense for the federation to be involved in teacher recruitment, posting, transfers, teacher training or teacher management. Punjab has some 400,000 teachers. A similar number must be there for all other provinces combined.
It is hard to manage teacher issues from even a provincial capital — our provinces are too large. We need to take teacher management to the local level. The principle should be that the decision-making should happen at the level where we have the information for the required decisions and where stakeholders impacted by the decision can have a say.

The curriculum has always been a thorn in the side of successive federal governments.

Similarly, school administration and management needs to be devolved to the local level too. I am pretty certain the federation has no interest in school management and administrative issues.
What it boils down to, of course, is the curriculum. This has been a thorn in the side of successive federal governments and deep state elements since independence and it continues to be one.
Historically, from a technical point of view, the federal government has always had a large or complete role in curriculum setting. And though the curriculum was devolved by the 18th Amendment, for many years the provinces continued to use the pre-18th Amendment curriculum since they did not have capacity for curriculum work. When they started getting ready for curriculum work, the federal government came up with the brilliant idea of the Single National Curriculum and most of the curriculum debate was taken up with the useless and damaging discussion about the benefits of having a single curriculum across the country. Though most provinces were ‘persuaded’ to go along with the SNC, some were quite reluctant and resisted it.
Clearly, it is not about the curriculum of science or mathematics that is the issue here. When have we heard the debate that provinces have diverged in what they teach in mathematics or science or that Punjab is teaching a different mathematics or science compared to Sindh? It is always about local culture and local languages and how they might impact the unitary identity that the federation has always wanted to impose and has imposed.
The federation fears local control over the curriculum might lead to changes that allow local languages and cultures to become so dissipative that our identity as Pakistani and Muslim may get threatened or diluted.
Is the 27th amendment an attempt to ensure there is no resistance to the idea of a single curriculum? Is it the continued game of ensuring that we shape young minds to have a particular religious and Pakistani identity? Have 76 years of these attempts taught us nothing? We introduced Islamiat and Pakistan Studies as compulsory subjects in the 1970s.
Have we started producing better Muslims and Pakistanis as a result? If we had, we would not keep insisting that we need to do more. We have now added Quranic studies and Islamiat topics in Urdu and English as well. But we are still not satisfied with the results.
 
 

What we are not willing to learn is that this is not the way to ensure a particular identity or address issues of personality formation. True, religion is important and has a place in the curriculum, but it need not be overwhelming and at the cost of local cultures, languages and traditions. The same is true of national identity.
In fact, local languages and cultures are the strength that allows stronger national and religious identities. The federation has looked at the issue of unity from the wrong lens and continues to make the same mistake. Having five or six national languages does not mean Urdu or English lose out.
Better education in local language at the start of a child’s academic journey will strengthen not only his or her language skills in the regional tongue but also help in learning other languages. And it will help in developing students’ cognitive abilities for other subjects and in general as well. Clearly, local cultures have to be part of our individual identity to have a full sense of belonging.
So, why the insistence on ‘taking back’ education? The federation, when it had education, did not do a stellar job. The provinces have not done much either but are no better or worse than when the federation had control. In principle, education should be devolved as much as possible.
Will the federation be able to do any better this time? Of course not. And if the interest is only in controlling the narrative on identity, culture, religion and language, how is that helpful for education or for Pakistan in general?

A new UN-OCHA report released on Thursday says the strategy, part of a broader support plan consolidated by the agency, will run through six months, ending in April next year, with activities based on findings from the Rapid Need Assessment (RNA).
The findings of the RNA were instrumental in identifying response and coverage gaps, and formed the basis for the district prioritisation of the current Support Plan for Relief and Early Recovery.
Following the assessment, the Punjab districts of Muzaffargarh, Multan, Khanewal, Jhang, and Bahawalpur were identified as high priority, while Bahawalnagar, Hafizabad, Okara, and Rahim Yar Khan were categorised as medium priority. Based on earlier but separate assessments in KP, the districts of Buner, Shangla, and Swat were prioritised, while in GB, Diamer and Ghizer were identified for this purpose.
Support plan
The support plan identifies the sector’s needs articulated in the RNA and the affected communities. It will be implemented through close coordination with the federal, provincial, and district governments.
 
 

As part of the support plan, $7.9 million in multipurpose cash assistance (MPC) will be distributed to support 1.2 million people, enabling vulnerable communities to meet their diverse needs in a flexible and dignified manner.
The MPC has been integrated across key sectors such as food security, agriculture, livelihoods, WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) project, shelter, and protection — providing both sector-specific and standalone support.
In an important sector like food security and livelihood, the response will adopt a dual-track approach. It will address immediate food and livelihood needs while laying the groundwork for early recovery and climate resilience.
The total funding requirement of the food security, agriculture and livelihoods sector to implement the above activities is $42.6m, of which $11.8m is required to provide relief and lifesaving assistance and $30.8m is required for early recovery.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Wednesday he would order steep cuts, citing air traffic control safety risks from the government shutdown.
The shutdown, now the longest in US history, has forced some 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 security screeners to work without pay, raising fear of travel disruptions during the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.
Staffing shortages have al­­rea­­dy caused tens of thousands of flight delays nationwide, with airlines estimating that 3.2 million travellers have been affected.
Industry sources said the first round of reductions, which cuts about four per cent of scheduled flights, will take effect as soon as Friday. The cuts will rise to five per cent on Saturday, six on Sun­day, and reach as much as 10pc next week if the shutdown persists.
Delta Air Lines said on Thursday it would begin reducing flights from Friday to comply with the directive, but expects to operate the vast majority of its schedule as planned, including all long-haul international services.
Holiday travel
Unless the government reopens, the drastic plan threatens to throw holiday plans into chaos for millions of Americans travelling for Thanksgiving, marking one of the most visible ripple effects yet from the record-long government shutdown.
“They (the airlines might) have some flexibility on prices, but if this shutdown goes on much longer, that should have a negative effect overall,” said David Morrison, a market analyst at Trade Nation, UK.
Airlines including United Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest were inundated with passenger queries on social media platforms like X, as flyers sought clarity on travel plans.
“Please, you and your fellow airlines — for Thanksgiving week — issue all cancellations at least a week in advance,” one X user urged in response to United’s post outlining flight reductions.
“Don’t make people wait to find out if they can fly home for the holiday.”
The reduction move aims to ease pressure on controllers, with the Federal Aviation Authority short about 3,500 staff and many working mandatory overtime and six-day weeks even before the shutdown.
“This is a fluid situation, but we believe the impact is more manageable than headlines imply,” Tom Fitzgerald, an aviation analyst, said.

The fund, conceived as a rapid response mechanism to deliver relief within days of a catastrophe, has instead become mired in the very red tape it was meant to bypass. With pledges of about $700 million — but only $300 million actually in hand — the FRLD is proving a hollow promise for nations like Pakistan that bear the brunt of a crisis they did little to cause.
As COP30 opens later this month in Belem, Pakistan plans to submit proposals worth up to $20m to the FRLD board despite deep misgivings.
 
 

Climate Minister Musadik Malik confirmed that the country has yet to receive a single dollar in support, even as it reels from the losses of recurring floods, droughts, and glacial melt.
Of the $300m available, half is reserved for Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries — leaving Pakistan and others to compete for a share of roughly $100-150m. The sums are negligible when measured against the billions in damage Pakistan suffered during the 2022 floods alone, or the continuing climate-related displacements now unfolding across its provinces and rural communities.
Civil society groups have condemned the fund’s structure as “slow, bureaucratic, and unfit for purpose”. Following the seventh board meeting in Manila last month, the ‘Fill the Fund’ campaign described the outcome as “a profound injustice”.
They note that the fund’s multi-month project cycle “betrays its core mandate” to deliver aid within 24-48 hours of a disaster. Even the World Bank’s interim hosting role has drawn criticism for reinforcing cumbersome procedures and adding layers of conditionality that obstruct direct access and transparency.
This inertia reflects a deeper North-South divide.
Wealthy nations insist on elaborate frameworks before disbursing funds; vulnerable countries demand quick, grant-based relief. As Pakistan’s climate minister put it, the Global North continues to “shift its burden” to developing economies while lecturing them on compliance. Meanwhile, climate victims wait in despair. The hypocrisy is glaring: those most responsible for the crisis remain reluctant to finance its fallout, even after the International Court of Justice affirmed that such support is a legal obligation, not charity.
At COP30, Pakistan and other climate-vulnerable states must renew pressure for a mechanism that delivers, not deliberates. The FRLD was not meant to be another showcase of bureaucratic caution or diplomatic posturing. Unless donor nations fill the fund and unblock its flow, the world’s ‘rapid response’ to loss and damage risks becoming yet another illusion — proof that even in the face of existential threat, justice can still drown in paperwork.

• Israeli forces kill teenager in occupied West Bank
CAIRO: Hamas fighters holed up in the Israeli-held Rafah area of Gaza would surrender their arms in exchange for passage to other areas of the enclave under a proposal to resolve an issue seen as a risk to the month-old truce, according to sources familiar with the talks.
Since the US-brokered ceasefire took effect in Gaza on Oct 10, the Rafah area has been the scene of two attacks on Israeli forces. Hamas has denied responsibility.
Egyptian mediators have proposed that, in exchange for safe passage, fighters still in Rafah surrender their arms to Egypt and give “details of tunnels” there so they can be destroyed, an Egyptian security official said.
Israel and Hamas have yet to accept mediators’ proposals, the sources said. They confirmed that talks on the issue were underway.
The Israeli prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accounts; Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza, declined to comment.
The attacks in Rafah left three Israeli soldiers dead. Subsequent Israeli strikes killed an unspecified number of Palestinians.
‘Unaware’ of ceasefire
The sources said the Hamas fighters in Rafah, which the group’s armed wing has said have been out of contact since March, might be unaware that a ceasefire was in place.
The ceasefire is the first part of President Donald Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict.
Hamas has released the last 20 living Israeli prisoners seized in the Oct 7, 2023, raid in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners; Israeli troops have withdrawn from western areas of Gaza, where Hamas remains in control.
Details of the next phase of Trump’s plan, which requires Hamas to disarm and give up control of Gaza, have yet to be agreed. The plan foresees Gaza being governed by a technocratic Palestinian committee with international supervision, and the deployment of an international force.
Since the ceasefire, Hamas has handed over the bodies of 22 of 28 deceased prisoners. Hamas has said the devastation in Gaza has made locating the bodies difficult. Israel has released to Gaza the bodies of 285 Palestinians.
Israeli forces kill teenager
The Palestinian health ministry said on Thursday that Israeli troops shot dead a teenager in the occupied West Bank.
The Ramallah-based ministry identified the 15-year-old as Murad Saifin, who had been killed late on Wednesday.
The ministry said the incident took place in the town of Al Yamun, west of Jenin.
Late on Wednesday the Israeli military said its troops had killed a militant in the area of Al Yamun.
In a separate incident, the Palestinian Authority reported the death of an elderly woman from a heart attack when Israeli forces raided her home on Thursday.
The PA’s media office identified the woman as Haniya Hanoun, and said she was pushed around by soldiers who had come to arrest her grandson in their home near Ramallah.
Violence in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, has soared since the conflict in Gaza broke out in Oct 2023.
One thousand Palestinians have been killed in the occupied territory by Israeli forces or settlers over the last two years.
During the same period, 43 Israelis have been killed in occupied West Bank.

They rarely make it into boardrooms or startup pitch decks.
Yet the Women in Tech event, funded by Standard Chartered, acknowledged these realities, which became the basis of new business ventures.
Starting with 86 applications in 2019, Women in Tech has now grown to 1,900 applications from over 100 cities across Pakistan. From these, 10 startups were selected for seed grants worth Rs 1 million each, along with a two-month mentorship programme through INNOVentures Global.
 
 

The top three winners this year were baby food brand Yumkins Foods by Hira Mubeen; Atfaal by Erum Sheheryar, which upcycles textile waste into kidswear; and Ootein by Maria Ameer, Pakistan’s first certified allergen-free food brand inspired by the founder’s own struggle with celiac disease.
The winners received scale-up grants of Rs5m, Rs3.5m, and Rs2m respectively, at an event held on Thursday.
The shortlisted 10 startups collectively generated close to Rs25m in verified revenue within two months. If they maintain this trajectory, these ventures are projected to deliver 3.3x annualised growth, reaching a total of Rs150m in revenue over the next year.
While that may seem like pocket change to the corporate sector, it’s important to remember that many of these ventures began at home with a woman simply solving a problem in her daily life.
 
 

Take, for example, the need to work from home. Childcare and household management are realities for most working mothers. And even with supportive environments, many corporations fall short.
Digital Superwomen’s founders realised that there is more scope in freelancing than in the corporate sector. The venture aims to address this by offering short online courses that can be managed with kids and provide basic skills that allow women to work from home and apply for jobs.
Another example is Lahore-based AZCode, a coworking space with a roughly 60 per cent female user base.
“Pakistan has one of the lowest rates of female workforce participation in the world. Women face unsafe workspaces, limited flexibility, and cultures that often silence their potential. Co-working spaces exist, but most offer only infrastructure — not inclusion,” says co-founder Asra Ameen.
“The more women are involved, the greater the multiplier impact,” said Nida Athar, CEO of INNOVentures.
Across these 10 startups, over 80pc of the teams are women, and more than 1,200 women have been engaged as suppliers, customers, and partners, she said.
From 2015 to 2021, local startups collectively raised $563m across 225 deals, but women-founded startups received only 1.4pc of that total, said Raeda Latif, country head of corporate affairs, brand and marketing at Standard Chartered.
“Since then, things have improved — women-led startups now represent roughly 10pc of the ecosystem,” she said.
As the principal country officer of the International Finance Corporation, Naz Khan pointed out that women’s entrepreneurship should not be treated as a side story; it should be seen as a driver of economic growth.
Studies have shown that 90pc of the income earned by women is reinvested into their families and communities, shaping generations to come.
Some areas identified as needing improvement among women-led businesses included digital bookkeeping, using analytics to track returns on spending, and developing the discipline to record every rupee.
Mentorship also emphasised distinguishing between personal and business expenses, and valuing one’s own time in monetary terms as part of the business investment</p><small>2025-11-07 03:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0708203761ee515.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953630/womens-public-role-realisation-of-long-denied-right-sc' target='_blank'><strong>Women’s public role realisation of long-denied right: SC</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Expounding on an earlier ruling, the Supreme Court on Thursday held that participation of women in the public sphere was not a benevolent concession, but a realisation of a right long denied.
“When women contribute across education, administration, policy, health, and justice, institutions draw upon a broader spectrum of experience, enhancing the quality, legitimacy and responsiveness of governance,” observed Justice Syed Man­soor Ali Shah while setting aside the Feb 14, 2024, order of the Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Service Tribunal, Peshawar.
In March this year, Justice Shah had ruled in a similar case that a woman’s legal rights, personhood and autonomy were neither erased by marriage nor should they depend on it.
On Thursday, he explained that women’s equal participation in public life was not simply a means to personal financial independence, but it was a structural driver of socio-economic development, good governance, and constitutional democracy.

Justice Shah calls on legislators, policymakers to stop enacting or interpreting laws in a manner that subordinates women to patriarchal or marital constructs

This has been recognised internationally through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and by comparative constitutional jurisprudence that advocates affirmative measures to correct gender imbalance in public services.
The dispute before a two-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Shah was whether marriage would disqualify a daughter from appointment under the quota reserved for children of civil servants who die or become incapacitated while in service.
The controversy pertains to petitioner Ms Farakh Naz, an employee of the KP education department, who was appointed in place of her mother after she retired from service on medical grounds in April 2022.
Ms Naz’s appointment order as a primary school teacher in Karak was withdrawn without any notice in 2023 after she got married. This termination was based on a clarification letter of February 2022, which stipulated that the benefit of appointment under the quota was not available to a female who has contracted marriage.
Further, an April 28, 2023, clarification provided that a married daughter may again be considered eligible for appointment if she has separated from her husband and is dependent on her parents. Aggrieved by her termination order, the petitioner filed a departmental appeal against the order, which was rejected in August 2023. Consequently, the petitioner preferred an appeal before the KP tribunal, challenging the impugned order, which was dismissed in February 2024.
 
 

In his 11-page verdict, Justice Shah asked legislators and policymakers to recognise women as autonomous individuals and refrain from enacting or interpreting laws in a manner that subordinates their personhood to patriarchal or marital constructs.
The exclusion or “othering” of women — particularly on the grounds of matrimony — constitutes a direct assault on their dignity and equality and denies them the fundamental rights that attach to their independent selves.
Terminations like that of the petitioner, resting upon patriarchal readings of the rule or policy, not only violate the identity and rights of women but also impoverish society and future generations, who are thereby deprived of the intellect, values, and perspectives that women uniquely bring to public life, the verdict explained.
Justice Shah observed that being married was not a disqualification that strips a woman of her personhood or her constitutional entitlements; marriage merely alters her legal status, not her fundamental rights.
A woman like a man is a “person” under the Constitution — and this constitutional status of her personhood remains undisturbed through marriage or divorce. The view that a daughter (and not the son) is always dependent upon her father and thereafter as a wife is always dependent upon her husband is constitutionally unsustainable.
Such a notion undermines her individuality and erodes her identity as a person in her own right, Justice Shah observed and cited Martha C. Nussbaum — an American philosopher — who had said: “A society that denies women equal opportunities for full human functioning denies itself justice.”

• Ruling elite has inflicted unprecedented harm on independence of judiciary, Akram Sheikh argues
ISLAMABAD: As speculations swirl around the controversial 27th Con­stitutional Amend­ment, legal experts have questioned the rationale behind such constitutional tweaks, especially after the previous 26th Amen­dment that had effectively brought the superior judiciary under the executive’s control.
The “final draft” of this Amendment has hitherto been kept under wraps, but its contours were recently shared by PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari when he said a prime minister-led delegation had sought the PPP’s support for its passage. In a statement, he said the proposal included setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, matters related to the transfer of judges, ending the protection of provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, and amending Article 243, which pertains to the command of the armed forces.
While some see it as a continuation of the 26th Amendment, a senior counsel questioned the reason behind such a move at a time when the government had not lost even a single constitutional case in the superior court.
“Not a single case pertaining to constitutional interpretations, be it the reserved seat case, judges transfer matter, military courts case, or matters relating to taxes, has ever been lost by the federal government after the passage of the 26th Amen­dment,” remarked the cou­nsel on condition of ano­nymity. Then what is the rationale behind stirring up the controversy at this juncture, he wondered.
Except for enhancing the retirement age limit from the existing 65 years, that too of ‘a few friends’, what the proposed constitutional court will be doing when the federal government has not lost a single major case from the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court.
The need to establish the Federal Constitutional Court is understandable, had Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah or Justice Munib Akhtar also been included in the CB. But when these judges are not part of the bench, then what is the purpose of establishing this court, he asked.
About speculations that the executive magistracy may be restored through the proposed Amendment, the counsel conceded that the judicial magistracy had failed to meet the expectations since it was common knowledge that they never resisted the remand of an accused in important cases. The reverting back to the executive magistracy will effectively be used to control the streets, he said.
Regarding the transfer of judges, he said that when the CB through a majority judgement has already empowered the government to transfer any high court to another high court, what more does the government intend to achieve?
Inevitable continuation
Meanwhile, former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar was of the view that the proposed 27th Amendment was the inevitable continuation of the 26th Amendment.
The executive wants to tighten its grip on the judiciary: granting unfettered power to transfer high court judges, a federal constitutional court as the ultimate guardian of the Constitution with its head chairing the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), thus playing a pivotal role in the appointment and ouster of judges and reducing the present Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) to an ineffectual position, he said.
The nation must brace itself for a long struggle against praetorian judges, the rollback of the independent judiciary, and the weight of the executive on the scales of justice, he feared.
According to former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Muhammad Akram Sheikh, the result of the general election on Feb 8, 2024, stunned the electors, monitoring agencies and the media beyond reproach.
The ruling elite then impose ‘PCO’ by giving an oath to willing judges while relieving others and thus nailing down the entire superior court. The regime inflicted unprecedented harm on the most paramount state organ of an independent judiciary, Akram Sheikh regretted, adding that the ruling elite decided to punish the Supreme Court in a manner not ever thought about by the respective military regimes.
Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani, considered to be one of the architects of the 18th Amendment, feared that in the brittle political situation prevalent in the country, the proposed tweaks would cast a shadow over the federation that may also help regain an extra nationalist narrative.
The proposed Amendment that deals with the question of bringing changes to the removal of protection for the share of provinces in the divisible pool through the National Finance Commission (NFC), as well as restoring the devolved ministries back to the federal government, amounts to the rollback of the 18th Amendment.
In Jan 2015, Mr Rabbani regretted after a vote on the 21st Amendment, which provided for military courts to try terrorists, stating he was ashamed of voting for the bill, although he did so in line with his party’s discipline.

• Taliban leader asks Afghan team to only make ‘realistic’ commitments
• Flare-up at Chaman-Spin Boldak looms over talks; at least two killed
ISLAMABAD: The third round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks opened in Istanbul on Thursday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested a shaky ceasefire.
Mediated by Turkiye and Qatar and held at the Conrad Hotel with restricted media access, the two-day round is focused on finalising a framework for a “monitoring and verification mechanism” agreed in principle last week, and on addressing long-standing disputes linked to militant sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.
Pakistan’s delegation is led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Asim Malik and includes senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials.
The Afghan Taliban side is headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and includes senior figures such as Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib.
The current dialogue process began after deadly clashes along the border last month — the worst since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul. Pakistan accused the Taliban of harbouring militants from Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), responsible for a series of cross-border attacks. The Taliban denied the accusations and accused Islamabad of airstrikes inside Afghan territory.
A ceasefire was brokered in Doha on Oct 19 through Qatari mediation, followed by two rounds of talks in Istanbul.
Before formal discussions resumed in Istanbul for the third round, Turkish and Qatari intelligence officials held separate consultations with both sides. The talks later continued in both direct and indirect formats.
A Pakistani official familiar with the delegation’s position said Islamabad’s demands remain “non-negotiable”.
“Pakistan’s position is clear,” the official said. “Our position is based on ground realities and solid information. We are seeking a verification mechanism to ensure that commitments made by Taliban representatives are kept. This includes the handover of all TTP leadership currently sheltered in Afghanistan.”
He added that the Pakistani delegation had proposed neutral, third-party observers to look into the presence of “terrorist groups” in Afghanistan and the action that is taken against them to prevent them from carrying out attacks in Pakistan.
“We have credible information that the (Afghan) Taliban regime is relocating TTP fighters within urban civilian populations,” he said. “This is a tactic designed to falsely portray any necessary action by Pakistan against TTP terrorists as an attack on civilians.”
According to Afghan sources, the Taliban delegation came to Istanbul with specific instructions from their leader, Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada. The Taliban chief reportedly told his negotiators to make only those commitments that could be realistically fulfilled and warned them against yielding to Pakistani demands.
Exchange of fire
Expectations for the Istanbul round were already modest, given the deep mistrust between the two sides and the little progress made in the previous two rounds. The situation worsened briefly on Thursday afternoon after two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing, threatening to derail the fragile dialogue.
Both sides accused the other of initiating the gunfire, though no casualties were reported. The incident, which lasted for a short time, came just hours after the opening session of talks in Istanbul.
“Afghan forces opened fire at Tasadaq and Iqbal Posts located along the Chaman border around 5pm, and Pakistani troops immediately retaliated and returned fire,” an official told Dawn.
He said the mortars landed in the Vesh Mandi area. However, he said it was a brief exchange of fire and no loss of life or property was reported.
An Afghan official in Spin Boldak told Chaman-based journalists that the incident was a result of a misunderstanding arising from celebratory fire at a marriage ceremony.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, however, disputed the account, accusing Pakistani forces of violating the truce.
“While the third round of negotiations with the Pakistani side had begun in Istanbul, unfortunately, this afternoon Pakistani forces once again opened fire on Spin Boldak, causing concern among the local population,” he said in a statement. “The Islamic emirate’s forces, out of respect for the negotiation team and to prevent civilian casualties, have so far shown no reaction.”
However, Pakistan rejected Mr Mujahid’s claim as “baseless”.
“We strongly reject claims circulated by the Afghan side regarding today’s incident at the Pak-Afghan border at Chaman,” the Information Ministry said. “Firing was initiated from the Afghan side, to which our security forces responded immediately in a measured and responsible manner.”
It added that the situation was brought under control, and the ceasefire remains intact.

• Diplomatic sources say draft lacks language necessary to fully empower Gaza force, Board of Peace
• Washington estimates ISF will be 20,000-strong, have two-year mandate
WASHINGTON: With the United Nations Security Council set to begin negotiations on a US-drafted resolution seeking endorsement of President Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, it looks increasingly likely that the mandate of a proposed international force may prove to be a major bone of contention.
On Thursday, the United States begun expert-level discussions on the resolution with representatives from key Arab and Muslim states.
It formally circulated the draft resolution to the 15 council members a day earlier, and officials claimed to have regional support from Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and the United Arab Emirates for the text.
On Wednesday, Michael Waltz, the US Representative at the United Nations, convened a meeting of all 10 elected members of the UN Security Council to “demonstrate regional support for the resolution to the UN Security Council on Gaza”.
Representatives of Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, the Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Somalia participated.
UN ambassadors from Egypt, Qatar, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, and the United Arab Emirates also attended the meeting.
The goal of the resolution, according to a statement, is to welcome the Board of Peace and auth­orise the International Stabi­lisation Force (ISF) outlined in President Trump’s 20-point plan.
Dawn reached out to Pakistan’s Foreign Office, but there was no official acknowledgement that Islamabad had received the draft, until the filing of this report.
Meanwhile, US outlet Axios reported that Ambassador Waltz also met Palestinian diplomats in New York to discuss the draft Security Council resolution.
A council resolution needs at least nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to be adopted.
Linguistic spin
According to diplomats privy to the draft, the language normally used when the Security Council wants strong action — like sending in a force — comes under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which gives it the legal authority to use coercive measures when it decides that a situation is a serious threat to international peace and security. The usual language to trigger Chapter VII, sources said, was to say that a situation is “a threat to international peace and security”. But the draft US resolution, according to insiders, says that “the situation in the Gaza Strip threatens the regional peace and the security of neighboring states”.
While this wording is very similar in meaning, the change seems deliberate: it leaves room for some countries to argue later that Chapter VII was not formally invoked, which could allow them to challenge or limit parts of the plan.
This distinction matters because the Board of Peace (BoP) proposed is meant to have wide-ranging powers to manage Gaza. If local authorities do not agree to this, the UN would need a Chapter VII mandate to give the BoP those powers legally. Otherwise, under international law, Gaza would still be considered occupied territory, the rules for which dictate that the occupying power cannot radically change how the territory is run.
Draft resolution
The draft resolution, seen by Reuters, calls for the ISF to “use all necessary measures” — language for force — to carry out its mandate. The ISF would be authorised to protect civilians and humanitarian aid operations, work to secure border areas with Israel, Egypt and a “newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force”.
The force would stabilise security in Gaza by “ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip”, something many in the Muslim bloc have misgivings about.
The official said the draft UN resolution gives the ISF authority to disarm Hamas, but that the US was still expecting Hamas to “live up to its end of the agreement” and give up its weapons. The senior US official said the ISF was shaping up to be around 20,000 troops.
While the US has ruled out sending US soldiers into the Gaza Strip, it has been speaking to Indonesia, the UAE, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Azerbaijan to contribute. Pakistan’s name has also cropped up in troop-contribution discussions, but Islamabad has yet to formally comment on these reports.
“We’ve been in steady contact with the potential troop contributors, and what they need in terms of a mandate, what type of language they need,” the US official told Reuters. “Almost all of the countries are looking to have some type of international mandate. The preferred is UN.” When asked when the draft text could be put to a vote, Reuters quoted a US official as saying: “The sooner that we move, the better. We’re looking at weeks, not months.
“Russia and China will certainly have their inputs, and we’ll take those as they come. But at the end of the day, I do not see those countries standing in the way and blocking what is probably the most promising plan for peace in a generation,” the official said.

The regulator conducted a public hearing for additional recovery worth Rs8.4 billion from all consumers over the coming three months — December to February 2026 — under quarterly tariff adjustment (QRA) for the first quarter (July-September) that would result in a per unit additional charge of about 50 paise per unit.
Since a previous negative QTA of about Rs1.80 per unit is expiring this month, the consumers would be paying a Rs2.30 per unit net higher cost in the December-February period.
 
 

Separately, Nepra called a public hearing on Nov 11 on another government directive for slashing power rates on incremental consumption by Rs11 per unit to Rs22.98 per unit for industrial and agricultural users to revive consumption that has plummeted by 14pc and 47pc, respectively.
Both revisions, upon approval, would apply across the country, including all distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric, under the government’s end-to-end national uniform tariff policy.

Power tariffs set to increase by Rs2.30 for users; govt pushes for Rs11 cut for incremental industrial, agricultural consumption

The public hearing was told that capacity charges had increased by Rs21.7bn in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, which was an alarming situation. However, the capacity charges were partly compensated by Rs13.3bn reduction in operation and maintenance costs, use of service charges and market operation fee and impact of technical losses in fuel costs, leaving a net additional financial burden of Rs8.4bn.
The hearing was also told that consumption in the July-September period increased by 1.5pc to 7pc in various Discos, while industrial consumption alone went up by 11 to 28pc, which was a good sign. All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) suggested that, in view of encouraging consumption patterns, the government should not impose fixed charges on net-metering consumers as demanded by some power companies.
 
 

Some industrial representatives said the consumers would get a net benefit Rs2.40 per unit through the proposed incentive package from the government because it would come into force only after 25pc increase in consumption. They said the incentive package was unfeasible given ambitious targets to become eligible for a discount, while there was no improvement in system losses and recoveries.
Nepra’s Member Technical Rafique A. Shaikh said the circular debt would not end unless recoveries improved and losses reduced, as evident from first quarter results showing Rs87bn increase in circular debt due to losses and Rs84bn due to lower recoveries.
On the other hand, the Power Division, in its petition for an incentive package for incremental consumption, the electricity demand across major consumer categories witnessed a noticeable contraction, reflecting broader macroeconomic adjustments, structural changes in consumption patterns, and increased adoption of alternative supply options such as net metering (6,035MW).
“The decline has been (particularly pronounced in the industrial and agricultural sectors, where consumption has reduced by 14pc and 47pc respectively”, it said, adding the demand reduction was leading to a vicious cycle where under-utilisation of system assets further increased the tariff due to under recovery of fixed cost.
It said the targeted incentive package in the past had worked well in stimulating demand and enhancing asset utilisation. The Industrial Support Package of November 2020-2023 helped increase industrial consumption by 14pc while Bijli Sahulat Package of December 2024-February 2025 recorded industrial growth of 6.9pc, 2.7pc and 10.2pc over three consecutive months.

• PTI says current govt lacks mandate to amend Constitution
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday held consultations with ruling allies to secure support for the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment, with the government expected to table the bill in the Senate within days.
The prime minister has also convened a meeting of the federal cabinet today (Friday), with the 27th Amendment topping the agenda. Sources said the amendment could be introduced in parliament after cabinet approval.
The premier is due to depart for Azerbaijan later in the day for a one-day official visit.
Some media reports suggested PM Shehbaz has decided to establish a parliamentary committee bringing all parties together to fine-tune the draft and seek consensus. However, there was no confirmation from the Prime Minister’s Office.
It has been learnt that all government allies, except the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), have assured conditional support, provided the 18th Amendment is not rolled back.
The PPP leadership, which met the prime minister earlier this week, reiterated at its Central Executive Committee meeting on Thursday that it would safeguard the 18th Amendment.
On the other hand, the government is said to be adamant about getting the 27th Amendment passed next week. The plan is to move the 27th Amendment first in the Senate and then in the National Assembly.
As constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority in both houses, winning over the PPP remains pivotal. The next two days are said to be quite crucial in this regard.
Meetings with ruling coalition
Meanwhile, a delegation of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) led by its convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui called on PM Shehbaz on Thursday.
A statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said “discussion and consultation took place on the proposed 27th Amendment” during the meeting.
The delegation also included Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, MNAs Dr Farooq Sattar, Jawed Hanif Khan, Syed Aminul Haque and Khawaja Izharul Hassan, the statement added.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and others also attended the meeting. They were also present in PM Shehbaz’s meetings with the delegations of the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) and Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q).
The IPP delegation was led by party president and Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan and Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, while the PML-Q team was led by Overseas Pakistanis Minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain, with Senator Kamil Ali Agha and MNAs Mohammad Ilyas Choudhary and Farukh Khan in attendance. The premier also held separate meetings with Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) chief Khalid Hussain Magsi, PML-Zia president Ijazul Haq, and an Awami National Party (ANP) delegation led by Senator Aimal Wali Khan.
In a separate development, MQM has presented its own version of additions to the 27th Amendment, calling for strong, autonomous local governments across the country, and has sought JUI-F’s support for constitutional protection of the system.
An MQM delegation led by Mr Siddiqui met JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman at his residence to present the amendment’s draft. MQM leader Mustafa Kamal said the party’s proposal aims to ensure powers and resources “reach the people’s doorsteps”, arguing that the current federal and provincial set-up “fails to deliver services effectively”.
The party said it would now await JUI-F’s formal response.
Meanwhile, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza confirmed that the MQM delegation had called on Maulana Fazlur Rehman and presented the draft amendment.
“The 27th Amendment relates to Article 140-A, which deals with local government powers,” he said. “We will review and study the draft carefully before giving our feedback,” he added.
PPP draws red line
Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Thursday drew a red line against any change to the provinces’ share under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, while indicating conditional support for limited amendments to Article 243 governing federal control of the armed forces.
Announcing decisions of the party’s Central Exe­cutive Committee (CEC) at Bilawal House late in the night, PPP Chairman Bil­awal Bhutto-Zardari said discussions on the government’s proposed constitutional changes would continue on Friday but stressed the PPP “can never compromise on the financial rights of the provinces”.
 






“The PPP rejects the proposal for constitutional protection of the provinces’ share,” he said, adding that the CEC had, however, authorised support for specific adjustments in Article 243.
“The government has proposed giving the Joint Chiefs a new designation, creating a new position for Strategic Command and a position of Field Marshal. Only this amendment the CEC has allowed me to support,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari added.
On the question of establishing a constitutional court, the PPP remained non-committal, saying further internal deliberation was required before arriving at any decision.
‘No roadblocks to amendment’
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday said there are no major roadblocks and impediments with respect to the 27th Amendment, according to a Dawn.com report.
Speaking to Geo News, the minister said consultations among political parties on the proposed amendment were taking place in a “positive environment” and that a broad consensus appeared to be emerging.
“The feeling I got during today’s (Thursday’s) meetings, in which different political parties were present … I got the feeling that there is no major roadblock or impediment,” he said.
“There was no need for any further discussions or debate. Ideas were shared in a positive environment, some of which were agreed upon.”
‘Govt lacks mandate’
Separately, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said the current parliament lacks the mandate and moral authority to amend the Constitution, arguing that such changes require a “genuine two-thirds majority”.
Speaking to the media at the Lahore High Court, he warned the proposed 27th Amendment would harm both the federation and the provinces, noting that the 18th Amendment had faced no provincial objections. He also pointed out that the fate of the 26th Amendment remains pending before the Supreme Court.
Mr Khan said an independent judiciary is essential to democracy and parliamentary sanctity and made clear the PTI would not support the government on the latest amendment.
Referring to the process adopted for the 26th Amendment, he said a committee had been formed, but “no draft ever surfaced”, adding that the PTI has resigned from that body.
He said the release of the party’s incarcerated founder Imran Khan would come “under the law, not through any deal”, and that no protest call had been given for November.
“We are working within the law for his release, and he is satisfied with the ongoing efforts,” Barrister Gohar said, dismissing rumours of foreign involvement.

According to the SBP, web portal InvestPak has been developed to digitise the process of investing in government papers for customers maintaining rupee accounts with banks, primary dealers (PDs) and microfinance banks (MFBs). 
Government securities are currently issued through auctions of Market Treasury Bills (MTBs) and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs). In addition, the government has recently begun raising funds through the stock market using Sukuk bonds. 
As of June 30, 2025, investment in government securities had reached Rs46.566 trillion. Scheduled banks held Rs38.7tr, or 83 per cent of the total, while corporates held Rs7.856tr, or 17pc. The inclusion of individual investors through InvestPak is expected to further increase investment in government papers and add to the government’s already substantial domestic borrowing. 

Individuals, corporates can now invest via InvestPak

The SBP said the portal enables customers of financial institutions (FIs) to digitally open Investor Portfolio of Sec­urities (IPS) accounts, place bids in primary auctions, and buy or sell securities in the secondary market — all without visiting a bank or financial institution. 
“All banks are mandated to facilitate their customers in registering on the portal. MFBs are also encouraged to help their customers register. All FIs must ensure high service standards and a smooth user experience,” the SBP said in a circular issued on Thursday. 
FIs have been granted access to the portal, which caters to both primary auctions and secondary market trading of government securities. They can also customise their treasury operations across front, middle, and back offices to align with the new system. 
All individuals, joint account holders, and corporates with rupee bank accounts are eligible to register digitally on the portal using their IBAN (International Bank Account Number). 
Customers who do not already hold an IPS account can request its opening through the portal when registering with their respective financial institution.
“The portal allows individuals and corporates to link and operate multiple rupee and IPS accounts across different FIs through a single registered account,” the SBP said. 
FIs are required to process each registration or onboarding request and communicate their decision to the customer within two working days.

“Mamdani would sit with me in the production room. He would always ask me, so who is affected by this one? Who pays the price?” Beyanga, The Daily Monitor’s media manager, told Reuters.
“He was always interested in how the big picture affects the everyday person,” Beyanga said.
The 34-year-old Mamdani’s resolutely progressive message, focused on lowering the cost of living and addressing inequalities through direct government interventions, propelled him to victory in an election on Tuesday that drew the highest turnout since 1969 in the most populous US city.
Young Mamdani lived ‘in a simple way’ despite privilege
The son of a Ugandan academic of Indian origins and an Indian-American filmmaker, Mamdani was born and spent several years as a child in Uganda’s capital Kampala, where the family lived in an affluent suburb near the shores of Lake Victoria.
He also spent stints in South Africa, India and the United States, where his father Mahmood teaches at Columbia University.
While his immediate surroundings in Kampala’s leafy Buziga neighbourhood bore little resemblance to the stark poverty of the city’s vast slums, mentors from his intern days said the 15-year-old Mamdani already had a fierce interest in questions of economic injustice rooted in his experiences in Uganda.

“Living in Uganda, where we have problems of inequality and corruption — that must have made an impression on him,” said Mark Namanya, who was a sports editor at The Daily Monitor.
Mamdani has acknowledged in the past that his upbringing was “privileged” and denied any tension between that and his leftist policy positions.
Beyanga said that during Mamdani’s internship, he would eat lunch at a makeshift canteen that served steamed plantains and maize meal porridge to the city’s working classes and liked to ride bodas, or motorbike taxis, around town.
“He liked life lived in a simple way, nothing exaggerated,” Beyanga said.
Mamdani had strong feelings on political subjects
Mamdani’s father had known hardship. In 1972, Mahmood Mamdani and his family were among tens of thousands of people of Asian descent whom Uganda’s dictator, Idi Amin, expelled from the country, accusing them of exploiting the economy.
Mahmood fled to Britain before returning to Uganda after Amin’s fall.
Despite his young age, Mamdani had strong feelings about major geopolitical topics, Beyanga and Namanya said. Namanya recalled one conversation about foreign aid, a subject at the centre of US political discussion this year following US President Donald Trump’s dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).
While liberals condemned the Trump administration’s moves to slash aid to poor countries, the young Mamdani had a sceptical view of foreign assistance rooted in leftist critiques of the system as benefiting donor countries at the expense of their purported beneficiaries, Namanya said.
“Zohran was the first person, which is odd because I was older than him, to explain to me how aid to African countries was a sham,” he said.

Hannington Muhumuza, a music producer who worked with Mamdani on the soundtrack of Queen of Katwe — a 2016 film by Mamdani’s mother Mira Nair about a girl living in a Kampala slum who becomes a successful chess player — said Mamdani knew the harsh reality of what life was like for many poor Ugandans.
“He has been to all the places, the ghettos, he knows how really life is and how really the average Ugandan is living,” Muhumuza told Reuters. “For him, it was always about… how can he uplift them. How can he be a part of their life and impact them in a positive way… That is something that I really noticed about him.”</p><small>2025-11-06 19:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06234111a03c8c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953530/tarar-sees-no-major-roadblocks-or-impediments-to-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Tarar sees no ‘major roadblocks or impediments’ to 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday said there are no major roadblocks and impediments with respect to the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held meetings with the delegations of multiple parties in what appeared to be efforts by the government to prepare the ground to get the 27th Constitutional Amendment approved by parliament. Tarar was present during these meetings.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, the minister said consultations among political parties on the proposed amendment were taking place in a “positive environment” and that a broad consensus appeared to be emerging.
“The feeling I got during today’s meetings, in which different political parties were present … I got the feeling that there is no major roadblock or impediment,” he said.
“There was no need for any further discussions or debate. Ideas were shared in a positive environment, some of which were agreed upon.”
The information minister added that the objective is “always to strengthen governance, defence and relations between the federation and the provinces”.
Tarar mainstained that he “looked forward” to the outcome of the PPP’s Central Executive Committee meeting, which was being held on Thursday night. “I feel that good ideas will emerge from that meeting,” he said.
The minister added that once the proposals are tabled in parliament, a joint committee comprising leaders of all parliamentary parties from both Houses would be formed to review them.
“The Constitution is a living document that can be updated in line with the country’s evolving needs,” he explained.
“The [idea of the] 27th Amendment was born from the 26th,” Tarar said, adding that debates on the idea of a constitutional court had been ongoing since around 2005, and based on the demands of lawyers, a constitutional bench had been formed.
The minister also “categorically” clarified that amid talks about the 27th Amendment, no one would be meddling with the 18th Amendment. He added that Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also previously assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the new legislation.
An ‘attack’ on the House
A day earlier, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, while speaking in the parliament, termed the proposed 27th amendment an “attack on the House” and said his party would continue to raise their voices against it.
“Whenever there is a constitutional amendment anywhere in the world, it happens with a consensus and amends things according to the country’s needs,” he had said.
The PTI chairman said the proposed amendment is “against the spirit of this House and the Constitution”, asserting that the country cannot have further division and urged that no amendments be presented that put more pressure on the courts.
Meanwhile, responding to some points raised by opposition members, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry called for bringing “negative and false propaganda” to a halt.
He assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th Amendment.
Chaudhry also denounced the attempts to make the proposed amendment controversial even before the official draft saw the light of day on the basis of assumptions and guesswork.</p><small>2025-11-06 19:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/062146067cf9bc2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953525/no-new-notification-needed-for-coas-5-year-term-says-state-minister' target='_blank'><strong>No new notification needed for COAS’ 5-year term, says state minister</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said on Thursday that there was no need for a notification to specify the army chief’s five-year term, as it was established in Section 8C [of the Pakistan Army Act].
“I do not think there is a need [for a notification] and the reason is the lawmaking we did, which specifies that [section] 8C, will be read in the same manner as it has always been part of this legislation and hence, it is five years,” said the state minister.
Section 8C of the Pakistan Army Act outlines the “retirement age and service limits prescribed for a general, under the rules and regulations made under this Act, shall not be applicable to the Chief of the Army Staff, during his tenure of appointment, reappointment or extension, subject to a maximum age of sixty-four (64) years. Throughout such tenure, the Chief of the Army Staff shall continue to serve as general in the Pakistan Army”.
In November 2024, the government passed six bills, including three related to the extension of the terms of armed services chiefs, amid deafening protests by the opposition. The three bills were The Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill, 2024, The Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill, 2024 and The Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, 2024.
The salient features of the bills stated that the tenure of all three services chiefs (chief of army staff, chief of air staff and chief of naval staff) will be five years, instead of three. The retirement age bar of 64 years (for generals, air chief marshals and admirals) won’t apply to these three functionaries and
extensions, re-appointments for these posts (if any) will also be for five years.
However, the tenure of chairman joint chiefs of staff remained unchanged, at
three years.
In an interview with Independent Urdu today, Barrister Malik said no new notification is required for the COAS’ 5-year term and the section has always been a part of legislation.
When asked his opinion on whether the government intends to keep the designations of field marshal and army chief separate, Malik pointed out that army chiefs are 4-star generals while the field marshal’s rank is a 5-star position.
“When there are ranks, other things are associated with them, and they should be considered as well,” he said.
When asked about the possibility of Pakistan becoming a part of the Gaza International Stabilisation Force, the state minister said a definitive answer at this time would be premature.
He highlighted that the foreign ministers of eight Muslim countries met in Istanbul and any announcement would be made accordingly. “My comment would be premature,” Barrister Malik said.
Field Marshal Asim Munir was appointed the army chief on November 29, 2022. He is the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army.
The government promoted the COAS to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his ‘strategic leadership and decisive role’ in defeating India during the war in May this year.</p><small>2025-11-06 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632428-ppp-cec-meeting-underway-to-discuss-proposed-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>27th Amendment: PPP CEC meeting rejects proposed amendments to NFC Award</strong></a><br><p>

Chasing 270, South Africa openers Lhuan-dre Pretorius and de Kock made a confident start, adding 81 in 11.5 overs. Pretorius, dropped by Mohammad Nawaz at deep square, raced to 46 off 40 balls with seven fours and a six before edging Mohammad Wasim to Rizwan.  De Kock reached his fifty off 55 balls and accelerated seamlessly.
De Kock anchored with poise and power for his 22nd ODI century, and Tony de Zorzi, whose aggressive 76 off 63 balls formed a match-winning 153-run partnership for the second wicket with the former after Pretorius had set the tone with 46.
De Zorzi shifted gears immediately upon arrival, smashing two sixes off Nawaz in the 23rd over. He fell in the 35th over after hitting nine fours and three sixes — chipping a leading edge to point off Faheem Ashraf.
De Kock brought up his hundred off 99 balls with a flick to midwicket, punishing loose deliveries with sixes off Faheem and Shaheen.
With captain Matthew Breetzke in support, he sealed the chase in the 41st over, guiding spinner  Saim Ayub to backward point for the winning single —South Africa’s joint-biggest win over Pakistan in Pakistan by wickets.
Earlier, Pakistan, electing to bat first under clear skies, staged a remarkable lower-order recovery to post 269 for 9 after a top-order collapse triggered by pacer Nandre Burger threatened to derail their innings.
Standout performances came from Saim, who anchored the early recovery with a composed 53, and Salman Ali Agha, whose patient 69 formed the backbone of the middle order before Nawaz delivered a match-turning 59, blending responsibility with aggression, while Faheem’s brisk 28 injected crucial momentum in the death overs.
The hosts suffered an early jolt when opener Fakhar Zaman gloved a sharp Burger bouncer to wicket-keeper de Kock for a three-ball duck. Babar Azam fell for 11, edging Burger to first slip, and Mohammad Rizwan lasted just four balls before being bowled for four. At 22 for 3 in the fifth over, Pakistan were reeling.
Saim and Salman steadied the ship with a 92-run stand for the fourth wicket. Saim played with composure for his 53 off 66 balls, including five fours and a six, before getting caught and bowled by pacer Corbin Bosch.
Salman anchored meanwhile, finding five boundaries before being yorked by Bosch in the 41st over.
Hussain Talat’s brief 10 ended caught off Nqabayomzi Peter’s leg-spin, leaving Pakistan at 131 for 5. Nawaz then turned the tide with a belligerent 59 off 59 balls — three fours and four sixes — lifting the scoring rate against the spinners.  Faheem chipped in with two sixes and as many fours, before falling to Burger.
The tail added 90 runs in the last 10 overs, with Nawaz’s late assault. Burger was the pick of the bowlers with 4-46, while Bosch took 2-58 and Peter 3-55.
The series decider will be played at the same venue on Saturday.</p><small>2025-11-06 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632419-russian-mps-due-next-week-to-bolster-relations' target='_blank'><strong>Russian MPs due next week to bolster relations</strong></a><br><p>

Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports on grounds of suspicion, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions follow Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s directive to crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives.
The development took place during a high-level meeting today presided over by the minister, in which he was briefed on such incidents. DG FIA Mukhtar, officials Ministry of the Overseas Pakistanis, and a delegation from the Pakistan Overseas Employment Promoters Association were also in attendance.
DG FIA Mukhtar informed the meeting participants that incidents of workers being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.
“If any FIA officials are found involved, strict action will be taken against them.”
While addressing the participants, Minister Hussain pointed out that workers were offloaded at different airports despite having work visas and protection certificates.
“Pakistanis going abroad for employment are highly respected by us, and no one will be allowed to unlawfully stop workers at airports,” the minister said, per the statement.
Overseas Pakistanis, he said, send foreign remittances to Pakistan, which drives the national economy.
The minister directed the DG FIA to immediately resolve the issue and instructed that no work visa holders be offloaded at airports in the future.
Per the statement, no new conditions have been imposed by the FIA for those travelling abroad on work visas, nor has any new requirement been introduced for obtaining an affidavit from a government officer.
A new digital system will soon be introduced, through which workers can complete their immigration online before departure.
Federal Minister Hussain stated that to prevent such incidents in the future, the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and FIA officials were preparing standard operating procedures (SOPs).
In December of last year, four Pakis­tani citizens were among those killed in migrant shipwrecks off the coast of Greece, as confirmed by the Foreign Office.
A high-level committee was formed to examine the tragedy, overseen by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. In January of this year, the former FIA DG, Ahmed Ishaque Jehangir, was removed from his position and Mukhtar appointed to replace him in early April.</p><small>2025-11-06 16:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632413-pakistan-rejects-afghanistans-claim-over-chaman-border-clash' target='_blank'><strong>'Ceasefire remains intact', says Pakistan after Afghan firing at Chaman border</strong></a><br><p>

Afridi has been seeking a meeting with the former premier, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, since he was sworn in as the KP CM on October 15. He has been denied access to the PTI founder at least four times since then, despite the IHC’s directives to implement its March order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for Imran.
Addressing reporters outside the prison, CM Afridi lamented that he was unable to meet the party founder and the chief justice of the IHC, the latter of whom he had waited 90 minutes to meet before leaving empty-handed.
“As you all know, there have been continuous efforts through constitutional and legal means; this is the fifth time,” he said, referring to how frequently he was denied a meeting with the PTI founder.
“After waiting for an hour and a half, we couldn’t meet the IHC chief justice, so we came here. I was again denied permission for a meeting [with Imran]. You are seeing this system in place, which was exposed by my leader, Imran Khan.”
He said that people with “clouded judgment” levelled allegations that the PTI was trying to incite and protest, but stated that he has “continuously tried to remove the fog clouding their judgment”.
“Some people have become more powerful than institutions, because people are telling us they cannot do anything unless they receive orders from the top,” CM Afridi said, adding that he did not know who was issuing the orders.
 






The PTI earlier staged a protest outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) over the multiple denials of CM Afridi’s jail meeting with Imran. The KP CM reached the IHC for “legal proceedings”, after which he would head to the Adiala jail to meet Imran, the PTI said on X.
 






The move comes a day after the PTI parliamentary party unanimously passed a resolution calling for the arrangement of a meeting between Afridi and Imran. The PTI members urged both the federal and the Punjab governments to implement the IHC in letter and spirit.
Speaking to reporters outside the court today, CM Afridi said he would “avail all legal and constitutional paths” to secure a meeting with Imran. The PTI leader has the option to file a petition against the Adiala jail administration for contempt of court proceedings — a move he has warned of previously.
The chief minister said he came to the IHC to meet Chief Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and to discuss the fixation of some cases for hearing. “Our cases are not being fixed,” he claimed.
“I have not been allowed to meet the PTI founder despite court orders,” the KP CM said, asserting that the Constitution guaranteed him the right to protest. “Only the courts can tell who is pressuring them,” he added.
On the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, the PTI leader wondered “whether the government itself has seen its draft or not”.
 






Meanwhile, PTI parliamentarians and leaders also staged a protest outside the IHC.
They chanted various slogans, including “One state, two constitutions unacceptable”, “Make the judiciary independent/free the judiciary”, and “Free Imran Khan”.
 






Videos showed PTI leaders gathered at at least two spots, with one group also chanting slogans against the proposed 27th Amendment.
 






Pictures shared by the PTI’s KP chapter showed huge crowds of party workers welcoming the chief minister upon his arrival at the IHC.
Meeting denials
A day after he took the oath as the chief minister on October 15, Afridi secured protective bail from the Peshawar High Court (PHC) till November 18 and went to Adiala to meet Imran, but failed to do so despite a two-hour wait.
CM Afridi had also filed a separate plea in the IHC seeking permission to meet Imran, on which notices were issued to Adiala jail’s Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum and others.
Then, on October 23, after the IHC ordered the jail superintendent to implement the twice-a-week meeting schedule, Afridi headed to Adiala jail but could not meet the imprisoned ex-premier again.
 
 

The KP CM then visited Rawalpindi on October 28 but was denied access to Imran for the third time, compelling the PTI founder to issue directives that Afridi pick his KP cabinet.
Afridi again was not able to meet Imran on October 30, marking the fourth such occurrence, following which he finally named his provincial cabinet.</p><small>2025-11-06 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061932481f4fd76.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953524/fo-dismisses-indian-reports-on-hindus-denial-of-entry-on-religious-ground' target='_blank'><strong>FO dismisses Indian reports on Hindus’ denial of entry on religious ground</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday rejected “unfounded and misleading” allegations that members of the Hindu community were denied entry into the country on religious grounds, clarifying the action was “purely administrative” and consistent with Islamabad’s sovereign right to regulate entry into its territory.
Earlier this week, Pakistan welcomed Sikh pilgrims from India, with over 2,000 pilgrims granted visas to attend a 10-day festival marking the 556th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, founder of the Sikh faith.
However, Indian media claimed yesterday that an Indian national and six family members were reportedly denied entry into Pakistan, with officials allegedly citing their Hindu faith as the reason for refusal.
In a statement today, FO said that these claims are “entirely baseless and represent yet another attempt to distort facts and politicise a matter that was purely administrative in nature”.
 






“High Commission for Pakistan, New Delhi, had issued over 2,400 visas to Sikh pilgrims from India to participate in the celebrations marking the birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak Dev Ji from November 4 to 13,” FO’s statement noted.
“On November 4, a total of 1,932 pilgrims successfully crossed into Pakistan through the Attari-Wagah border,” the statement highlighted. “It is pertinent to note that approximately 300 visa holders were prevented by the Indian authorities from crossing over. The entire immigration process on the Pakistani side was smooth, orderly, and free of any hindrance.”
It added that a very small number of individuals were “found to possess incomplete documentation and were unable to provide satisfactory responses to immigration authorities”.
Consequently, the statement noted, “they were requested to return to the Indian side in accordance with standard procedures”.
“To suggest that these individuals were denied entry on religious grounds is completely incorrect and mischievous,” according to FO.
“Pakistan has always welcomed pilgrims of all faiths to visit its sacred religious sites under a well-established and facilitative framework. The action taken was purely administrative, consistent with Pakistan’s sovereign right to regulate entry into its territory,” said FO, adding that any attempt to give this issue a communal or political colour is not only regrettable but “also reflective of the prejudiced mindset that increasingly dominates the Indian government and media narratives”.</p><small>2025-11-06 15:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632404-political-leaders-rally-in-full-swing-as-govt-pushes-for-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Political leaders rally in full swing as govt pushes for 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafiz confirmed the development to Dawn. The national flag carrier also issued two dismissal notices to the engineers, copies of which are available with Dawn.
Abdullah’s role was stated as an aircraft engineer (PG-VI), while Awais was an aircraft engineer (PG-VIII).
The dismissal letters said that notices were issued to the SAEP president for conducting a press conference without prior authorisation and for disclosing official information to the media, and to the SAEP secretary general, for the unauthorised disclosure of confidential operational information and PIA images.
“In order to enquire into the allegations/charges communicated to you via the aforesaid showcause notice, an enquiry was conducted wherein you failed to participate despite providing ample opportunities to appear and defend your case,” the notices said.
“After examining the available evidence and statements of prosecution witnesses, the enquiry committee found you guilty of the charges levelled against you,” they added. They further said that both the SAEP officials were provided two opportunities to appear before the chief executive officer, but failed to do so.
“Keeping in view your entire disciplinary case, the management has decided to dismiss you from the service of Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited,” the notices said, adding that these dismissals would go into effect immediately.
 
 

The dismissals come amid an ongoing tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP, with the protesting engineers refusing to issue clearance certificates to aircraft — a move that has disrupted flight operations in recent days.
The engineers have been protesting for two-and-a-half mont­­hs, seeking pay hikes among other demands, according to SAEP officials.
While the PIA has claimed that the engineers are on “strike”, the SAEP maintains that its engineers were on duty but were not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks.
Earlier, the PIA spokesperson had highlighted that the Essential Services Act was in force in PIA under which strikes or abandonment of work was a legal offence. “All elements involved in or supporting such actions as part of a conspiracy will face legal action,” he had warned.
For his part, Awais Jadoon had earlier said that the two officers were on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances.”
He had also clarified that the engineers were not on strike and said that they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying.
In response to a question about a meeting with the PIA management, he had said that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them.
Meanwhile, the PIA has alleged that the engineer’s protest is aimed at sabotaging the national flag carrier’s privatisation.
Flight disruptions
The matter came into the spotlight when hund­reds of air travellers were reported to have been stranded at three major airports on Monday night due to the aircraft engineers’ protest, which delayed at least six flights of the national flag carrier.
Similar delays have been reported at nearly all major airports in the country during the last two months.
On Tuesday, the PIA claimed to have restored flight operations through alternative arrangements. A PIA spokesperson said that the management had used alternative means and worked overnight to restore operations, mitigating the impact of already delayed flights on subsequent operations.
Yesterday, too, the PIA said it had managed to “partially restore its flight operations”.</p><small>2025-11-06 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061801444a84dbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953515/federal-govt-accepts-ptis-invitation-to-kp-peace-jirga' target='_blank'><strong>Federal govt accepts PTI’s invitation to KP peace jirga</strong></a><br><p>Federal Minister for Frontier Affairs Amir Muqam announced on Thursday that the federal government would take part in the upcoming peace jirga called by the PTI.
The announcement was made as Muqam held a joint press conference alongside PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser in Islamabad.
Earlier this week, the PTI decided to convene a peace jirga in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly (KPA) on November 12 to discuss the volatile law and order situation in the province.
“We have conveyed our requests to the federal government and are grateful that they accepted our invitation,” Qaiser said while jointly addressing reporters after the meeting.
“We have come together and we know what policy we want. Whatever it is, the province’s people and leadership need to come together to create a concerted plan of action,” he added.
In response to a question, Muqam said that the PTI presented “the reason why we are here” and that the government accepted it.
“They said they wanted peace and that we are all one,” he added.
Meanwhile, Qaiser wrote a post on X announcing that a delegation he led also met with National Awami Party Chairman Aftab Sherpao today.
“The delegation invited Aftab Ahmad Sherpao to attend the peace jirga organised by the KP provincial government on November 12,” he wrote.
 






In another post, Qaiser wrote that Sherpao was an “important leader of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and has also served as chief minister”.
“We desire that he inform the provincial government of his views and experiences. Peace and security are our common issues, which transcend politics,” Qaiser wrote.
 






ANP to hold ‘consultations’ before accepting jirga invitation
President of the ANP’s KP chapter, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said that he will hold consultations and then inform the PTI and the press about accepting the invitation to the peace jirga.
He made these remarks at a joint press conference flanked by PTI leader and Adviser to the KP chief minister, Shafiullah Jan.
“The jirga we held was successful and we formed an organising committee with all political parties,” he said in response to a question. “To look after it, we implemented a procedure.
“When we called an All-Parties Conference, we made a decision, and the ANP called another conference in Islamabad,” he added. “After the floods, we decided to suspend that decision under the situation improved.”

Hussain said that there has been no contact with some parties, adding that ANP President Aimal Wali Khan told KP CM Afridi that the party would only make a decision after consultations.
“We are grateful for their (the PTI) invitation and we will reply once we have had consultations,” he stated. “You will find out who is going [to the jirga].”
The PTI’s KP Secretary General, Ali Asghar Khan, took the floor and said that the previous jirga was called by the chief minister, and the party had reservations about being part of a jirga with the federal government.
“This time, the jirga has been called by the [KP] speaker,” he stated. “He formed a committee and will hold meetings with parliamentarians from all parties. He has done so because we, as a party, have come to extend the speaker’s invitation and to ask that you positively respond.”</p><small>2025-11-06 13:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061729307bc7522.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953492/british-army-chief-meets-coas-munir-both-discuss-enhancing-bilateral-defence-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>British army chief meets COAS Munir; both discuss enhancing bilateral defence cooperation</strong></a><br><p>The British Army’s Chief of the General Staff (CGS) Gen Sir Charles Roland Vincent Walker on Thursday met Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir in Rawalpindi, where the two discussed boosting bilateral defence cooperation.
The meeting between the army chiefs took place at the General Headquarters (GHQ), a press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
“During the meeting, matters of mutual interest, regional security and measures to further enhance bilateral defence cooperation were discussed,” it said.
“Both sides reiterated the need for continued collaboration to ensure peace and stability in the region,” the military’s media affairs wing added.

Gen Walker “appreciated Pakistan Army’s achievements and sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and its efforts for regional peace and stability”, according to the ISPR.
Upon his arrival at the GHQ, the British CGS laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-i-Shuhada to pay homage to the martyrs. He was presented with a guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army.
 






The field marshal’s meeting today comes about two weeks after his visit to Egypt, where he held discussions with the Egyptian Armed Forces’ Chief of Staff Lt Gen Ahmed Khalifa Fatehi and Minister of Defence and Defence Production Gen Abdul Maged Saqar.
COAS Munir had last met with Gen Walker during his five-day official visit to the United Kingdom in February, where he attended and delivered a keynote address at the annual 7th Regional Stabilisation Conference at the Royal Military Academy in Sandh­urst.
During his visit, the army chief had also engaged with the UK’s then-chief of defence staff Admiral Toney Radikin and National Security Adv­i­ser Jonathan Nicholas Powell, and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss shared security challenges and the importance of enhanced collaboration between the two nations.
 
 

In May 2024, then-CGS Gen Sir Patrick Sanders had paid a visit to Pakistan, where he met COAS Munir, with Gen Walker present as well as the CGS-designate. Gen Sanders had also addressed the sixth Pakistan-UK Regional Stabilisation Conference at Islamabad’s National Defence University.
COAS Munir and then-CGS Gen Sanders had also met in May 2023 as the latter visited Rawalpindi, where he acknowledged the Pakistan Army’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism.
CJCSC vows to boost defence cooperation with Brunei
Separately, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has held meetings with the sultan of Brunei Darussalam and other officials during an official visit to the country, expressing the commitment to “further strengthen military-to-military ties and defence cooperation”, the ISPR said today.

According to the ISPR, apart from meeting the sultan of Brunei, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah Ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar ‘Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddien, General Shamshad also held meetings with  Yang Berhormat Pehin Datu Lailaraja Major General (Retired) Dato Paduka Seri Awang Haji Halbi bin Haji Mohd Yussof, Brunei’s minister at the PM’s office and minister of defence-II, as well as Major General Dato Paduka Seri Haji Muhammad Haszaimi bin Bol Hassan, commander of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.
During the meetings, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional security environment in the meetings, the ISPR statement said, adding that the CJCSC “underscored Pakistan’s cordial relations with Brunei Darussalam and expressed his commitment to further strengthen military-to-military ties and defence cooperation”.
The CJCSC also visited the ship KDB Darulaman at Muara Naval Base and the Defence Academy of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.
At the defence academy, he “delivered a talk on ‘Pakistan’s contributions to regional peace and stability’ and interacted with the students of command and staff course, including officers from 19 foreign countries”.
According to the ISPR statement, the sultan and civil-military leadership of Brunei Darussalam “appreciated [the] high professional standards of Pakistan’s armed forces and their achievements and sacrifices in [the] fight against terrorism”.
The statement also said that upon his arrival at the Royal Brunei Armed Forces headquarters, “a smartly turned-out military contingent presented a ‘Guard of Honour’” to the CJCSC.
The CJCSC’s Brunei’s visit comes roughly around a week after his trip to Bangladesh, where he called on Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman at Army Headquarters in Dhaka. The two leaders expressed appreciation for the “positive trajectory” of growing defence cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh during the meeting, the ISPR said.
During the visit, the CJCSC also met with Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Mohammad Nazmul Hassan, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan and Principal Staff Officer (PSO) of the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen S.M.

Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday. The talks are expected to continue for two days.
In this round, Pakistan’s delegation is being led by Lt Gen Asim Malik, director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence, and includes senior officials from the military, intelligence agencies, and the Foreign Office.
The Afghan Taliban’s delegation, meanwhile, includes General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq, Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani, Qahar Balkhi, Zakir Jalali and Afghanistan’s chargé d’affaires in Ankara.
Focus of the talks
A joint statement was released by the Turkish foreign ministry following the last round of talks between the two sides. It said that “all parties have agreed on continuation of ceasefire” and “to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and impose a penalty on the violating party”.
The communique further stated that “the principals” from both sides would reconvene in Istanbul on November 6 to discuss implementation.
Earlier, a diplomat from one of the mediating countries said while speaking to Dawn on the condition of anonymity that the two sides will review the implementation of the commitments reached during the previous round of talks and attempt to finalise the modalities for the monitoring and verification mechanism agreed in principle last week.
Meanwhile, officials in both Islamabad and Kabul have kept expectations low about the upcoming dialogue.
Pakistani military and intelligence officials have stated that Islamabad’s position remains unchanged, that Afghan soil must not be used for terrorism against Pakistan — a longstanding demand of Islamabad.
“The Pakistan military and intelligence service have a single-point agenda — the end of terrorism,” military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said earlier this week.
Another security official, speaking on anonymity, said while speaking to Dawn that Islamabad seeks “concrete, verifiable guarantees”.
From borders clashes to talks
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on Oct 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
The information minister had said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by India-abetted“ terrorists.
“The Afghan Taliban regime has been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar had stated.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6 (today).</p><small>2025-11-06 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632356-sindh-launches-student-attendance-system-to-enhance-school-management' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh launches student attendance system to enhance school management</strong></a><br><p>
