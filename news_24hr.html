Islamabad is boosting its military capabilities following its recent military confict with India, increasing defence budget by 20 per cent for the fiscal year 2025-2026.
“On this occasion, today, I announce the formation of the Army Rocket Force Command,” the prime minister said while addressing a special ceremony held at Islamabad’s Jinnah Sports Stadium on late Wednesday night to celebrate Pakistan’s 79th Independence Day and Marka-i-Haq.
Marka-i-Haq (Battle of Truth) is a term the state uses for the recent conflict with India, when Pakistan responded to Indian aggression following the April 22 Pahalgam attack, before a ceasefire was reached on May 10.
“Equipped with modern technology and capable of targeting the enemy from every direction, this force will prove another milestone in further strengthening our conventional war capabilities,” PM Shehbaz said.
 






Pakistan has sophisticated missile capabilities, some of which it deployed in May alongside J-10C Vigorous Dragon and JF-17 Thunder fighter jets.
“After the recent conflict, the object of course is to further strengthen Pakistan’s military capability and this is a part of that process,” defence analyst Talat Masood, a former general, told AFP.
The high-profile event last night featured a countdown to midnight and culminated in a spectacular fireworks display as the national anthem was played.
It was attended by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, President Asif Ali Zardari, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, federal and state ministers, and diplomats.
Parades were taken out by the different branches of the armed forces, while military personnel from Turkiye and Azerbaijan also featured in the parade. Pakistan Air Force Falcons also performed a fly past over the venue.
During his address, the premier highlighted that the recent military conflict with India concluded with Pakistan’s decisive victory “within three to four days”.
“India forgot that wars are not won with weapons alone, but with the spirit of the nation,” he said, adding that the defeat taught India a lesson it will never forget.
 
 

PM Shehbaz hailed the post-conflict period as the “birth of a new Pakistan” and called COAS Munir a “son of the nation”, whose strategy led to a decisive military victory.
The prime minister also unveiled the digital model of the Marka-i-Haq Monument.
He praised the leadership of COAS Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad, and PAF Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber for their coordinated and swift response to Indian aggression.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.
During his address, the premier also paid homage to the pioneers of Pakistan’s atomic programme, especially ex-president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, along with other politicians, scientists, and the armed forces, for making Pakistan the seventh atomic power of the world.
He also commended then-PM Nawaz Sharif, his brother and PML-N president, for resisting international pressure in 1998 and taking the brave decision to go ahead with the nuclear tests in Balochistan’s Chagai.
“Our nuclear arsenal is not for aggression. It is only for defence purposes,” the prime minister stressed.
 
 

The premier also unveiled the digital model of the Marka-i-Haq Monument.
In another highlight of the event, PM Shehbaz invited all political parties to become part of ‘Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan’, to lay the basis for the greater national interest.
He underscored the need for the pact so the whole world could see that “differences have their own place, but we are all one for the sake of our beloved Pakistan”.

In July, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said this year’s Independence Day would be marked as “Marka-i-Haq”. The term is used by the state to name the conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the end of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos with a ceasefire on May 10.
In an earlier message today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari said the day served as a reminder of courage, unity, and sacrifices that led to the creation of Pakistan and paid homage to the founding father Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the workers of the Pakistan Movement for their struggle and sacrifices.
The awards, including both wartime and peacetime honours, were conferred by President Zardari and PM Shehbaz during a ceremony at the Presidency in Islamabad. Awards were conferred upon senior military and civilian officials, members of the PM’s war cabinet, as well as the delegation that presented Pakistan’s case to the world in the wake of the military confrontation with India.
According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), eight Sitara-i-Jurat (Star of Courage), five Tamgha-i-Jurat (Medal of Courage), 24 Sitara-i-Basalat (Star of Valour), 45 Tamgha-i-Basalat (Medal of Valour), 146 Imtiazi Asnad (mentioned in the Dispatches of senior commanders), 259 COAS Commendation Cards and one Tamgha-i-Imtiaz (Military) (Medal of Excellence) were awarded to both officers and enlisted men.
Field Marshal Asim Munir was presented with the Hilal-i-Jurat (Crescent of Courage), Pakistan’s second-highest wartime gallantry medal.
“During a difficult time, he was engaged in a battle with India from April 22 till May 10, leading the war effort,” according to the citation. “In light of your unquestionable courage, military prowess, firm belief and unshakeable patriotism, the president awards you the Hilal-i-Jurat.”

“You brought the air force’s motto, ‘second to none’ to reality,” the citation read. “The president awards you the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for your unshakeable courage, military prowess and undefeatable patriotism.”
Naval Chief Admiral Naveed Ashraf was also awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “making Pakistan’s naval defence a reality and forcing the Indian Navy to withdraw.
“For your service in Pakistan’s naval defence, you are awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz.”

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz — Pakistan’s highest civilian honour — for “exposing India’s one-sided diplomatic attacks on the international stage and presenting Pakistan’s stance to the world to ensure regional peace”.

According to state broadcaster PTV News, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif was also awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for his “exceptional leadership and strategic contributions during the recent India-Pakistan war and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”.
 






The broadcaster also reported that Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “effectively and successfully presenting the national narrative on an international level during the recent Pakistan-India tensions.
“During the tense situation between Pakistan and India, Attaullah Tarar ensured complete coordination in the dissemination of information by civil and military institutions, successfully countering India’s propaganda and powerfully highlighting Pakistan’s stance on international forums,” PTV News wrote in a post on X.
 






Similarly, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “using legal means to serve the nation and challenge the illegal suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, as well as the illegal killing of Pakistanis”, while Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi was presented the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “ensuring national unity and keeping the peace in the face of intense attacks on civilians”.
Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was presented the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for leading the delegation that travelled to New York, London and Brussels to present Pakistan’s stance at international fora.
The delegation members — Dr Musadik Malik, Senator Sherry Rehman, Khurram Dastigir, Senator Sherry Rehman, Hina Rabbani Khar, Senator Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janua and Jalil Abbas Jilani — were all awarded the Hilal-i-Imtiaz (Crescent of Excellence).

Chehlum, also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic), marks the 40th day of mourning for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). It is marked by processions by Shia Muslims across the country.
Karachi’s Additional Inspector General (IG) Javed Alam Javed said in a statement that 7,465 police officers and personnel will be deployed for security duty at 108 processions, 2,901 at 501 majalis, and 1,113 at 642 imambargahs on Chehlum, for a total deployment of 11,479 officers and personnel.
“All roads intersecting the route of Karachi’s main procession will remain completely closed, and extraordinary measures have also been taken around Nishtar Park,” he added.
According to the Additional IG, all station house officers have been instructed to remain present in their respective areas, intensify patrolling, snap checking, and picketing, and ensure high alert security at sensitive installations, public places, and key government and private buildings.
“Checkpoints and searches at the city’s entry and exit points have been made more coordinated, while sweeping and clearance of all important locations by the bomb disposal squad is to be completed,” the statement said, adding that advance intelligence collection and sharing at the police station level would also be further strengthened.
The statement added that Javed had “made it clear that any negligence in implementing security measures will not be tolerated”.
The procession will lead to the closure of Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road on Friday, according to a police press release.
A press release from the office of the deputy inspector general (DIG) of Karachi’s traffic police confirmed the details of the main procession route today and offered alternative traffic routes.
The main procession will start on Friday from Nishtar Park and will end at the Hussainiya Irani Imambargah, taking its traditional fixed route, the release said.
“Due to security reasons, MA Jinnah Road will remain closed from Guru Mandir to Tower,” it added.
For the Central district, it directed those travelling from Nazimabad to take Lasbela Chowk towards Nishtar Road via the Garden. Those coming from Liaquatabad are directed to turn right from Teen Hatti to Lasbela Chowk and left to Central Jail on Martin Road.
Meanwhile, it directed people going from Hassan Square to PP Chowrangi to take Kashmir Road under Jail Chowrangi Flyover to Society Light Signal (Shahrah-e-Quaideen), and from Jail Flyover to Teen Hatti to Nishtar Road (Lasbela Chowk).
For the East district, it advised people travelling from Shahrah-e-Faisal to Shahrah-e-Quaideen (Noorani Kabab) to Numaish to go from Society Light Signal to Kashmir Road to reach their destination. People going from Central Jail Gate (Jamshed Road) to Guru Mandir, MA Jinnah Road, are directed to go from Guru Mandir to Bahadur Yar Jang Road to Soldier Bazaar to their destination.
For District South, those going from Garden Zoo to MA Jinnah Road are advised to reach their destination via Gul Plaza on the right or Coast Guard Holy Family Hospital to the left of Anklesaria Hospital.
The statement also outlined alternate routes for heavy traffic.
“All heavy/commercial traffic coming from Super Highway, Gulberg towards MA Jinnah Road will be diverted from Liaquatabad No. 10 to Nazimabad Chowrangi No. 2 via Habib Bank Flyover, State Avenue Road (and) Shershah to Maripur, and the same route will be used for the return journey,” it said.

“No small or large traffic of any kind will be allowed to enter the procession route beyond Guru Mandir Chowk,” the press release said. “All of this traffic will be diverted towards Bahadur Yar Jang Road’s Soldier Bazaar.”
It added that entry of all types of vehicles on MA Jinnah Road would be prohibited, except for those with a sticker on their windscreen to join the procession. These will be allowed to enter via the Shahrah-e-Qaideen Society Light Signal.
For those participating in the procession, participants coming from Nazimabad will proceed to Lasbela, Albela Chowk, Garden Jamaat Khana to the right, then via the Soldier Bazaar No. 3 Light Signal to Numaish; from Liaquatabad to Teen Hatti, Jahangir Road, Guru Mandir and Numaish; from Society Light Signal to Numaish; and from Gulistan-e-Johar and Gulshan-e-Iqbal along University Road to the Old Sabzi Mandi, Kashmir Road, and Society Light Signal to Numaish.
Directions have also been given to vehicles which will perform sabeel, niaz or tabbaruk at the procession.
“These vehicles will enter the procession from the entry point tower. In addition, vehicles practising sabeel and niaz will enter the procession from Lyari Expressway Garden Interchange via Aga Khan III Road, Anklesaria (and) Nasra School Capri Light Signal,” the statement said.
It added that additional vehicles performing these practices would be able to join the procession from Bahadur Yar Jang (Soldier Bazaar) to Holy Family Hospital, turning right at the Nasra School Capri Light Signal.
“No vehicle will be allowed to park on the procession route,” it added.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Home Department has imposed Section 144 in 13 districts of the province to maintain law and order during the observance of Chehlum.
In July, the Rawalpindi district administration alerted the members of the District Peace Committee ahead of Chehlum and Independence Day, asking them to make arrangements more effective and comprehensive.</p><small>2025-08-14 13:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/14165515384a326.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930864/heavy-downpour-triggers-flash-floods-in-abbottabad-disrupts-traffic-and-injures-2' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy downpour triggers flash floods in Abbottabad, disrupts traffic and injures 2</strong></a><br><p>A spell of heavy downpour lashed various parts of Abbottabad district on Thursday, triggering flash floods that severely disrupted traffic flow and caused damage to infrastructure.
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
The torrential rains led to the blockage of the Karakoram Highway (KKH) at multiple points within Abbottabad city, leaving commuters stranded for hours.
According to local authorities, all major nullahs and ravines in the district, including the River Door, swelled beyond their banks, creating dangerous conditions for nearby residents and motorists.
The sudden surge of water from the upper catchment areas inundated low-lying localities and washed debris onto the KKH, making several stretches impassable. Rescue and relief teams, along with the traffic police, were deployed to clear the road and assist stranded passengers.
In one tragic incident, two passengers sustained injuries when the boundary wall of a residential house collapsed on a passing vehicle in Abbottabad city. Eyewitnesses said the wall, weakened by continuous rainfall, gave way suddenly, crushing the roof of the vehicle. Both were taken to Ayub Medical Complex, where their condition is reportedly stable.
Local residents reported widespread flooding in streets and markets, causing damage to shops and homes, while the electricity supply was also disrupted in several areas due to rain-related damage.
Authorities have advised the public to avoid unnecessary travel, especially along flood-prone routes, and to stay clear of water channels.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department has warned of more rain in the coming days, prompting the district administration to remain on high alert for possible landslides and further flooding.
Last week, it was reported that over 71 people have died — over half of them children — and another 86 have been injured in rain-related incidents across Khyber Paktunkhwa since the start of the monsoon season in late June.</p><small>2025-08-14 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618827-karachi-traffic-plan-for-chehlum-procession' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi traffic plan for Chehlum procession</strong></a><br><p>

The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region. On Wednesday, a glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) swept away part of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), while on Tuesday evening, a powerful torrent surged through the Juchar nullah in Gulmit, Gojal, and Hunza, triggered by accelerated glacier melt.
“Diamer, Shigar, Skardu, Astore, and Gilgit are most affected by poor and unsafe water, with the people of these districts being admitted to hospitals and clinics every day,” said GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.
A government report said children under the age of five have also begun falling victim to cholera, diarrhoea, typhoid and pneumonia, among other epidemic diseases.
Thousands of people in Gilgit’s Danyor city are deprived of clean drinking water due to the floods that hit the region on July 21. On Monday, at least seven volunteers died and six were injured early when a landslide hit individuals working at a water channel in Danyor.
Poor quality water because of the disaster is being used through tankers, due to which hundreds of people have fallen sick with stomach diseases.
Faraq noted that work was being done as quickly as possible to restore the water supply and irrigation system.
Dr Muhammad Iqbal, who runs a clinic in the main market in Danyor, said that since spring water has been cut off for the past several days, unfiltered water from tankers is being used.
“This has led to an alarming increase in stomach diseases, and in most health centres, the number of patients with these diseases is higher than other patients,” Iqbal said.
He added that the increase in cases of diarrhoea and cholera had caused a shortage of Flagyl medicine in the market.
Another senior nurse, Zaffar Abbas, said he sees around 20 to 25 patients daily who are suffering from water-borne diseases, adding that this has been an issue for weeks.
“We often stay open till 2am due to the influx of people coming to private clinics since government hospitals have run out of medicines,” he said.

Since its launch in January, the free school meals programme has been marred by mass food poisoning cases across the archipelago, affecting over 1,000 people.
Sragen government chief Sigit Pamungkas told Reuters that 365 people fell ill and a food sample was being tested in a lab. The government would pay for any medical treatment if needed.
Wizdan Ridho Abimanyu, a ninth grader at Gemolong 1 middle school, told Reuters he was woken at night by sharp pain in his stomach.
He had a headache and diarrhoea, which he deduced had been caused by food poisoning after seeing schoolmates’ social media posts complaining of the same.
The likely contaminated lunch was turmeric rice, omelette ribbons, fried tempeh, cucumber and lettuce salad, sliced apple and a box of milk, cooked in a central kitchen and distributed to several schools.
“We have asked to temporarily stop the food distribution from that kitchen until the lab results are back,” Sigit said.
The government’s National Nutrition Agency, which oversees the programme, has raised the standards of kitchen operations and delivery in the aftermath of previous food poisoning cases, its chief Dadan Hindayana told Reuters.
The free meals programme has been rapidly expanded to over 15 million recipients so far. Authorities plan to reach 83 million by year-end, budgeting a total cost of 171 trillion rupiah ($10.62 billion) this year.
In a food poisoning case in a city in West Java in May, more than 200 students fell ill, and a lab found the food was contaminated with Salmonella and E. coli bacteria, according to media reports.</p><small>2025-08-14 12:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/141532125fd4a84.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930859/at-least-34-killed-in-india-occupied-kashmir-floods-official' target='_blank'><strong>At least 34 killed in India-occupied Kashmir floods: official</strong></a><br><p>Powerful torrents driven by intense rain that smashed into a Himalayan mountain village in India-occupied Kashmir killed at least 34 people on Thursday, a top local official told AFP.
The disaster occurred in Chasoti town of Kishtwar district, a pit stop on a popular pilgrimage route. It comes a little over a week after a heavy flood and mudslide engulfed an entire village in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand.
“We have found 34 dead bodies and rescued 35 injured people,” said Kishtwar Deputy Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Sharma. “There are chances of more dead bodies being found.”
Visuals on television showed pilgrims crying in fear as water flooded the village. Local TV channels said the floodwater had washed away community kitchens set up for pilgrims.
The disaster occurred at 11:30am (11am PKT), Ramesh Kumar, the divisional commissioner of Kishtwar district, told news agency ANI, adding that local police and disaster response officials had reached the scene.
“Army, air force teams have also been activated. Search and rescue operations are underway,” Kumar said.
“The news is grim and accurate, verified information from the area hit by the cloudburst is slow in arriving,” Omar Abdullah, the chief minister of India-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, said in a post on X.
 






A cloudburst, according to the Indian Meteorological Department, is a sudden, intense downpour of over 100 millimetres of rain in just one hour that can trigger sudden floods, landslides, and devastation, especially in mountainous regions during the monsoon.
The local weather office in Srinagar predicted intense showers for several regions in occupied Kashmir on Thursday, including Kishtwar, asking residents to stay away from loose structures, electric poles and old trees as there was a possibility of mudslides and flash floods.</p><small>2025-08-14 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/14095154cdcdd5b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930816/leaders-militarys-top-brass-call-for-national-unity-justice-in-independence-day-messages' target='_blank'><strong>Leaders, military’s top brass call for national unity, justice in Independence Day messages</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have called for rising beyond divisions and standing united for a Pakistan that is built on justice, equality, and service to all, as the nation celebrates Pakistan’s 79th Independence Day today.
They said the day served as a reminder of courage, unity, and sacrifices that led to the creation of Pakistan and paid homage to founding father Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the workers of the Pakistan Movement for their struggle and sacrifices.
In his message on the occasion, President Zardari emphasised that the nation had “reaffirmed its strength, resolve, and unity in the face of external aggression”.
“Our success in Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos is a landmark moment in our history,” he said. “It was a demonstration of unshakable national will, professional excellence, and united purpose.”
In July, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said this year’s Independence Day would be marked as “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth). The term is used by the state for the conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the end of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos with a ceasefire on May 10.
The clash began after India blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, leading to air strikes and a week of missile exchanges stretched until a US-brokered ceasefire.
The day dawned with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and 21-gun salutes at the provincial headquarters, Radio Pakistan reported.
 






Special prayers were offered in mosques for peace, solidarity and prosperity of the country. Various renowned buildings across the country have also been decorated with the national flag and lights as the nation celebrates Independence Day with fervour.
The main flag hosting ceremony was held at the Pakistan Monument in the federal capital, where PM Shehbaz unfurled the national flag.
Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, cabinet members, parliamentarians and school students were present on the occasion, according to Radio Pakistan.
 






A flag-hoisting ceremony was also held at the Supreme Court, where Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Yahya Afridi unfurled the national flag.
In his message, President Zardari noted that “faced with unjustified Indian aggression, Pakistan responded with clarity, courage and restraint.
“The world witnessed a nation that is peace-loving, but fully capable of defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
“Today, the world sees Pakistan as a country that seeks peace but does not bow to coercion.
“But this moment is about more than military success. It is a reminder of what we can achieve when we are united, focused, and committed to a common goal,” the president said.
He asserted that this victory gave the people of Pakistan a sense of renewed confidence. It has lifted the morale of the people, restored faith in our institutions, and enhanced Pakistan’s stature on the global stage, he added.
President Zardari urged the nation to channel this spirit into economic revival, educational reform, technological advancement, institutional development, and environmental resilience.
“The same discipline, courage, and clarity that led to our recent success against India can lead us toward victory in eradicating poverty, creating opportunities for our people, and building a just and inclusive society.”
He also expressed solidarity with the people of India-occupied Kashmir, saying that “their courage and struggle for justice and their right to self-determination remain close to our hearts.
“Pakistan will continue to extend its unwavering diplomatic, moral, and political support until their right to self-determination is realised.”
 






In his message, PM Shehbaz paid tribute to Jinnah and national poet Allama Muhammad Iqbal, who along with other resolute leaders and workers of the Independence Movement, united the nation under one vision, one mission and one goal.
“Their relentless efforts changed the course of the history with the establishment of an independent, ideological state, thus realising a seemingly impossible dream into a reality,” he said in a statement.
“The past 78 years tell a tale of resilience, strong faith and a hope of a bright future when as a nation, we braved several difficult challenges”, he stated. “Despite this, Pakistan achieved a series of milestones of success and achievements in every field.”
He also paid tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of Pakistan’s freedom, saying Marka-i-Haq was not just a military conquest, but also the victory of validation of the Two-Nation Theory.
 






“Pakistan’s historic victory in Marka-i-Haq during the four-day war imposed by India has not only reinforced the sanctity of our freedom, but has also instilled a renewed sense of ambition and national spirit in the hearts of our people, magnifying the pride and fervour of this Independence Day.”
He continued: “With the blessings of Almighty Allah, our brave armed forces revived their past glory and shattered the false pride of enemy by acting as a Bunyanum Marsoos — a solid fortified wall.
“The military capability, valour and faith of our brave soldiers and air warriors forced the enemy to kneel down. We pay tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of our freedom and offer prayers for the elevation of their ranks in eternal life.”

While expressing his resolve to protect Pakistan’s sovereignty, PM Shehbaz said: “We reiterate our belief in the principles of peaceful coexistence and resolving the regional and global issues through dialogue and diplomacy.”
He said India needs to demonstrate the same will for the resolution of all disputes, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
PM Shehbaz also highlighted the government’s initiatives for the welfare of the common people, such as a reduction in electricity prices. “The government is utilising all resources to make the country effectively meet the economic, industrial technological demands of the present era.”
He called for demonstrating the spirit of Marka-i-Haq and Pakistan Movement for a strong and stable economy, which is inevitable for an impregnable national defence and sovereignty.

“Pakistan is our pride, our identity, and the symbol of our existence. We will never allow any harm to come to this land,” Bugti vowed.
 






Speaking at a flag-hoisting ceremony on the lawns of Balochistan Assembly, Bugti stressed that this year’s celebration carried “exceptional significance, as the nation has defeated an adversary stronger than an enemy steeped in arrogance and pride”, APP reported.
“Our brave armed forces have achieved a victory that fills every Pakistani with pride,” said CM Bugti, extending heartfelt gratitude to the armed forces, particularly the army chief, as well as PM Shehbaz and President Zardari.

He underscored the cultural richness of Balochistan’s diverse communities, which include Baloch, Pashtun, Hazara, and others, while condemning the actions of terrorist groups that violate tribal and societal values.

The programme featured speeches, patriotic songs and a cake-cutting ceremony.
Additional Chief Secretary (General) Midhat Shehzad, who attended as the chief guest, said that true appreciation of freedom comes from contrasting life in AJK with that in IoK, terming freedom a great blessing from Allah Almighty that must be honoured with gratitude and responsibility.
Meritorious Prof Dr Syed Nadeem Haider Bukhari, dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, underscored that no blessing was greater than freedom for humankind.

Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu extended “heartfelt felicitations to the nation on the auspicious occasion” of Independence Day, “marking the triumph of unity, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to a shared vision for a brighter future”.

“The unbreakable bond between the armed forces and the people is the cornerstone of our collective strength.”

Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks on police forces. The country has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
In KP’s Upper Dir, three cops were martyred after their mobile was attacked by terrorists, while another six were injured in the same attack, the police said in a statement.
Police have launched a search operation to find the perpetrators, and the injured were rushed to the nearby hospital.
Meanwhile, in Lower Dir, “two separate terrorist attacks on police checkpoints in the areas of Maidan, Lajbok and Shadas claimed the life of police constable Sanaullah, while Sultan Zareen was injured,” District Police Officer Abdul Salam Khalid said in a statement.
In Peshawar, two separate police checkpoints in the areas of Matni and Nasir Bagh and a police station in Hassan Khel came under fire, leaving one police personnel dead and another injured.
The deceased has been identified as Constable Jahangir Khan, who lost his life in the attack on Hassan Khel police station.
According to a press release issued by the KP police, “the attacks on Matni and Nasir Bagh checkpoints were successfully thwarted”.
“Police and law enforcement agencies retaliated against the attacks,” the statement read, adding that the terrorists retreated after the exchange of fire.
“Elements of Fitna-ul-Khawarij also fired on a police party near Nasir Bagh, which was foiled with timely action,” the statement added, using the state-designated term for TTP.
In Bannu, terrorists attacked two police checkpoints in the area of Miryan and Mazanga by firing an RPG-7 rocket launcher.
The attack was foiled as the police personnel retaliated immediately, the statement said, adding that no personnel were injured.
According to the press release, “terrorist attacks on police posts in different districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were bravely foiled.”
“The terrorists failed in their attacks thanks to the timely action of law enforcement agencies,” the statement highlighted.
Separately, in Shangla district, a police post came under attack; however, the attack was foiled as the police responded immediately, prompting the terrorists to flee.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Sub-divisional police officer Usman Munir said, “The attack was successfully thwarted and no human loss or injury was reported.” He added that a search operation has been launched to look for the terrorists.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur condemned the spate of terrorist attacks in Peshawar, Lower Dir and Upper Dir, expressing sympathies for the martyred policemen.
Calling the attacks “a cowardly act”, Gandapur vowed that such incidents can not be allowed to demoralise the police.
“The sacrifices made by the KP Police will be remembered in history, he said, promising support for the families of the martyred personnel.
The Inspector General of Police, KP, Zulfiqar Hameed, lauded the efforts of the police in foiling the terrorists’ attempts, saying that “our brave soldiers have once again proven that they are always ready to defend KP.”
He added, “The professionalism, bravery and strength exhibited by the officers deserve heartfelt appreciation”.
Speaking to the media, IG KP said, “The enemy carried out these attacks to cast a shadow over 14 August celebrations.”
He added that “we have foiled 80 per cent of the attacks, but sustained damage in two of the attacks.”
Funeral prayers offered for Constable Jahangir Khan
Funeral prayers were offered for Constable Jahangir, who lost his life in an attack on Hassan Khel police station at Malik Saad Shaheed Police Line in Peshawar on Thursday.
The funeral prayers were attended by IG Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Zulfiqar Hameed, who assured the family that “their sacrifice will not go in vain”.
Others present at the funeral included: CCPO Peshawar Qasim Ali Khan, SSP Khan Zeb Khan, SSP Investigation Noor Jamal, PSO to IG Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Imran Khan, SP Security Mujeeb-ur-Rehman.
In Upper Dir, funeral prayers were offered for three policemen martyred in the attacks last night. KP IG was also in attendance at the funeral.
On August 3, a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in KP’s Bannu district left one cop dead while three other policemen were injured.
While in a separate incident on August 1, at least six law enforcement personnel were injured in a quadcopter attack on Miryan police station in Bannu amid an ongoing operation against terrorists in the Nurar area.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.</p><small>2025-08-14 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618799-pakistan-may-move-unsc-against-bla-affiliate' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan may move UNSC against BLA, affiliate</strong></a><br><p>

Past trade across the icy and high-altitude Himalayan border passes between the neighbours was usually small in volume, but any resumption is significant for its symbolism.
The two major economic powers have long competed for strategic influence across South Asia.
 
 

But caught in global trade and geopolitical turbulence triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff regime, the countries have moved to mend ties.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is expected to hold talks in New Delhi on Monday, according to Indian media, after his counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visited Beijing in July.
That, as well as agreements to resume direct flights and issue tourist visas, has been seen as an effort to rebuild a relationship damaged after a deadly border clash in 2020 between their nations’ troops.
“For a long time, China-India border trade cooperation has played an important role in improving the lives of people living along the border,” China’s foreign ministry said in a statement to AFP on Thursday.
It added that the two sides have “reached a consensus on cross-border exchanges and cooperation, including resumption of border trade”.
New Delhi’s junior foreign minister, Kirti Vardhan Singh, told parliament last week that “India has engaged with the Chinese side to facilitate the resumption of border trade”.
No restart date was given by either side.
Successive US administrations have seen India as a longstanding ally with like-minded interests when it comes to China.
India is part of the Quad security alliance with the United States, as well as Australia and Japan.
But ties between New Delhi and Washington have been strained by Trump’s ultimatum for India to end its purchases of Russian oil, a key source of revenue for Moscow as it wages its military offensive in Ukraine.
The United States will double new import tariffs on India from 25 per cent to 50pc by August 27 if New Delhi does not switch crude suppliers.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to Indian media, might also visit China in late August. It would be Modi’s first visit since 2018, although it has not been confirmed officially.
Beijing has said that “China welcomes Prime Minister Modi” for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit opening on August 31.</p><small>2025-08-14 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/14133039ee68494.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930846/ukraines-zelensky-to-meet-uk-pm-in-london-ahead-of-trump-putin-summit' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine’s Zelensky to meet UK PM in London ahead of Trump-Putin summit</strong></a><br><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due in London to meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday, to take stock ahead of US President Donald Trump’s key talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.
Zelensky, who was in Germany on Wednesday, has been working with European leaders to press Trump not to allow Putin to carve up Ukraine’s territory at the Alaska summit.
He is due to meet Starmer at 9:30am local time (1:30pm PKT) at the British premier’s official residence, 10 Downing Street.
 






On Wednesday, Trump joined a Germany-hosted virtual meeting with European leaders, including Zelensky, who sought to set red lines ahead of the summit on ending the war in Ukraine.
Zelensky said he warned Trump that the Russian leader was “bluffing” about his desire to end the war.
Trump later threatened “severe consequences” if Putin does not agree to peace in Ukraine and while he did not specify what the consequences could be, he has warned of economic sanctions if his meeting on Friday proves fruitless.
The comments and the outcome of the virtual conference on Wednesday could provide encouragement for Kyiv ahead of the summit.
Trump described the aim of his talks with Putin in Alaska as “setting the table” for a quick follow-up that would include Zelensky.
“If the first one goes okay, we’ll have a quick second one,” Trump said.
“I would like to do it almost immediately, and we’ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelensky and myself, if they’d like to have me there.”
Britain, France and Germany, the co-chairs of the so-called “Coalition of the Willing”, set out their position on the pathway to a ceasefire in Ukraine in a statement released after Wednesday’s virtual meeting.</p><small>2025-08-14 08:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618790-met-office-forecasts-moderate-to-heavy-rainfall-in-karachi-next-week' target='_blank'><strong>Met Office forecasts moderate to heavy rainfall in Karachi next week</strong></a><br><p>

Williams became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004 when she beat Peyton Stearns at last month’s Washington Open after a 16-month absence from competitive tennis.
She last played in the US Open singles main draw in 2023, losing in the first round to Belgian Greet Minnen.
 
 

The seven-time Grand Slam winner is also playing in the tournament’s new-look mixed doubles tournament with compatriot Reilly Opelka.
Other women’s singles wildcards included France’s Caroline Garcia, in what will likely be the 2022 semi-finalist’s last appearance at Flushing Meadows.
The 2022 WTA Finals winner announced plans to retire from the sport earlier this year.

“Once we have enough countries agreeing to this, the [UN Environment Programme] secretariat will be forced to put it on the agenda,” said the climate minister.
Going through the treaty’s text with a fine-tooth comb, he found it confounding that there was no mechanism to show how the polluters would pay to countries that were getting polluted, he said, giving the example of small island nations which generate less plastic waste, but get ashore anyway from the rest of the world.
He also asked developed nations to stop exporting their plastic waste to “countries like Pakistan” and using them as “junkyards”.
 






Interestingly, in his address at the informal ministerial dialogue on investment opportunities for a plastic circular economy, he said, “When I look at the green financing, I find that the same countries that are consuming plastics are the countries that are getting green financing,”, putting the blame squarely on countries with a bigger plastic footprint.

Musadik Malik says he is ‘extremely disappointed’ at UN system, as plastic talks remain stalled

Talking to a packed hall, he warned, “Injustice is unsustainable and if we do injustice to nature; it is not going to care… it will retaliate, and we shall all suffer.”
Giving the example of coal, he added, “We are all interwoven as one global village, or so I believed, up until the geopolitical tectonic plates moved. And when they moved and some countries started to use coal once again, other countries were forbidden from using it. I find that perplexing… how can coal in one country be black and another country be orange with yellow polka dots. So sometimes, naive as I am, I don’t get the geopolitics of the world. The plastics [pollution] is, frankly, no different.”
“I told them to listen to us; we’re not voiceless and don’t ramrod us,” he told Dawn over the phone from Geneva.
‘Race to the bottom’
Billed as the most important environmental deal since the 2015 Paris climate accord, the 10-day summit with delegates from 184 countries has yet to agree on a definition of “plastic pollution” itself.
“They’re just squabbling over where the semi-colon is going to be placed; the number of brackets in the text continues to grow; no wonder nothing gets done,” said Dr Malik.
 
 

He was not the only one. European Union environment chief Jessika Roswall found there to be “more square brackets in the text than plastic in the sea”.
Dr Malik said he was extremely disappointed with the way the UN system works. “Is this how you deal with matters that affect the lives and livelihood of people?”
From Geneva, Rachel Radvany, environmental health campaigner at the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL), told Dawn: “What was meant to be a global effort to solve the plastics crisis has stalled.”
She further said, “As in the climate space, it’s the countries least responsible for the problem that are fighting the hardest for an ambitious treaty… while producers are in a race to the bottom, with some even questioning whether the treaty is about plastic.”
“The written jargon-infested statements were benign to say the least; everyone agreeing and endorsing each other that the world needs to do something about the plastic waste, yet offering not a single solution,” said Dr Malik, adding that it had been exhausting.

Incidents of aerial firing are a routine occurrence on occasions such as Independence Day and New Year’s Eve despite bans imposed in the past, often leaving dozens injured.
According to a statement issued by police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed, a total of 109 people with bullet injuries from aerial firing were brought in from different areas across the metropolis to three major hospitals. Three people were said to be in critical condition.
However, police put the injury toll as 67, according to a statement from the office of the Karachi Additional Inspector General (AIG) Javed Alam Odho.
Azizabad Station House Officer (SHO) Waqar Kaiser told Dawn.com, “A seven-year-old girl was watching Independence Day fireworks from the second floor gallery of her house in Azizabad Block-8 when a bullet struck her in the head.
“A while later, her mother saw her bleeding out, and her uncle took her to a nearby private hospital where doctors pronounced her dead. The body was later shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital where the bullet from her head was retrieved.”
SHO Kaiser said the bullet was fired from a 9mm pistol.
Police have taken four suspects into custody involved in aerial firing and recovered two 9mm pistols from them to ascertain whether they were used in the killings, he added.
Meanwhile, Awami Colony police said in a statement that a 35-year-old man was killed by a stray bullet in Model Family Park Korangi No 3. The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for legal proceedings. He added that further investigation was underway.
The third victim was 70-year-old man, struck by a stray bullet while sitting outside his home in Agra Taj Colony near Ibrahim Masjid in Kalri, South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com.
“He was taken to Civil Hospital Karachi where he died during treatment,” DIG Raza said.
The police statement on the incident said that on the instructions of AIG Odho, police took immediate action and arrested 86 miscreants and recovered 68 illegal weapons from their possession and registered cases.
“A total of 111 cases have been registered, while more cases of murder and attempt to murder are also being registered after innocent citizens were killed and injured,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-08-14 07:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/14112534679e5c9.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930720/punjab-police-bid-to-arrest-pti-leader-freed-after-two-years' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab police bid to arrest PTI leader freed after two years</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Police attempted to arrest Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Advocate Haider Majeed, who was convicted by a military court, when he was finally released from Kot Lakhpat Jail after completing the two-year term, on Wednesday.
PTI leaders Shayan Bashir and Rai Muhammad Ali Kharl, along with party workers, accorded a warm welcome to Advocate Majeed. The workers passionately chanted slogans in favour of the PTI founder Imran Khan and Majeed.
Soon after Mr Majeed came out of jail, police pounced and arrested his father and brother. However, Mr Majeed managed to slip away on a motorcycle and reached Model Town courts.
Reacting to the police action, Mr Bashir wondered that the Punjab police have become so confused as it did not want to let the PTI leader remain free despite completing his two-year “illegal confinement.”
“We strongly condemn the illegal detention of Advocate Majeed’s father and brother,” Mr Bashir added.

In Gulmit, Gojal, Hunza, a powerful torrent surged through the Juchar nullah on Tuesday evening, triggered by accelerated glacier melt.
The floodwaters destroyed a women-owned restaurant, a government tourist facilitation centre, orchards, farmland, and critical infrastructure including electricity and internet poles, according to Rescue 1122 officials.
A bridge and sections of the KKH were swept away, leaving no alternative route for locals and tourists travelling to and from China via the Khunjerab Pass. 



 
“Never experienced such intensity of floods in the nullah,” Saeed Jan, a local resident, told Dawn.
The destruction of a fibre optic line has left the area without mobile and internet services, while rising water in the Khunjerab River damaged a power transmission line near Sost, plunging communities into darkness.
Efforts to reopen the highway have been repeatedly hampered by rising water levels and mudflows, with even foot crossings for patients and travellers now deemed impossible.
In Hunza’s Hassanabad, erosion linked to outburst flooding from the Shishper glacier continued on Wednesday, dismantling two more houses and putting others at risk.
Power to Roshanabad Mohallah was cut after an electricity pole collapsed. With a section of the KKH already washed away, traffic is being diverted through the Sas valley in Nagar. 



 
Flash floods also struck Shigar district, damaging homes and property in Dogoro village of Basha, while a glof in the Horchas nullah damaged crops and blocked the road leading to K2, according to local officials.



 
Faizullah Faraq, spokesperson for the Gilgit-Baltistan government, said rehabilitation work is underway across affected areas, but warned that climate change-induced disasters “have changed the map of Gilgit-Baltistan”, with high river flows, erosion, and landslides complicating repairs.
“Passengers and vehicles are waiting for the road to be restored on both sides of the KKH,” he said, adding that the chief minister has ordered efforts to be expedited in Shigar, Ghizer, Hunza, Gilgit, Astore, Diamer, and other districts.
Evacuations in Kasur
Meanwhile, in Punjab, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has ordered the immediate evacuation of people living along the banks of the Sutlej River in Kasur district, warning of significant flooding as a powerful monsoon spell approaches.
The flow of the Sutlej is expected to increase next week, coinciding with the seventh and strongest spell of monsoon rains this season, which has already been linked to 164 deaths across Punjab.
“There is a possibility of further increase in the flow of the Sutlej River next week, and citizens are requested to immediately move to safer places,” PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said, during his emergency visit to Kasur.
The PDMA director convened a high-level meeting at the deputy commissioner’s office in Kasur to address the potential flood situation.
Officials are racing to clear storm drains and reinforce embankments, with the upcoming monsoon forecast to bring intense rainfall from August 13-17 in upper Punjab, followed by extended downpours in other areas from August 18-21.
Major urban centres including Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Sialkot face threats of urban flooding, while the PDMA has also warned of landslides in Murree and Galliyat. 



 
The monsoon season has so far killed at least 164 people, 582 rain-related injuries, damaged 216 homes, and resulted in the loss of 121 livestock, according to recent data.
River monitoring stations show low-level flooding on the Indus River at Kalabagh, Tarbela, and Chashma, with Tarbela Dam currently at 96 per cent capacity.
Kasur Deputy Commissioner Imran Ali said comprehensive preparations have been made to handle a potential flood, with de-silting of drains underway, machinery available, and staff deployed. “Adequate arrangements have been completed to deal with the flood situation at all sensitive places,” he said.

On Aug 10, a fast-moving dumper hit a motorcycle and crushed to death Mahnoor, 22, and her brother Ahmed Raza, 14, on main Rashid Minhas Road near the UBL Sports Complex. Enraged people took to the streets and set to fire seven dumpers within the remit of the Federal B Industrial Area and Yousuf Plaza police stations.
On Wednesday, the investigation officers of the two cases produced the suspects before the administrative judge of the ATCs at the Judicial Complex inside the central prison.
They requested the court to grant their 14-day police remand for interrogation and to arrest other absconding suspects.
 
 

The court remanded all 12 suspects in police custody for seven days and directed the IOs to submit progress reports at the next hearing.
Remand of dumper driver extended
A judicial magistrate on Wednesday extended the physical remand of a dumper driver booked and arrested for killing the two siblings in the fatal accident.
IO Fida Hussain brought dumper driver Firdos Khan before Judicial Magistrate (Central) Farman Ali Tager and sought an extension of his police remand, stating that more time was needed to verify the suspect’s documents.
During the hearing, the IO informed the court that the suspect had claimed to possess an HTV (Heavy Transport Vehicle) licence issued from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For verification, he said, a letter had been sent to the relevant authority in the province.
However, the IO added that the licence had not yet been verified, which was why Sections 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab) and 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) had been added to the case. He requested more time as he awaited a response from the authorities concerned.
After hearing arguments from the defence counsel and the IO, the court extended the suspect’s physical remand for three more days and directed the IO to submit a progress report at the next hearing, scheduled for Aug 16.

Based on current tax rates, informed sources said the ex-depot price of HSD is estimated to decline by around 4pc, depending on final calculations, while petrol could rise by about 0.5pc.
International petrol prices inched up by 15 cents per barrel over the past fortnight, while diesel rates fell by about $4.5 per barrel. The rupee also appreciated slightly against the dollar.
The current ex-depot petrol price stands at Rs264.61 per litre, following a Rs7.54 per litre cut on August 1. This came after cumulative hikes of Rs20 per litre in the previous four fortnights since May 15. Petrol, used mainly in private cars, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers, directly impacts the budgets of middle- and lower-middle-income groups.
HSD is presently priced at Rs285.83 per litre, after an almost Rs27 per litre surge since May 15, including a minor Rs1.48 per litre cut earlier this month. The fuel powers most of the transport sector — from trucks and buses to trains, tractors, tube-wells and threshers — and has a strong inflationary effect, particularly on the prices of vegetables and other essential goods. Transport fares have already risen in response to earlier price hikes and rarely come down.
Kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) prices are expected to drop by about Rs6 and Rs7 per litre, respectively.

A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and comprising Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, was hearing the appeal against the IHC’s Aug 4 short order.
At the outset, when senior counsel Farooq H. Naek, representing Bahria Town, came to the rostrum for arguments, the CJP suggested that he refer to the original bench, which earlier heard the matter.
On Aug 8, a different three-judge bench consisting of Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Siddiqui heard the matter during which Justice Afghan wondered why auction of the property developer was being rushed in haste when culmination of trials in the pending references against Zain Malik will determine confiscation of attached properties.
On Wednesday, Mr Naek stated that since the detailed judgement of the high court had come, he would prefer to furnish additional submissions in the light of that verdict.
At this, the CJP decided to adjourn further proceedings for an indefinite period to provide the counsel ample opportunity for submitting additional arguments before the apex court.
In its 14-page detailed judgement, the IHC held that the orders passed by the Islamabad’s Accountability Court No. 1 was quite in accordance with law and warrants no interference by the high court.
As a result, the petitions moved by the Bahria Town were dismissed.
Authored by IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, the verdict recalled that the Bahria Town had claimed that it was an independent entity and was not responsible for any act or deed of any of its shareholders and that it was never declared a proclaimed offender.
But the judgement recalled that Sections 87 and 89 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) allow attachment of the properties of an absconding accused as a coercive measure to compel his appearance.
If the absconder fails to comply with the proclamation as per Section 88 of CrPC, the court can order the attachment of his movable and immovable property, including sealing bank accounts, seizing assets and restricting transactions, the IHC said.
The attachment under Section 88 of CrPC was not punitive but coercive, with the sole aim of securing the attendance of the accused before the court, the high court order said, highlighting that in the case at hand, the accused Malik Riaz Hussain and Ahmad Ali Riaz were declared proclaimed offenders on Jan 6, 2024.

Mufti Munir Shakir, founder of the banned Lashkar-i-Islam, was killed in a blast outside his seminary in Urmar area on the outskirts of the provincial capital on March 15 this year.
They said the department identified the gang involved in this heinous act while efforts were under way to apprehend the culprits in the near future.
The CTD officials, while briefing media-persons said that it busted a group of militants responsible for no fewer than 18 terrorist incidents in the settled areas of the provincial capital, adding that those attacks include the martyrdom of deputy superintendent of police Sardar Hussain Khan and 14 other police officials of various ranks.

Officials reveal terrorists using digital currency for extortion; propose seminary registration should be subject to CTD’s consent

They said that following interrogation from arrested terrorists involved in several terrorist activities, CTD recovered a substantial cache of arms, ammunition, and explosive material, including IEDs, adding that the timely action also led to securing of at least six sensitive installations that had already been subjected to reconnaissance by militants and were in the final stages of planning an attack.
 
 

“CTD has identified the gang responsible for the targeted killing of religious scholars, enabling focused follow-up operations to apprehend the culprits,” they said.
Also, the CTD officials, who didn’t want to be named, claimed to have busted the Daesh Khorasan network directly responsible for the suicide attack in Peshawar city on 11 May, 2025, some four kilometres from a JUI-F gathering being addressed by Maulana Fazlur Rehman at Mufti Mehmood Markaz on Ring Road, on outskirts of the provincial capital.
While briefing journalists, CTD revealed that apart from currency notes and bank transactions, terrorist organisations received extortion money through digital currency as well.
The CTD officials told reporters here that apart from Afghanistan, people also received extortion calls from Saudi mobile numbers.
“They [militants] now seek extortion money in digital currency — Bitcoin,” a senior CTD official said, adding that the terrorist organisations generated finances not only from extortion but from drug smuggling as well.
Also, the CTD officials said that the terrorists were involved in online propaganda on several social media platforms and the department had established contact directly with the organisations owning the Apps, adding that the department had proposed to the government to establish counter cyber terrorism police stations.
“CTD also wants empowerment under Prevention of Electronic Crime Act,” they said, adding that the counter violent extremism policy was in the final stage. The CTD officials said that the religious seminaries and their registration should be subject to the approval of the CTD, adding that they had proposed empowering the deputy commissioners to registrar the religious seminaries under Societies Registration Act 1860.
They also said that they had been facing issues while arresting the accused persons in the merged districts, as it took years to arrest one person, adding that the department wanted powers under a mix of Frontier Crimes Regulations 1901 and Police Act 2017.
“We have 44 special weapon and tactics (SWAT) teams for each district. All these teams are equipped with modern gadgets,” they said, adding that capacity building of the department was under way with an explosives handling and analysis laboratory.
They said the prosecution department had developed enough expertise and the bail refusal ratio, which was 6 per cent in 2022, had gone up to 34pc in 2025, adding that 25pc was the conviction rate in 2025 as compared to 23pc in 2022.
They informed reporters that ratio of logically concluding cases was 13pc in 2022, which had gone up to 34pc in 2025, adding that 11 scientists were recruited for forensic laboratory with latest technology to be adopted in the near future.

All major bazaars and business centres in Khar, Inayat Kalley, Sadiqabad, Raghagan, Pashat, Haji Lawang, Yousafabad, Nawagai, Lowi Sam, Umary and Qazafi reopened in the morning after the district administration notified an end to the 48-hour curfew late on Tuesday.
“The general public is hereby informed that major roads in the district, including Khar- Munda road, Khar-Nawagai road and Khar-Sadiqabad-Inayat Kallay roads will reopen from tomorrow [Wednesday], allowing citizens to resume their daily activities , while bazaars and trade centres along these routes will also function normally from Wednesday,” read the notification shared on the Facebook page of the deputy commissioner.
The notification came an hour after heads of trade bodies, including those from Khar and Inayat Kalley, announced on social media that they would reopen their business centres on Wednesday regardless of curbs, as they could no longer “tolerate the baseless restrictions.”

Residents protest civilian killings in mortar shelling

The lifting of the curfew restored business activities and transport services on both inter- and intra-district routes but also led to the reopening of educational institutions, which had been closed for the last two days.
 
 

However, curfew will remain in place in around 27 selective areas of both Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils until August 14 due to the ongoing ‘targeted’ military offensive Operation Sarbakaf against terrorists, which entered its third consecutive day on Wednesday.
According to residents, security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery targeted terrorist hideouts in the areas on Wednesday.
However, loss of life on the terrorists’ side in the ongoing operation was not reported by officials on Wednesday evening. Provincial Inspector General of Police Zulfqar Hameed said it was an intelligence-based operation aimed at “eliminating terrorist threats to peace” in the region.
Meanwhile, scores of people from Lowi Mamund tehsil staged a demonstration on Wednesday against the killing of three members of a family after a mortar shell allegedly hit a house in the Erab area on Tuesday evening.
The demonstration held in the Bad-i-Siah area began after the funeral prayers of the deceased were performed. People from all walks of life, mostly youth, showed up defying the curfew.
Participants expressed grave concern over deaths in the mortar shelling, which, they said, killed a woman and two children and wounded two family members.
Bajaur Aman Jirga chief and JI local chapter emir Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, PTI local MPA Dr Hamidur Rehman, former MNA Gul Zafar Khan, Malik Khalid Khan, Najibullah Khan Mamund and JI youth wing leader Irfan Janbaz addressed the gathering and such incidents were unacceptable.
They said authorities promised to avoid the targeting of civilian population in the ongoing operation.
“We were told by authorities that it would be an operation targeting terrorists who posed a threat to peace in the region and its residents,” said a speaker.
The speakers demanded avoiding civilian casualties in the operation, lifting of the curfew and restoration of mobile phone and internet services in the region without delay.
They said that they would launch a massive protest demonstration if their demands were not met immediately.
The demonstration, which continued for a couple of hours, was also addressed by Ibrahim, the head of the affected family, who shared details of the mortar shelling.
Earlier, members of Bajaur Aman Jirga met at Bajaur Press Club Khar and condemned the killing of three people in the incident.
The participants, who also included political, religious and youth leaders, discussed the prevailing law and order situation in the district amid the ongoing operation against terrorists in several areas of Lower and Upper Mamund tehsils.
The meeting chaired by head of the jirga Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, was addressed by ANP MPA Mohammad Nisar Khan, PTI MPA Dr Hamidur Rehaman, former MNA Gul Zafar Khan, ANP president Gul Afzal Khan, religious scholar Maulana Ihsanul Haq, ANP senior leader Sheikh Janzada, PPP president Haji Sher Bahadur and PML-N president Malik Gul Kareem Khan.
The meeting was later joined by ANP provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain and a delegation of his party, who said the killing of civilians not only violated the authorities’ promise but also sparked unrest among residents.
They said that they were not against the action against terrorists as it was vital to clear the area of anti-peace elements but they were opposed to the killing of civilians.
The participants called for an investigation into the incident and said civilians should not be targeted in the future.
ANP leader Iftikhar Hussain expressed his party’s solidarity with the people of Bajaur and called for immediate halt to military action in the district and other parts of the province.
Accompanied by party provincial general secretary Hussain Shah Yousafzai, joint secretary Hamid Toofan and other leaders, Mian Iftikhar said the ANP was deeply concerned about the prevailing poor law and order situation across the province and that the peace march scheduled in Islamabad on August 23 would determine the party’s plan of action to address issues.
Later, the ANP provincial president, along with other leaders and activists, visited relief camps set up for displaced persons, including those on the Bajaur Sports Complex in Khar, and learned from inhabitants about their issues.
Senior officials of the district administration, PDMA and health department briefed visitors about the facilities being provided to displaced persons in camps.
