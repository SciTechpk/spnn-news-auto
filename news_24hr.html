The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had predicted rain and snowfall in the hilly areas of the country on Sunday.
According to local sources, light to moderate snowfall occurred in high-altitude regions, including Angoor Adda, Shakai, Khamrang, Raghzai, Kaniguram, Badar, Laddha and surrounding hilly localities, while intermittent rainfall was reported in lower areas.
The precipitation transformed the mountainous landscape, with hill ranges blanketed in snow, significantly enhancing the natural beauty of the region.
Residents welcomed the change in weather, describing the snowfall and rain as “positive and refreshing” after a prolonged dry spell.
Many locals were seen enjoying the scenic views, while others expressed optimism about the environmental and economic benefits associated with the winter precipitation.
“The first snowfall and rainfall of the season are highly beneficial from an agricultural perspective,” said local farmers.

They noted that the moisture from rain would improve soil fertility and boost crop productivity in the coming months. Farmers particularly expected a positive impact on wheat cultivation, currently at a critical stage, as well as on orchard crops such as pine nuts, apples, peaches, and plums.
“Rain and snow act as natural irrigation,” said a local farmer in Kaniguram.
“They improve soil moisture, strengthen seed germination, and increase the effectiveness of fertilizers. This will ultimately lead to better yields and improved livelihoods for farmers.”
Officials from the Irrigation Department and the Agriculture Department also termed the precipitation encouraging, especially in light of the steadily declining groundwater levels observed over recent years.
“Underground water reserves in South Waziristan had been decreasing at an alarming rate due to prolonged dry conditions, limited rainfall, and overdependence on tube wells,” said the officials.
“Recent snowfall and rainfall are expected to halt the continuous decline in the groundwater table,” an official from the Irrigation Department said. “As snow melts gradually, it will recharge streams, springs, underground aquifers, and natural water reservoirs, which will help stabilize and eventually raise the water level.”
Agriculture Department officials added that seasonal rainfall is essential not only for staple crops but also for vegetables, orchards, and grazing lands.
“Improved moisture levels are expected to support livestock farming, another major source of income for the region’s rural population.”
However, snowfall in remote and high-altitude areas has also resulted in a noticeable drop in temperatures, intensifying the cold weather.
In some mountainous localities, residents also reported partial disruption to movement due to slippery roads and reduced visibility.
The local administration has advised residents to take precautionary measures, particularly in snow-prone areas, and urged people to avoid unnecessary travel during adverse weather conditions. Authorities have also directed relevant departments to remain alert to address any potential emergencies arising from harsh winter conditions.
A day earlier, the National Disaster Management Authority had issued a weather advisory, asking authorities to ensure all necessary preparations and response measures ahead of an expected cold wave in the country.
Residents expressed hope that continued rainfall and snowfall during the winter season would not only strengthen agricultural productivity but also significantly ease the ongoing water crisis in South Waziristan — a region historically affected by water scarcity and climate variability.</p><small>2025-12-30 15:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/30190114cc694b7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964103/uae-rebuffs-saudi-accusations-of-shipping-weapons-to-yemen-separatists-as-tensions-flare-between-gulf-neighbours' target='_blank'><strong>UAE rebuffs Saudi accusations of shipping weapons to Yemen separatists as tensions flare between Gulf neighbours</strong></a><br><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Tuesday rejected Saudi Arabia’s accusations that it supplied weapons to a Yemeni separatist faction amid rising tensions between the two Gulf monarchies.
“The shipment in question did not contain any weapons, and the vehicles unloaded were not intended for any Yemeni party,” said the UAE.
Saudi Arabia also declared a UAE-backed separatist advance in Yemen a threat to the kingdom’s national security and called Abu Dhabi’s actions “highly dangerous”, as the rivalry between the Gulf monarchies boiled over into an open dispute.
The strongly worded foreign ministry statement came hours after the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it had struck a United Arab Emirates weapons shipment destined for separatist forces.

“The steps taken by the UAE are considered highly dangerous,” it said, adding “the Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line, and the Kingdom will not hesitate to take all necessary steps and measures to confront and neutralise any such threat”.
In recent weeks, separatists seeking to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen, have made sweeping territorial gains in a lightning offensive.
“Given the danger and escalation posed by these weapons… the coalition air forces carried out a limited military operation this morning targeting weapons and combat vehicles that had been unloaded from the two ships at the port of Al-Mukalla,” the alliance said, according to the Saudi state news agency.
AFP footage of the port showed dozens of parked military vehicles and pick-ups, several of which were burnt out and smouldering as workers hosed them down.
After the strikes, the leader of Yemen’s presidential council, which sits atop the Aden-based government, declared a state of emergency and cancelled a security pact with Abu Dhabi after the forces of the Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized swaths of territory.
The STC is also a key member of the government - a fractious patchwork of groups held together by its opposition to the Houthi rebels who control swaths of northern and western Yemen including the capital Sanaa.
Oil prices steady amid rising tensions in Gulf
Despite growing tensions between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, oil prices saw little change as investors took stock of the situation in the Middle East.
Brent crude futures for February delivery, which expire on Tuesday, were up by 24 cents, or 0.39 per cent, at $62.18 a barrel at 1315 GMT (6:15pm PKT). The more active March contract was up by 26 cents, or 0.42pc, at $61.75.
US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 26 cents, or 0.45pc, to $58.34.
The Brent and WTI benchmarks settled more than 2pc higher in the previous session as Saudi Arabia launched today’s airstrikes.

Despite renewed fears of potential supply disruptions, perceptions of an oversupplied global market remain and could cap prices, analysts say.
Prices are likely to trend downwards in the first quarter of 2026 because of a “growing oil glut”, said Marex analyst Ed Meir.
Meanwhile, Gulf equity indexes mostly ended lower on Tuesday as tension flared between regional oil powers and neighbours Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Dubai’s main share index retreated 2pc, LSEG data showed, while Abu Dhabi’s main index and Saudi Arabia both dropped 1pc each.
The Dubai index saw its biggest daily decline since June. Blue-chip developer Emaar Properties fell 2.8pc and Sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank lost 2.3pc.
Among Saudi shares, Saudi Arabian Mining Co slipped 2.6pc and Al Rajhi Bank eased 0.3pc. Oil giant Saudi Aramco was down 0.3pc.
‘A red line’
Saudi Arabia and the UAE - traditionally close allies who joined forces against the Houthis - have increasingly been at odds over the conflict as well as the war in Sudan.
“The Kingdom expresses its disappointment by the actions taken by the brotherly United Arab Emirates, pressuring the Southern Transitional Council’s forces to conduct military operations on the southern border of the Kingdom,” the Saudi foreign ministry statement said.







It called them “a threat to the Kingdom’s national security, as well as to security and stability in the Republic of Yemen and the region,” it said.
Abu Dhabi denied that it was behind the separatist offensive, saying it “condemns the claims made regarding the exertion of pressure or direction on any Yemeni party to carry out military operations that affect the security of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia”.
A source close to the Saudi military coalition told AFP on Tuesday after the strikes that a diplomatic solution remained on the table.
“The coalition was forced to do that. All diplomacy efforts met deaf ears,” said the source.
“Diplomacy is still an option to stop any further escalation.”
24-hour deadline
Riyadh also backed a demand from Yemen’s presidential council for Emirati forces to withdraw from the country within 24 hours, and urged Abu Dhabi to cut off military and financial support for Yemeni groups.
Rashad al-Alimi, head of the Presidential Leadership Council, issued decrees on Tuesday announcing a 90-day state of emergency and annulling a security pact with the UAE over the separatists’ advance.
The STC members of the council later rejected the decision, saying the move threatened to “drag Yemen into new confrontations”.
Following the strikes, broadcasters in Saudi Arabia aired segments showing surveillance footage of the alleged Emirati ships delivering the combat equipment to the port of Mukalla in southern Yemen.
The Saudi-led coalition said the ships had arrived from the UAE port of Fujairah, adding that the operation was conducted in accordance with international humanitarian law and without causing collateral damage.An official at the port said they had received an evacuation warning.
‘Unacceptable to God’
Abdullah Bazuhair, whose home overlooks the port, showed AFP the damage to his property, with windows blasted clear out of the walls and glass strewn across the floor.
The strikes were “unacceptable to God” he said, adding “the children were terrified and the women frightened”.
The Saudi-led coalition had warned that it would back Yemen’s government in any military confrontation with separatist forces and urged them to withdraw from recently seized territories in Hadramawt and Mahra governorates.
Tuesday’s strike came days after reported Saudi air raids on separatist positions in resource-rich Hadramawt last week.
A Yemeni military official said on Friday that around 15,000 Saudi-backed fighters were massed near the Saudi border but had not been given orders to advance on separatist-held territory.</p><small>2025-12-30 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/301647078f86924.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964120/soaring-prices-spark-australia-gold-rush-for-new-generation-of-fortune-hunters' target='_blank'><strong>Soaring prices spark Australia gold rush for new generation of fortune hunters</strong></a><br><p>In the hinterlands of Australia’s historic goldfields, Vicki Plumridge jumps for joy when she digs a small golden nugget out of the earth.
The retired retail worker was learning how to use her new metal detector when it started bleeping by the moss-covered ruins of a building. After Plumridge dug the nugget out of the shallow dirt with a plastic trowel, a guide estimated it was around 0.2 of a gram of gold, worth about $40 Australian Dollar ($26.58).
“But to me, it’s worth a million dollars,” said the 63-year-old, who had bought the detector only a few days before. “My heart is singing.”

Plumridge’s story is becoming more common, as hobbyists flock to Australia’s 9,600 sq km “golden triangle” in the heart of Victoria state, known as one of the world’s most prospective regions for gold nuggets.
Prospectors have been spurred on by record gold prices, social media, the success of TV show Aussie Gold Hunters, and a love for the outdoors, according to Reuters interviews with a dozen gold hunters.
Plumridge’s detector, Minelab’s Gold Monster 2000, which she bought for Australian Dollar $2,999, sold out across the country within weeks of its October 20 launch, according to Leanne Kamp, joint owner of Lucky Strike Gold, a prospecting shop in Geelong.

“It’s a great price point, and we have seen a big jump in sales this year, partly because the gold price has got everyone’s interest,” said Kamp, who has led prospecting tours since 2007.
“We get a lot of internationals. Next week we have some Germans coming. Germans love the gold. The Swiss seem to love the gold too. And we have some coming over from the US,” she said.
The chance of finding nuggets on historic sites improves with each iteration of detectors, which is why there is a rush for new models as soon as they are released, she added.
World’s biggest nuggets
Hobbyists have flocked to 19th-century gold rush towns like Ballarat, which laid the foundation for Melbourne’s early wealth and helped make Australia one of the world’s top three gold producers.

The region has yielded the world’s biggest nugget, the Welcome Stranger at 72kg, found in the 1860s, as well as the Hand of Faith, the largest nugget found with a metal detector at 27.2kg in 1980. As recently as February 2023, an amateur prospector unearthed a 4.6kg nugget in the region with a detector, according to the state government.
The lure of large nuggets is one of the draws for Damian Duke, 39, who works in construction. Duke used to go prospecting with his father, who died three years ago. Now he takes his own son, Ethan.

The 11-year-old inherited his grandfather’s detector, and Duke has recently upgraded his machine, he told Reuters.
“Where prices are now, you do have the chance of striking a life-changing piece of gold,“ he said.
Gold has chalked up successive records this year, surging above $4,500 a troy ounce on Friday. Goldman Sachs expects prices to reach $4,900 by the end of 2026, with further gains likely if private investors continue diversifying their portfolios amid geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty.
Global Phenomenon
In Victoria, fossickers must buy a permit from the state government. The permit allows them to fossick using only hand tools and to keep any gold they find.
Demand for the miner’s right permits, which cost Australian Dollar $28.60 each and last for a decade, has hit all-time highs, at almost 16,000 by November, from nearly 11,000 last year, according to figures from Victoria’s Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action, supplied exclusively to Reuters.
In total, there are more than 100,000 active miners’ right permits in Victoria.

A dream of riches may drive people to get out, but they stay out because of the psychological benefits that come from the focus on the hunt, being outside in nature, and connecting with others, prospectors said.
“It’s really good for your mental health, being out here. You take it all in, you can’t think about anything else - I love looking at all the wildflowers,” said Kelly Smith, a 50-year-old from the country town of Koondrook, who was prospecting with her partner on a training session organised by The Gold Centre in Maryborough.
“You’re not guaranteed to find anything. But you’re not going to find anything at all if you don’t look.”
Victoria’s latest gold rush is part of a broader phenomenon, said Ben Harvey, executive general manager of Minelab at Adelaide-headquartered Codan, which is the world’s largest maker of hand-held metal detectors.

Alongside Codan’s communications division, strong detector sales in its home market of Australia, as well as in Africa and the Americas, have helped double the firm’s share price this year.
In Africa, demand may be led by artisanal miners working in cooperatives to improve their standard of living, Harvey said. In Latin America, there is also recreational interest from hobbyists searching for coins and other treasures, he told Reuters in an interview.
Behind the success is a push by Codan’s team of engineers to improve technology to cut down on background noise so detectorists can focus on the gold, he said.
“What a prospector is looking for is, when they go out, they want to find gold, and they want to find more gold than they found last time,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-30 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642295-pa-speaker-proposes-legal-action-over-scuffle-during-kp-cms-arrival' target='_blank'><strong>PA speaker proposes legal action over scuffle during KP CM's arrival</strong></a><br><p>

Relations between Washington and New Delhi have become strained over the course of the year, due to US President Donald Trump’s sweeping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods and India’s discomfort over US engagement with Pakistan after the May conflict between the two South Asian rivals.
In a post on X, the US Embassy posted a message reading, “If you break US law, you will be punished with significant criminal penalties. The Trump Administration is committed to ending illegal immigration to the United States and protecting our nation’s borders and our citizens.”







Neither the US State Department nor US missions in Pakistan or other nations, including Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar or China, have issued similar warnings.
Since taking office in January this year, Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration in the US, rolling out policies and enacting mass deportations through 2025.
In February, a US military aircraft carried 104 deported Indians and landed in Amritsar. Although illegal Indian immigrants have been deported home by previous US administrations, it was the first time Washington used a military aircraft for the purpose.
In addition to deportations, Washington has made it harder for immigrants to obtain visas. In September, Trump ordered a $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled worker visas.
H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills — such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers — to work in the United States, initially for three years, but extendable to six years.
India’s foreign ministry said that the Trump administration’s move to increase H1-B visa fees was likely to have humanitarian consequences, warning of potential disruptions for families affected by the policy.
Similarly, India’s leading trade body Nasscom said the timeline for implementing the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas for high-tech workers in the United States was a “concern”.
Since his inauguration on January 20, Trump’s administration has revoked around 80,000 non-immigrant visas for offences ranging from driving under the influence to assault and theft.
Around 16,000 of the visa revocations were tied to cases of driving under the influence, while about 12,000 were for assault and another 8,000 for theft.
“These three crimes accounted for almost half of revocations this year,” said a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
In August, a State Department spokesperson said Washington had revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and breaking the law, including a small number for “support for terrorism”.</p><small>2025-12-30 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/301740189ea799e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964123/karachi-mayor-urges-people-to-avoid-politicisation-after-child-drowns-in-open-manhole' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi mayor urges people to avoid politicisation after child drowns in open manhole</strong></a><br><p>A day after an eight-year-old boy drowned in an uncovered manhole in Karachi’s Mehran town, Mayor Murtaza Wahab urged people not to politicise the issue, saying that the child fell because the manhole cover “had been removed and put on the side”.
According to the Edhi Foundation, the number of people who died after falling into open manholes and drains across the metropolis rose to 27 in the outgoing year of 2025. Eight of them are children, the data says.
The child, identified as Dilbar, was playing outside his residence with other area children when the tragedy occurred, Korangi Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Fida Husain Janwari told Dawn.
Speaking to the media today, Mayor Wahab, in response to a fiery question about the issue of missing manhole covers, particularly the death of a child a day earlier and reports of missing covers on II Chundrigar Road, said: “The reports I have so far received from locals, I am in touch with the child’s family, indicate that it was not that there was no cover at all, but that it had been removed and placed on the side.”
Noting the tone of the question, he remarked, “Now that this question has been recorded, it will go viral, and that, unfortunately, is the real issue”.
He maintained that the issue could not be looked at through a “political lens”.
“The first thing I checked was if the Union Council […] was given the additional Rs100,000 I had announced? Yes, the money was disbursed.“
“The point being that we did whatever was in our capacity, but if someone removed the cover and put it on the side, then it is a problem that can not be seen through a political lens,” Mayor Wahab maintained.
He stressed that it was vital to “look at what the real issue is“.
In reference to PTI‘s Alamgir Khan, who is known for his ‘Fix It’ campaign, the mayor said, “Yesterday, a person from a certain party went to II Chundrigar and said that his team had installed missing covers; however, later they went missing”.
“So did I remove the covers?” he asked.
“It means someone stole them,“ he said, urging people to address the issue “based on merits, rather than politicising it”.
Earlier this month, the body of a three-year-old boy, Ibrahim, who fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal was recovered on December 1, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.
Following the tragedy, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials.
The incident also prompted the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to increase the budget of 246 union committees (UCs) to exclusively maintain manhole covers and streetlights.</p><small>2025-12-30 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/30154605df33cce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964113/a-timeline-of-key-moments-in-saudi-uae-relations' target='_blank'><strong>A timeline of key moments in Saudi-UAE relations</strong></a><br><p>A Saudi airstrike on what it said was a weapons shipment in Yemen on Tuesday marked the most significant escalation between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to date. Once the twin pillars of regional security, the two Gulf heavyweights have seen their interests diverge on everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.
Here is a timeline of how the relationship has evolved:
2011:
As the Arab Spring spreads, the two form a unified front against extremist movements, deploying joint forces to Bahrain to quell an uprising and coordinating support for Egypts 2013 military overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood government.
March, 2015:
They launch a military intervention in Yemen to restore the government ousted by the Houthis rebels. UAE troops lead ground operations, while Saudi air power controls the skies.
June, 2017:
The allies lead a boycott of Qatar, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism, charges it denies. The move cements the alignment between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (MBZ).
2019:
The UAE draws down troops in Yemen, shifting strategy but retaining influence through the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), leaving Riyadh to shoulder the war against the Houthis.
September, 2020:
The UAE normalizes ties with Israel under the US-brokered Abraham Accords. Saudi Arabia, the custodian of Islam’s two holiest sites, declines to follow suit, insisting on Palestinian statehood first, giving Abu Dhabi a unique diplomatic channel to Washington.
January, 2021:
Saudi Arabia leads the Al-Ula summit to end the Qatar dispute. The UAE signs reluctantly, maintaining a cooler stance toward Doha.
February, 2021:
Riyadh challenges Dubai’s commercial dominance, telling foreign firms to move regional HQs to the kingdom by 2024 or lose state contracts.
July, 2021:
Economic rivalry spikes. Riyadh removes tariff concessions for goods from free zones, undercutting the UAE’s trade model. Simultaneously, a rare dispute erupts at OPEC as the UAE blocks a Saudi-led deal, demanding a higher crude oil production baseline.
April, 2023:
In Sudan’s war, Riyadh hosts ceasefire talks supporting the army, while UN experts accuse the UAE of arming the rival Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which Abu Dhabi denies.
December 8, 2025:
Tensions peak in Yemen as the UAE-backed STC seizes oilfields in Hadramout, crossing a Saudi “red line.”
December 30, 2025:
Saudi jets strike a vessel in Mukalla. The coalition says the ship was delivering heavy weapons to separatists, marking the first direct engagement between the partners’ interests.</p><small>2025-12-30 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/30172652bfb514e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964122/shaheen-shah-afridi-to-return-home-after-knee-injury-cuts-short-bbl-stint' target='_blank'><strong>Shaheen Shah Afridi to return home after knee injury cuts short BBL stint</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi has been forced to cut short his maiden Big Bash League stint after sustaining a knee injury while representing Brisbane Heat.
The left-armer suffered a cartilage injury while fielding during Heat’s last-over victory against Adelaide Strikers at the Gabba on Saturday night.
Following consultations between Brisbane Heat and the Pakistan Cricket Board’s medical staff, it was decided that Shaheen would return home for further treatment ahead of the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup, the club said in a statement on Tuesday.
A PCB spokesperson confirmed to Dawn that Shaheen will return to Pakistan on Wednesday, adding that the seriousness of the injury and the potential recovery timeline will be determined after meetings with the board’s doctors upon his return.
Shaheen expressed disappointment at leaving the tournament prematurely but thanked the franchise and its supporters for their hospitality.
“I have enjoyed myself a lot playing for Brisbane and I am sad that I will not be able to finish the season with the team,” Shaheen said in a statement released by the club.
“The BBL was everything I had heard it would be — lots of good, skilful cricket. I have enjoyed the challenge.”
In a post on X, the pacer reiterated his gratitude to the Heat, stating that he had been called back by the PCB to begin rehabilitation. “Hopefully, I will be back in the fields soon,” he wrote.
Shaheen featured in four matches for Brisbane Heat, claiming two wickets at an average of 76.50.
Brisbane Heat chief executive Terry Svenson praised Shaheen’s professionalism and impact on the squad despite his brief stay.
“Despite his season not finishing the way he would have liked, he has been a thorough professional,” Svenson said. “Our young bowlers have benefitted greatly from his advice and suggestions.”
Acting Heat captain Xavier Bartlett also lauded Shaheen’s contribution, describing his presence as “great value” for the bowling group.
The Heat are now exploring options to replace Shaheen for the remainder of the competition, while the 24-year-old will focus on recovery as Pakistan prepare for the T20 World Cup, set to be held in February-March.
The pacer, however, was not named in the Pakistan squad for the upcoming three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka — which is to be played in the second week of January.
His and Babar Azam’s exclusion from the roster came reportedly due to an arrangement between Cricket Australia and its Pakistan counterpart that required some national players to feature in the entirety of the competition.

Both nations have a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia also signed a landmark mutual defence agreement in September this year, which outlined that an attack on one party would be treated as an attack on both.
In a post on social media, the FO said that Dar expressed satisfaction with the positive trajectory of bilateral relations between Islamabad and Riyadh during the exchange, while Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan “reaffirmed his commitment to further strengthening and enhancing bilateral ties”.
Dar also conveyed season’s greetings and best wishes for the New Year, which were “warmly reciprocated” by Prince Faisal, the FO added.







Earlier today, the Saudi-led coalition struck what it described as foreign military support to southern separatists at Yemen’s Mukalla port.
Last Saturday, Pakistan expressed its full support for Saudi Arabia’s efforts to ensure peace and stability in Yemen.
“Pakistan expresses its full support for the diplomatic efforts being undertaken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for ensuring peace and stability in the Republic of Yemen. We also commend the efforts of the United Arab Emirates in this regard,” a statement from the FO read.
In November, the military leadership of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia vowed to enhance bilateral defence cooperation and reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen ties between the two countries.
“During the meeting, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional environment and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation,” the ISPR said. “The military leadership reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen the strong brotherly ties and enduring defence partnership between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.”

During his three-day visit to Lahore over the weekend, the KP chief minister had given an address at the Punjab Assembly to opposition MPAs last week. However, the visit was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
Speaking during the session today, Bokhari staged a walkout to show solidarity with journalists from the Punjab Assembly’s press gallery, who she said were “beaten and pushed around” by people accompanying the KP CM.
During yesterday’s assembly session, a statement by opposition member Col. (retd) Shoaib Amir about the press gallery, calling them “sellouts”, also sparked outrage.
“The whole world witnessed the spectacle in the assembly on the arrival of the KP CM,” she said, adding that preparations had been made for the chief minister’s arrival.
However, she claimed that the KP CM “brought unauthorised persons with him, who claimed to be journalists”.
She alleged that they beat up journalists from the press gallery and misbehaved with them.
“The footage is available in the assembly’s records,” she added.
She further said that rather than apologising, the opposition doubled down on their conduct.
“I was accused of planting journalists during the KP CM’s visit,” she said, questioning if it was wrong to ask the KP CM “how he was finding his Lahore visit”.
“I was told that I had paid my employees to pose as journalists,” she said, vowing that she intended to send a defamation notice.
“In solidarity with what happened with Punjab‘s journalists and with the members of the press gallery, I’m staging a walkout,” the minister said.
On Monday, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan had announced that an inquiry conducted into the chaos that marred the arrival of KP CM to the provincial legislature’s building would be sent to the law enforcement agencies.
Same day, chief minister Afridi, in a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, expressed “deep concern” at the treatment meted out to him during his Lahore visit, stating it was marked by “discourtesy and unnecessary hostility”.</p><small>2025-12-30 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/30160743fc5d5e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964114/election-tribunal-dismisses-yasmin-rashids-challenge-to-nawazs-na-130-win-in-2024-polls' target='_blank'><strong>Election tribunal dismisses Yasmin Rashid’s challenge to Nawaz’s NA-130 win in 2024 polls</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: An election tribunal dismissed on Tuesday incarcerated PTI leader Yasmin Rashid’s petition that challenged PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s victory from Lahore’s NA-130 in the 2024 general elections.
The tribunal, comprising retired Justice Rana Zahid Mahmood, dismissed Rashid’s plea on technical grounds.
It said in its decision that the petitioner had failed to comply with the requirements under the Election Act, 2017 for filing an election petition.
A written order of the tribunal is yet to be issued.
Rashid had filed the petition challenging Nawaz’s victory notification on April 16, 2024.
The petition argued that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had issued Sharif’s victory notification in violation of the law. Rashid requested in her plea to set aside the victory of the former prime minister and to declare her a returned candidate. She alleged that the ECP manipulated the election results to ensure her defeat.
The ECP had issued the notification of Nawaz’s victory from NA-130 on February 13 last year.
According to the ECP, Nawaz won the general election in the NA-130 constituency with 179,310 votes, while Rashid came second with 104,485 votes.</p><small>2025-12-30 11:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642258-peshawar-police-issue-performance-report-of-k9-units-sniffer-dogs' target='_blank'><strong>Peshawar Police issue performance report of K9 Unit's sniffer dogs</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement released on the social media platform X, the interior ministry said that Kundi called on the interior minister in Islamabad. It added that the two discussed security measures in KP’s border areas and ongoing operations against khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).







According to the statement, the interior minister gave assurances of the government’s full cooperation for peace and security in KP.
“Establishing peace in KP is the top priority,” he was quoted as saying. He said that the federal government was “prepared to provide support in this regard in every possible way”.
“We appreciate the sacrifices made by the people of KP in the war against terrorism,” Naqvi said.
“Fitna al Khawarij and their facilitators are being eliminated through joint efforts,” he added. “No leniency of any kind will be shown toward the khawariji,“ he said.
Meanwhile, Kundi said that the Centre’s cooperation was essential for establishing peace and security in the province.
“Joint and coordinated action is needed to eliminate terrorism,” he said.
On Sunday, Kundi had asked the KP government to support the military operations in the province as the security situation had significantly deteriorated due to militancy.
Speaking at the National Press Club, he said the KP government should support security operations, as “without stability, development projects could not move forward”.
Insecurity has a negative impact on the social and economic conditions of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said, adding that “sustained peace was essential for businesses and investment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa”.
According to statistics released by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), Pakis­tan’s counterterrorism scenario saw a marked escalation in 2025 — combat-related deaths rising by 73 per cent against the previous one — with violence intensifying and pushing several indicators to their highest levels in over a decade.
The year not only witnessed a steep rise in overall combat-related deaths, but also became the deadliest one for militants since 2015, the most lethal for security forces since 2011, and the worst for civilian casualties since 2015.</p><small>2025-12-30 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/3013595413ecc70.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964109/pia-to-resume-flights-to-london-from-march-after-6-year-hiatus' target='_blank'><strong>PIA to resume flights to London from March after 6-year hiatus</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced on Tuesday that it was resuming direct flights to London in March 2026 after a six-year hiatus.
In a statement, the PIA spokesperson said the national flag carrier was increasing its flights to the United Kingdom. He said the airline would operate four weekly flights from Islamabad to London from March 29, 2026.
He said that the flights would be operated from Heathrow Airport’s Terminal 4. “The flights are being resumed after a long gap of six years,“ he added.
The spokesperson further said that London was the airline’s “first-ever” international destination and remained one of its most important routes.
He maintained that the national carrier was already operating three weekly flights to Manchester.
In June 2020, the European Union Air Safety Agency had barred PIA from operating in EU countries over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers. The ban on flights followed the then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament, where he termed pilots’ licences “dubious”.
The European agency lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28, 2024. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain.
In September, PIA received the go-ahead to resume direct flights to the UK after a gap of nearly five years. Subsequently, the airline resumed flights to the UK, with flight operations to Manchester resuming in the first phase.
At the time, the airline had said it planned to extend operations to Birmingham and London as well.</p><small>2025-12-30 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642238-students-of-punjab-private-institutions-to-get-free-laptops-under-govt-scheme' target='_blank'><strong>Students of Punjab private institutions to get free laptops under govt scheme</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on X, the prime minister said,“Pakistan condemns the reported targeting of the residence of His Excellency Vladimir Putin, president of the Russian Federation.”
He said that such a “heinous act constitutes a grave threat to peace, security and stability, particularly at a time when efforts aimed at peace are underway”.
“We reiterate our firm rejection of all forms of violence and acts intended to undermine security and threaten peace,” he said.







While the premier did not mention any names, Russian has accused Ukraine of trying to attack Putin’s residence and vowed retaliation, a claim Kyiv dismissed as baseless and aimed at derailing arduous peace talks.
The angry exchanges between the warring neighbours on Monday, including a statement by Russia that it was reviewing its stance in negotiations in response to the attack, dealt a new blow to prospects for peace in Ukraine.
US President Donald Trump said Putin had told him about the alleged attack in a phone call on Monday morning, which had angered him. Still, Trump repeated his belief that a peace deal may be near.
“It’s one thing to be offensive,” Trump told reporters. “It’s another thing to attack his house. It’s not the right time to do any of that. And I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it.”
On Sunday, Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Florida and the US president said they were “getting a lot closer, maybe very close” to an agreement to end the war, although “thorny” territorial issues remained.
On Monday, Putin struck a defiant tone, telling his army to press on with a campaign to take full control of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region.
The Kremlin repeated demands for Kyiv to pull its forces out of the last part of the Donbas area that they still hold in eastern Ukraine.
Putin told Trump in Monday’s phone call that Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, was reviewing its stance following the reported drone attack, an aide said. Zelenskiy dismissed Russia’s allegation as “a complete fabrication” and the Kremlin’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war.
After the call with Putin, Trump told reporters outside his home in Palm Beach, Florida, that he had no further information about the alleged attack.
“I don’t like it, it’s not good,” Trump said. Asked if US intelligence agencies had evidence of such an attack, Trump said: “We’ll find out.”
Russia signals more hardline approach to ending war
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Ukraine had tried to attack Putin’s residence in the Novgorod region west of Moscow on December 28-29 with 91 long-range drones which were all destroyed by Russian air defences.
No one was injured and there was no damage, he said in comments reported by Russian media.
“Such reckless actions will not go unanswered,” Lavrov said in a statement, describing the attack as “state terrorism” and adding that targets had already been selected for retaliatory strikes by Russia’s armed forces.
Reuters could not independently verify Lavrov’s comments. Neither Lavrov nor any other Russian officials offered any evidence for the attack assertions. It was not clear where Putin was at the time.
Lavrov said the attack took place during negotiations about a possible peace deal, and said Russia would review its negotiating stance but not quit the negotiations.







Denying Ukraine had planned such an attack, Zelenskiy accused Russia of preparing the ground to strike government buildings in Kyiv.
“It is clear that we had a meeting with Trump yesterday, and it is clear that for the Russians, if there is no scandal between us and America, and we are making progress for them it is a failure, because they do not want to end this war,” Zelenskiy told reporters via WhatsApp.
He added: “I am sure they are simply preparing the ground for strikes, probably on the capital, probably on government buildings.”</p><small>2025-12-30 09:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642241-pia-to-resume-islamabad-london-flights-from-march-29-after-six-year-hiatus' target='_blank'><strong>PIA to resume Islamabad-London flights from March 29 after six-year hiatus</strong></a><br><p>

A special test day in October in Nottingham aimed to address a major gender gap in F1, one of the flashiest of sports.
Italian Lella Lombardi was the last woman to compete in an F1 Grand Prix in 1976, and the absence of women on the circuit is linked to young girls’ limited exposure to motorsports, according to gender parity organisations.
More Than Equal, a non-profit that supports women drivers, said girls start karting two years later than boys on average. Seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton, for example, got into the format aged just eight.
“These are the first steps that a girl could take,” Cameron Biggs, coaching and academy pathway manager at Motorsport UK, told AFP.
“We’re really trying to join the dots between grassroots and elite.”

The enthusiasm was palpable among the youngsters, who were mostly new to karting.
Some attended the taster day, supported by makeup company Charlotte Tilbury, after watching F1 while others were encouraged by their parents.
None seemed put off by F1’s breakneck speed, the thrumming engines and the prospect of driving a vehicle years before they are old enough to have a driver’s licence.
“On the second time, I came first and I’m very proud,” beamed 11-year-old Megan.
“I watch Formula 1 quite often, and so I kind of know how to get around the track,” said Erin, also 11.
F1 paradox
F1’s official website boasts a global fanbase of 827 million people — a 63 per cent increase since 2018.
But there is a paradox: F1 is one of the world’s few non-gender-segregated sports yet one of the most male-dominated.
“We know that the pathway for female drivers hasn’t successfully got a woman into Formula One competitively in the last 50 years,” More Than Equal’s head of driver development Lauren Forrow told AFP.
That means that girls are “not thriving within” the current system, she said.

The organisation has pledged to “make history” by training a woman not just to compete but to win.
“We know that this is a real challenge and that it’s never been done before,” CEO Tom Stanton told AFP.
More Than Equal lists limited access to motorsports at an early age, cultural and structural biases, sponsorship gaps and a lack of role models at the top as barriers obstructing women’s entry into F1.
Forrow said the organisation’s unique Driver Development Programme “acknowledges the physiological, psychological and technical
differences” women face, such as the impact of menstruation on athletic abilities and daily life.
These realities “inform what the kind of right recipe is for supporting female athletes in this space”, she said, of the programme created for young female racing drivers.
‘Nobody to look up to’
Fifteen-year-old Skye Parker, from Trelogan, North Wales, told AFP she is determined to become “Formula 1 world champion”, having started karting aged six and now loving the “feeling of excitement” she gets on the track.
On a wet December day, the assured teenager did laps in a Formula 4 car on Spain’s Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. It has a challenging layout and is used by More Than Equal to hone the skills of female drivers.
F4, for junior drivers, is an essential stepping stone for drivers on their way to the top.
Parker’s personalised pink-and-green helmet distinguished her from other drivers as she drove for 45 minute stretches, concluding each session with a technical debrief.
Parker told AFP there are more women than before, but noted “boys definitely outnumber us”.
“It is quite sad that there is nobody to look up to female-wise in Formula One,” she said.
On top of obstacles unique to women, F1 is an “incredibly expensive” sport to pursue, Forrow said.
In Nottingham, Marcus McKenzie stood on the sidelines, using a headpiece to instruct his eight-year-old daughter Georgia as she rocketed around the karting track — at 40 kilometres per hour, somewhat slower than the average speeds of 220 miles per hour characteristic of a Grand Prix.
The single father conceded that the cost of the sport made things difficult, but he is hoping to secure sponsorship for Georgia and her 11-year-old brother who is also passionate about F1.
But money was far from the minds of the youngsters, who were exhilarated as they stepped off the track.
“Don’t be shy to do it. Just be brave and have fun,” was eight-year-old Thea’s message to other girls her age.

An Arif Habib group-led consortium had won the auction for the airline with a bid of Rs135 billion last week after a competitive process, marking the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.



The investment firm‘s chairman spoke about the development on DawnNewsTV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’ — televised on Monday night — where he was asked about PIA employees’ concerns, reservations and protests regarding their jobs against the backdrop of the airline’s privatisaion.
In response, Habib said the “number of staff [in the airline] was reasonable”, adding that the privatisation would in fact increase employment on the whole as an expansion was planned and, therefore, more team members would be required.
But, he continued, a major issue would be that of “quality and performance”.
“And we have come to know that most of these people are very competent,“ he said, adding that Pakistanis were generally capable people.
Moreover, Habib said PIA had an “excellent track record” and that at one time, it was the world’s second-best airline. “These are the same people who made it the second-best airline.”
Similarly, he added, PIA had also played “a very important role“ in the establishment of Emirates, Singapore and Malta airlines.
“This means Pakistanis have the skill, and if they are given confidence, a proper platform and support, then I think these people can run PIA well.
“We hope that they will play their role in bringing its (PIA’s) past glory back,” he added.
A day after PIA’s privatisation, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali had also told Reuters during an interview that the buyer must retain all employees for 12 months after the transaction, with contracts unchanged.
Habib was also asked about Fauji Fertiliser Company during the interview.
Fauji Fertliser was initially in the race to acquire PIA shares but it later opted out of the bidding process. After the PIA auction, it joined the consortium led by Arif Habib Corporation Limited.
Confirming the development, Arif Habib had earlier told Dawn that the company had joined his consortium and discussions were under way to finalise the terms and conditions of the partnership.
Speaking about it on ‘Doosra Rukh’, he said Fauji Foundation Company was part of the consortium as a shareholder of PIA.
He also said he had met Chief of Defence Forces and Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on two occasions before PIA’s privatisation — first in Karachi and then in Rawalpindi. On both occasions, he said, other businessmen and industrialists were also present, and the Field Marshal had emphasised that local businesses should show interest and invest in the airline.</p><small>2025-12-30 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/301211484233608.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964101/case-registered-against-lawyers-after-youtuber-rajab-butt-roughed-up-during-court-appearance-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Case registered against lawyers after YouTuber Rajab Butt roughed up during court appearance in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A first information report (FIR) has been registered against more than a dozen lawyers after YouTuber Rajab Butt was physically assaulted during a court appearance in Karachi on Monday, it emerged on Tuesday.
On Monday, Butt was physically assaulted, allegedly by some lawyers, at the Karachi City Court premises during the hearing of his bail plea in a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, said on X that “a few lawyers launched a life-threatening attack on him within the court premises”.
A video of the incident showed Butt, clad in a shirt torn from places, moving through a crowd surrounding him.
The FIR of the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was subsequently registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer, Ashfaq. It named Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers”. It should be mentioned that Solangi is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.
The FIR was regisisted under sections 147 (punishment for rioting), Section 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), Section 382 (Theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft), Section 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation), and Section 337-A (Punishment of shajjah) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The complainant said that his client had arrived at City Court at 9am to seek bail in a case registered against him under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the PPC.
“However, when we reached the inner premises near the West building, Solangi and Fatah, along with 15-20 other lawyers, attacked and started beating my client,” he alleged. He further said that his client was injured in the attack.
“The attackers assaulted me as well and other lawyers from my office,” Ashfaq said.
He further added that during the attack, his client Butt was holding a bag containing Rs300,000, which was snatched from him. He said that Solangi later returned the bag, but the cash was missing.
He also said that his client was then forcibly taken to the additional district and sessions judge (Central), where they “threatened to kill my client”.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that so far no one had been arrested.
Advocate Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers.
On Monday, Ashfaq had said that the attackers continued to beat him (Butt) despite being repeatedly asked to stop“. “Taking the law into their hands is weakening the reputation of lawyers in the country,“ he added.
Another video had showed Butt walking along with a group of lawyers, who were raising slogans “Karachi Bar Zindabad” (long live Karachi Bar). Among them was also Solangi.
Tiktoker Nadeem Mubarak, also known as Nani Wala, was also present on the occasion and was seen in one of the videos.</p><small>2025-12-30 07:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/30071624cb42cd7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-dies-at-80-after-prolonged-illness' target='_blank'><strong>Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, dies at 80 after prolonged illness</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday.
Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.
“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the Fajr prayer,” the party said in a statement.







“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus said Bangladesh “has lost a great guardian”.
“Through her uncompromising leadership, the nation was repeatedly freed from undemocratic conditions and inspired to regain liberty,” the Nobel Peace Prize winner said in a statement.
“I pray for the eternal peace and forgiveness of Begum Khaleda Zia’s soul,” ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina said, in a statement on social media by her now banned Awami League party.







Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Hasina last year.
Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.
But in late November, she was rushed to hospital, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.
Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.
She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.

There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.
Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.
Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.
Bangladesh declares three-day state mourning
Bangladesh declared three days of state mourning, with Khaleda’s funeral to be held on Wednesday.
Interim leader Yunus, in a television broadcast to the nation, appealed for calm.
“I humbly appeal to everyone to maintain discipline while observing all forms of mourning, including the funeral prayers. I know you are all deeply emotional at this time,” Yunus said.
“I hope that during this difficult period, you will show utmost patience and support one another in carrying out her last rites, including the funeral.”
Asif Nazrul, who holds the law portfolio in the interim government, said the funeral prayers would be held in front of parliament after midday prayers, and that Zia would then be buried alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman.
‘Committed friend to Pakistan’
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened by Khaleda’s passing. “Her lifelong service to Bangladesh and its growth and development leaves a lasting legacy,” he said.
“Begum Zia was a committed friend of Pakistan. My government and the people of Pakistan stand with the people of Bangladesh in this moment of sorrow,” he said.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends and the people of Bangladesh during this difficult time,” he said.







President Asif Ali Zardari said Khaleda’s “leadership and services will be remembered with respect”.







Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also expressed his condolences at Khaleda’s passing.







Separately, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Zia’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall.







‘Battling begums’
Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.
Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of “liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness”.
She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh’s founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990.
But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed “the battling begums”.
Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals.
Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades.
In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the Jamaat-e-Islami.
In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, who was elected three years earlier.
Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win.
Her second term was marred by the rise of militants and allegations of corruption.
In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded.
Khaleda’s government and its allies were widely blamed.
In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh’s highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated.
Detention and freedom
Although Khaleda later clamped down on radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.
The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.
Khaleda never regained power.
With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.
Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.
In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister — charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.
She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.
Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina’s ouster.
In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.</p><small>2025-12-30 07:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642217-ex-spymaster-faiz-hamid-files-appeal-against-military-court-sentence-says' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-spymaster Faiz Hamid files appeal against military court sentence, says lawyer</strong></a><br><p>

Sajid Akram and his son Naveed allegedly killed 15 people in an ISIS-inspired attack targeting a Jewish festival on December 14.
The pair travelled to the southern Philippines in the weeks before shooting, fuelling suspicions they may be linked to extremists.

 

Australian Federal Police commissioner Krissy Barrett said so far, this did not appear to be the case.
“These individuals are alleged to have acted alone,” she told reporters.
“There is no evidence to suggest these alleged offenders were part of a broader terrorist cell, or were directed by others to carry out the attack.”
Barrett said police would continue to probe why the pair travelled to the city of Davao, where CCTV showed they barely left their budget hotel.
“I want to be clear. I am not suggesting they were there for tourism,” she said.
Police believe the duo “meticulously planned” the attack for months, and have released pictures showing them training with shotguns in the Australian countryside.
They also recorded a video in October railing against “Zionists” while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State group, police have said.
Sajid Akram, 50, was shot and killed by police during the attack. An Indian national, he entered Australia on a visa in 1998.
Gun crackdown
His 24-year-old son, Naveed, an Australian-born citizen, remains in custody charged with 15 murders and a litany of other serious offences.
New Year’s Eve parties across Sydney will pause at 11pm (5pm PKT) on Wednesday for a minute of silence in memory of the victims.
Crowds will be watched over by squads of police carrying high-powered firearms, New South Wales state premier Chris Minns said on Tuesday.
“That is a clear and deliberate message from the police that safety is the number one priority,” he told reporters.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a nationwide crackdown on gun ownership and hate speech in the wake of the attack, promising stricter laws and harsher penalties.
He has announced a sweeping buyback scheme to “get guns off our streets”.
It is the largest gun buyback since 1996, when Australia tightened firearms laws in the wake of a mass shooting that killed 35 people at Port Arthur.
Albanese has also ordered a review of police and intelligence services.</p><small>2025-12-30 06:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642212-india-expedites-massive-hydropower-projects-on-chenab-river' target='_blank'><strong>India expedites massive hydropower projects on Chenab River</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan has stated that Israel’s “unlawful recognition” is “deeply troubling” against the backdrop of previous references to it being a “destination for the deportation of Palestinian people, especially from Gaza”. The remarks were made by Pakistan’s Deputy UN Ambassador Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon during a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) briefing on Israel’s recognition of Somaliland.
Israel became the first country to recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday.
In his remarks, Jadoon said, “Against the backdrop of Israel’s previous references to ‘Somaliland’ of the Federal Republic of Somalia as a destination for the deportation of Palestinian people, especially from Gaza, its unlawful recognition of ‘Somaliland’ region is deeply troubling.“
In March, the Associated Press reported that the US and Israel had reached out to officials in Sudan, Somalia and Somaliland to discuss using their territories as potential destinations for forcibly relocating Palestinians from Gaza.
“For decades, Israel’s dispossession and occupation of Palestinian land have been a central source of instability and conflict in the Middle East. It is now exporting this destabilising conduct to the Horn of Africa, with serious implications for regional peace and security,” he said.
He said that Pakistan unequivocally rejected any proposals or plans aimed at the forced displacement of Palestinians. He noted that a previous UNSC resolution had endorsed US President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan, noting that it stated that “no one will be forced to leave Gaza”.







“Any actions that advocate or imply displacement or resettlement not only violate international law but also undermine the prospect of a just and lasting peace,” he said.
“We reaffirm our steadfast support for the Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for self-determination. The only path to lasting peace and stability lies in the realization of an independent, contiguous and sovereign state of Palestine on pre-1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital,” he said.
In his remarks, Jadoon also expressed Pakistan‘s “unwavering and steadfast support to the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity” of Somalia. He condemned Israel’s “unilateral and unlawful recognition” of Somaliland, calling it a direct assault on Somalia’s international borders.
“The ‘Somaliland’ region remains an integral, inseparable, and inalienable part of Somalia. No external actor has either the legal standing or the moral authority to alter that fundamental reality,” he said. He also highlighted that a group of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation countries and Pakistan had rejected Israel’s move.
The envoy also said that “continued, predictable support for Somalia’s security sector and stabilisation efforts remains indispensable for preserving the hard-won gains against terrorism”.
“Therefore, at this pivotal juncture, when Somalia is focused on defeating extremism, any action that diverts attention, weakens cohesion, or fuels division is profoundly irresponsible,” he said.
He concluded his remarks by calling on the UNSC and the international community to reject all actions that “undermine Somalia’s unity and territorial integrity”.
“On our part, we remain firmly and resolutely committed to standing with the government and people of Somalia in the country’s march toward peace and prosperity,” he said.
Meanwhile, the 22-member Arab League, a regional organisation of Arab states in the Middle East and parts of Africa, said it rejected “any measures arising from this illegitimate recognition aimed at facilitating forced displacement of the Palestinian people or exploiting northern Somali ports to establish military bases,” Arab League UN Ambassador Maged Abdelfattah Abdelaziz told the UNSC.
Somalia’s UN Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman said Council members Algeria, Guyana, Sierra Leone and Somalia “unequivocally reject any steps aimed at advancing this objective, including any attempt by Israel to relocate the Palestinian population from Gaza to the northwestern region of Somalia“.







Meanwhile, the United States defended Israel’s right to recognise the breakaway territory, comparing it to the recognition of a Palestinian state by numerous countries.
“Israel has the same right to conduct diplomatic relations as any other sovereign state,” Tammy Bruce, deputy US ambassador to the UN, said.
“Earlier this year, several countries, including members of this council, made the unilateral decision to recognise a nonexistent Palestinian state, and yet no emergency meeting was called to express this Council’s outrage,” she added, accusing colleagues of “double standards”.
Slovenian ambassador Samuel Zbogar, whose country has recognised the Palestinian state, rejected Washington’s comparison.
“Palestine is not part of any state. It is illegally occupied territory, as declared by the International Court of Justice, among others,” while Somaliland “is part of a UN member state and recognising it goes against” the UN Charter, Zbogar said.
United Kingdom Ambassador James Kariuki reaffirmed the country’s support for “the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia”.
Israel’s representative Jonathan Miller said the move was “not a hostile step towards Somalia, and it does not preclude future dialogue between the parties,” calling it “an opportunity to strengthen stability”.</p><small>2025-12-30 04:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/30092512c8babdc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963971/law-enforcers-in-karachi-thwart-plot-to-use-radicalised-schoolgirl-for-suicide-bombing' target='_blank'><strong>Law enforcers in Karachi thwart plot to use ‘radicalised schoolgirl for suicide bombing’</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A major terror plot was thwarted by law enforcers in the city on Monday as they rescued a school-going teenage girl who had been radicalised through social media by an outlawed militant group and was being prepared for a suicide attack in Karachi.
This was shared by Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar during a press conference at the Central Police Office.
The minister said that the girl was detained during routine checking by police on the outskirts of Karachi and during the investigation, she revealed the details of the potential terror attack.
Mr Lanjar said that the girl belonged to an ordinary family in Balochistan and had been radicalised by anti-state elements through social media before being recruited by a banned group. She was shown fictitious heroic stories of past suicide bombers and was trained through WhatsApp groups to carry out a suicide attack in Karachi. However, law enforcers “foiled the terrorists’ nefarious designs by rescuing her in time,” he added.
He also said that the girl’s father, a government servant, had passed away, while her mother was alive. One of her brothers is serving in the Balochistan police while the other is employed in a government department.

Home minister claims girl from Balochistan detained during routine checking on city outskirts; alleges outlawed BLA brainwashed her

Additional Inspector General of Police (CTD) Azad Khan said the girl was studying at a local school in Balochistan and that the family’s sole source of income was her father’s government pension. She was initially provided hate material through a mobile phone to mentally condition her. Later, an Instagram handler linked to the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) contacted her, shared extremist content and added her to a WhatsApp group where anti-state material was regularly circulated.
He said the girl was persuaded to “perform a big act” and was gradually trained towards suicide bombing. One day, she left her home and met a woman outside Karachi, who took her to another location where she was further indoctrinated before being sent to Karachi. During police checking, she failed to give satisfactory answers and was taken to a women’s police station, where she disclosed the entire story during debriefing.
The CTD chief said that on the directions of the home minister, authorities had decided not to apply the normal legal process against her and instead adopt a restorative justice approach. “We will treat her as a victim, not an accused,” he said, adding that no explosive or suicide material was recovered from her possession. However, he said her brainwashing was complete and she was close to the “execution phase” when she was rescued.
Responding to a question, the home minister said it was an “open secret” that the BLA was destabilising Pakistan with the direct support of India.
Additional IGP Karachi Javed Alam Odho, the rescued girl, and her mother were also present at the press conference.
In a recorded video message, the girl said she was a student who aspired to become a teacher. She said she first came across a story about Shari Baloch on social media. 
It is pertinent to mention here that Shari Baloch had carried out a suicide attack to target Chinese academics at Karachi University in 2022.
The girl said she developed curiosity about how an educated woman like Shari became a suicide bomber. She watched videos and read material that made her believe there was “some truth” in the propaganda. Gradually, her mindset changed after watching videos and songs glorifying the suicide bomber.
The girl said she now realizes that social media handlers who speak softly and show sympathy are actually “hunters.” She questioned why they do not radicalise their own daughters.
In her video message, the girl’s mother thanked the law enforcement agencies for saving her daughter and protecting their family’s honour.

Uncertainty, rather than cost alone, has emerged as the most damaging factor, eroding livelihoods, weakening regional connectivity and placing disproportionate strain on border communities between the two countries.

 

These concerns were raised at an online dialogue on “Exploring Pathways to Pakistan-Afghanistan Trade and Economic Connectivity” organised by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) as part of it’s the beyond boundaries initiative on Monday.
The dialogue convened policymakers, customs officials, business leaders, and economic experts from Pakistan and Afghanistan to reflect on the evolving trade dynamics and their broader regional implications.
Khan Jan Alokozay, Co-President of the Pakistan-Afghanistan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PAJCCI), said peace in the region was inseparable from economic stability, adding that robust and predictable trade formed the foundation of durable bilateral relations. Without continuity in trade, he cautioned, broader objectives of peace and regional integration would remain fragile.
Fazal Moqeem Khan, former president Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, called for the establishment of cross-border economic zones to institutionalise trade and transit cooperation with manufacturers on both sides collaborating and heightening joint stakes and move beyond ad hoc arrangements. He warned that isolated or one-sided approaches to trade were not viable and will ultimately weaken both economies.
Highlighting the human cost of trade disruptions, Mujeeb Shinwari, president All Torkham Customs Clearing Agents Association, noted that border communities bear the brunt of repeated closures as their economic lifelines depend directly on cross-border trade. He observed that persistent disruptions had crippled local economies and undermined livelihoods in already vulnerable areas.
Emphasising the political economy of trade, Naqeebullah Safi, executive director AJCCI’s Kabul office, said trade should shape politics rather than be subordinated to it. He noted that while elite groups retain mobility through air travel, lower-income and border populations have suffered disproportionately, warning that continued uncertainty risks permanently diverting Afghan markets away from Pakistan and vice versa.
Ibrahim Shams, former vice president Afghanistan Investment Support Agency (AISA), said economic deprivation lied at the core of instability. He cautioned that prolonged trade blockages exacerbate insecurity rather than mitigate it with ordinary citizens bearing the heaviest costs.

 

Mohammad Ibrar Aimal, an Afghan scholar, highlighted how sustained disruptions have stalled production, disrupted supply chains and resulted in job losses, particularly in agriculture-linked and small-scale industries operating across Pakistan, Afghanistan and the wider region.
Ahmad Shah Yarzada, an Afghan businessman, called for a unified appeal for the normalisation of trade and economic activity, jointly led by traders, tribal elders and border communities on both sides. He noted that with Pakistan–Afghanistan trade repeatedly disrupted, many Afghan businesses have started pivoting towards Iran and Central Asia. While these alternative routes involve higher operational costs, they offer greater certainty, underscoring the urgent need to restore stability and predictability in Pakistan-Afghanistan trade relations.
Focusing on operational challenges, Arbab Qaiser, chief customs wing, FBR Islamabad, highlighted recent efforts to address the issue of pending containers at ports, pointing to measures aimed at easing clearance delays and reducing bottlenecks. He said the interlinked nature of regional economic dependencies required improved operational coordination and smoother communication among relevant stakeholders on both sides.
A common concern raised during the dialogue was the lack of organised and coordinated engagement by chambers of commerce, which has limited structured communication between traders and implementing authorities. The participants stressed the need for stronger private-sector coordination and more organised advocacy to collectively identify procedural bottlenecks and support smoother trade and transit operations.
Imtiaz Gul, executive director CRSS, warned that prolonged deadlock in trade and economic connectivity carried consequences far beyond immediate commercial losses. He said sustained disruptions shrink employment opportunities, expand informal economies and intensify social pressures, ultimately undermining long-term regional stability.

NEW DELHI / ISLAMABAD: India’s Ministry of Environment has been pondering clearances for a slew of controversial hydroelectric projects on the Chenab River in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident earlier this year. Yet, it does not seem to share serious apprehensions that leading environmentalists have expressed over their threat to a fragile Himalayan ecology.
Last week, a panel under the ministry approved the 260-megawatt Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Kishtwar district of India-held Jammu and Kashmir, according to The Hindu.
Earlier, in October, it was reported that environmental clearances were revived for the larger Sawalkote hydro-electric project on the same river.
The clearances came against the backdrop of India unilaterally suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) after blaming Pakistan over the Pahalgam incident — an allegation Islamabad had denied, terming the suspension of the 1960 treaty “an act of war”.
Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab.
At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty.
The projects
The Sawalkote project has been in the works for decades, and has faced numerous delays related to forest clearances and the compliance compulsions of the Indus Waters Treaty. As of now, the 1,856MW project is still said to be in the pre-construction stage. Its environment clearances have been reheated several times over.
The Dulhasti Stage II is a 258MW project, conceived as a complementary run-of-the-river scheme to utilise the water discharged from the existing 390MW Dulhasti Power Station “more efficiently”. It is a smaller component of the frequently discussed Chenab basin projects. It is expected to cost around $35 million.
According to The Hindu, “With the treaty now in abeyance, the centre is pushing ahead with several hydroelectric projects in the Indus basin, such as Sawalkote, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai I and II.”
The total land requirement for the project is estimated at 60.3 hectares. This project will require 8.27 hectares of private land from two villages, Benzwar and Palmar, in Kishtwar district, The Hindu reported.
Environmental concerns
The question environmentalists are posing focuses greatly on a primary concern related to climate change.
Water bodies are drying up rapidly. Chenab forms at the confluence of Chandra and Bhaga rivers in Lahaul and Spiti, Himachal Pradesh. According to the Indus Waters Treaty, Chenab is a Western River, allocated to Pakistan. India is permitted limited consumption use and unlimited non-consumption use of Chenab.
From the treaty’s signing up to the year 2004-05, studies estimate that glacial volume in the Chenab basin has reduced by a whopping 33.3pc.
This is what the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People NGO says: “For a river whose flows are made up of 50% meltwater when it leaves India at Akhnoor, this is shocking for both India and Pakistan”.
“Glaciers, the water stored in them, the slow release of this water in spring and summers is the key to water security of the entire Himalayan region. Sixty per cent irrigation in the entire Indus basin depends on glacial melt. As the glaciers are concentrated in the Indian Himalayas, their health and sustenance is crucial for millions in both countries.”
In the Hindu mythology, the River Saraswati, which is said to have made up a troika with the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, disappeared in ancient times. In the real world, many more rivers and water bodies face a similar fate. Chenab is among them.
Sherry expresses alarm
While there was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, former climate change minister Senator Sherry Rehman protested against this weaponisation of water, saying that it was “neither sane nor acceptable”.
In a post on X, the PPP leader wrote, “In flagrant violation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), India has just given approval to the Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K).
“As per the IWT, which cannot be unilaterally revoked, as recent UN rapporteurs have confirmed, Pakistan has control over the waters of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers, while the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers fall under India’s control,” she said.







“Following the illegal suspension of the treaty, India has decided to fast-track several disputed hydroelectric projects in the Indus Basin. These projects include Sawalkot, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai-1 and 2. Dulhasti Stage-II is considered part of this strategy,” she said.
“This weaponisation of water is neither sane nor acceptable in a region on the frontlines of climate change and environmental stress. It will inflame tensions in a bilateral relationship already bristling with hostility and distrust,” she said.

In a media briefing after a cabinet meeting here, Mr Jan said that the PTI delegation comprising provincial ministers and members of the assembly and led by CM Afridi, which just concluded a visit to Punjab province to launch a street movement, achieved its objectives as restrictions prevented people from freely moving with PTI flags on Lahore roads.
He said the love of Punjab residents for the PTI was evident from the warm welcome accorded to the delegation on arrival in Lahore.
The chief minister’s aide regretted that the chief minister was denied permission to visit the houses of some PTI workers in the cantonment area.

CM tells cabinet that funding denial by Centre has badly hit uplift projects in tribal districts

He wondered if a chief minister’s entry to the cantonment area could be stopped, how a mob entered the Lahore corps commander’s house on May 9, 2023.
Mr Jan condemned the Punjab government’s conduct towards the KP chief minister during the Punjab visit.
“Curfew was imposed; roads were blocked;all those who invited the PTI team to their areas, were arrested and even members of the Christian community, who were celebrating Christmas, were taken into custody and bundled into a prison van before being taken away,” he said.
Mr Jan accused Punjab Minister for Information Azma Bukhari of allowing nine YouTubers entry to the Punjab Assembly and refusing the same to “genuine” journalists.
He said that the chief minister had ordered an inquiry into the “extra-judicial“ killing of two Swat residents in Gujranwala.
To a question, the aide to the CM said the provincial government wouldn’t allow new military operations in the province.
Earlier in the cabinet meeting, CM Afridi complained about the denial of the Accelerated Implementation Programme‘s funds to the Centre by the Centre, saying the long delays in the release of funding have severely hit work on development projects in the merged tribal districts, according to an official statement.
The chief minister said the federal government owed Rs4.758 trillion to KP and that the finance ministry tried to hold a media trial of the provincial government on the issue of fiscal releases through false propaganda.
He demanded that the federal government disclose complete details of funds released to all provinces and present a comparison of KP’s dues with those of other provinces and directed all departments to write formal letters regarding the outstanding payments and obtain written responses.
The cabinet approved the establishment of Takaful companies in the province in line with Islamic principles, according to Mr Jan.
He said the KP General Takaful Company and KP Family Takaful Company would be established, with Rs2 billion approved for the former and Rs3bn for the latter.
According to him, the General Takaful Company will cover health and other risk-related matters, while the Family Takaful Company will provide financial support to families in the event of the death of the family head.
The cabinet approved a supplementary grant of Rs3.825 ttrillion for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Safe Cities Projects for Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Lakki Marwat and Waziristan districts.
The aide to the CM said significant progress had been made on the Peshawar Safe City project, with 80 per cent of work completed on “some targets“ and over 50pc on others, while work on safe city projects in other cities was under way.
He said recommendations of the cabinet committee regarding the merger of the posts of risaldar and dafadar in the former Fata were laid before the meeting, which granted “nomenclature approval” to 16 remaining posts. These posts will be merged with police after the fulfillment of rules and regulations, according to him.
The cabinet approved the framework as per the prevailing conditions for maintaining the quota system for students from the erstwhile Fata in medical and other educational institutions on a merit basis after dividing South Waziristan into two districts.
It also granted approval to the establishment of a KP cell for the National Finance Commission in the Small Industrial Development Board Plaza in Islamabad, reconstitution of the KP Trade Testing Board, and Rs199 million funding for security and other development needs around the Rashakai CPEC Economic Zone.
The cabinet accepted the proposal to grant Rs168 million to the KP Education Foundation besides budget estimates of the KP Housing Authority and the purchase of four Rs49 million vehicles for the Mansehra Gravity Water Supply Scheme.
It approved financial assistance to compensate owners of rickshaws, petrol pumps, shops, vehicles, flour mills and factories for losses incurred during the 2025 flashfloods.
The cabinet allowed authorities to launch a three-year Ehsaas Education Internship Programme with an initial allocation of Rs207 million for the current year to provide 850 talented youth with internship opportunities in schools every year.
It also approved new mechanisms for contracts for five outsourced hospitals, a special compensation package for those martyred and injured in the Pakistan-India war and an Rs1 million civilian victim compensation package for Shaheed Noor Rahman, son of former member of the United Ulema Board, Shaheed Mufti Fazl Rahman.
Amendments to the Rules of Business of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Service Commission were also approved during the cabinet meeting, according to the statement.

“In pursuance of its goal to further strengthen the risk management capacity of regulated financial institutions (banks, DFIs and MFBs), it has decided to introduce an additional set of shocks covering climate-related risks,” said a circular of the State Bank.
Consequently, Guidelines on Climate Stress Testing are being rolled out. Climate change has emerged as a significant challenge for the domestic economy and the financial system, said the SBP.
Another related circular issued by the SBP said Pakistan is among the most climate-vulnerable countries. “Consequently, its financial sector faces increasing exposure to physical and transition risks,” said the circular.

New guidelines aim to strengthen risk management as climate threats intensify

According to the SBP circular, the guidelines provide scenarios for climate-related single-factor shocks across physical and transition risks for SBP-regulated financial institutions (FIs). “The sample Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), as identified under D-SIBs Framework 2018, are now required to incorporate climate-related risks into their annual scenario analysis i.e., Macro Stress Testing (MST) exercise,” said the SBP.
The guidance will enable FIs to gauge the impact of climate-related risks on their lending portfolios and financial positions.
The circular said that the regulated FIs will conduct climate stress tests in addition to the exercises being carried out under FSD Circular No. 01 dated Sept 1, 2020.
The regulated FIs will conduct climate stress testing (single-factor) based on end-of-December data by the second quarter of the following year. However, the first iteration may be conducted by end of Q3CY26, based on end-December 2025 data.
The sample D-SIBs will conduct an annual MST exercise based on data as of December 31 (audited annual financials) and will also incorporate climate-related risks in the scenarios. The results will be included in the relevant section and submitted to SBP by June 30 of the following year.
The SBP, as part of its supervisory process, will regularly conduct its own in-house climate stress testing exercises and, if required, may engage with the regulated FIs for any risk mitigation measures/contingency plans based on the outcome of these exercises.
The SBP supervisory teams may also review the climate stress testing framework and processes of the regulated FIs.
Regulatory Framework
Recognising the potential impact of climate change on the financial sector’s resilience and soundness, the SBP has also issued the Regulatory Framework for Effective Management of Climate-related Financial Risks.
The framework aims to ensure that FIs effectively identify the climate risk drivers and integrate climate-related financial risk considerations into their governance, business strategy, and risk management frameworks.
“All FIs will ensure compliance with the framework by June 30, 2029. For the purpose, FIs are required to submit board-approved, time-bound implementation plans and targets to SBP by Sept 30, 2026,” said the circular.

ISLAMABAD: The telecom industry has demanded rational conditions in the spectrum auction policy expected to be announced by the federal cabinet in the coming days, suggesting that the government needs to prioritise long-term economic benefits over short-term revenue generation.
Telecom companies say spectrum is an invisible infrastructure but a crucial one as it drives digital connectivity — the foundation of modern life.
Financial technology adoption, freelancer platforms, and digital tools used by schools and hospitals all depend on mobile broadband capacity.
However, the problem is that while the demand for connectivity has surged in the country, spectrum availability remains scarce.
Currently, Pakistan has just 274 MHz of spectrum allocated nationwide, resulting in slow internet speeds, poor service quality, and limited innovation — constraining households, businesses and government institutions alike.
‘Economic realities’
Aamir Ibrahim, chief executive officer of Jazz, emphasised that Pakistan’s upcoming spectrum auction must reflect the economic realities of the telecom sector.
“Since operators earn in Pakistani rupees, spectrum pricing and payment structures should also be denominated in the same currency to ease financial pressure and accelerate network rollout,” he said in a statement.
Mr Ibrahim added that a pragmatic, long-term approach aligned with national objectives, similar to the PIA auction model, was essential to deliver affordable internet at scale and unlock Pakistan’s digital future.
Greater spectrum availability will also support freelancers, who contributed $400 million in remittances between July 2024 and March 2025 but remain constrained by unstable internet connectivity.
Nearly two-fifths of the country’s adult population remains financially excluded, as digital banking and microfinance services cannot scale without reliable connectivity.
Telecom operators also struggle with an average revenue per user of $1, which is one of the lowest globally, limiting their ability to reinvest in infrastructure.
‘Foundational reform’
The government’s recognition of this bottleneck and its decision to release more than 600 MHz of new spectrum is “therefore as a foundational reform”. It aligns with national digital goals and supports emerging technologies such as AI and the Internet of Things (IoT).
“The issue is no longer whether Pakistan needs more spectrum; it is how the auction is structured to accelerate digital progress,” the statement read. “The GSMA analysis shows that a two-year delay in releasing new spectrum could cost Pakistan $1.8 billion in GDP, while a five-year delay could exceed $4.3bn,” it added.
It warned that a “misaligned policy now means lost jobs, weaker exports and slower innovation”.
Mr Ibrahim stressed that spectrum pricing and policy must reflect domestic realities and national interest. “Clarity on future spectrum availability is essential to restore investor confidence, encourage competition and accelerate infrastructure deployment,” he added.
Rollout obligations, he continued, must prioritise imp­roved customer experience, wider rural access and service quality standards that empower the country’s digital economy.
“These are not concessions but economic enablers that turn spectrum from a one-time revenue stream into a productive long-term national asset,” he said.
“Every additional MHz carries measurable benefits for productivity, innovation, and inclusion.”
Successful test
Meanwhile, as 5G services are set to be launched in Pakistan, Zong and Huawei have successfully tested ultra-high-capacity backhaul technology to meet the growing data traffic in the country.
According to a statement, Zong, in collaboration with Huawei, completed Pakistan’s first field test of a full-duplex E-band microwave link.
With rapidly growing data demand driven by high-definition video streaming, augmented reality, cloud services and low-latency applications, traditional microwave backhaul solutions are facing increasing spectrum constraints.
The full-duplex E-band solution directly addresses these challenges, enabling next-generation network performance.
While the traditional microwave solutions are limited by spectrum resources, the new technology uses high-isolation integrated antenna structures and advanced interference cancellation algorithms to simultaneously send and receive data on the same frequency, double the spectrum efficiency — with a data transmission capacity of up to 50 Gbps per link.
“This innovative technology will be deployed in future network infrastructure, enabling Zong to offer faster, more reliable, and scalable connectivity services, providing users with a smoother and more stable network experience,” the statement read.
Zong’s Chief Technology Officer Mao Weiliang said ultra-high-capacity backhaul solutions were a foundation for Pakistan’s digital future.
“This advancement will support emerging technologies, enhance user experience, and contribute directly to national economic growth and digital inclusion,” Mr Mao added.
The company added that with the successful test, Zong had become the first operator in Pakistan to deploy full-duplex E-band technology, reinforcing its role in the country’s digital transformation.

The position is the highest rank within the Bugti tribe after Nawab Aali Bugti, who heads all six Bugti clans and was chosen as the Nawab following the death of his grand­father, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti.
According to historical records, the title of Chief of Bugti was conferred on Mir Sarfraz Bugti’s grandfather in the early 1800s, reflecting a long-standing tradition of tribal leadership and governance within the Bugti community.
The turban-tying (Dastar Bandi) ceremony was held in the Bekar area of Dera Bugti district and was attended by tribal chiefs, elders and pro­minent figures from the Bug­ti tribes. Mir Sarfraz Ahmed Bugti was formally adorned with the turban, marking his official elevation as Chief of the Bugti tribes.
Members of the Nawab Bugti family, including Nawab­­zada Zamran Saleem Akbar Bugti, were also present.
Addressing the gathering, Mir Sarfraz Bugti called for dialogue and negotiations with the state, urging armed Baloch groups to abandon violence and return to the national mainstream. He said the Baloch nation was being pushed into a futile war and stressed that no political or national objectives could be achieved through violence.
He appealed particularly to Baloch youths who have taken to the mountains to reconsider their path and opt for talks with the state. “I make this appeal on behalf of the state and the government to return and join national institutions. Other­wise, the state knows how to establish its writ,” he said.
The chief minister thanked the Bugti tribes for placing their trust in him, saying the turban was not merely an honour but a sacred responsibility. “This turban is a trust that demands justice, courage, brotherhood, love and sincerity. I promise to stand by you with honesty, hard work and full dedication, and I will never disappoint my people,” he said.
He said the trust reposed in him would be repaid thro­ugh dedicated service, parti­cularly in education. He not­­­ed that the Bugti community had lagged behind in education and said he had already facilitated the admis­sion of several children, including those from Bugti tribes, to institutions such as Lawrence College and Sadiq Public School, Bahawalpur.
Mr Bugti said he had accepted the role of Chief of the Bugti tribes with a deep sense of responsibility and pledged round-the-clock service to his people. He vowed to resolve issues faced by Bugti and neighbouring tribes through dialogue and reconciliation, and to pursue constructive solutions.
Condemning violence against civilians, he said killing unarmed people, labourers, Punjabi workers, engineers and doctors, as well as harassment of women, was against Baloch traditions. “We are custodians of Baloch traditions and cannot allow anyone to impose their ideology at gunpoint,” he said, adding that the writ of the state must be upheld at all costs.
Earlier, tribal elders formally honoured Mir Sarfraz Bugti as Chief of the Bugti tribes, with the turban placed on his head by Nawabzada Zamran Saleem Akbar Khan Bugti, brother of Nawab Mir Aali Khan Bugti, along with chiefs of various Bugti sub-tribes.
