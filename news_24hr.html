The British-flagged yacht Madleen, operated by the pro-Palestinian FFC, had departed from Sicily on June 6 and had hoped to reach Gaza later in the day, when the interception occurred, the group said on its Telegram account.
Among those on board the boat are Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament. The yacht is carrying a small shipment of humanitarian aid, including rice and baby formula.

The ministry said in a statement on X that the vessel “is safely making its way to the shores of Israel. The passengers are expected to return to their home countries”.
It said earlier that “the maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to unauthorised vessels under a legal naval blockade, consistent with international law”.
“Humanitarian aid is delivered regularly and effectively via different channels and routes and is transferred through established distribution mechanisms,” it added.
Earlier, Israeli forces boarded the charity vessel attempting to reach the Gaza Strip in defiance of an Israeli naval blockade, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) had said earlier on Monday.

The Israeli military had no immediate comment.
Shortly before the FFC statement, the Israeli Foreign Ministry posted a video on X showing the Israeli Navy communicating with the Madleen over a loudspeaker, urging it to change course.
“The maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to naval traffic as part of a legal naval blockade,” a soldier said. “If you wish to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, you are able to do so through the (Israeli) port of Ashdod.”
The organisers of the Madleen’s voyage said on Saturday that they had reached Egyptian waters and were nearing Gaza, where the conflict between Israel and Hamas entered its 21st month.
The Madleen, a sailing boat operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, left Italy on June 1 with the stated aim of delivering humanitarian aid and breaking the Israeli blockade on the Palestinian territory.
“Israel will not allow anyone to break the naval blockade of Gaza, which is aimed at preventing weapons from reaching Hamas — a murderous terrorist group holding our hostages and committing war crimes,” Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.
“Israel will act against any attempt to break the blockade or support terror groups — by sea, air or land,” he added.
The coalition responded in a statement on X, saying it expected “interception and an attack from Israel at any moment” and calling for the governments of those on board to protect them.
The post added that the Madleen is 160 nautical miles from Gaza and that jamming “briefly disrupted our location, but our tracker is functioning again”.
 






Meanwhile, activists aboard the vessel have said they will continue their journey “until the last minute”.
“We’ll stay mobilised until the last minute — until Israel cuts the internet and networks,” European parliament member Rima Hassan told AFP from the boat. “There are twelve of us civilians on board. We are not armed. There is only humanitarian aid.”
Hassan voiced concern over the lack of official response from countries whose citizens are part of the crew.
“No state has responded. The message being sent is that Israel is being allowed to act with impunity, without any guarantee of protection for us,” she added.
In a post on X, Hassan said that the activists have “less than 24 hours” before they are detained by Israeli authorities.
“When we are no longer able to communicate with you, I’m counting on you to continue the mobilisation that has been so valuable to us throughout this journey,” she wrote.
 






Nationals of Germany, France, Brazil, Turkey, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands are on the boat.
“We’re not scared of them,” said German human rights activist Yasemin Acar, also on board. “The message they have been sending us, that we cannot come closer, is not making us step back.”
On Sunday, French Minister for Foreign Trade and French Nationals Abroad Laurent Saint-Martin said that France was obliged to ensure “consular protection” for its nationals aboard the Madleen.
“The six French citizens on this boat are entitled to consular protection,” he told a state TV channel.
The conflict was sparked by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
On Sunday, the health ministry in Gaza said that the overall toll for the Gaza war had reached 54,880, the majority being civilians. The UN considers these figures reliable.</p><small>2025-06-09 03:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/090829413b5ae0f.jpg?r=083055' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916023/5-injured-as-blaze-in-karachis-landhi-factory-continues-to-burn' target='_blank'><strong>5 injured as blaze in Karachi’s Landhi factory continues to burn</strong></a><br><p>A fire that broke out at a factory in Landhi on Sunday is still burning, more than 24 hours after the blaze, injuring five, according to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassan Khan told Dawn.com that rescue officials are still at the site, trying to put the blaze out.
The fire, which erupted in a factory in the export processing zone in Landhi, caused part of a factory building to collapse, leaving five people injured.
“The injured include 45-year-old Aslam, 30-year-old Hamza, 20-year-old Ayaz, 43-year-old Sajid Mahmood and 53-year-old Mohsin,” Khan said. “They have been transported to Civil Hospital.”
Earlier, Khan told Dawn.com that the fire broke out at 4:31am, meaning that it has been burning for over 24 hours.
Speaking to Dawn.com earlier today, Abid Jalaluddin Sheikh, chief operating officer at Rescue 1122 Sindh, said that the fire broke out early on Sunday morning, spreading rapidly and engulfing two other factories due to the presence of combustible material.
He said, “As soon as the information was received, the Fire and Rescue team of Rescue 1122 reached the spot.”
According to Sheikh, a total of 12 fire brigade trucks,two snorkels and two ambulances of Rescue 1122 and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) are present at the spot to provide full assistance to deal with any emergency situation.
“The rescue operation is facing difficulties due to the intensity of smoke and other difficulties, as well as the shortage of water, but Rescue 1122 is making efforts to control the fire,” he said.
Sheikh highlighted that firefighting operations were “in full swing and full efforts are being made to reduce the intensity of the fire because the intensity of the fire is very high”.
“The Rescue 1122 team is making full efforts to control this emergency situation by utilising all possible resources,” he said, adding that citizens have been requested to immediately report any emergency to 1122.
Fire incidents are common in the metropolis due to the absence of adequate fire safety measures in buildings.
Thirty shops were gutted when a huge fire erupted in a commercial building in Clifton in February.
Four people, including one firefighter, were affected by smoke inhalation and 12 fire tenders worked for four hours to bring the fire under control.
Last year, the KMC informed the Sindh High Court that it had conducted a fire safety audit of over 265 commercial buildings, and not a single one was found to have a fire safety certificate or a no-objection certificate (NOC) issued by the fire brigade department.
Out of 265 buildings, around 155 did not have fire alarms and smoke detectors installed, while the status of nine such buildings was not available in this respect, the KMC report added.
Similarly, the condition of the wiring and electric system of over 155 buildings was termed unsatisfactory. Regarding access to firefighting equipment, the report said that around 200 buildings had no or unsatisfactory firefighting equipment.</p><small>2025-06-09 03:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/090020167c9abb0.jpg?r=002104' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916052/alcaraz-saves-three-match-points-to-beat-sinner-to-french-open-title' target='_blank'><strong>Alcaraz saves three match points to beat Sinner to French Open title</strong></a><br><p>Carlos Alcaraz saved three championship points as he produced an astonishing fightback from two sets down to beat Jannik Sinner in a French Open final for the ages on Sunday.
Reigning champion Alcaraz rallied from the brink of defeat to overcome world number one Sinner 4-6, 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (10/2) to clinch his fifth Grand Slam title after five hours and 29 minutes.
The 22-year-old Spaniard is now unbeaten in five Grand Slam finals after snapping Sinner’s 20-match winning run at the majors.
Alcaraz pulled off his first-ever comeback from two sets down to stun Sinner in the longest Roland Garros final in history. It easily eclipsed the 1982 final in Paris when Mats Wilander triumphed in four sets over Guillermo Vilas in 4 hours and 42 minutes.
Alcaraz becomes the third youngest man to win five Grand Slams — after Bjorn Borg and compatriot Rafael Nadal — following an incredible duel between the two stars of a new generation.
Sinner fell agonisingly short of a third successive Grand Slam crown after last year’s US Open title and back-to-back Australian Open triumphs.
He suffered his fifth straight loss to Alcaraz in what was their first meeting in a Grand Slam final — and the first championship match at a major between two men born in the 2000s.
Alcaraz leads 8-5 overall, having also beaten Sinner to win in Rome, where the Italian returned to competition after a three-month doping ban.</p><small>2025-06-08 19:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/08215858b9db87d.jpg?r=220139' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916010/troops-sent-by-trump-reach-protest-hit-los-angeles-over-governors-wishes' target='_blank'><strong>Troops sent by Trump reach protest-hit Los Angeles over governor’s wishes</strong></a><br><p>United States National Guard troops began arriving in Los Angeles early on Sunday after being deployed by President Donald Trump, a rare deployment against the state governor’s wishes after sometimes violent protests against immigration enforcement raids.
Trump took federal control of California’s state military to push soldiers into the country’s second-biggest city, an extraordinary move not seen for decades and deemed “purposefully inflammatory” by California Governor Gavin Newsom.
Helmeted troops carrying automatic weapons and with camouflaged vehicles could be seen in the Compton neighbourhood of the California city early Sunday, ahead of more protests, including a call by organisers for a “mass mobilisation” at City Hall at 2pm local time (2100 GMT).
The development came after two days of confrontations during which federal agents fired flash-bang grenades and tear gas toward crowds angry at the arrests of dozens of migrants in a city with a large Latino population.
Republicans lined up behind Trump on Sunday to dismiss warnings by Newsom and other local officials that the protests had been largely peaceful, and that the deployment was against their wishes and would exacerbate tensions.
“I have no concern about that at all,” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson told ABC’s ‘This Week’ when asked, adding that Newsom “has shown an inability or unwillingness to do what is necessary there, so the president stepped in”.
As for threats by Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday to send in active-duty Marines on top of the Guard troops, Johnson said he did not see that as “heavy-handed.”
“We have to be prepared to do what is necessary,” he argued.
Federal authorities “want a spectacle. Don’t give them one. Never use violence. Speak out peacefully,” Newsom had posted on X late on Saturday. He branded Hegseth’s threat “deranged”.
 






“We agree that if you’re being violent, you should be arrested … But this is not what’s happening,” California Congresswoman Nanette Barragan told CNN on Sunday.
“We are having an administration that’s targeting peaceful protests … The president is sending the National Guard because he doesn’t like the scenes,” the Democrat said.
Overnight, an AFP photographer saw fires and fireworks light up the streets during clashes, while a protester holding a Mexican flag stood in front of a burnt-out car that had been sprayed with a slogan against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.
“It’s up to us to stand up for our people,” said a Los Angeles resident whose parents are immigrants, declining to give her name as emergency services lights flashed in the distance.
‘Zero tolerance’
Trump had signed a memorandum sending 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, the White House said on Saturday.
The National Guard — a reserve military — is frequently used in natural disasters, and occasionally in instances of civil unrest, but almost always with the consent of local authorities.
It is the first time since 1965 that a president has deployed a National Guard without a request by a state governor, the former head of Human Rights Watch, US activist Kenneth Roth, posted on X, accusing Trump of “creating a spectacle so he can continue his immigration raids”.
 






But the National Guard are “specifically trained for this type of crowd situation”, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CBS’ ‘Face the Nation’ on Sunday, refusing to divulge where in Los Angeles they would be deployed.
 


Trump has delivered on a promise to crack down hard on the entry and presence of undocumented migrants — who he has likened to “monsters” and “animals” — since taking office in January.
ICE raids in other US cities have triggered small-scale protests in recent months, but the Los Angeles unrest is the biggest and most sustained against the Trump administration’s policies so far.
A CBS News poll taken before the Los Angeles protests showed a slight majority of Americans still approved of the immigration crackdown.
Masked and armed immigration agents carried out high-profile workplace raids in separate parts of Los Angeles on Friday and Saturday, attracting angry crowds and setting off hours-long standoffs.
Fernando Delgado, a 24-year-old resident, said the raids were “injustices” and those detained were “human beings just like any.”
The stand-off demonstrated “Trump’s authoritarianism in real time,” Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders posted on X on Sunday.
“Conduct massive illegal raids. Provoke a counter-response. Declare a state of emergency. Call in the troops,” he wrote, adding: “Unacceptable.”

As announced by Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad, the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 will be presented on June 10, while the Pakistan Economic Survey will be released a day earlier.
According to today’s statement, Sadiq approved the NA’s schedule for the budget, which will be presented in the lower house on June 10.
“There will not be any sessions in the National Assembly on June 11 and 12,” Sadiq was quoted as saying.
“The discussion on the federal budget will begin in the National Assembly on June 13 [and] parliamentary parties present … will be given time for discussion as per the rules and regulations,” he added.
 
 

According to the statement, debates on the federal budget will continue until June 21, when it will be finalised.
“There will be no meeting of the National Assembly on June 22. The necessary expenses for 2025-26 will be presented and debated in the National Assembly on June 23,” the statement added.
Sadiq was quoted as saying that on June 24 and 25, there will be debates and voting on motions for deductions and grants, while the Finance Bill 2025-26 will be finalised on June 26.
“On June 27, there will be a debate and voting on other issues, including supplementary grants,” the speaker said, with the statement adding that changes to the schedule could be made with his permission.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has stated that the government’s priority in the upcoming budget is to provide relief to the common man, in addition to “the creation of jobs, agriculture, information technology, small and medium enterprises, and the housing sector”.
Meanwhile, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said that the government would have a Rs1 trillion development budget and hinted at an increase in defence spending.</p><small>2025-06-08 15:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/08200549e280a95.jpg?r=200707' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916039/ayaz-sadiq-expresses-gratitude-to-saudi-crown-prince-for-supporting-pakistan-during-difficult-time' target='_blank'><strong>Ayaz Sadiq expresses gratitude to Saudi crown prince for supporting Pakistan during ‘difficult time’</strong></a><br><p>National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Sunday met the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, and expressed Pakistan’s gratitude for the kingdom’s support during “a difficult time”, a statement from the NA Secretariat read.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif embarked on a two-day state visit to the kingdom and performed Umrah on the night of Thursday and Friday, offering prayers for the country’s success in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, the government said on its X account.
During his visit, the prime minister “expressed appreciation for the kingdom’s proactive role during recent tensions between Pakistan and India, and its steadfast commitment to promoting peace and stability in the region and beyond”, according to a statement from the PM’s office.
According to the statement issued today, the Saudi crown prince expressed his commitment to addressing issues that affect the Islamic world when he met with NA Speaker Sadiq, who expressed gratitude for the kingdom’s support for Pakistan.
“Saudi Arabia has supported Pakistan in every difficult time,” Sadiq was quoted as saying. “I am grateful for the Saudi leadership’s clear stance on Pakistan. The people of Pakistan look up to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques [the title held by the Saudi king].”
Sadiq added that he expects that ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia will “further strengthen”.
 






Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who was also attending the luncheon, expressed his gratitude to the Saudi crown prince for the invitation to perform Haj as a royal guest.
“The exemplary arrangements for the pilgrims and the services to the Muslim Ummah are commendable,” Tessori wrote on X, adding that he extended an invitation to the crown prince to visit Pakistan.
 






Pakistan and India engaged in a brief military confrontation last month, following the latter’s allegations that Islamabad orchestrated a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam; an allegation Pakistan strongly denied.
Saudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Aljubeir welcomed the ceasefire between the two countries, according to a post by the Foreign Office (FO) on X.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited Turkiye for two days last month and expressed gratitude to Erdogan for Turkiye’s support during a brief military confrontation with India.
According to PTV News, a delegation-level meeting between the two nations was “warm and most cordial” and both nations “reaffirmed the deep-rooted, historic, and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Türkiye, anchored in shared values, mutual respect, and a common vision for progress and prosperity”.
PTV News reported that the Turkish president made his remarks during a phone call with PM Shehbaz, where both leaders exchanged Eidul Azha greetings.
“While recalling their recent meetings in Istanbul and Lachin, the prime minister thanked President Erdogan once again for Turkiye’s strong and unwavering support to Pakistan during the recent Pakistan-India crisis,” the report read.
“He said this gesture has won the hearts of the people of Pakistan and added another glorious chapter to the history of [the] Pakistan-Turkiye brotherhood.”
 






Both leaders agreed to fast-track key decisions taken in recent meetings, which PM Shehbaz said would “help accelerate bilateral cooperation, particularly in trade and investment”, the report stated.
Erdogan and Shehbaz “reaffirmed their unflinching support to each other on their core interests. They also discussed the latest regional and global developments, including the situation in Gaza.”
“In his remarks, President Erdogan … reaffirmed Turkiye’s resolute support to Pakistan on all important issues,” PTV News added.</p><small>2025-06-08 13:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0813451152d5266.png?r=165315' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916022/pakistan-seeks-global-intervention-in-issues-with-india-as-diplomatic-team-lands-in-london' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks global ‘intervention’ in issues with India as diplomatic team lands in London</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called for “intervention” from global powers in resolving key issues with India amid ongoing tensions, members of a high-level delegation presenting Islamabad’s stance said on Sunday after landing in London.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team has arrived in London and will also visit Brussels.
The delegation comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Subzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
“The resistance we faced is that the Americans think that since [US] President [Donald] Trump has mediated the ceasefire, there is no need for further intervention. This was exactly our mission: to make them understand that intervention is needed,” Dastgir told Geo News after arriving in the United Kingdom.
“The diplomatic delegation fulfilled its objectives,” he asserted.
The former MNA added: “Our ministers also put forward this stance that if India does not come to the table for talks again, then due to [the water issue] and India’s irresponsible behaviour — saying that it does not need evidence for a war — a war in the subcontinent is certain.”
 






Similarly, Subzwari told Geo News: “We want global powers to tell India that two neighbouring nuclear states cannot move forward in such a dangerous environment. It is not just damaging for the region but for the world’s peace.”
Noting that the delegation began its engagements with a multilateral forum, the United Nations, the senator stressed, “Despite showing our military prowess, we have come with an invitation to peace.”
Rehman, a former ambassador to the US, called the meetings “very positive”.
“They understood our points and the risks. They all also agreed that the weaponisation of water is extremely wrong,” she said, terming India-occupied Kashmir as the “largest open-air prison after Gaza”.
“Whatever the Indians do, good luck to them,” the PPP leader quipped, referring to the delegations sent by New Delhi to various countries on the matter.
Rehman highlighted: “India’s delegation does not know what its mission is, except for maligning Pakistan. [However,] we did not go [to US] to malign India, but to tell Pakistan’s story.”
Senator Butt termed the response in both New York and Washington to Pakistan’s concerns on held Kashmir and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which India unilaterally held in abeyance after a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir, as “fantastic”.
“If the Indus Waters Treaty is overlooked today, then no treaty in the future will stand any ground,” she asserted.
 
 

Summarising the delegation’s stance, former caretaker foreign minister Jilani stated: “Our message was that India committed aggression and that Pakistan is a peaceful country.”
He reiterated Islamabad’s desire for a peaceful resolution to the long-standing issues between the two nations.
Pakistan has appeared to be aiming to draw the US into a more proactive diplomatic role in South Asia.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called Trump a “man of peace”, while Bilawal said it was “reasonable to expect that an American role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would also be beneficial for us”.
Diplomatic contest
On June 4, the Bilawal-led delegation concluded its two-day visit to New York, where it met with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, along with elected and permanent members of the UN Security Council.
It then met with several US Congress members in Washington — including chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — as well as think tanks.
 


Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, visited Moscow from June 2 to June 4. It met with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and a senior aide to President Vladimir Putin.
On its part, India had also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, as well as meet members of the UNSC, to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.
On June 5, the Indian delegation met US Vice President JD Vance, taking advantage of his links to India.
 
 

Both delegations lobbied for their countries on Capitol Hill, meeting senior US lawmakers and chairs of various Congress committees.
The Indian delegation met members of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, including senators Dave McCormick, Jacky Rosen, Jim Risch, Mark Warner, John Cornyn, and Elissa Slotkin.
The Indian delegation is led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and includes Shambhavi Chaudhary (Lok Janshakti Party), Sarfaraz Ahmed (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), G. M. Harish Balayogi (Telugu Desam Party), Shashank Mani Tripathi, Tejaswi Surya, and Bhubaneswar Kalita (all from the BJP), Mallikarjun Devda (Shiv Sena), former Indian ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu, and Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora.</p><small>2025-06-08 13:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608274-five-firefighters-hurt-as-efforts-underway-to-douse-karachi-factory-inferno' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi factory fire still raging after over 24 hours</strong></a><br><p>

Iranian state media reported on Saturday that Iranian intelligence agencies had obtained a large trove of sensitive Israeli documents. Khatib said these were related to Israel’s nuclear facilities and its relations with the United States, Europe and other countries, and to its defensive capabilities.
There was no immediate official comment from Israel.
It was not clear whether the information breach was linked to a reported hacking of an Israeli nuclear research centre last year, which Tehran is only disclosing now amid heightened tensions over its nuclear programme.
“The transfer of this treasure trove was time-consuming and required security measures. Naturally, the transfer methods will remain confidential but the documents should be unveiled soon,” Khatib said, adding that in terms of volume, “talking of thousands of documents would be an understatement.”
In 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israeli agents had seized a huge “archive” of Iranian documents that showed Tehran had done more nuclear work than previously known.
United States President Donald Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if Tehran does not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear programme. But Trump in April reportedly blocked a planned Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites in favour of negotiating a deal with Tehran.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that abandoning uranium enrichment was “100 per cent” against Iran’s interests, rejecting a central US demand in talks to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
Western powers say Iran is refining uranium to a high degree of fissile purity close to the level suitable for atomic bomb fuel. Iran has long denied seeking nuclear weapons.</p><small>2025-06-08 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/081635117b62afb.jpg?r=163841' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916038/pope-leo-criticises-nationalist-politics-at-sunday-mass' target='_blank'><strong>Pope Leo criticises nationalist politics at Sunday Mass</strong></a><br><p>Pope Leo criticised the emergence of nationalist political movements on Sunday, calling them unfortunate, without naming a specific country or national leader.
Leo, the first pope from the United States, asked during a Mass with a crowd of tens of thousands in St Peter’s Square that God would “open borders, break down walls [and] dispel hatred”.
“There is no room for prejudice, for ‘security’ zones separating us from our neighbours, for the exclusionary mindset that, unfortunately, we now see emerging also in political nationalisms,” said the pontiff.
Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost, was elected on May 8 to succeed the late Pope Francis as leader of the 1.4-billion-member Church.
Before becoming pontiff, Prevost was not shy about criticising US President Donald Trump, sharing numerous disapproving posts about him and Vice President JD Vance on X in recent years.
The Vatican has not confirmed the new pope’s ownership of the X account, which had the handle ‘drprevost’ and was deactivated after Leo’s election.
Francis, pope for 12 years, was a sharp critic of Trump. The late pope said in January that the president’s plan to deport millions of migrants in the US during his second term was a “disgrace.”
Earlier, Francis said Trump was “not Christian” because of his views on immigration.
“A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” Francis said when asked about Trump in 2016.
Leo was celebrating a Mass for Pentecost, one of the Church’s most important holidays.</p><small>2025-06-08 11:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/081428385582148.jpg?r=143031' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916032/search-underway-after-2-girls-fall-from-bridge-at-upper-dirs-gwaldai-river' target='_blank'><strong>Search underway after 2 girls fall from bridge at Upper Dir’s Gwaldai river</strong></a><br><p>A search operation was launched on Sunday after two girls fell from a makeshift bridge over the Gwaldai River in the Shahi Banda area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Upper Dir district and went missing, police said.
Zaman Shah, a sub-divisional police officer, told Dawn.com that two young girls — namely 15-year-old Samira Bibi and 12-year-old Javeria Bibi — were crossing the Gwaldai river when they fell into it and were feared to have drowned.
The official said the incident occurred within the limits of Shahi Doba’s Patrak police station, adding that the flow of water had increased recently due to glaciers melting.
Shah said that the search continues for the bodies in the river as the Rescue 1122 and locals have not succeeded yet, adding that he is present at the spot along with other officials to monitor the operation.
Pakistan is home to over 13,032 glaciers spanning the Karakoram, Hindu Kush and the Himalayan mountain ranges, making its northern region the largest reservoir of glaciers outside of the Polar Regions.
However, with striking changes in the climate, these glaciers and the habitats surrounding them are deeply troubled, with 10,000 glaciers reported to be receding.
 
 

Earlier this week, three people drowned in a canal in KP’s Malakand district, while a body was discovered in a river in Upper Dir in a separate incident.
Last month, seven people were rescued while two went missing after a boat sank in the Indus River near the province’s Kohat district.
In April, two minor sisters went missing in the Indus River in the Bisham tehsil of KP’s Shangla district.</p><small>2025-06-08 10:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/08165736ffe597a.jpg?r=170013' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916031/indias-restive-manipur-orders-curfew-shuts-off-internet-after-fresh-violence' target='_blank'><strong>India’s restive Manipur orders curfew, shuts off internet after fresh violence</strong></a><br><p>An Indian state riven by ethnic tensions imposed an internet shutdown and curfew after protesters clashed with security forces over the arrest of some members of a radical group, police said on Sunday.
Manipur in India’s northeast has been rocked by periodic clashes for more than two years between the predominantly Hindu Meitei majority and the mainly Christian Kuki community that have killed more than 250 people.
The latest violence was triggered on Saturday after reports of the arrest of five members, including a commander, of Arambai Tenggol, a radical Meitei group.
Incensed mobs demanding their release stormed a police post, set fire to a bus and blocked roads in parts of the state capital Imphal.
Manipur police announced a curfew in five districts, including Imphal West and Bishnupur, due to the “developing law and order situation”.
“Prohibitory orders have been issued by District Magistrates. Citizens are requested to cooperate with the orders,” the police said in a statement.
Arambai Tenggol, which is alleged to have orchestrated the violence against the Kuki community, has also announced a 10-day shutdown in the valley districts.
The state’s home ministry has ordered all internet and mobile data services in volatile districts to be shut off for five days in order to bring the latest unrest under control.
 
 

Internet services were shut down for months in Manipur during the initial outbreak of violence in 2023, which displaced around 60,000 people from their homes, according to government figures.
Thousands of the state’s residents are still unable to return home owing to ongoing tensions.
Long-standing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities revolve around competition for land and public jobs.
Rights activists have accused local leaders of exacerbating ethnic divisions for political gain.</p><small>2025-06-08 08:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608243-karachi-braces-for-gusty-winds-amid-heatwave-forecast-in-sindh-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi braces for gusty winds amid heatwave forecast in Sindh, Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

According to the anthropologist Marcel Danesi, once people begin to believe in lies, they are unlikely to change their minds even when confronted with evidence that contradicts their beliefs. Danesi wrote, “They turn the contrasting information on its head, so as to make it fit their beliefs.”
Research in this regard shows that, once a lie is accepted, the brain becomes more susceptible to subsequent lying. So, does this mean one should be resigned to the fact that we will always be surrounded by folk who are only willing to believe what they want to believe? I’m afraid so. 
Supporters of the jailed former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan continue to exchange ‘information’ about his release. They’ve been at it for over two years now. They keep exchanging dates of his ‘triumphant’ release, which never materialises. Yet, this hasn’t dissuaded his supporters from continuing to embrace new ‘information’ about his release and then waiting for another date. 

From Pakistan’s political myth-making to India’s media-fed fantasies of war, the truth is currently struggling against a tide of comforting falsehoods

And when that date too passes without incident, this miss is spun with new ‘information’ in which, supposedly, the establishment and government are desperate to release Khan but he is refusing to come out himself, because he doesn’t want to strike any demeaning ‘deal’ with his opponents. 
Let’s take another case. On the evening of May 9, millions of Indians remained glued to their TV screens and on social media, excitedly applauding what their TV anchors were telling them was happening in Pakistan. Apparently, city after city in Pakistan was falling to the might of the Indian armed forces and a whole province had broken away to declare its independence. The government had fallen and the military chief had been removed.
Of course, this was all hogwash. Wasn’t there even a single significant Indian who bothered to check other news sources? ‘News’ was flooding in from Indian media outlets of one nuclear country effortlessly dismantling another. So didn’t anyone gasping with excitement in India bother to check BBC, CNN, Reuters, Al-Jazeera etc.? All these have correspondents in Pakistan. 
Even when evidence began to emerge that it was India that had suffered millions of dollars’ worth of losses when the Pakistan Air Force shot down at least 5 Indian jets, the Indian media began to spin this as ‘minor losses’ suffered by a ‘giant’. 
There were no apologies by those who went on a feeding frenzy on brazen ‘information’ being relayed to them by their ‘reporters’, and which they shouted out all evening in front of the cameras. 
There are several overlapping factors that are at play in the two examples that I have provided: 
(1) Conformation Bias: people tend to accept information that bolsters their existing beliefs, making them less likely to question or reject misinformation. 
(2) Motivated Reasoning: in an essay for The Washington Post, the journalist Richard Sima wrote that people’s beliefs and desires can influence how they interpret and process information, making them more susceptible to lies that align with their goals or emotions. 
If Khan is not released on the date his supports were ‘informed’ he would be, the likely truth that there was never any plan to release him is understood by his supporters as Khan himself not wanting to be released, because he’s a ‘principled’ man who doesn’t want to cut a deal with his ‘corrupt’ and ‘oppressive’ opponents. 
(3) The Illusory Truth Effect: repeated statements, even false ones, can become more believable over time due to increased familiarity. This propaganda tactic was first perfected by the Nazi regime in Germany. Recently, some Indian anchors confessed to using this ploy when they were caught spreading outright lies about Pakistan’s annihilation. 
But the thing is, their claptrap in this regard was repeated over and over again in a matter of just a few hours and not months/years that it takes for this ploy to effectively achieve its purpose. However, if the purpose was to gain an evening full of TV ratings, then this tactic did work. 
 


Misinformation, when amplified on social media, creates echo chambers, where people are revealed only that information which confirms their biases. In these chambers, people often believe information that aligns with the beliefs of their ‘social/political tribe.’ One saw this on Indian social media when, on May 9, millions of Indians got guzzled by a giant echo chamber and lost all contact with the reality that existed outside.
Truth often seems humdrum compared to a fantastical lie. Lies can trigger strong emotions. They are thus more attractive and compelling than the truth. Indians were told fanciful lies that played out like Bollywood blockbusters. The lies heightened emotions that completely overwhelmed any ability left in most Indians to apply critical thinking. This factor is especially potent if the lies have any relation to a ‘popular’ leader who is adored as a messiah of sorts. 
In India’s case, it is PM Narendra Modi and, in Pakistan’s case, it is Khan. According to the American political historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat, once people bond with a populist leader, they may be inclined to dismiss any evidence that conflicts with his claims, or overlook contradictions in his messages. They may know he is lying, but they decide that they don’t care.
 
 

Khan constantly contradicts himself in his statements that are relayed through his party’s X account. Interestingly though, he seems to be petrified that a deal with his opponents will embarrass him in front of his supporters. Truth is, they are likely to spin it into meaning something noble and gallant. 
This is exactly what Modi’s most hardcore fans have also been doing when faced with increasing evidence that Modi’s gambit against Pakistan failed. Instead of believing this, they are trying to spin it as a “victory against terrorism.”
To Ben-Ghiat, investing in media literacy is essential, but so is education about the damages of populist models of power that turn leaders into infallible god-like figures with a network of lies and misinformation.
Published in Dawn, EOS, June 6th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-08 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/68418ba50b06c.jpg?r=114627' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915622/pakistani-students-and-the-american-dream' target='_blank'><strong>PAKISTANI STUDENTS AND THE ‘AMERICAN DREAM’</strong></a><br><p>Shayan* and his wife Aliya* spent the last couple of months preparing their travel plans, which included a potential Haj trip after a visit back home to their families in Pakistan.
At least, this was the plan up until the end of March. Shayan, a PhD student in the US who lives with his wife and daughter, found himself concerned about his travel plans when the Trump administration started revoking student visas.
While Shayan has been in the US since the first Trump administration took office, Aliya only joined him two years ago, with their daughter. Aliya reveals that when Trump was re-elected, Shayan grew extremely anxious and she was the one who kept re-assuring him that things would be alright.
That was until the Trump administration’s sudden actions against foreign students, which led to hundreds of students and recent graduates having their visas revoked. As part of the crackdown, Trump’s team has frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for universities and moved to deport students, while revoking visas for others. 
 
 

With Shayan on a student visa, and Aliya and their daughter living there as his dependents, the couple is worried about potentially leaving the country and not being able to return. “Shayan’s coursework is still not completed,” Aliya says, “so if we travel abroad and are not able to return, my husband’s career would be over and he would have to start all over again.” Such an outcome, after all the time and investment the couple has put into starting a new life in the US, would be painstakingly difficult.
This is why, despite the fact that their two-year-old daughter asks to go to her “Nano’s [grandmother’s]” house every time she sees a plane flying overhead, the couple have made the decision to stay in the US for the remainder of the year — unsure as to when a trip back to Pakistan will be possible.

As US visa restrictions tighten, threats of visa revocations increase, university funding becomes limited and Islamophobia grows under the Trump administration, Pakistani students applying to the US find their futures hanging in the balance. For many, their dream of studying in the US is turning into a costly gamble they may no longer be able to afford — emotionally or financially

Their decision to not take the risk of travelling abroad was further cemented when they took a domestic flight within the US, only to find themselves under far more scrutiny from airport security than they’d ever experienced. At the airport, they found themselves dealing with increased screenings, and Aliya even had her hijab swabbed as part of the security check.
Aliya says, “The adviser who handles all the foreign students advised us not to travel.” The adviser also added that “if push comes to shove, change your dissertation topic [which required Shayan to travel] but do not travel.”
Shayan and his family are not the only ones in this position right now. With a travel ban hanging in the balance, and so many plans upended, being a student, or even a potential student, in the US is turning out to be more confusing and stressful than it has ever been.
Across the world, countless students are now living under the fear of what their future might look like. Pakistani students currently in the process of applying to universities in the US, those who had already gained admission to US universities, and those currently studying there now find themselves in uncharted waters.

When it comes to how college counsellors in Pakistan are helping students navigate these unprecedented times, their first step is making sure students have alternative options. Putting all your eggs in one basket leads to a higher risk of emotional distress when that option doesn’t work out, and advisers want to be sure that their students have a back-up.

The latest development has seen the Trump administration order US embassies around the world to stop scheduling appointments for student visas, as it prepares to expand “social media vetting” of such applicants. This comes during a wide-ranging crackdown on some of America’s most elite universities, with Trump accusing many of these institutions of failing to combat “anti-Semitism” when pro-Palestinian protests have taken place on campuses.
Aside from the restrictions themselves and confusion around them, there’s also the very real emotional toll this process has been taking on everyone involved — from students, to parents and college advisers. For many young Pakistanis, securing a future in the US is the ultimate dream. For most young people, that future starts with a student visa and, as things stand, they’re no longer sure if they can get it.
SEPARATING FACT FROM HYPERBOLE
Following Trump’s re-election, there was a lot of media noise regarding a potential travel ban with countries across the world facing different restrictions. There was also some confusion about whether Pakistan would be on the yellow list or the more restricted orange list, which has worried potential visa applicants regarding their future. When leaked drafts made it to the news, both global and Pakistani media tried to deduce what it would mean for international travellers.
 
 

Students, in particular, would be one of the groups that would bear the brunt of these restrictions. One of the first orders that Trump passed focused on extended vetting and screening for visa holders — both those in the process of applying and those already in the country. The recent arrests and visa revocations from multiple universities across the US have only added to the fear students are facing.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, when talking about the increased scrutiny visa holders are facing, said that the department was targeting those who were involved in activities that “run counter” to US national interests.
Muhammad Ali, a Senior Education Counsellor at The IEIS Education Group in Pakistan, believes that media attention regarding this issue — which he thinks has been exaggerated — is adding to the fear. “Our media has been quite heated with regards to US visa policies, talking about deportations and visas being revoked,” he says, while also pointing out that the situation is not as extreme and “it’s not like everything is being rejected.”
Hasan* is one of those students whose US visa came through recently. As he prepares to start his PhD in the US soon, he shares that he initially wasn’t even considering applying to the US, simply because he’d heard how difficult it now was to go through the visa process. The new directives that required the checking of applicant’s social media as part of visa applications also concerned him.
 
 

“I hadn’t shared any posts that could be flagged, but I was still worried,” Hasan reveals. “My friend and teachers told me I wouldn’t know unless I tried, so I decided to do it,” he shares. But he also adds that a friend of his who had applied for his Master’s had had his visa rejected.
Junaid Sohail, the CEO and founder of Endeavours Consultants, a company that advises Pakistani students on studying abroad and study visas, observes that the acceptance might hinge on a preference for certain subjects.
“I have seen many cases of students who are applying for pre-med and Stem [Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics] subjects having a higher chance of visa acceptance than those applying for a business degree,” he says. He adds, “Parents are very concerned, especially after all the hype regarding this that they see in the media. We’re trying to explain to them that deportations only occur in the case of people breaking the law.”
On the other hand, Aliya believes that people in Pakistan haven’t understood this issue and its ramifications correctly. When she and her husband initially tried to reach out to their Pakistan-based Haj organisers to talk to them about potentially cancelling the trip, Aliya says the organisers didn’t understand how dire the situation was. Ultimately, they were able to get a refund.
But whether the Pakistani public fully understands the changes ushered in by the Trump administration, student arrests in the US are real, and they are causing concern. Increasing Islamophobia, arrests of students participating in pro-Palestine protests, students under increased scrutiny and the revocation of student visas has led to many Pakistani students reassessing their academic futures in the US.

FUTURES AT RISK
Naima* is a medical student currently in her fifth year at Dow University of Health Sciences. She has long been on track to apply to the US for further medical studies — a pathway many of her classmates, and previous alumni, have been through. The eventual goal is to go to the US for their electives, followed by a residency and then, hopefully, a job — one that pays back the extremely high investment Pakistani students have to put in just to secure their futures in the US.
According to Naima, “The general culture at my university now is that you give your USMLEs [United States Medical Licensing Examinations] as fast as you can. A lot of people have now started giving it in their third, fourth and fifth year. The plan is to go to America as quickly as possible.” Naima, and many students like her, now have to navigate the pressures of medical school with the additional difficulty of US applications.
For Naima, who has already given all her USMLE Step exams — there are three — and has been planning for this since she began medical school, it’s hard to imagine a back-up. “I’m in my fifth year of med school and the Match process [through which medical students are matched with their residencies in the US] is already extremely stressful, and this uncertainty regarding studying in the US is only adding to it,” Naima says, as she talks about how it’s already become very hard to even get a US visa interview date.
Naima’s original plan was, and still is, to go to the US in March 2026, which would then give her three months to take part in her electives — hands-on work experience in a US hospital that students get to undertake right before they graduate.
But electives can only be undertaken when a student is still registered in their programme at their university, and Dow has told its students it will officially have them graduate in June. Following their graduation, electives no longer remain an option and, while they can still gain experience under what’s called “observerships”, Naima points out that electives hold far more weight on one’s CV’s for future opportunities.
“If I get my visa late, if I do end up getting it at all, that is, going after June would severely impact my chances, since I won’t be able to do an elective,” she says, pointing out that many of her classmates have got visa interview dates for March 2026.
It’s not just Naima and medical students who feel confused with these latest changes. Omair*, a student at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), had received admission into Boston’s Northeastern University for a Master’s in Data Analytics. He was long set on pursuing this path for his future and felt so sure that it would work out that he didn’t even have a back-up plan in place. For him, it’s not even a case of long-term immigration to the US. Omair just hopes to get his degree, maybe some work experience and then move back home to work in his father’s business. So, when his US visa got rejected recently, the shock hit him and his parents very hard.
Counsellors, such as Sohail and Ali, reveal that having a clear purpose for your visit and confidence in your future plans makes it extremely likely that you will get your US visa. After all, the visa interview officer really just wants to ensure that students aren’t going to drop out of college and resettle elsewhere in the country, Sohail says.
But Omair had both a strong sense of his future plans, and all his financial statements were in order. Yet he was rejected on account of not having “sufficient home ties”, which he says he found confusing, because the only family member of his currently in the US is his brother-in-law, with whom he has no blood ties. While they were both aiming to attend the same university, surely that shouldn’t be enough of a reason for a visa officer to question Omair’s plans?
While Omair is trying again to get the visa, he’s not particularly hopeful: “To get an acceptance the second time is very difficult, and the problem is, I don’t even know what I did wrong the first time,” he says. He does think it may be a case of the interviewer being suspicious of why he seemed to only be applying mostly in or near the Boston area, although that was just a personal preference, but he won’t know for sure.
“Initially I didn’t even have another plan so, once I got rejected, I got scared,” Omair says. “I had not applied to any other country except the US. After I got rejected, I applied to two other universities in the US outside of Boston. My counsellor told me to apply to other countries, and then I started applying for jobs as well.”
But while he’s ready to get up and try again, Ali, who’s counselled countless students over the last four years, says that many students are simply unable to deal with the rejection. He even had a student who considered ending his life because he couldn’t see a future beyond his hopes for studying in the US, which didn’t materialise. Many others find it hard to recover as well, just from the sheer effort that they often put into trying to make this work.

THE FINANCIAL AND EMOTIONAL BURDEN
The effort isn’t just the time alone — it’s the hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars that go into just the application. Furthermore, as the dollar rate continues to climb higher against the rupee, the financial pressure increases along with it. There are the application fees, the countless hours spent writing essays, the SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System), IELTS (International English Language Testing System) and GRE (Graduate Record Examinations) fees, and even payment for the visa interview. “It just leaves you hanging, because you invest so much into it,” Omair says.
Depending on what you’re studying, those fees may get significantly higher. Naima, like most medical students, has had to pay for the exam fees for her Step exams and has made a significant investment in procuring the materials needed to prep for the exams. She will also have to pay for her elective and fund living costs if she ends up in the US.
With the US getting more and more expensive, college counsellor Zara Malik*, who is also currently a Master’s student at Harvard University’s Department of Education, points out that there’s also the additional burden of finding financial aid, since a very small percentage of Pakistani students can even afford studying in the US without a scholarship or financial support.
Malik has been a college counsellor for eight years, working with some of the most popular A-Level schools in Karachi before opening up her own private counselling firm. She’s noticed how there was already a decrease in the number of students applying to the US after the arrival of the Trump administration and because of how increasingly expensive studying in the US has become.
 
 

Talking about how the uncertainty of the last few months has impacted student’s perceptions of the US as an ideal study destination, Malik says, “The onset of the Trump administration has created a lot of chaos. Even those who could afford it, have now been hit by visa cancellations.”
Malik and the other counsellors point out that universities in Europe, Turkey and the Middle East are becoming increasingly popular, not only due to their high rankings but also because of what promises to be a much better and more affordable student experience.
Even though Naima is still hoping to go through with her plans to go to the US, she knows it is not an easy decision. There are still students around her who are in the early stages of their application process and are now wondering if the time and money spent will be worth it. Naima says, “People have now been considering that, okay so we’ve given the Step 1 but do we still want to spend 7000 to 8000 dollars to go through this whole journey and not get a Match, or should we just explore other pathways?”
And even though Naima has had extensive conversations with her fiancé — who’s also planning to go to the US — about their future, she’s started thinking about the possibility of a back-up. She hasn’t fully fleshed out her thinking yet, because she’s still hoping the US pathway works out, but she’s had to start thinking about what could happen if it doesn’t.
Further increasing the financial pressures is the Trump government’s new policy to cut back on federal funding to educational institutions, which would severely impact the amount of financial aid universities can give out. Harvard currently finds itself at the epicentre of Trump’s policy changes after the administration announced it was freezing more than $2 billion in federal contracts and grants with Harvard, which mostly fund scientific and medical research.
Speaking as a Master’s student, Zara Malik says, “A lot of people in my class at Harvard are worried they may not be able to get renewed funding, and these are domestic students very worried about funding. So, international students won’t be getting a lot of aid.”
In her opinion, the lack of financial support will be another way that the Trump government will exclude and discourage Pakistani students from applying to the US, and that’s not the only burden. Along with the financial burden, it’s the increasing emotional stress coming from fears of Islamophobia and what their student experience may look like in this new reality.
Malik says that, based on her recent conversations with students, this is an increasing concern for many applicants to the US: “This seems like one of the final nails in the coffin for the declining popularity of the US, given the rising Islamophobia and issues of freedom of speech. The facade has really come off.”
The Trump administration also announced that it would revoke Harvard’s ability to enrol international students and force current foreign students to transfer to other schools or lose their legal immigration status. However, a federal judge has now issued a block on this order.
The implementation of any such policy would be disastrous for US universities given that a large chunk of their revenue comes from international students. According to the US-based census institute Open Doors’ 2024 Report on International Educational Exchange, the total number of international students at US colleges and universities reached an all-time high of more than 1.1 million students for the 2023 and 2024 academic year. This was a seven per cent increase from the previous academic year. According to Reuters, “Harvard’s 6,800 international students make up 27 per cent of its total enrolment.”
WHAT COMES NEXT?
When it comes to how counsellors are helping students navigate these unprecedented times, their first step is making sure students have alternative options. Putting all your eggs in one basket leads to a higher risk of emotional distress when that option doesn’t work out, and advisers want to be sure that their students have a back-up.
“What we do is we make sure kids have an alternative option,” says Sohail. “We encourage them to apply to the UK, Cyprus, Malaysia or Dubai.” He adds: “If we can see that an applicant’s visa or admission might be at risk, we get them into international campuses of US universities and then help them to transfer their credits after a year or so.”
Trepidation regarding studying in the US has also led to many students exploring local university options. According to Fuad A Mehdi, Head of Marketing and Communications at IBA, Karachi, “It is too early to comment on the overall number of applications as IBA admissions close at the end of June. Having said that, Round I applications for the undergraduate programmes this year have registered an increase of 13.68 percent compared to last year’s Round I undergraduate programmes’ applications. The average year-over-year increase in the number of applications is usually between 2-5 percent. The target intake [total seats] has remained unchanged for the past three years, therefore overall competition per seat is going up every year, but this year it is expected to be even more competitive.”
Zainab*, a student who has just completed her A-Levels, had been applying to business schools in the US since last year and has also received two conditional offers. But, after recent developments, she says that her parents told her to apply to local universities as well that offer a business degree. “I’d given my SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] exams with the sole intention of going to the US for my undergrad,” she says.
“But I’ve now had to look at university options in Pakistan in case my visa doesn’t come through or if there is some other policy change regarding foreign students. The whole situation is quite taxing, for both me and my parents.”
For those students who do manage to make it to the interview stage, Ali encourages them to prepare well, saying that it’s extremely important to display confidence and understand the interviewer’s questions properly.
But at the end of the day, Ali, Sohail and Malik all agree that no matter how much you prepare or follow the supposed rules, there’s no guarantee. The Trump government seems far more extreme this time around.
For many students, that’s enough to let go of the ‘American dream’ and look elsewhere, where their experiences and identity will not be sacrificed for their education. Others will keep fighting their way through the process, even while knowing it won’t get any easier.

The biggest blow to the US president’s trade policy was the ruling delivered by a federal court last month that declared illegal many tariffs he had imposed on countries across the world. Although the administration secured a temporary reprieve from an appeals court that paused the ruling, the legal battle is far from over. The appeal process has to play out and the case may even go to the US Supreme Court. Global financial markets welcomed the court order against tariffs but it leaves Trump’s trade plan hanging in the balance.
Trump reacted furiously to the court of international trade’s decision calling it “wrong”, “political” and the “harshest financial ruling” ever. His officials went further, accusing judges of “judicial overreach” and an abuse of power to “usurp the authority of the president”. In fact, it was Trump who exceeded his emergency powers to levy global tariffs, according to the trade court. Trump had invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on April 2.
Due to the adverse market reaction to that decision, he went back and forth on tariffs, pausing them, lowering some and then raising others. This spooked investors and sowed confusion among America’s trading partners. Trump switched course when markets tanked and there was a heavy sell-off in US bonds. After the markets, it was the turn of the courts to try to restrain Trump. As the Financial Times wrote in a recent editorial, America’s courts are playing a salutary role by “trying to rein in what Trump regards as his limitless powers as president”.
Legal problems have cast a shadow over Trump’s trade agenda. They may impact trade talks underway with many countries, who might see their negotiating hand strengthened by challenges Trump’s policies face from the courts. Crucial negotiations lie ahead with America’s two key trading partners, China and the EU. They can be affected by legal issues at home, even though Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have recently had a positive phone conversation on trade issues.

America’s courts are trying to restrain Trump’s unbridled use of executive power.

While the tariff ruling is arguably the biggest judicial jolt to Trump’s plans, he has encountered legal setbacks on other fronts too. According to one estimate, there have been court orders against 182 of Trump’s executive actions. Some injunctions have been of a temporary nature, but they have still acted as a check on Trump’s whimsical conduct. The petitioners have mostly included state governments, cities, labour unions, civil liberties and non-profit organisations. In the tariff case, it was a group of states led by Oregon that sued the administration over its use of emergency powers without congressional action.
Cases against the administration have involved Trump’s immigration and deportation policies, his downsizing of the federal government that entailed sweeping layoffs of the workforce, freeze on foreign aid, dismantling of US agencies, birthright citizenship rights, and assaults on universities and law firms.
Among the most controversial of Trump’s actions to be legally challenged are the drastic cuts in the size of the federal government by large-scale firing of civil servants, ceasing funding and closing down agencies. The task of executing this plan was given to Trump’s billionaire (now estranged) friend, Elon Musk, through his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which saw over three dozen cases challenging its authority and even more lawsuits contesting funding cuts and sacking of workers. Tens of thousands of federal employees were fired while thousands were placed on forced leave or left their jobs under resignation programmes.
A California court ruling ordered a halt to the downsizing, questioning the legality of the move. Subsequently, in another blow for Trump, an appeals court upheld that decision, forcing the administration to maintain the pause on more cuts and firings. Musk’s exit from the government throws DOGE’s future into uncertainty, even though Trump has vowed its work will carry on.
Ivy League universities have also come under mounting pressure from Trump’s efforts to control these institutions and suppress dissent. The administration’s battle with Harvard University has seen funding withheld, and attempts to change its governance structure and bar its ability to host foreign students. Harvard resisted and asserted its rights in the face of government intimidation by suing the federal government. Its efforts succeeded when a federal judge blocked the order revoking its right to enrol foreign students. Trump then suspended visas for six months for foreign students enrolled for study at Harvard. But this effort to circumvent the court’s ruling will only intensify the legal battle.
Courts have issued important rulings and provided temporary relief in some cases to foreign students whose visas were cancelled or threatened owing to their pro-Palestinian sympathies. The way foreign students have been arrested — some from the streets — handcuffed and sent to detention centres, with their visas abruptly revoked, sparked an outcry in America’s academic community. A California district judge has now barred the administration from ending the legal status of international students across the country. The ruling prevents the authorities from arresting, imprisoning or moving students elsewhere based on their legal status until their case is resolved.
Trump’s response to judicial opposition to his policies has predictably been harsh. He and his officials have vilified judges and subjected some to strong public criticism. Of course, in some notable and consequential cases, courts have also ruled in his favour. But the administration is embroiled in scores of lawsuits and it remains unclear whether Trump will comply with court orders or try to circumvent them. He has already defied court rulings, especially in immigration issues, including a supreme court order in a deportation case. How the growing clash between the executive and judiciary plays out is hard to predict, but for now America’s courts are standing up to Trump’s arbitrary actions, striking them down in key cases and acting as a check on the unbridled use of executive power.

The 39-year-old senator, who was shot during a campaign event as part of his run for the presidency in 2026, is a member of the opposition conservative Democratic Center party founded by former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe. The two men are not related.
According to a party statement condemning the attack, the senator was hosting a campaign event in a public park in the Fontibon neighborhood in the capital on Saturday when “armed subjects shot him from behind.
 
 

The party described the attack as serious, but did not disclose further details on Uribe’s condition. Videos on social media showed a man, identified as Uribe, being tended to after the shooting. He appeared to be bleeding from his head.
Uribe’s wife Maria Claudia Tarazona wrote on her husband’s account on X that he was “fighting for his life”.
Colombia’s Defence Minister Pedro Sanchez said a suspect had been arrested in the shooting and that authorities were investigating whether others were involved. Sanchez said he had visited the hospital where Uribe was being treated.
The government is offering some $730,000 as a reward for information in the case.
Colombia’s presidency issued a statement saying the government “categorically and forcefully” rejected the violent attack, and called for a thorough investigation into the events that took place.
Leftist President Gustavo Petro sympathised with the senator’s family in a message on X saying, “I don’t know how to ease your pain. It is the pain of a mother lost, and of a homeland.”
Petro later said in a speech on Saturday night that the person arrested was a minor and that the investigation would focus on finding who had ordered the attack.
“For now there is nothing more than hypothesis,” Petro said, adding that failures in security protocols would also be looked into.
The United States’ Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that the U.S. “condemns in the strongest possible terms the attempted assassination” of Uribe, blaming Petro’s “inflammatory rhetoric” for the violence.
Uribe, who is not yet an official presidential candidate for his party, is from a prominent family in Colombia. His father was a businessman and union leader. His mother, journalist Diana Turbay, was kidnapped in 1990 by an armed group under the command of the late cartel leader Pablo Escobar. She was killed during a rescue operation in 1991.
Colombia has for decades been embroiled in a conflict between leftist rebels, criminal groups descended from right-wing paramilitaries, and the government.</p><small>2025-06-08 05:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/080956520ff2dd3.jpg?r=095710' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915892/police-investigate-family-of-10-year-old-suspect-in-infant-murder-case-in-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>Police investigate family of 10-year-old suspect in infant murder case in Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: After the police enlarged the scope of their investigation to determine the real circumstance surrounding the murder of a toddler allegedly by her 10-year-old cousin in Ratta Amral, it emerged that the suspect was mentally unstable.
This was revealed by the grandmother of the juvenile suspect during police investigation.
The suspect’s mother had left her husband’s house, along with her two children, including the 10-year-old boy, and started living with her parents in Ratta Amral. She had left behind her two other children with their father who was an addict.
The police investigated the family members of the suspect’s father to find out the motive behind the tragic death of one-year-old Maryam whose body was found in a sewerage line in Ratta Amral late Wednesday night.
Initial postmortem examination suggested that sewage had entered her lungs and brain which caused her death. The little girl was laid to rest in a local graveyard on Thursday afternoon.
Maryam’s grandmother, Musarat Bibi, said a large number of people, including her relatives and people from their neighbourhood, were visiting her house for condolence.
The police have already added murder section (302 of the PPC) in the FIR which had already been registered under kidnapping charges (363 PPC) and arrested the suspect. The boy was shifted to the Child Protection Bureau on the orders of a local court. Musarat Bibi told Dawn that police had investigated the suspect’s paternal grandmother who has revealed to the police that the boy was mentally unstable.
“The boy loved Maryam as an elder brother but what compelled him to do such an act is beyond her understanding,” she said, adding that, “it was our fate”.
“On one side, there is the daughter of my son and on the other is my daughter’s son,” Musarat Bibi said. During initial investigation, the suspect revealed that he picked up the girl from the street and took her to a sewerage line where he submerged her head which claimed her life.
Quoting the 10-year-old boy, the police said he did not like her. However, the police are investigating all aspects.
The police traced the culprit through CCTV footage in which he could be seen taking the girl from the street.The girl’s body was handed over to her parents after postmortem and was laid to rest on Thursday afternoon.

The bull, sitting under the scorching sun, was unable to get up, as it was suffering from foot-and-mouth disease, a highly contagious viral illness wreaking havoc across Punjab for the last two months.
The disease has emerged in the province just ahead of Eidul Azha, leaving buyers and sellers in a lurch. Since cattle markets across the province were not shut down to contain the disease, it has spread to many districts.
“I have lost a cow and four calves due to this disease, and now my bull is fighting for his life,” Mr Abid told Dawn. His cattle pen is located on the outskirts of Chakwal, where he is rearing 13 animals, including cows and buffaloes. According to him, no government veterinarian ever visited his place for the vaccination.
Ironically, the Chakwal livestock department is not even aware of the scale of the havoc that the FMD has been wreaking in Chakwal and Talagang. “Only one case has been reported so far from Tamman village of Talagang, where fifteen animals were affected by the disease,” Additional Director Dr Sohail Manzoor told Dawn. Dawn’s investigation, however, revealed that almost every village in the two districts has been affected by the disease.
For example, in Murid village, two cows and four calves owned by dairy farmer Jaffar Abbas died. “The loss of my animals has broken my back as my two cows were valued at Rs 1 million,” Jaffar Abbas told Dawn.
His neighbour Ahmed Khan was administering medicine to a cow when this correspondent reached his cattle pen. “My cow is neither eating her fodder nor drinking water due to illness,” Ahmed Khan told Dawn, opening up the mouth of his cow to show her blistered tongue.
The cattle pen of Qazi Farooq is only a kilometre from the livestock department’s office and Mr Farooq has lost seven animals to the disease. In the same locality, eight out of 24 animals owned by Ashir Ali are sick for the same reason.
In Dhakku village, the herd of goats and sheep owned by Aftab Ahmed has been badly affected by the disease, while his five cows are still ill. In Dhudial, dairy farmer Syed Asad Abbas lost a heifer and Mohammad Arif in Murid village lost three calves to FMD. Many other farmers belonging to different villages also confirmed the prevalence of the disease in their cattle.
Last week, Mehran Aziz from Dhakku took his sacrificial bull to the market and demanded Rs 350,000, but the animal could not fetch the desired price and he had to bring it back. Days after, the bull contracted FMD.
Meanwhile, the cows who survived the disease are still reeling from aftershocks.
“A cow, which was giving twenty litres of milk, is now only producing three to four litres; it is also feared that pregnant cows would abort, while the lactating ones might not come into estrous cycle”, a veterinarian told Dawn.
Former livestock deputy director Dr Muhammad Riaz, who is the most sought-after veterinarian in Chakwal, told Dawn that he had attended to more than 150 cases of FMD during the last one and a half months.
“The disease is still present in many villages,” he said. “…the mortality rate in large animals used to be hardly one per cent in the past, but this year it killed even large animals in significant numbers,” he revealed.
He said the vaccination must be carried out by a separate task force that should be completed within a short span of time. “But, unfortunately, the campaign is carried out by the same veterinarians who treat the infected animals. Moreover, disposable syringes and proper equipment are not used, and this practice causes the spread of the disease instead of controlling it,” said Dr Riaz.
When contacted, Dr Sohail Manzoor, the LDD additional director, said that he would look into the issue. “Strict action would be taken against those employees who did not report the FMD cases,” he said, adding that vaccination had been carried out in different hotspots of Chakwal and Talagang where FMD had been witnessed in the past.
Pakistan is among the few countries that still cannot control FMD, despite lofty claims by the federal and provincial governments. According to a report prepared by the Punjab Livestock and Dairy Development Department (LDD), Pakistan faces an annual loss of $6-8 billion in the livestock sector due to FMD. This fatal disease also remains a major obstacle in the export of Pakistani meat to the major markets of the world.
Meanwhile, at the government level, the efforts are insufficient to counter this disease.
The Foot and Mouth Disease Research Centre in Lahore produces 10 million doses of FMD vaccine annually due to limited budget and obsolete technology, while the annual demand exceeds 80 million doses in the province, the LDD report said.
The livestock department has been using two vaccination strategies for FMD control in Punjab since 2017.
In south Punjab, massive vaccination has been underway since 2017 to make the region a disease-free zone, while ring vaccination is carried out in case of an outbreak in other parts of the province.
Ironically, south Punjab has not become FMD-free, as the current outbreak was first reported from different southern districts.

• Driving without licence to cost Rs50,000 for four-wheelers, Rs25,000 for bikers
• Meeting decides to ban four-seater rickshaws across Sindh
KARACHI: The Sindh government has decided to amend the motor vehicle law to increase traffic violation fines and ban four-seater rickshaws.
After the amendments, wrong-way driving will cost a car driver Rs100,000 and motorcyclist Rs25,000.
The decision to this effect was taken at a meeting, chaired by Home Minister Zia Ul Hassan Lanjar, to discuss amendments to the Motor Vehicles Rules.
The meeting, attended among others by Excise Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla, law secretary, transport secretary and DIG Traffic, also approved mandatory fitness certification for both commercial and non-commercial vehicles, outsourcing vehicle fitness evaluations to third parties and a ban on the sale of paper car tints, fancy lights and sirens either online or at shops.
 
 

For wrong-way driving, the approved fines are set at Rs200,000 for government vehicles, Rs100,000 for other four-wheelers and Rs25,000 for motorcycles.
Driving a vehicle without a valid licence will cost a fine of Rs25,000 for motorcyclists and Rs50,000 for car drivers. One-wheeling or drifting will result in a Rs100,000 fine for a first-time offence, going up to Rs200,000 and Rs300,000 for repeated violations.
These decisions were taken in the backdrop of a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024.
The meeting approved legal amendments to enforce a complete ban on four-seater rickshaws with the excise minister assuring full support from the excise department in enforcing traffic regulations.
He ensured the meeting that no registration or route permits would be issued for four-seater or larger rickshaws like Qingqi, as many accidents have taken place due to rickshaws colliding with trucks.
The excise minister further said that a crackdown would be launched against any such vehicles found operating on the roads. He promised a prompt completion of the vehicle fitness service structure and said that strict enforcement of fitness requirements would follow.
 
 

He said that it would be mandatory for water tankers and dumpers to install trackers and sensors.
It was decided that a comprehensive draft of the new regulations would be prepared and submitted to the Sindh government for approval and ratification.
The home minister said that only one-plus-two rickshaws would be allowed on the roads to reduce traffic congestion, accidents and rule violations.
The meeting also approved the mandatory installation of at least five cameras in heavy vehicles.
It was also decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines will not be allowed to be sold or transferred.
Mr Lanjar further said that the traffic, transport and excise systems would be interlinked and moved online, and announced the appointment of a dedicated traffic magistrate to handle traffic law offence cases.

The ban will remain in place till June 13 and it is applied to the Kannup, Sunerah, Mubarak Village, Turtle and Dua Chowk beaches.
Official sources said there was no restriction on people to visit other city beaches, including Sandspit, Hawkesbay, Paradise Point and Seaview, as these beaches were guarded by lifeguards and law enforcers.
 
 

Commissioner Syed Hasan Naqvi imposed the ban under Section 144 of the criminal procedure code on the request of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC).
The order authorised the SHOs concerned to register FIRs under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code against violators of the ban.
The officials said that a ban on swimming at other beaches might be imposed in view of the monsoon season, when there was comparatively high tide there.

KARACHI: It is disappointing that only two Urdu films will be released on Eidul Azha. They are: Love Guru directed by Nadeem Baig and Deemak helmed by Rafay Rashdi. Although half-a-dozen Pakistani films hit the cinema screens on Eidul Fitr (five Urdu and one Punjabi), they did not manage to create a splash in the placid waters of our local movie scene.
It is abundantly clear now that the only way for the film exhibitors and cinema owners to do business is by virtue of big Hollywood releases. For example, prior to Eidul Azha, Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning, the popular franchise starring Tom Cruise, did well at the box office. (It is difficult to ascertain the exact number that it has managed to attract because MI is still in theatres.)
On Eidul Azha, too, a couple of major English language films — apart from a few Turkish projects dubbed in Urdu — will be there to compete with the Pakistani movies: Ballerina and Karate Kid: Legends. The former is a spin-off of the John Wick series and the latter a throwback sequel to a project that began in 1984.
This means, both are strong franchises. Since, Love Guru and Deemak will have more screens, as they should, Ballerina and Karate Kid may have a sluggish start at the box office.
Now back to the Urdu films. Love Guru is a romantic comedy (or rom-com in modern day parlance) starring Humayun Saeed and Mahira Khan. The presence of the seasoned lead pair, and the team that’s involved in the making of the movie (director Nadeem Baig and writer Vasay Chaudhry) pretty much gives an idea as to what the storyline will entail. It is primarily meant to entertain.
But will it rake in big numbers in terms of ticket sales? The question can be answered in a month or so.

In addition to Love Guru and Deemak English language films Ballerina and Karate Kid: Legends are also being screened

 
 

One of the marked features of Deemak is that it’s director and producer are the sons of two distinguished Pakistani women. Rafay is the son of Mehtab Rashdi and Murad Ali (the producer) is the son of eminent poet, the late Parveen Shakir.
Deemak, starring Javed Sheikh, Faysal Qureshi and Sonya Hussyn, is a horror film. It is a difficult genre to do justice to — a slight misstep, and all can go topsy-turvy.
Those who have seen the movie are singing praises for it. In the final analysis, though, it will be box office results which will put a cinematic venture in its right place.
