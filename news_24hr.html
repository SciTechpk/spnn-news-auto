We saw how the national elections were manipulated. We saw how a coalition of failed politicians was hoisted into the corridors of power. We knew who the real decision-makers were. Civilian institutions like the administration and police services appeared to be pawns of those involved in political engineering.
The myth of judicial independence was shattered. Votes cast legitimately were allegedly disregarded through a fraudulent counting process supervised by a weak-willed Election Commission. People’s disaffection and hunger for change went unheeded. It was a year of discontent.
 
 

The year 2025 so far has seen how power is harnessed through draconian laws, the suppression of the media, and political manoeuvres through controversial constitutional benches. These are the undeniable realities that must be reckoned with. The breach of trust between the state and society is all too evident and it is also clear democracy in the country is a mere façade.
 
 

The dominant mood today is one of confusion and despair. The problem is that we have lost our vision of a future that encompasses empathy, tolerance, freedom, liberty and justice. Tragically, the truth is shut out as our self-respect and dignity are repeatedly called into question. This is not what our founding father wanted us to be — an enlightened, democratic polity. What went wrong? Are we ready to face the reality of this ignominy?
Post-1947, our first two army chiefs were British. The first native chief imposed martial law, abrogated the constitution of 1956 and became the president. He conferred upon himself the elevated title of field marshal — with little to show for it. His decade-long rule of so-called development ended in widespread disaffection and protests. He was deposed by the next army chief who oversaw the loss of the eastern wing of Jinnah’s Pakistan in 1971. The western wing then experienced a turbulent phase of civilian rule. A major development was the near-consensus passage of the Constitution of 1973, ushering in an era of parliamentary democracy as a federation, promising autonomy to the four federating units.

We need to forge a model that counters the authoritarian threat.

The democratic phase of the 1970s was disrupted yet again. The army chief appointed by the civilian chief executive imposed martial law in 1977. He became president even while remaining the army chief and gave himself extensions during his decade-long rule, which saw the persecution of political opponents and prosecution of an elected prime minister, who was awarded the death penalty by a compliant judiciary. The 1980s witnessed a decade of decadence when religiosity and hypocrisy reigned supreme.
The death of the general in an air crash in 1988 brought the civilians back to power but the prime minister, who belonged to the PPP, was handed over the reins only after conceding major decision-making in the foreign policy and national security domains to the defence establishment. Thus, the foundation of a hybrid governance framework was laid in 1988. Civilian governments were changed one after another during the 1990s. And then another chief deposed the prime minister who had appointed him, leading to a decade of ‘enlightened’ military rule from 1999 to 2008.
Since the 2008 elections, we have seen two major political parties lead coalition governments and complete their five-year parliamentary tenure up to 2018. However, no prime minister has survived to complete a five-year tenure due to the actions of the actual decision-makers. In the 2018 elections, a new experiment saw the emergence of a popular sports hero who was ensconced as chief executive. His ouster and subsequent prosecution and conviction in corruption cases follows the rule book of the powers that be. People in power change while the methods remain the same. The present dispensation seems to have set new standards of authoritarianism.
Many justifiably argue that for a progressive polity and liberal democracy to prevail, what is needed is a national movement against political autocrats and religious extremists. “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice,” said Martin Luther King Jr. The progressives suffer from various maladies: inertia, and the lack of a solid liberal platform that can generate a movement for adherence to the true spirit of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
The real strength of liberalism has always lain with the academia, civil society organisations, progressive lawyers’ bodies, human rights institutions and grassroots cooperatives and unions. Today, they lie scattered, rudderless and leaderless. Collective cohesion is missing. A central question is: how can you do politics when the ground has shifted so decidedly in favour of kleptocracy through an obviously rigged electoral process? We see a national crisis of liberal democracy. A challenge is to figure out what pillars a movement for true democracy will stand on. The decay of decent liberal values must be addressed within the full spectrum of the sociopolitical and economic frameworks.
We need to forge a model that counters the authoritarian threat. The ascendant forces of oligarchy and autocracy must be defeated through concerted, non-violent grassroots movements. Let the urban youth and rural farmers combine their energies to galvanise the educated, urbane, honest middle-class communities to forge partnerships against retrogressive elements. A manifesto prepared by liberal progressives along these lines can turn the tide against the entrenched forces of elitism and fortune seekers who thrive in a state of reactionary status quo, led by those outside the political fold. Working together on this project to capture the fragmented attention of the people can help the country once again start its journey in the direction of a liberal, democratic and enlightened polity. We have a dream: a future of dignity, liberty and justice. We should be able to face the truth. It may hurt, but it also heals.

Accountability Court Judge Sheikh Ejaz Ali cancelled the warrants and restored Mr Elahi’s bail bonds.
The case relates to Bahria Town’s alleged illegal occupation of 684 acres in Rakh Takht Pari and 732.5 acres in the Loi Bher forests.
Takht Pari, located six kilometres from Rawal­pi­ndi near G.T. Road, spans a total of 2,210 acres and was transferred to the forest de­­­partment on Aug 4, 1856.
According to a Punjab government report, the land consists primarily of natural shrub forest, dominated by Phulai and Sanatha bushes.
Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan, representing Bahria Town owner Malik Riaz in the Supreme Court, defended his client by highlighting his charitable contributions, including the provision of medicines to the underprivileged and food to the needy. However, the court, while acknowledging Mr Riaz’s philanthropy, remarked that the case was akin to the saying: “Rob Peter to pay Paul.”

Despite repeated assurances by the authorities that Peca would not be used to target journalists or censor dissent, the law has once again been invoked — this time under the vague pretext of curbing “fake, misleading and defamatory” content.
Among those affected are independent journalists, political analysts, and the official PTI account. The move appears to be less about safeguarding national security and more about controlling the narrative. As per court documents, the blocked channels were allegedly engaged in defamation, disinformation and provoking ill-will towards state institutions.
Yet, no clear definitions of what constitutes ‘fake news’ or ‘defamation’ appear to have been provided. Sweeping accusations, along with the invocation of national security, have once more exposed just how broadly and arbitrarily Peca is being applied.
 
 

Independent journalism in Pakistan is already under threat. The authorities have consistently failed to distinguish between criticism of government policy and attacks on the state itself. Almost any criticism is instantly labelled as anti-state activity. This conflation is dangerous. Holding the government, military or judiciary accountable through peaceful means — including digital platforms — is a constitutional right. It is neither sedition, nor subversion.
The newly rebranded National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency, much like its predecessor, appears to be more focused on policing speech than addressing real cybercrime. Section 37 of Peca, under which this action was taken, continues to function as a legal bludgeon against dissent. International watchdogs, local media unions and digital rights activists consistently warn that such actions violate Pakistan’s obligations under international human rights law.
 
 

It is alarming what precedent this sets for future online censorship. If content can be taken down solely on the state’s interpretation of intent, no independent voice is safe. It also places tech platforms like YouTube in a precarious position, forcing them to comply with vague legal orders or risk state retaliation.
If there is truly defamatory content, why not seek legal recourse under the Defamation Ordinance? Why enforce blanket bans? Such bans should be lifted and the misuse of Peca must end. A country cannot legislate its way out of political discontent, and silencing opposition will only deepen public mistrust.

The chairman of the committee, Senator Ali Zafar, also observed that the ministry of information had fai­led to provide a report in this regard and that its request to the ministry of interior had gone unanswered.
The committee decided to summon the secretary of interior in the next meeting for clarification regar­ding registration of cases against media persons under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
While discussing the Prohibition of Unethical Advertisements Act, Senator Afnan Ullah voiced concern over increasing display of content promoting gambling, alcohol and inappropriate clothing on TV and social media. He cited the appearance of betting ads during international cricket matches and depictions of alcohol use in TV dramas as evidence of regulatory lapses.
Senator Sarmad Ali highlighted the accessibility of gambling apps and proposed regulatory action by PTA or religious advisory mechanisms, along with the formation of a content monitoring body.
The committee members raised questions about the implementation of existing Pemra laws over such advertisements. Senator Pervaiz Rashid argued that penalties have failed to deter misconduct but cautioned against overregulation of cultural norms, especially for attire.
Senator Afnan clarified that the legislation does not aim to target women. The committee decided to seek the opinion of the minister of information over the Prohibition of Unethical Advertisements Act.
On the Right of Access to Infor­m­a­tion (Amendment) Bill, Senator Za­­rqa Suharwardy Taimur expressed serious concern about government departments providing incomplete or selective data. The senator cited Scotland as a role model where public institutions ensure transparency and timely responses.
The committee also discussed ad­­ministrative matters of PTV and exa­­mined budget and staffing issues.
The ministry officials reported that Rs11bn annual budget had been exhausted, with Rs8.5bn consumed by salaries of the PTV staff alone.
Senator Waqar Mehdi raised alarm over the illegal occupation of Radio Pakistan buildings in Karachi and electricity theft through unauthorised connections.
He called for inspections of Radio Pakistan properties outside Islamabad to assess conditions and prevent further encroachments.

Zubeida Mustafa

A PIONEER in women’s journalism in Pakistan and a dedicated voice for the marginalised, Zubeida Mustafa passed away on Wednesday evening in Karachi. She was 84.
Known to her colleagues at Dawn as ‘Mrs Mustafa’ or ‘ZM’, she spent 33 years at the paper, retiring in 2008 after serving as assistant editor.
During her over three-decade tenure at Dawn, Mrs Mustafa helped bring out numerous supplements and satellite publications such as the education page and Books & Authors, the first dedicated English-language magazine focusing on book reviews and literary matters brought out by a mainstream paper in the country.
ZM was educated at St Joseph’s Convent in Karachi, and later attained a Master’s degree in International Relations from Karachi University. She also attended the London School of Economics, but could not complete her studies at that institution.
She began her professional life at the Karachi-based Pakistan Institu­­te of International Affairs, and was later approached by Dawn‘s editor Ahmad Ali Khan to work at the paper. She considered Khan Sahib a major influence, and in an interview with Newsline termed him “a very progressive man and a champion of women’s rights“.
But as Zohra Yusuf noted in a review of ZM’s autobiography, “in her own quiet way, [she] exercised a significant influence on the newspaper’s journey”. This included bringing the “women’s perspective” to the paper’s editorials. Zubeida Mustafa’s editorials, and later columns, focused on a wide variety of subjects, including international affairs, education and issues of the marginalised and the downtrodden.
As Dawn’s op-ed editor Ayesha Azfar, who worked with Mrs Mustafa noted, “Her last column for op-ed appeared in March this year, after which she was finding it increasingly difficult because of her failing health. She was legally visually impaired, and it is remarkable the way she managed to do her columns, to regularly attend seminars, and keep up her interest in education — she wrote a book on that — women, and health amongst other subjects.”
ZM edited numerous books and wrote two: her aforementioned biography My DAWN Years — Exploring Social Issues and Reforming School Education in Pakistan & the Language Dilemma. She was recognised for her professional work through various local and international awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award presented to her by the International Women’s Media Foundation in 2012.
Pakistan Herald Publications Limited had launched an award named after her in 2013, titled the ZM Award For Journalistic Excellence to recognise her contribution “both to Dawn and to the field of journalism in Pakistan”.
Activist and columnist Naeem Sadiq said he knew Zubeida Mustafa for 30 years. “She was a good friend. She had lunch with us about a month ago and wanted to come again. She was a great woman, it is the nation’s loss. She taught us values and professional ethics. She was a very progressive lady. She wrote on human rights, issues of the handicapped. She set standards in ethics and morality,” he observed.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan mourned her loss and observed that she “championed social, cultural and language rights like few. She was a comrade-in-arms and stood by the disadvantaged and oppressed”.
 






A condolence statement from the Karachi Press Club noted that she “was not just a journalist; she was an institution”.
“Her work on social issues, education, and health was particularly impactful, demonstrating her deep empathy and dedication to improving the lives of ordinary citizens,” KPC President Fazil Jamili and Secretary Sohail Afzal Khan said, adding that she leaves a “legacy that will continue to inspire generations of journalists”.

• Official statement causes confusion by terming ordinance an ‘act of parliament’
• Companies must be licensed by authority to offer virtual asset services
ISLAMABAD: The government announced on Wednesday that President Zardari had approved the ‘Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025’ to establish an independent regulator for virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.
However, an official statement  from the office of the state minister referred to it as the ‘Virtual Assets Act, 2025’, leading to confusion and concerns about why the draft law had not been moved to the National Assembly or Senate, as required for a bill to become an act of parliament.
The confusion was clarified later when the authorities confirmed to Dawn that the regulation was not an act of parliament but rather an ordinance, issued under Article 89 of the Constitution. The provision allows the president to issue an ordinance in urgent matters when both houses are not in session; such ordinances remain in effect for 120 days and do not require passage through the National Assembly and Senate.
According to the Gazette of Pakistan dated July 9, 2025, seen by Dawn, the ordinance (No. VII of 2025) was promulgated on July 8 by the president to establish a regulatory authority for the licensing, regulation and supervision of virtual assets and virtual asset service providers.
Earlier, the SAPM on blockchain and crypto said in a statement that the president “has approved landmark Virtual Assets Act 2025 on the prime minister’s advice”. It added that the government has formally approved the “act” following endorsements from the federal cabinet, the prime minister and the president.
The statement said that the law (ordinance) established “the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regul­atory Authority (PVARA), an autonomous federal body empowered to license, regulate and supervise entities dealing in virtual assets”.
The authority has been granted comprehensive powers to ensure transparency, compliance, financial integrity and the prevention of illicit activities in alignment with international standards, including those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
The authority’s board will include key government stakeholders, such as the State Bank’s governor, secretaries of finance, law and justice, and information technology and telecommunications, as well as the chairpersons of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and the Digital Pakistan Authority.
Two independent directors with expertise in virtual assets, law, finance or technology will also be appointed by the federal government. The board’s chairperson will be chosen based on demonstrated experience in finance, law, technology or regulatory affairs.
Under the ordinance, any person or company intending to offer virtual asset services in or from Pakistan must be licensed by the PVARA. A structured licensing regime will be introduced, with specific requirements for incorporation, operational capacity, compliance frameworks and reporting obligations, the statement added.
“The legislation (ordinance) also incorporates a framework for responsible innovation by establishing a regulatory sandbox, allowing emerging technologies and business models to be tested under supervisory oversight,” it said.
In addition, the authority may issue no-action relief letters under defined conditions to facilitate experimentation while preserving regulatory accountability.
To ensure compatibility with Islamic finance principles, the law mandates the formation of a Sharia Advisory Committee, which will advise PVARA on matters related to the Sharia compliance of virtual asset products and services.
Licensed entities offering Islamic financial products will be bound by the rulings issued by the committee, the statement said, adding that the ordinance “also provides for the establishment of a Virtual Assets Appellate Tribunal to hear appeals against regulatory decisions”.
The tribunal will function with judicial independence and a specialised bench comprising experts in law, finance and technology.
With this forward-looking legislation, Pakistan takes a major step in shaping a secure, inclusive and innovation-friendly digital financial ecosystem, ensuring that technological progress is matched with institutional readiness and public interest safeguards.
This milestone comes less than four months after the launch of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) on March 14, marking the beginning of a new era in the country’s digital finance journey.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb serves as the chairman of the PCC, while Bilal Bin Saqib is its CEO, holding the status of the prime minister’s special assistant and the minister of state.

Officials told Dawn that Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur chaired a meeting on Tuesday night, which lasted over 90 minutes, in which it was decided to convene a multi-party meeting to be attended by the heads of all parliamentary parties on Monday. This sitting would be followed by a PTI parliamentary party meeting on the same day.
“Apart from these two mee­tings, the provincial government has also decided to hold another meeting and to engage tribal elders along with other stakeholders in order to overcome the law and order situation,” officials said. Following these meetings, government delegations would be constituted to visit tribal districts, the officials said, adding that the invitations for the meeting were being sent.
When contacted, the chief minister’s adviser on information, Barrister Muham­mad Ali Saif, confirmed the development, saying the government intended to consult public representatives and stakeholders to devise a strategy for lasting peace in the region.

Huddle with govt allies, opposition parties likely on Monday; meeting with tribal elders also on the cards

“I will not say the situation is volatile, but there is unrest among people against the Taliban (Tehreek-i-Taliban Paki­stan), with tribesmen from North Wazir­i­stan already holding a sit-in for peace while those from South Waziristan planning to hold a sit-in today [July 10],” Barrister Saif told Dawn. He said the protesters included people from all walks of life and from almost all political parties. He stated that some people had expressed concern over a military operation in their areas, calling such an action an extreme step.
 
 

“Now this is the reason we want to take everybody along — like all the stakeholders, including political parties, locals, tribal elders and others, so that they come up with their proposals and then those proposals along with suggestions from the government, are deliberated upon,” the CM’s aide said.
“The provincial government wants to develop a consensus. Like, whatever the government does for lasting peace, [it] should have public and political support,” he added.
Meanwhile, a statement issued from the chief minister’s secretariat read that the meeting was held to review the law and order situation in the merged districts with a special focus on North and South Waziristan. It said that the meeting decided to formulate a joint and consensus-based strategy involving all schools of thought and segments of the population to eliminate militancy.
 
 

CM Gandapur emphasised that the prevailing circumstances demanded that all political parties set aside their differences and unite on a single platform to work towards restoring peace and security and urged elected representatives to speak with one voice and implement a unified strategy for the eradication of terrorism. He further stated that lasting peace could only be achieved through meaningful action, mutual consultation, and collective decision-making.
Last week, thousands of people gathered in Mirali to protest an anticipated military operation in the area. In December last year, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly unanimously passed a joint resolution against potential military action in parts of Khyber and Bannu districts.

• Rubio announces sanctions against outspoken UN expert Francesca Albanese
• Six children among 26 killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza
JERUSALEM: As Israel fell in line with US President Donald Trump and his optimism about the prospects for a ceasefire and prisoner-release deal in Gaza, Hamas called the talks difficult due to Israel’s “intransigence”, but said it was working seriously to overcome hurdles.
The Palestinian group announced it would release 10 prisoners amid ongoing peace efforts, but clarified that the agreement still had several sticking points, including the flow of aid, withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, and ‘genuine guarantees’ for a permanent ceasefire.
The announcement came after four days of indirect talks brokered by Qatar.
“Despite the difficulty of negotiations over these issues until now due to the intransigence of the occupation, we continue to work seriously and with a positive spirit with the mediators to overcome the hurdles and end the suffering of our people and ensure their aspirations to freedom, safety and a dignified life,” the group said.
Hamas has vowed “Gaza will not surrender” and a Palestinian official close to the ceasefire talks indicated that Israel was still holding back a deal by refusing to allow free entry of aid in Gaza.
One Palestinian source familiar with the negotiations in Doha said the Israeli delegation was “mostly listening rather than negotiating, which reflects Israel’s ongoing policy of obstruction and sabotaging any potential agreement”.
Meanwhile, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu – who met with top officials in Washington – struck a more upbeat note, in line with President Trump’s hopes for a ceasefire in Gaza this week or the next.
“I think we’re getting closer to a deal,” Netanyahu told Fox Business Network. “There’s a good chance that we’ll have it.”
Sanctions on UN expert
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the sanctioning of UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, following her criticism of Washington’s policy on Gaza.
The action was supposedly taken over the outspoken UN rapporteur’s “efforts to prompt (International Criminal Court) action against US and Israeli officials, companies, and executives”, Rubio claimed..
The Italy-born expert, who has consistently been a leading voice speaking for Palestinians, released a damning report earlier this month denouncing companies she said “profited from the Israeli economy of illegal occupation, apartheid, and now genocide” in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Rubio also attacked her for “biased and malicious activities,” and accused her of having “spewed unabashed antisemitism (and) support for terrorism.”
He said she escalated her contempt for the US by writing “threatening letters” to several US companies, making what Rubio called unfounded accusations and recommending the ICC pursue prosecutions of the companies and their executives.
Gaza strikes
Meanwhile, Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Wednesday that 26 people were killed in Israeli strikes, at least six of them children.
“The explosion was massive, like an earthquake,” said Zuhair Judeh, 40, who witnessed one of the strikes, which prompted frantic scenes as people scrabbled in the rubble for survivors.
“The bodies and remains of the martyrs were scattered,” he added, calling it “a horrific massacre”.

The two separate but iden­t­ical intra-court appe­als (ICA) were filed before the Supreme Court through senior counsel Hamid Khan and Muhammad Waqar Rana against the June 19 ruling.
The bar associations moved the apex court after five judges of the IHC — Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Jus­tice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz — challenged the same ruling before the SC on June 28.
In its decision, the constitutional bench, by a three to two majority, had held that the transfer of three judges from three different high courts to the IHC was within the framework of the Constitution. Less than two weeks after the decision, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan nominated Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar as the permanent chief justice of the IHC and he was sworn in on July 8.
The fresh ICA requests the SC to set aside the June 19 judgement, arguing that it failed to resolve the key constitutional question regar­ding the requirement of taking an oath before assuming office as a judge of the IHC.
“It is an admitted fact that the transferred judges did not take oath upon their transfer to the IHC; therefore, they cannot legally assume office,” the petition stated. It added that the June 19 ruling was liable to be set aside as it failed to resolve the issue in essence.
The appeal contended that by remanding the matter to President Asif Ali Zardari, the majority judgment of June 19 effectively allowed the executive to rectify legal deficiencies in the Feb 1 notification, thereby facilitating executive to infringe upon the independence of the judiciary. The ruling, it claimed, violated the doctrine of trichotomy of powers.
It further argued that the June 19 order was against the law and all rules of fairness and thus void, without jurisdiction, coram non judice having been passed without lawful authority and thus of no legal effect.
The appellants submitted that all related actions as well as subsequent proceedings of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan regarding the IHC chief justice’s appointment were unconstitutional and must be declared void. The judgment, notifications and appointments were purportedly made in pursuance of the directions given in the judgment, the petition said.
 
 

It is an accepted principle of constitutional interpretation that all articles and legal provisions were aggregate formulations incorporating therein constitutional values/principles and structure, the petition said. A constitutional document is to be read as a whole to understand the underlying constitutional values, principles and objectives, it said.
It explained that the independence of the judiciary was a basic feature of the Constitution and must be protected from executive interference, especially in matters of appointment, transfer, and removal of judges. The Supreme Court recognise the independence of the judiciary as one of the basic features of the Constitution, the petition said, adding the appointments, transfer and removal of judges having been provided in different provisions of the Constitution.

“A special vaccination campaign is scheduled from July 14 to 18 in Diamer district and three districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, targeting a total of 158,497 children. Additionally, a fractional IPV-OPV campaign will be conducted in seven selected districts of Balochistan from August 4 to 11, aiming to vaccinate approximately six million children,” said an official.

• KKH reopens for traffic but heatwave persists in GB; glacial melting, floods cause severe damage
LAHORE / GILGIT: At least 11 people lost their lives and many others sustained injuries as heavy monsoon rains lashed Lahore, its surrounding districts and some parts of Balochistan on Wednesday. The downpours caused widespread flooding and disrupted daily life in several areas.
In Lahore, the heavy rainfall submerged low-lying areas and major roads, exposing the city’s inadequate drainage infrastructure.
According to data from the Water and Sanitation Agency’s (Wasa) Monsoon Control Room, Lahore received an average of 58.8mm of rain, with some areas like Nishtar Town recording the highest 84mm, followed by Lakshmi Chowk (78mm) and Paniwala Talab (74mm).
The first spell of rain lashed the city from 2:45am to 5:40am, with a second, more intense downpour hitting between 10:45am and 12:11pm.
The heavy showers exposed the weaknesses in Lahore’s drainage system, with key areas such as Jail Road (63mm), Qurtaba Chowk (68mm) and Wasa Head Office in Gulberg (69mm) experiencing severe water accumulation. The rainwater mixed with sewage, creating a public health crisis as residents struggled to navigate flooded streets.
 
 

At Yakki Gate, a child was electrocuted by exposed wiring, while multiple Lesco feeders tripped across the city, leaving thousands without electricity for hours.
“We’ve been without power since the morning and the stagnant water is making it impossible to leave our homes,” said Rukhsana Bibi, a resident of Mughalpura, which received 60mm of rain.
Residents of Barki Road also faced immense difficulties in travelling. They complained that no machinery was sent to clear the water from the roads and streets until evening, with the Wasa and district administration focusing efforts on draining water only from “elite” areas.
Despite claims from the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) about deploying cleaning teams and clearing over 6,000 waste containers, citizens reported minimal improvements on the ground.
“The main roads are still submerged, and no one from the administration is here to help,” said Asif Mahmood, a shopkeeper at Lakshmi Chowk.
The situation was particularly dire in low-lying areas like Farrukhabad (49mm) and Johar Town (39mm), where drainage systems were virtually non-existent.
Monsoon rains also affected several other districts across Punjab in the last 24 hours. Khanewal recorded 51mm, Rawalpindi 42mm, Sahiwal 44mm, Murree 41mm, Okara 30mm, Mandi Bahauddin 27mm, Mangla 24mm, and Toba Tek Singh 13mm.
Other regions like Gujranwala, Bahawalpur, Gujrat, Kasur, Bahawalnagar, Sargodha, Multan and Jhang also experienced downpours.
Deaths and injuries
According to Rescue 1122, nine people lost their lives and many others were injured in rain-related incidents across the province.
Two children died when the roof of their house collapsed due to the rain in Sheikhupura. Rescue teams also retrieved four people trapped under the rubble of a collapsed house in Pakpattan. In Jhelum valley, a cloudburst caused severe damage to houses and vehicles, while roads were destroyed.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast more intense rainfall over the next 24 hours in Lahore and much of Punjab.
Irfan Ali Kathia, director general of Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), said the rains are expected to continue until July 13. Thunderstorms are likely on Thursday in Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Sialkot, Narowal, Gujarat, Lahore and Hafizabad. The Punjab government has also imposed Section 144 around rivers and canals.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), water levels are expected to rise in the Kabul, Indus, Chenab and Jhelum rivers, with low-level flooding likely at Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma and Taunsa along the Indus.
Low-level flooding is also feared in Marala and Khanki on the Chenab River, and at Mangla on the Jhelum River. Tributaries of the Swat and Panjkora rivers may also experience flooding.
Heavy rainfall is expected to cause a significant rise in water flow in the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur, as well as in local streams in Jhal Magsi, Kachhi, Sibi, Qila Saifullah, Zhob and Musakhel districts in Balochistan.
Two people were killed and another injured in separate rain-related incidents in Balochistan’s Khuzdar and Mastung districts on Wednesday. Heavy rainfall and strong winds caused a wall to collapse in Khuzdar, resulting in the death of a man named Muhammad Arif and injuring Ehsanullah.
In Bolan Colony in the Kanak area of Mastung, a tanker carrying LPG overturned on a person due to slippery roads caused by the rain. The victim, identified as Muhammad Yaqoob, was killed on the spot.
Glacial melting intensifies in GB
The current heatwaves have accelerated glacial melting across Gilgit-Baltistan, leading to widespread flooding and soil erosion that have disconnected roads, damaged homes, agriculture and disrupted power and water supplies in various areas.
 
 

Rising water levels in rivers and streams have put downstream communities at significant risk. According to the local administration, river erosion has severed links to the Hoper, Hisper and Nagar Khas areas on Thursday, with access roads submerged or washed away.
Flooding from the Supultar Nallah has once again damaged the RCC bridge and agricultural land in Tokorkot, while water from the Hamari Nallah and Supultar Nallah has cut off drinking and irrigation water supplies to most residents in Nagar Khas and Hoper.
The surge of glacial water near the Hamorkhay area has led to continued erosion, endangering homes in nearby villages. In Upper Hunza, rising water levels in the Khunjerab River have caused the destruction of power infrastructure, with two electricity poles submerged, cutting off the electricity supply to several villages in Gojal.
The situation has also affected irrigation and drinking water systems, crops and bridges, leaving the residents of Nagar and Hunza districts without essential services like water, electricity and road access.
In Gilgit, the increasing water levels in the Shigar River have damaged the K2 Road, leaving hundreds of residents and foreign tourists stranded. Officials said the melting Baltoro Glacier had rapidly increased the volume of water in nearby rivers and streams, further exacerbating the situation.
Flash floods in Babusar Valley, Chilas, also caused significant damage, with 10 homes destroyed and crops damaged. The Karakoram Highway, which had been blocked in Chilas, was reopened for traffic on Thursday, allowing thousands of stranded passengers, including tourists, to continue their journeys.
Rising water levels in the Jutal area in Gilgit have damaged homes and farmland, with many people living near rivers facing the imminent threat of flooding. Local officials have warned that the situation remains precarious, with many areas still without power, water and proper access routes.
The Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) expressed fears of a major water crisis in the region due to climate change, which is causing a decrease in snowfall and rapid melting of glaciers.
Geo-fenced SMS alerts
Meanwhile, Jazz and the NDMA have partnered to deliver geo-fenced SMS alerts to millions of citizens in flood-risk areas. The alerts, part of the Disaster Early Warning System (DEW-3), are designed to enhance public awareness and enable timely evacuations or precautionary measures in flood-prone areas.
Under the agreement, more than 23 million Jazz users residing in regions identified as vulnerable by the NDMA will receive location-based alerts, ensuring that citizens are informed of impending flood risks.

Concerns over political bias, hate speech and factual inaccuracy in AI chatbots have mounted since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022.
“We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,” said a post attributed to the AI system on Musk’s social media platform X, where the bot can be accessed.
“Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X.”
 






The firm said xAI was training the bot for “only truth-seeking” and thanked its users for helping the company identify the inappropriate posts.
Screenshots posted on X showed several posts made by the bot in which it praised Adolf Hitler, and claimed Jews promoted “anti-white hate”.
 






The chatbot, developed by Musk’s company xAI, was criticised by Jewish activist group Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for answering multiple user prompts with the questionable posts.
“What we are seeing from Grok LLM right now is irresponsible, dangerous and anti-Semitic, plain and simple,” the ADL said on X.
“This supercharging of extremist rhetoric will only amplify and encourage the anti-Semitism that is already surging on X and many other platforms.”
 






Musk has not commented on the controversy, but posted: “Never a dull moment on this platform.”
Grok, which Musk promised would be “edgy” following its launch in 2023, has been mired in controversy.
In May, it caused a row for generating misleading and unsolicited posts referencing “white genocide” in South Africa, which xAI blamed on an “unauthorised modification”.
Turkiye blocks Grok content for alleged insults to Erdogan, religious values
Separately, a Turkish court on Wednesday blocked access to some content from Grok after authorities said the chatbot generated responses insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, modern Turkiye’s founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and religious values.
Ankara chief prosecutor’s office said it launched an investigation, and marked Turkiye’s first such ban on content from an AI tool.
Authorities cited violations of laws that make such insults a criminal offence punishable by up to four years in prison.
Neither X, nor its owner Elon Musk could immediately be reached for comment. They have not referred to the decision on the platform.
 
 

Last month, Musk promised an upgrade to Grok, suggesting there was “far too much garbage in any foundation model trained on uncorrected data”.
Grok, which is integrated into X, reportedly generated offensive content about Erdogan and Ataturk when asked certain questions in Turkish, media said.
The Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK) adopted the ban after the court order.
Transport and Infrastructure Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu was later cited by broadcaster NTV as saying that Turkiye had not yet imposed a total access ban on Grok but that it would do so if necessary, adding Turkish authorities would discuss the issue with X.
Yaman Akdeniz, a cyber law expert at Istanbul Bilgi University, said authorities had identified some 50 posts by Grok as the basis for the investigation, ruling on the access ban and removal of certain content to “protect public order”.
“Turkiye has become the first country to impose censorship on Grok,” he said on X.
 






Turkiye has in recent years significantly increased oversight on social media platforms and online streaming services, passing laws to give authorities more control over content, detaining or arresting individuals for posts, launching probes into companies and limiting or blocking access to certain sites.
Critics say the law is frequently used to stifle dissent, while the government maintains it is necessary to protect the dignity of the office.</p><small>2025-07-10 02:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613266-pakistani-delegation-visits-uae-to-fast-track-public-service-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani delegation visits UAE to fast-track public service reforms</strong></a><br><p>

The statement comes amid tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries in the wake of their recent military confrontation, sparked by New Delhi’s baseless allegations against Islamabad over the Pahalgam attack.
In an interview with The Wire’s Thapar, the PPP chief said that had Pakistan been involved in the attack, evidence would have surfaced and the perpetrators identified.
This is the first interview given by a Pakistani representative to Indian media since the military escalation.
“As far as the Pahalgam terrorist attack is concerned, Pakistan has been willing to be part of an impartial international investigation; your government refused that,” Bilawal said.
Notably, Bilawal led a delegation to present Pakistan’s case across the globe in the wake of the confrontation.
“To this day, the Indian government has not shared with Pakistan, with the international community, with the Indian public … who exactly are these individuals that were involved in this terrorist attack that are from Pakistan?”
When pressed on the issue, Bilawal said that if Pakistan was truly involved, the international community would endorse India’s perspective.
“It’s very uncomfortable for you that I point out the truth to the Indian public, that they have been lied to … that Pakistan was involved in this attack when we were not,” he asserted.
 


“The government has been unable to provide the evidence. That’s why during this war, the Indian media and the Indian government launched a campaign of disinformation to continue to bamboozle the people of India,” he added.
Last Friday, Bilal had told Al Jazeera that Pakistan had no objection to extraditing “individuals of concern” — namely Laskhar-i-Taiba (LeT) chief Hafiz Saeed and Jaish-i-Muhammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar — to India as a confidence-building measure, as long as New Delhi showed willingness to cooperate in the process.
When Thapar asked about Saeed and the 2008 Mumbai attacks, Bilawal highlighted that the LeT chief was in prison and that the Mumbai attack case was still ongoing.
The attacks of November 26, 2008, targeting the symbols of India’s economic capital, including luxury hotels, left 166 people dead and more than 300 injured.
“As far as Hafiz Saeed is concerned, the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba, he was sentenced to 31 years in prison for terrorist financing in April 2022 by Pakistan,” Bilawal said.
“As far as the Mumbai attack case is concerned, it’s absolutely true that the case is still sub judice. The frustration that the courts and the Pakistani government and legal system are having with achieving a conviction is that India is refusing to participate in the trial and produce the witnesses necessary to record their statements.”
Continuing his answer, Bilawal said, “I appeal to you that we need to work towards a place where Pakistan and India have that sort of relationship again, where we have that sort of cooperation, that we can deliver justice to the people of Mumbai.”</p><small>2025-07-09 19:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/100012139d4ab0e.jpg?r=001220' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923089/govt-hints-at-denying-entry-to-pti-founders-sons-if-they-come-to-spread-discord' target='_blank'><strong>Govt hints at denying entry to PTI founder’s sons if they come to ‘spread discord’</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik on Wednesday warned that the government could deny entry to the sons of PTI founder Imran Khan if they travelled to Pakistan and “spread discord”.
Imran’s sons — Suleman Khan (28) and Qasim Khan (26) — had called attention to their father’s incarceration in a rare public appearance in May. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests. It was the first time the two had publicly talked about their father’s incarceration.
On Monday, Qasim uploaded a post on X calling for his father’s release, saying that the PTI founder had been imprisoned for 700 days and cut off from his family and even his personal physician.
 






Imran’s sister Aleema Khan told reporters a day ago outside Adiala Jail that the two would join an upcoming PTI protest movement. She claimed that the sons would go to the United States to present their father’s case before coming to Pakistan to join the movement.
Addressing the matter on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, Malik said the government had no issue with Qasim and Suleiman entering Pakistan, provided they do not engage in protests or political activity.
Malik noted that, being British nationals, Qasim and Suleiman could not legally participate in Pakistani political activity. He alleged that the boys are “coming to spread discord and there is no permission for this”.
“If they intend to get a visa to visit Pakistan, the concerned authorities in the interior ministry will look at their purpose of visit … But their aunt (Aleema) said … that they are coming to join the PTI movement,” the minister asserted.
“We have no issue with them coming here, but we have an issue with them participating in political activity as foreign nationals.”
He further said: “I do not believe that they will actually come here … If they had any family values, they would have come to see their father earlier.”
Malik said the PTI needed to “perform a political stunt” and the party, Aleema and Imran were “using these boys as trump cards”. “This is their last option,” he added.
 


On a different note, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said while talking to reporters earlier today: “His children should come and get to know what their father has done with the country. It is a very good thing but they won’t come.”
However, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah stated in an interview on the ARY News show ‘Khabar’ a day ago that the sons could face arrest.
“Their coming here [will achieve nothing] except difficulties for them and then the UK Embassy will have to get them released and take them back.”
Questioned if he meant they could be arrested upon participation in the PTI protest, Sanaullah said: “Why won’t they be arrested? If they come here to lead a violent movement, then what will be the consequence of that?”
 


Asked about his supposing the movement to be violent, he said the PTI could no longer be trusted after the events of its past protests.</p><small>2025-07-09 19:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/092324007d385a8.jpg?r=235018' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923093/veteran-journalist-zubeida-mustafa-passes-away-in-karachi-at-84-family' target='_blank'><strong>Veteran journalist Zubeida Mustafa passes away in Karachi at 84: family</strong></a><br><p>Veteran journalist Zubeida Mustafa passed away on Wednesday in Karachi at 84, her family confirmed.
She was born in India in 1941 and moved to Pakistan at a young age. She earned her undergraduate degree and graduate degree in international relations from the University of Karachi and began her career as a research officer at the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs in the 1960s.
She worked as an assistant editor at Dawn, where her career spanned 1975-2008. She was the first female journalist from Pakistan to receive an International Women’s Media Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award in May 2012.
A statement issued by the Karachi Press Club hailed her as a “true icon and veteran of Pakistani journalism” who left behind a legacy “that will continue to inspire generations of journalists”.
“Zubeida Mustafa was not just a journalist; she was an institution. Her unwavering commitment to truth, her incisive analysis, and her relentless pursuit of social justice set a benchmark for ethical reporting. She was a pioneer, breaking barriers and paving the way for women in a field often dominated by men.
“Her work on social issues, education, and health was particularly impactful, demonstrating her deep empathy and dedication to improving the lives of ordinary citizens. The Karachi Press Club extends its heartfelt condolences to her family, friends and colleagues during this difficult time. Her absence will be deeply felt, but her contributions to journalism and society will never be forgotten. May her soul rest in eternal peace,” the press club said.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said it mourned the passing of a veteran journalist, columnist and editor who “championed social, cultural and language rights like few.
“She was a comrade-in-arms and stood by the disadvantaged and the oppressed. May her family and friends find strength to bear this irreparable loss.”
 






Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also expressed deep sorrow over the death and hailed her as an “excellent journalist” whose services would always be remembered.</p><small>2025-07-09 19:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613254-zubeida-mustafa-trailblazing-journalist-and-rights-advocate-passes-away-at-84' target='_blank'><strong>Zubeida Mustafa, trailblazing journalist and rights advocate, passes away at 84</strong></a><br><p>

The Elon Musk-led firm has been waiting since 2022 for licences to operate commercially in India. Last month, it received a key licence from India’s telecom ministry to launch, but has been waiting for a go-ahead from India’s space regulator.
Starlink’s licence is valid for five years, the country’s space regulator Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) said.
Reuters reported earlier in the day, citing sources, that Starlink had secured the licence from IN-SPACe.
 
 

Starlink would be the third company to receive India’s nod to enter the space, with India previously approving applications by Eutelsat’s OneWeb and Reliance Jio to provide services in the country.
Starlink will now need to secure spectrum from the government, set up ground infrastructure and also demonstrate through testing and trials that it meets the security rules it has signed up for.
Musk and billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio clashed for months over how India should grant spectrum for satellite services. India’s government sided with Musk that the spectrum should be assigned and not auctioned.
Starlink is also similarly engaged with Pakistan. In April, Federal Minister for Information Technology (IT) and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja had announced that Starlink services were expected to be operational by November or December this year in the country.</p><small>2025-07-09 17:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09215420be4dee5.jpg?r=222902' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923087/fears-grow-that-death-toll-from-floods-in-us-state-of-texas-could-surge-beyond-110' target='_blank'><strong>Fears grow that death toll from floods in US state of Texas could surge beyond 110</strong></a><br><p>Fears grew on Wednesday that the death toll of 110 in the floods in the US state of Texas could still surge as hopes fade of finding survivors among the many reported still missing several days after the disaster.
More than 170 people remain unaccounted for after the flash flooding on the Fourth of July holiday, a tragedy that shocked many Americans.
After torrents of river water roared through several Texas counties — some striking in the middle of the night — rescuers still worked to find bodies and any survivors as state Governor Greg Abbott warned that the final toll was not yet known.
Officials in Kerr County, the epicentre of the flooding, on Wednesday confirmed 161 people were known to be missing in the county. Twelve others remain unaccounted for elsewhere in the state.
“There very likely could be more added to that list,” Abbott said on Tuesday, later posting on X: “Right now, our [first] job is to find every single missing person.”
 






Kerr County, part of a Hill Country region in central Texas known as “Flash Flood Alley”, suffered the most damage, with at least 95 fatalities, including 36 children, Sheriff Larry Leitha told reporters.
Among them are at least 27 girls and counsellors at a summer camp on the Guadalupe River when it burst its banks early on Friday.
Five campers and one counsellor from Camp Mystic were still missing as of Wednesday, plus another child not associated with the camp, Leitha said.
Elsewhere in the state, there have been at least 15 fatalities, according to Abbott.
More than 2,000 rescue personnel, police and experts have descended on the flood zone in what Leitha described as an “all hands on deck” operation.
Ben Baker, with the Texas Game Wardens, said search and rescue efforts involving helicopters, drones and dogs were difficult because of the water, mud and debris.
“When we’re trying to make these recoveries, these large piles can be very obstructive, and to get in deep into these piles, it’s very hazardous,” Baker said.
Kerrville police officer Jonathan Lamb spoke of heroic rescues by authorities and volunteers who evacuated hundreds of people from their homes or vehicles.
 
 

Officers went “door to door, waking people up” in Kerr County early on Friday and in some cases “pulling them out of windows” of flooding homes and trailers, Lamb told reporters.
The tragedy, “as horrific as it is, could have been so much worse”, he added.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has forecast scattered storms on Wednesday in the Hill Country, including isolated pockets of heavy rain.
In the neighbouring state of New Mexico, flash flooding left three people dead on Tuesday in Ruidoso, the village website said in a statement, adding the Ruidoso River rose to a record-breaking 20 feet (six metres).
Bodies in the mud
In the Texas town of Hunt, an AFP team saw recovery workers combing through piles of debris with helicopters flying overhead.
Javier Torres, 24, was digging through mud as he searched for his grandmother, after having located the body of his grandfather.
He also discovered the bodies of two children, apparently washed up by the river.
President Donald Trump is due to visit Texas on Friday with First Lady Melania Trump.
“We brought in a lot of helicopters from all over … They were real pros, and they were responsible for pulling out a lot of people,” Trump said.
Meanwhile, questions intensified over whether Trump’s government funding cuts had weakened warning systems, and over the handling of the rescue operation.
During sometimes tense news conferences on Tuesday and Wednesday, officials skirted questions on the speed of the emergency response.
“There’s going to be an after-action” review of what happened, Sheriff Leitha said, adding, “those questions need to be answered”.
But officials stressed that the focus now was on locating the missing and reuniting families.
Shel Winkley, a weather expert at the Climate Central research group, blamed the extent of the disaster on geography and exceptional drought, when dry soil absorbs less rainfall.
“This part of Texas, at least in the Kerr County flood specifically, was in an extreme to exceptional drought … We know that since May, temperatures have been above average,” Winkley told reporters.</p><small>2025-07-09 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/092117413bd525e.jpg?r=212113' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923083/us-subpoenas-harvard-for-records-of-foreign-student-protesters' target='_blank'><strong>US subpoenas Harvard for records of foreign student protesters</strong></a><br><p>The United States government said on Wednesday that it subpoenaed Harvard University for records linked to students allegedly involved in a wave of pro-Palestinian student protests that the Trump administration labelled anti-Semitic.
Since being sworn in again in January, President Donald Trump has targeted top US universities over claims they are politically biased towards anti-Jewish hate and “woke” politics.
Trump has waged a political and economic campaign against Harvard, stripping it of funds and demanding extensive records linked to foreign students, whom it has repeatedly attempted to block the prestigious university from enrolling and hosting.
“After many previous requests to hand over relevant information concerning foreign students, DHS will now send subpoenas forcing Harvard to comply,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement.
Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “Harvard, like other universities, has allowed foreign students to abuse their visa privileges and advocate for violence and terrorism on campus.”
The subpoena demands that Harvard turn over “relevant records, communications, and other documents relevant to the enforcement of immigration laws since January 1, 2020”, according to the statement.
Harvard did not respond to a request for comment.
Harvard, like several other universities, was swept by a wave of student protests against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. Trump has made the question of student protests, particularly by foreign scholars, a flashpoint political issue.
A proclamation issued by the White House last month sought to bar most new international students at Harvard from entering the country, and said existing foreign enrollees risked having their visas terminated. Harvard challenged the move in court and a judge blocked the administration from enforcing the policy.
International students at Harvard, who accounted for 27 per cent of total enrollment in the 2024-2025 academic year, are a major source of income for the Ivy League institution.
The government has already cut around $3.2 billion of federal grants and contracts benefiting Harvard and pledged to exclude the Cambridge, Massachusetts, institution from any future federal funding.
Harvard has been at the forefront of Trump’s campaign against top universities after it defied his calls to submit to oversight of its curriculum, staffing, student recruitment and “viewpoint diversity”.
Unlike Harvard, several top institutions — including New York’s Columbia University — have already bowed to far-reaching demands from the Trump administration.</p><small>2025-07-09 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613239-british-pakistani-entrepreneur-honoured-at-uk-parliament-for-pakistan-investments' target='_blank'><strong>British-Pakistani entrepreneur honoured at UK Parliament for Pakistan investments</strong></a><br><p>

According to a notification issued by Nepra today, the authority “decided to allow a negative FCA of 4.0349/kWh for April 2025, to be passed on to the consumers in the billing month of July 2025”.
Nepra said the negative FCA would apply to “all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, domestic protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and prepaid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff”.
The adjustment would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in the respective month to which the adjustment pertains, it said.
“In case any bills of July 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” the notification said.
It also said that KE shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of April in the billing month of July.
The notification said that the negative FCA of Rs.4.0349/kWh was being allowed on a “provisional basis subject to adjustment” once Nepra determined KE’s Multi-Year Tariff for FY2024-30. “The difference in cost, if any, based on the MYT FY 2024-30 would be allowed in future adjustments once the same is notified,” it added.
Separately, Nepra also notified a Rs0.49 per unit negative FCA following an adjustment on account of variation in fuel charges for May in the approved tariff of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos).
According to a separate notification issued today, the authority “has reviewed and assessed a National Average Uniform decrease of Rs.0.4952/kWh in the applicable tariff for Discos on account of variations in the fuel charges for May”.
The notification said that the FCA should apply to all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, EVCS and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for prepaid tariffs.
“Discos shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of May 2025 in the billing month of July 2025,” the notification said, adding that it would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills based on units utilised in May.
“In case any bills of July 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” it added.</p><small>2025-07-09 16:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09195207073ca35.jpg?r=205345' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923078/russia-launches-largest-drone-strike-of-war-with-ukraine-after-trump-vows-to-send-more-weapons' target='_blank'><strong>Russia launches largest drone strike of war with Ukraine after Trump vows to send more weapons</strong></a><br><p>Russia targeted Ukraine with a record 728 drones overnight, shortly after US President Donald Trump pledged to send more defensive weapons to Kyiv and aimed unusually direct criticism at Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Ukrainian air defence units destroyed almost all the drones, including through electronic jamming systems, Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging app.
The attack, which follows a series of escalating air assaults on Ukraine in recent weeks, showed the need for “biting” sanctions on the sources of income Russia uses to finance the war, including on those who buy Russian oil, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Telegram.
Trump said on Tuesday he was considering supporting a bill in the Senate that would impose steep sanctions on Russia, including 500 per cent tariffs on nations that buy Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports.
“We get a lot of ‘b******t’ thrown at us by Putin … He’s very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless,” Trump said at a cabinet meeting.
When asked by a reporter what action he would take against Putin, Trump said: “I wouldn’t tell you. We want to have a little surprise.” Separately, Europe is working on a new sanctions package against Moscow.
 


Trump, who returned to power this year promising a swift end to the war in Ukraine, has shifted US rhetoric away from staunch support for Kyiv towards accepting some of Moscow’s justifications for its full-scale invasion.
But initial rounds of talks between Russia and Ukraine have so far borne little fruit, with Moscow yet to accept an unconditional ceasefire proposed by Trump and accepted by Kyiv.
The US president’s promise to supply more defensive weapons reversed a Pentagon decision days earlier to stall some critical munitions supplies to Ukraine, despite rising Russian attacks that spread fear in Kyiv.
Following Trump’s new promise, Zelensky said on Tuesday he had ordered an expansion of contacts with the United States to ensure critical deliveries of military supplies, primarily air defence.
Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, is due in Rome later on Wednesday to attend a July 10-11 international aid conference on Ukraine, attended by Zelensky and Kyiv’s European allies.
ECHR finds Russia responsible for ‘rights abuses’, downing of MH17
Europe’s top human rights court ruled unanimously on Wednesday that Russia was responsible for the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in 2014 and also that Moscow had repeatedly and systematically violated human rights in Ukraine.
The Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said Russia had performed indiscriminate military attacks, summary executions of civilians, torture including the use of rape as a weapon of war, unjustified displacement and transfer of civilians and other violations.
Ahead of Wednesday’s ruling, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would not abide by any court decisions, saying: “We consider them null and void.”

The ECHR is an international court of the Council of Europe, also based in Strasbourg, from which Russia was expelled in 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s parliament then voted in 2023 to end the ECHR’s jurisdiction in the country.
In its ruling, the ECHR said: “Taken as a whole, the vast volume of evidence before the court presented a picture of interconnected practices of manifestly unlawful conduct by agents of the Russian State (Russian armed forces and other authorities, occupying administrations, and separatist armed groups and entities) on a massive scale across Ukraine.”
The ruling concerned four consolidated cases, one of which involved Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, which departed Amsterdam for Kuala Lumpur in July 2014 and was shot down over eastern Ukraine amid fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists. All 298 people on board the plane died.
Moscow denies any responsibility for MH17’s downing and in 2014 denied any presence in Ukraine.

‘Suffering and grief’
The ECHR ruled that Russia had failed to conduct an adequate investigation into the incident, to cooperate with requests for information or provide legal remedies for survivors. Its lack of cooperation and continued denial of any involvement has caused additional suffering for the victims’ relatives, the court said.
Responding to the ruling, Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said: “Nothing can take away this suffering and grief, but I hope the verdict offers a sense of justice and recognition.” A majority of those on the airliner were Dutch.
The other three cases covered by Wednesday’s ruling were brought by Ukraine, over pro-Russian separatists accused of abducting groups of Ukrainian children and transferring them to Russia, and over alleged patterns of human rights violations during Russia’s war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year.
Ukraine’s Justice Ministry, in a statement on the Telegram messaging app, hailed the ECHR ruling as “one of the most important in the practice of interstate cases”.
The court is expected to rule in due course on possible damages and compensation but it has no way of enforcing its rulings, especially on a country that no longer recognises its jurisdiction, meaning Wednesday’s verdict is mainly symbolic.</p><small>2025-07-09 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0918480773594ae.jpg?r=185007' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923067/hrcp-expresses-concern-as-govt-warns-criminal-action-against-27-youtube-channels-set-for-blocking' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP expresses concern as govt warns criminal action against 27 YouTube channels set for blocking</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Wednesday expressed concern over the recent court decision banning 27 YouTube channels as the government said the owners were expected to face criminal action.
It emerged a day ago that an Islamabad court last month ordered YouTube to block 27 channels for disseminating “fake, misleading, and defamatory” content against the government and armed forces.
Among the 27 sanctioned accounts — run by journalists, political commentators and social media in­­fluencers in Pakistan and overseas — are those of the PTI, Matiuallah Jan, Wajahat Khan, Ahmad Noorani and Asad Ali Toor, Imran Riaz, Orya Maqbool, Sabir Shakir, and Moeed Pirzada.
In a statement on X, HRCP said that it was “greatly concerned” by the court’s directive.
“The wholesale blocking of entire channels — rather than addressing specific instances of unlawful or hateful speech in accordance with due process — conflates dissent with criminal activity,” the statement said.
“The constitutional right to freedom of expression is fundamental not only for individual liberty but also for ensuring government accountability, fostering debate and enabling the public to access a diversity of viewpoints,” the HRCP said, urging “precise and proportionate” interventions against hate speech.
 






Separately, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that these channels would also face criminal action.
Speaking to the media earlier today, he said, “The whole world, including Pakistan, has laws regulating cybercrime and cybersecurity. Those laws must be followed.” He added, “You cannot use [your] mobile and social media to spread anarchy.”
YouTube told the 27 content creators that their channels could be taken down if they did not comply with the court orders.
“If you fail to do so, as per our local law obligations, we may comply with the request without further notice,” the popular video sharing platform said in emails this week to the channel owners, according to a notice seen by Reuters.
Toor, who has more than 333,000 YouTube subscribers, said the move was aimed at undermining fundamental and constitutional rights of the people, political parties and other dissident groups.
“It is not about me. It is about these people who are on the left side of the state,” he told Reuters.
“I have dedicated my platform for these underdogs who have no place to go to and raise their voices against state oppression.”
 
 

YouTube’s regional communications manager did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for a comment. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Digital rights campaigners say that any ban would further undermine free speech in the country and accuse the authorities of stifling newspapers and television, with social media seen as one of the few outlets for dissent.
Digital rights activist Usama Khilji said the court did not fulfil due process.
“What is jarring is the complete lack of legal process,” he said.
Toor said neither the court nor the cybercrime agency gave him a chance to respond to the allegations, and that he would be taking legal action against the court order.
“It is a dictatorial move. It can’t silence me,” he said
On March 20, Farhan Mallick, the founder of media agency Raftar and a former news director at Samaa TV, was arrested in Karachi and booked under Peca as well as the Pakistan Penal Code in a case related to alleged anti-state content on his YouTube channel.
The arrest was met with widespread criticism from media bodies as well as rights activists.
He was granted bail in April in the many cases against him pertaining to allegedly “anti-state” content and data theft through a call centre.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority lifted the ban on X in May after the platform was inaccessible to users for more than a year.
The social media platform was blocked in February 2024, around 10 days after the general elections, while the caretaker government was still in power.
In April 2024, the interior ministry told the Islamabad High Court that X didn’t adhere to the government’s directives to stop the “misuse of its platform”. The ban was imposed “in the interest of upholding national security, maintaining public order, and preserving the integrity of our nation”.
Migration to YouTube
After the government clamped down on traditional media, many independent-minded reporters migrated to YouTube, as did journalists and commentators sympathetic to former prime minister Imran Khan, who was removed from office in 2022.
“It’s not only about anchors getting fired or YouTube channels getting banned. It’s what they are not allowing to be told and the human rights abuse they are trying to hide from the world,” said PTI leader Zulfikar Bukhari.
“In this day and age you can’t suppress digital media,” he added.
The order is the latest in a series of laws and regulations from the government that have enabled the authorities to crack down on critics and dissidents. It has blocked social media platforms X, Facebook and TikTok on several occasions.
In January, parliament introduced a new amendment in the Electronic Crimes Act to further regulate cyber content, which included a new social media regulatory authority with its own investigation agency and tribunals.
Such tribunals will be able to try and punish alleged offenders with prison sentences of as long as three years and fines of two million rupees for dissemination of information deemed “false or fake”.</p><small>2025-07-09 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613219-pakistan-never-backs-terrorists-bilawal-tells-indias-karan-thapar-clearly' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan never backs terrorists, Bilawal tells India's Karan Thapar clearly</strong></a><br><p>

In his letter to the Nobel Committee, which he shared online, Netanyahu said Trump had “demonstrated steadfast and exceptional dedication to promoting peace, security and stability around the world”.
Trump, who is trying to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, has been nominated before. Pakistan said in June it would recommend Trump for the prize for his work in helping to resolve the conflict with India.
Netanyahu’s nomination of Trump has generated scepticism in some quarters, including from former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt, who said on X that Netanyahu was seeking to flatter Trump.
 






If Trump won the prize, he would be the fifth US president to do so, after Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama.
Here is a look at how the award works:
Who is eligible to win?
According to the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, the prize should go to the person “who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses”.
All living persons or active institutions are eligible.
In an introduction on the Nobel website, Chair of the Peace Prize Committee Jorgen Watne Frydnes says, “In practice, anyone can be the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. The history of the prize shows clearly it’s given to people from all layers of society from all over the world.”
The Nobel Prizes are announced in October each year, but nominations close the previous January, meaning Netanyahu’s nomination of Trump could not be considered this year.
Who can nominate?
Thousands of people can propose names: members of governments and parliaments; current heads of state; university professors of history, social sciences, law, and philosophy; and former Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others. You cannot nominate yourself.
Nominee lists are kept secret for 50 years, though there is nothing to stop those who make nominations from disclosing their choices.
Who decides the winner?
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which consists of five individuals appointed by the Norwegian parliament, is the arbiter. Members are often retired politicians, but not always. The current committee is led by the head of the Norwegian branch of PEN International, a group defending freedom of expression.
They are all put forward by Norwegian political parties and their appointments reflect the balance of power in Norway’s parliament.
How does the committee decide the winner?
The first meeting of the committee takes place in February of each year, when committee members can make their own nominations to add to the list.
Last year, there were 286 nominees, and in 2025, there are 338 candidates nominated for the prize — 244 individuals and 94 organisations.
The committee whittles the nominations down to make a shortlist, and each nominee is then assessed by a group of permanent advisers and other experts.
The committee aims for unanimity but can decide by majority vote. A final decision is often only made a few days before the prize is announced.
Controversies
The Nobel Peace Prize has often been seen as having a political message. The Nobel website says some recipients have been “highly controversial political actors”, while the prize has also increased public focus on international or national conflicts.
Obama won the award just a few months after taking office. Two members of the committee stepped down over the decision in 1973 to award the Peace Prize to US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Vietnamese politician Le Duc Tho for negotiating an end to the Vietnam War.
One member quit in 1994 when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shared the prize with Israel’s Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin.
What does the Laureate get?
A medal, a diploma, 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.15m) and immediate global attention, if they are not already famous.
When are the announcement and the ceremony?
The announcement of this year’s prize will be made on October 10 at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo.
The ceremony will take place at the Oslo City Hall on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death.</p><small>2025-07-09 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09183814f1aee65.jpg?r=191347' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923071/bangladesh-recordings-suggest-ex-pm-hasina-ordered-deadly-crackdown' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh recordings suggest ex-PM Hasina ordered deadly crackdown</strong></a><br><p>Audio recordings analysed by the BBC suggest Bangladesh’s fugitive ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina ordered a deadly crackdown on protests last year, allegations for which she is on trial.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024, according to the United Nations, when Hasina’s government ordered a crackdown on protesters in a failed bid to cling to power.
Hasina, 77, fled to India at the culmination of the student-led uprising and has defied orders to return to Dhaka, where her trial in absentia for charges amounting to crimes against humanity opened on June 1.
The BBC Eye Investigations team analysed audio alleged to be of Hasina — and which forms a key plank of the evidence for the prosecution — which was leaked online.
In the recording, dated July 18, 2024, a voice alleged to be Hasina is heard authorising security forces to “use lethal weapons” against protesters and that “wherever they find [them], they will shoot”.
The BBC said audio forensics experts had found no evidence that the speech had been edited or manipulated, and that it was “highly unlikely to have been synthetically generated”.
Bangladesh police have also matched the audio with verified recordings of Hasina.
‘Denies the charges’
Protests began on July 1, 2024, with university students calling for reforms to a quota system for public sector jobs.
Student ambitions to topple Hasina’s iron-fisted rule seemed a fantasy, just months after she won her fourth consecutive election in a vote without genuine opposition.
But protests gathered pace and a fuse was lit when police launched a deadly crackdown on July 16.
Hasina’s state-appointed lawyer — who says they have not been in contact with her — has sought to throw out the charges.
Her now-banned Awami League party said it “categorically denies the charges that its senior leaders, and the prime minister personally, directed the use of lethal force against crowds during the protests of last summer”.
It instead said that “breakdowns in discipline among some members of the security forces on the ground in response to instances of violence led to (a) regrettable loss of life”.
Hasina was already convicted of contempt of court in a separate case on July 2, receiving a six-month sentence. She remains in India.</p><small>2025-07-09 15:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091819057eaa6b9.jpg?r=181939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923069/pm-pleased-as-remittances-rise-by-266pc-to-hit-record-383bn-in-fy25' target='_blank'><strong>PM pleased as remittances rise by 26.6pc to hit record $38.3bn in FY25</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his satisfaction on Wednesday as data showed that workers’ remittances increased by 26.6 per cent to hit a record $38.3 billion during the fiscal year 2025 as compared to the corresponding period of last year.
The State Bank of Pakistan said remittances reached $38.3bn during July-June 2024-25, as compared to the $30.3bn in remittances received during the same period for FY2023-24.
Similarly, on a year-by-year basis, the workers’ remittances went up by 7.9pc to $3.406bn in June 2025, compared to $3.158bn during the same month last year.
 






Data showed that Saudi Arabia ($823.2m) and the United Arab Emirates ($717.2m) were the biggest sources of remittance inflows during June 2025, followed by the United Kingdom ($537.6m) and the United States ($281.2m).
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said the premier was pleased at the development, saying that the government was committed to economic prosperity after bringing economic stability, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“The record surge in remittances reflects expatriate Pakistanis’ valuable contributions and their confidence in the national economy,” he added.
He expressed the opinion that the recent positive economic indicators were a “manifestation of the government’s policies in the right direction”.
Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad termed the record remittances “massive” in a post on X and added that the feat “reflects growing trust of overseas Pakistanis in the economy and policy measures”.
 






A study published by the Asian Development Bank last year found that Pakistani migrants tend to remit more when economic conditions are improving back home, and when there is a positive association between remittances and domestic economic activity.</p><small>2025-07-09 13:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09174137949f0c2.jpg?r=184046' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923062/toll-of-air-india-disaster-rests-at-260-as-focus-turns-to-crash-report' target='_blank'><strong>Toll of Air India disaster rests at 260 as focus turns to crash report</strong></a><br><p>Indian forensic investigators have identified all 260 people killed in last month’s crash of a London-bound passenger plane, health authorities said on Wednesday, ahead of a hugely anticipated preliminary report into what went wrong.
India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is leading the probe into one of the deadliest air disasters in decades, with an initial report expected on Friday.
All but one of the 242 people aboard the Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner were killed when it crashed on June 12.
It ploughed into housing just after takeoff in the western city of Ahmedabad, and authorities have also identified 19 people killed on the ground.
No details have been released about the probe, in which British and US air accident investigation agencies have also taken part.
But specialist website The Air Current, citing multiple sources familiar with the investigation, reported it had “narrowed its focus to the movement of the engine fuel switches”, while noting that full analysis will “take months — if not longer”.
 
 

It added that “the focus of the investigators could change during that time”.
But “at this point in the inquiry, the data available to investigators does not indicate a mechanical or design issue” with the 787 plane, or its engines.
The site said its sources “indicated that post-accident analysis showed no sign of fuel contamination or improper retraction of the aircraft’s flaps”, over which there had been speculation.
Matched all DNA
Health officials in the Indian state of Gujarat initially said at least 279 people were killed, but forensic scientists reduced the figure after multiple scattered and badly burnt remains were identified.
“The final death toll in the plane crash now stands at 260,” Rakesh Joshi, head of Ahmedabad’s main state hospital, told AFP today.
“All the human remains found so far from the crash site have been identified and handed over to their families,” Joshi added.
“Our work is now over,” he added. “We have matched DNA of all the mortal remains that were collected from the crash site.”
The UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) stipulates that states heading an investigation must submit a preliminary report within 30 days of an accident. That report, however, does not have to be made public.
According to the ICAO, preliminary reports “may be marked as confidential or remain public at the investigating state’s discretion”.
Joshi said it was doubtful any further remains would be found in the wreckage. “The possibility is almost negligible, I believe,” he said.
On Tuesday, health authorities handed over the remains of 26 victims to their relatives, or, for families who had already received parts of their dead kin’s bodies and held funerals, carried out ceremonies for them.
“Seven families collected the remains of their kin … while 19 families gave consent to the hospital to carry out the rites,” Joshi said.
There were 230 passengers — 169 Indians, 53 British, seven Portuguese and a Canadian — along with 12 crew members.
Dozens of people were injured, with two remaining in the hospital.
Only one passenger miraculously survived, a British citizen who was seen walking out of the wreckage of the crash, and who has since been discharged from the hospital.</p><small>2025-07-09 13:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/09180939f76d8f6.jpg?r=182223' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923068/red-bull-sacks-christian-horner-after-20-years-as-f1-team-boss' target='_blank'><strong>Red Bull sacks Christian Horner after 20 years as F1 team boss</strong></a><br><p>Christian Horner was sacked on Wednesday by Red Bull after 20 years as team principal of the Formula One outfit.
The 51-year-old has been in charge since the team was formed in 2005 and has led them to eight drivers’ titles and six constructors’ crowns.
Dutchman Max Verstappen has won the past four drivers’ titles for Red Bull, matching the achievement of Sebastian Vettel, who dominated for the team from 2010 to 2013.
Horner’s dismissal as CEO and team principal comes 17 months after he was accused by a female colleague of “inappropriate behaviour”.
The Englishman was twice cleared over the claims by the Formula One team’s parent company, Red Bull GmbH, and his wife, former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, stood by him.
But there have been rumblings of discontent within the team, with several high-profile departures, while form on the track has nose-dived.
“Red Bull has released Christian Horner from his operational duties with effect from today (Wednesday) and has appointed Laurent Mekies as CEO of Red Bull Racing,” said a statement from Red Bull GmbH.
Oliver Mintzlaff, CEO of corporate projects and investments, paid tribute to Horner, thanking him for his “exceptional work”.
“With his tireless commitment, experience, expertise and innovative thinking, he has been instrumental in establishing Red Bull Racing as one of the most successful and attractive teams in Formula 1,” he said.
“Thank you for everything, Christian, and you will forever remain an important part of our team history.”
‘Difficult to drive’
Horner’s departure comes amid speculation that Verstappen may be tempted to jump ship to Mercedes.
Although the 27-year-old Dutchman won the title last year, he only topped the podium twice in the final 14 races of the season.
Red Bull has won only two races this season, with McLaren taking their place as the team to beat. Verstappen is languishing 69 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri at the halfway point of the campaign and finished a disappointing fifth at Sunday’s British Grand Prix, having started on pole.
He showed frustration with his Red Bull during the race, saying: “This car is just so difficult to drive.”
Other key figures responsible for the team’s previous dominance have left since last year, including design guru Adrian Newey, who signed for Aston Martin, and sporting director Jonathan Wheatley, who joined Sauber.
Max Verstappen’s father, Jos, a former F1 driver, had expressed his dissatisfaction with Horner even after he was cleared of the charges of inappropriate behaviour. He warned the team was in danger of being “torn apart” if Horner remained.
Mekies, who has been promoted from Red Bull’s second team, Racing Bulls, has had a long career in Formula One, previously working as racing director for Ferrari.
“The last year and a half has been an absolute privilege to lead the team with Peter (Bayer),” the 48-year-old Frenchman said in a statement. “It has been an amazing adventure to contribute to the birth of Racing Bulls together with all our talented people.
“The spirit of the whole team is incredible, and I strongly believe that this is just the beginning.”</p><small>2025-07-09 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0918114861ccb85.jpg?r=181155' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923063/dg-ispr-brands-indian-nsa-ajit-doval-chief-architect-of-terrorism-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR brands Indian NSA Ajit Doval ‘chief architect’ of terrorism in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Wednesday accused Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval of being the “chief architect” of terrorism in Pakistan.
The interview comes amid tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries in the wake of their recent military confrontation, sparked by New Delhi’s baseless allegations against Islamabad over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
During an exclusive interview with Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera, the military’s spokesperson branded Doval the “evil chief architect of India’s terror enterprise” and accused him of being responsible for not only acts of terrorism in Pakistan, but also terrorism within the region and transnational killings.
“Do you think it’s happening on its own? This terror enterprise cannot be sustained without the sponsorship of India,” the DG ISPR said. “Who is the chief architect? Mr Ajit Doval.”
According to the ISPR chief, India provided funding, planning, intelligence and technical support to terrorist groups within Pakistan, such as Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan.
In July last year, the government designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
“The strategy of India is to keep Pakistan embroiled in this menace of terrorism, so that its true power … potential is not realised,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “The power differential between the two countries keeps increasing, so that India can act as a regional hegemon, a bully and can dictate its own terms.”
He added that this strategy of supporting terrorists in the region went as far back as 1971, when India supported the Mukti Bahini in East Pakistan.
“Indians have acknowledged it — PM [Narendra] Modi went on record not only acknowledging but boasting about it.”
 


The military’s spokesperson then added that terrorist commanders who had surrendered or been captured confessed that they received support from New Delhi, citing press conferences by captured Fitna-al-Hindustan commanders and the case of captured Indian Navy Officer Kulbhushan Jadhav.
“This evidence is all public. It is RAW,” he said, referring to India’s spy agency, Research and Analysis Wing.
“And not only are they using men, they are also exploiting the Baloch women for these nefarious purposes.”
‘A reckless and irresponsible state’
Lt Gen Chaudhry further said that Pakistan was “not a reckless and irresponsible state like India”, blaming external actors for internal issues.
“We must understand that terrorism is an internal problem of India as a result of the continuous oppression which India does to its minorities as part of its policy,” he said. “Rather than addressing these grave injustices, inequalities, and doing soul searching, it (India) is very quick to put all the blame on Pakistan.
“Because of this senseless blame game that the Indians are resorting to, it is bringing the thresholds between India and Pakistan to dangerously low levels, to such levels that where one incident of terrorism or an act of violence can be turned into an act of war.”
The ISPR chief warned that such an approach was putting the lives of over 1.6 billion people “in the hands of non-state actors” who had an interest in Pakistan and India going to war.
“We are an established and declared nuclear power, and the world has no experience of going to or even attempting to go into a misadventure against an established nuclear power,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.
“If such a misadventure is taken or attempted, then it will lead to horrific consequences which the world may not be able to endure.”</p><small>2025-07-09 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/091616034d61286.jpg?r=171951' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923012/pakistan-turkiye-to-establish-special-economic-zone-for-turkish-entrepreneurs-in-karachi-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Turkiye to establish special economic zone for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi: Dar</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday said Pakistan and Turkiye were pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for Turkish entrepreneurs in Karachi.
The announcement came after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan arrived in Islamabad earlier today on an official visit. Turkiye’s Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler is also visiting Pakistan.
Pakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect. In February, the two countries pledged to boost bilateral trade to $5 billion as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Islamabad.
“We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said, addressing a press conference alongside Fidan at the Foreign Office (FO).
 


Dar also mentioned other engagements, including the revival of the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad train, saying, “Our delegations are meeting in the coming weeks to finalise the roadmap for revival.”
The deputy PM further said that Pakistan has allocated land for the construction of a Maarif School in Muzaffarabad, referring to the Turkish Maarif Foundation, which Fidan said has more than 80 schools in Pakistan.
“A Maarif Foundation delegation is visiting Muzaffarabad today and visiting the site for evaluation,” he said.
Dar further stated that Turkish companies were being considered for undertaking the Jinnah Medical Complex and Daanish University megaprojects in Islamabad.
The Turkish companies will also be participating in offshore drilling projects and the privatisation of electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the power sector, he highlighted.
“We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar asserted.
He appreciated Turkiye’s indigenisation of the defence industry from 20 per cent to 80pc in the last few years, adding: “We would like to benefit from Turkiye’s experience and expertise.”
In his remarks, the Turkish foreign minister said defence cooperation will be further strengthened in the coming days, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Fidan called it a “strategic step”, emphasising that it was very important for the security of Pakistan and Turkiye. He asserted that both countries will continue to support each other in countering terrorism. Over a month ago, the two nations conducted a joint operation and arrested a high-ranking terrorist.
Referring to the recent Pakistan-India conflict, Fidan was “appreciative of Pakistan’s wisdom-oriented attitude”, Radio Pakistan stated.
He noted that Turkiye and Pakistan were intensifying their cooperation in the field of energy, including mining, precious stones, natural gas and oil. The minister also highlighted that the two nations have expanded their relations in other fields, such as the economy, education and culture.
Fidan reiterated the countries’ aim to increase their commercial relations to $5bn and expressed the firm resolve to take Pakistan-Turkiye relations to a higher level, Radio Pakistan added.
Following their meetings, Dar wrote on X: “Held productive discussions on the entire gamut of bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments.
’“Pakistan and Türkiye share deep-rooted bonds of brotherhood, mutual trust, and strategic cooperation,” the deputy PM stressed.
 






Air chief, Turkish defence minister agree to form joint working groups
Separately, a high-level delegation led by Guler called on Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) chief, at the Air Headquarters in Islamabad.
Both officials agreed on the establishment of “dedicated joint working groups to streamline and accelerate progress across various sectors of mutual interest”, according to a statement by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The meeting encompassed discussions on evolving regional security dynamics, progress of ongoing defence cooperation and prospects for future collaboration in emerging domains of warfare, ISPR said.
 


The Turkish defence minister expressed sincere gratitude to the air chief for the warm reception and gracious hospitality extended by the PAF.
He lauded PAF’s “exceptional performance under the insightful leadership of the air chief in the recent conflict with India, commending its operational preparedness and resolute defence of national sovereignty”, the ISPR said.
“Highlighting the longstanding fraternal ties between Turkiye and Pakistan, Yasar Guler conveyed Turkiye’s earnest desire to bolster bilateral defence relations through deeper industry-to-industry collaboration,” the ISPR highlighted.
Guler “particularly emphasised the need to explore joint ventures in cutting-edge domains, including niche disruptive technologies, advanced avionics and unmanned aerial systems”, the statement said.
The Turkish defence minister expressed his appreciation for PAF’s continued support in the pilot exchange programme, which he termed as a “vital initiative for fostering professional growth and operational understanding” between the two air forces.
During the meeting, the Air Chief Marshal Sidhu highlighted the enduring brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, emphasising the common aspirations and strategic convergence that bind the two nations.
 
 

He reaffirmed PAF’s “steadfast resolve to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in the domains of advanced training and aerospace technologies”, the military’s media wing said.
“Both dignitaries concurred on finalising the modalities for enhanced training collaboration and reaffirmed their strong commitment to expanding the scale and scope of joint bilateral and multilateral air exercises,” according to the ISPR.
The military’s media wing noted that the visit reflected the shared commitment of both nations to enhance strategic cooperation, solidify defence ties and promote “lasting institutional linkages” between the armed forces of Pakistan and Turkiye.
Dar, Fidan co-chair first meeting of joint commission
Meanwhile, Dar and Fidan co-chaired the first meeting of a joint commission established in February during President Erdogan’s visit, the FO said in a statement.
Dar expressed satisfaction with the progress of all 12 Joint Standing Committees (JSCs) working under the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC) framework, saying they have “either already met or are scheduled to meet in the coming weeks”.
 






Established in 2009, HLSCC is the highest decision-making forum bet­ween the two countries, guiding bilateral relations through joint standing committees covering trade, investment, defen­­ce, energy, agriculture, IT, health and education.
During the press briefing, Dar said that the JSC on security, defence and intelligence was scheduled to meet on July 24 in Islamabad, while the committee on transport and communication was expected to meet next week.
The trade and investment JSC met on June 20, Dar noted, adding that the committee on defence industries was scheduled to meet later in September.
“Similarly, other committees — health, science and technology; social sector development; culture and tourism; agriculture and water; energy and power; banking and finance; and the political and diplomatic coordination committee are expected to meet in the coming months,” he said.
The upcoming meeting of the Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC), co-chaired by Güler and Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan, is also expected to be held next week, FO said.
“This important platform is expected to further bolster economic cooperation between the two countries,” it highlighted.
The FO added that both sides exchanged views on a range of regional and global developments, and reaffirmed their commitment to regional peace.
Turkish ministers land in Pakistan
A day ago, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had announced that Fidan, along with Guler, will visit Pakistan on July 9. Fidan also paid a visit to Islamabad in May last year.
Fidan arrived in the early hours of Wednesday to hold discussions on bilateral issues, the Foreign Office said on X.
 






“During his official engagements in Pakistan, all important issues of mutual interest will be discussed,” the FO said. “The visit reflects the close and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, rooted in shared history, culture, and mutual trust.”
It added that upon their arrival, the visiting dignitaries were received by Pakistan’s Additional Secretary for West Asia, Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani.
 






On Tuesday, Pakistan had extended condolences to Turkiye after 12 Turkish soldiers died of methane exposure in Iraq during a search mission in the Claw-Lock Operation zone a day earlier.
Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met on the sidelines of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) summit in Khankendi, Azerbaijan, to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.
The two leaders discussed deepening cooperation in key areas, including trade, energy, defence, connectivity and investment. PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to working closely with Turkiye to promote peace, stability and sustainable development in the region.

The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered at Rawat Police Station a day ago on the complaint of Head Constable Shahbaz Anjum Kayani under Section 302 (Punishment of qatl-i-amd), and Section 311 (Waiver or compounding of qisas) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Under Section 311, the state becomes the complainant, as this provision is non-compoundable, and the case must proceed to a logical conclusion. The punishment for ‘honour’ killings, under Sections 311 and 302, includes the death sentence or life imprisonment. The option for a 25-year sentence under Section 302C is not applicable when Section 311 is invoked.
The FIR said the incident occurred at 11:30am a day ago in Dhok Chaudhrian, within the limits of the Rawat Police Station when Kayani received a tipoff from a source about the suspect asking his daughter to delete her TikTok account, but she refused. He added that the suspect was angered and shot his daughter in the name of ‘honour’, fleeing after the crime.
A statement from the police said they had arrested the victim’s father and recovered the murder weapon, a pistol, from his possession, adding that three teams were formed under the supervision of Saddar Superintendent of Police  Nabeel Khokhar for the task.
Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Mehmood Hamdani told Dawn.com that the “police registered the case as a complaint because the family of the deceased was portraying the incident as suicide. Later, police investigation revealed it was a murder. The police filed the case to avoid any compromise in future.
“Similar cases were registered earlier too, but when a family member becomes the complainant, they reach a compromise after six months or a year. Police registered the case as the complaintant to charge the suspect with solid evidence.”
The police further said that the postmortem analysis had been conducted, evidence was collected from the crime scene and investigations were ongoing from all angles.
 






“Crimes against women and children are intolerable; the accused will be prosecuted with solid evidence and ensured a just punishment,” the CPO said.
 






TikTok is wildly popular in Pakistan, in part because of its accessibility to a population with low literacy levels. On it, women have found both audience and income, rare in a country where fewer than a quarter of the women participate in the formal economy.
Last month, popular social media influencer, Sana Yousuf, was shot dead at her house in Islamabad by a man whose advances she had repeatedly rejected, police said.
Yousaf had racked up more than a million followers on social media. The incident sparked public outrage and widespread media coverage. The case remains under investigation.
Cases of honour killings are prevalent in Pakistan. From January to November last year, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to so-called ‘honour’. In 2023, the country saw a total of 490 ‘honour’ killing incidents taking place, while in 2022, as many as 590 people lost their lives to ‘honour’ killings.
In January, a man who had recently brought his family back to Pakistan from the United States confessed to shooting dead his teenage daughter, motivated by his disappr­oval of her TikTok content.
In December, Amina Bibi, a mother of three, was shot dead by her brother, Zafar Hussain, in the Qasimpur area of Pakpattan. Hussain told the police he thought his sister had a “questionable character”.
In November, a mother of five was brutally killed in Faisalabad by her husband and younger brother, allegedly to protect the family’s ‘honour’. Accused of having an affair, the victim was attacked at home with bricks, leading to fatal injuries. Her body was later dumped in a nullah through a donkey cart.
A man murdered four women in his family in October, including his mother, in a fit of rage over their TikTok videos. He told the police the videos spread “immodesty and shamelessness, tarnishing the family’s reputation”.</p><small>2025-07-09 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613188-pakistan-turkiye-pledge-to-boost-bilateral-trade-volume-to-5bn' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Turkiye pledge to boost bilateral trade volume to $5bn</strong></a><br><p>
