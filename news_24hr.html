Major parties opened their campaigns on Wednesday for the elections slated for February 2026, the first since a deadly uprising last year toppled the autocratic government of former ruler Sheikh Hasina.
Campaigning turned violent almost immediately.
The shooting took place at a rally on Wednesday for the powerful Bangladesh National Party (BNP) attended by hundreds in the port city of Chattogram, police said.
Senior BNP leader Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said, “It was an attempt to destabilise politics and disrupt the election”.
The BNP are widely seen as the frontrunner in the polls.
Police said the gunmen opened fire quickly on a crowd of hundreds at the rally but insisted that the BNP candidate was not the target.
“The miscreants… shot their target, and fled in a flash,” senior police officer Hasib Aziz told reporters late on Wednesday.
Candidate Ershad Ullah was shot and wounded, along with a supporter. A third man was killed.
“We would urge candidates to inform the police station at least 24 hours prior to any election campaign, so that more police can be deployed,” Aziz said.
‘Show restraint’
The South Asian nation of about 170 million people has been in political turmoil since Hasina was overthrown by the student-led uprising in August 2024.
Campaigning is technically unofficial because the election commission is not expected to announce the voting day until December.
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner serving as chief adviser, has repeatedly promised the elections will be held in February.
Yunus has ordered an investigation into the shooting, his media team said in a statement.
The interim government “calls on all political actors and their supporters to uphold calm, show restraint, and ensure that the February general election takes place in an atmosphere of peace, dignity, and fairness”, it said on Thursday.
Bangladesh police offered cash rewards on Wednesday for the surrender of more than 1,300 machine guns, rifles and pistols looted during last year’s uprising.
Lieutenant General Md Mainur Rahman told an army news conference on Wednesday that the military would provide security to ensure peaceful polls and that they would return to barracks after the election.
“We hope stability will be strengthened, law and order will remain normal, and we will return to the cantonment once the election is held,” Rahman said.
Major parties have unveiled their candidate lists, with the BNP saying this week that 80-year-old leader and three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia will run again, as well as her son, Tarique Rahman.
Bangladesh’s largest Islamist political party, Jamaat-e-Islami, said it had finalised a preliminary candidate list and was “engaging with other parties on the prospect of seat-sharing”, senior leader Abdullah Mohammad Taher told AFP.</p><small>2025-11-06 11:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0615235165b5b1a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953507/president-secretary-general-of-aircraft-engineers-body-dismissed-from-pia-service-amid-ongoing-tiff' target='_blank'><strong>President, secretary general of aircraft engineers’ body dismissed from PIA service amid ongoing tiff</strong></a><br><p>Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP) President Abdullah Jadoon and Secretary General Awais Jadoon were dismissed from service on Thursday amid an ongoing tiff with the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).
PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafiz confirmed the development to Dawn. The national flag carrier also issued two dismissal notices to the engineers, copies of which are available with Dawn.
Abdullah’s role was stated as an aircraft engineer (PG-VI), while Awais was an aircraft engineer (PG-VIII).
The dismissal letters said that notices were issued to the SAEP president for conducting a press conference without prior authorisation and for disclosing official information to the media, and to the SAEP secretary general the unauthorised disclosure of confidential operational information and PIA images.
“In order to enquire into the allegations/charges communicated to you via the aforesaid showcause notice, an enquiry was conducted wherein you failed to participate despite providing ample opportunities to appear and defend your case,” the notices said.
“After examining the available evidence and statements of prosecution witnesses, the enquiry committee found you guilty of the charges levelled against you,” they added. They further said that both the SAEP officials were provided two opportunities to appear before the chief executive officer, but failed to do so.
“Keeping in view your entire disciplinary case, the management has decided to dismiss you from the service of Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited,” the notices said, adding that these dismissals would go into effect immediately.
 
 

The dismissals come amid an ongoing tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP, with the protesting engineers refusing to issue clearance certificates to aircraft — a move that has disrupted flight operations in recent days.
The engineers have been protesting for two-and-a-half mont­­hs, seeking pay hikes among other demands.
While the PIA has claimed that the engineers are on “strike”, the SAEP maintains that its engineers were on duty but were not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks.
Earlier, the PIA spokesperson had highlighted that the Essential Services Act was in force in PIA under which strikes or abandonment of work was a legal offence. “All elements involved in or supporting such actions as part of a conspiracy will face legal action,” he had warned.
For his part, Awais Jadoon had earlier said that the two officers were on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances.”
He had also clarified that the engineers were not on strike and said that they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying.
In response to a question about a meeting with the PIA management, he had said that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them.
Meanwhile, the PIA has alleged that the engineer’s protest is aimed at sabotaging the national flag carrier’s privatisation.
Flight disruptions
The matter came into the spotlight when hund­reds of air travellers were reported to have been stranded at three major airports on Monday night due to the aircraft engineers’ protest, which delayed at least six flights of the national flag carrier.
Similar delays have been reported at nearly all major airports in the country during the last two months.
On Tuesday, the PIA claimed to have restored flight operations through alternative arrangements. A PIA spokesperson said that the management had used alternative means and worked overnight to restore operations, mitigating the impact of already delayed flights on subsequent operations.
Yesterday, too, the PIA said it had managed to “partially restore its flight operations”.</p><small>2025-11-06 11:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06160050898cccc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953509/amid-lifetime-ban-and-legal-fiasco-arshad-nadeems-coach-to-travel-with-him-for-islamic-solidarity-games' target='_blank'><strong>Amid lifetime ban and legal fiasco, Arshad Nadeem’s coach to travel with him for Islamic Solidarity Games</strong></a><br><p>Arshad Nadeem’s coach Salman Butt will travel with him for the upcoming Islamic Solidarity Games next week despite having been slapped with a lifetime ban by the Athletics Federation of Pakistan (AFP) which prohibits him from participating in any athletics activities.
The ban, which the federation imposed on Salman on October 12 “for gross violations of the AFP Constitution”, barred Salman from participating in any athletics activity “whether as an athlete, coach, official, or office bearer, at both national and international levels, inside or outside Pakistan.”
AFP cited “illegal and unconstitutional” elections held on August 31 by the Punjab Athletics Association — of which Salman was president till August 6 — as the primary reason for the ban.
The ban came just days after AFP asked Salman to explain Arshad’s 10th-place finish at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo in September.
The matter descended into the legal sphere when Salman approached the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) on Oct 14 to hear the case that he was appealing. PSB appointed Senator Pervaiz Rashid as adjudicator to the case.
According to a notice of hearing on the matter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Rashid sent a questionnaire to AFP and held the first hearing on November 3, but the federation objected to the matter being sent to an adjudicator instead of arbitration.
PSB, citing its constitution, as well as hearings from both the Supreme Court and Islamabad High Court, said it “possesses ample jurisdiction and authority to hear and decide the present matter”, and that the objection raised by AFP regarding jurisdiction was “rejected and set aside.”
The notice of hearing directed all parties to appear for the next hearing on Nov 6 (today), but after the AFP requested more time, the hearing has been scheduled for Nov 13 instead, a source close to the matter told Dawn.
Separately, Arshad had written to the Pakistan Olympics Association (POA) on Oct 17, who in turn confirmed its continued support and safeguarding oversight.
Arshad was a recipient of the POA’s Olympic Scholarships for athletes bound for the Paris 2024 Olympics, where Arshad won gold and broke the Olympic record with a 92.97m throw.
In the POA’s response to Arshad, a copy of which is available with Dawn, it confirmed that Salman “as per your patent right, preference and performance record, shall continue to serve as your Athlete Support Personnel for all training, rehabilitation, and competition activities including those conducted under the Pakistan Olympic Association and within the scope of the IOC Olympic Solidarity Programme.”
The association reaffirmed its full commitment to Arshad’s “professional development, mental welfare, and safeguarding.
“You will continue to train and compete within a safe, dignified environment free from external interference,” the letter read.
It further stated that a follow-up consultation would be convened to review his ongoing and future programmes, and the IOC would be informed of the situation “to protect your rights under the Olympic Charter and, in consultation with you, jointly engage with World Athletics at the appropriate time.”</p><small>2025-11-06 11:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061401317e38574.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953502/27th-constitutional-amendment-on-the-agenda-as-pm-shehbaz-holds-flurry-of-meetings' target='_blank'><strong>27th Constitutional Amendment on the agenda as PM Shehbaz holds flurry of meetings</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held meetings with the delegations of multiple parties on Thursday in what appears to be efforts by the government to prepare the ground to get a 27th Constitutional Amendment approved by Parliament.
Among those he met was a seven-member delegation of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), which was led by party Convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.
A statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said “discussion and consultation took place on the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment” during the meeting.
The delegation also included Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, Members of National Assembly Dr Farooq Sattar, Jawed Hanif Khan, Syed Aminul Haque and Khawaja Izharul Hassan, the statement added.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah were also present in the meeting.
They were also present in PM Shehbaz’s meetings with the delegations of the  Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q).
 






A separate PMO statement said party President and Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan and Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry were part of the IPP delegation that held a meeting with PM Shehbaz and discussed the proposed 27th Amendment.
 






Another statement by the PMO said the premier also met a delegation of the PML-Q, which was led by Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain, and discussed the proposed constitutional amendment.
The PML-Q delegation also included Senator Kamil Ali Agha and MNAs Mohammad Ilyas Choudhary and Farukh Khan.
A day earlier, the MQM-P had demanded that local governments (LGs) be given autonomy in the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment after the PPP revealed key features of the proposed amendment for which the PML-N-led government sought its support.
The party said that after provincial autonomy had been granted under the 18th Amendment of 2010, the “next step naturally is local autonomy, so it’s turn must come”.
“The important thing that we also said at the time of the 26th Amendment, that our constitutional amendment package be included,” MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar said yesterday during a presser, referring to its agreement with the PML-N to empower local governments.
“But it did not happen,” he lamented, calling for the matter to be included in the 27th Amendment.
The PML-N and the MQM-P had signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2024 under which LGs would directly draw powers from the federation instead of provinces.
When talks of the 26th Amendment gained momentum, the MQM-P also tied its support for the legislation to the inclusion of LG-related provisions. However, the final version — passed with MQM-P lawmakers voting in its favour — featured no such provisions.
Sattar contended that the Constitution’s Article 140A, which provides that the provinces will establish LGs, needed to be amended so that laws enacted by local bodies would not contradict it.
“The Constitution is a sacred document, but not a divine scripture; it is a living document,” the MNA contended. He added that it should not bring worry or surprise if amendments were needed in it “as per the requirements of the time and situation, and for the country’s stability”.
He also voiced support for constitutional courts, which were initially planned to be formed through the 26th Amendment, but only constitutional benches were established in the end.
Meanwhile, about the proposed Constitutional tweaks, Siddiqui said during the presser that “we are only telling the key features, and have presented what the government told us and what we understood.
“Even from us, especially Article 243 … this year has created the need for it to be harmonised with national unity, strong defence, and modern requirements of defence,” he said, referring to the provision related to the command of armed forces.
Siddiqui called for local governments to also be “considered a government”, with the Constitution guaranteeing nazims and mayors’ elections and tenures, without the prime minister needing to issue orders for it.
“The Constitution should decide that. The Supreme Court should monitor it,” the education minister said, proposing a caretaker set-up for the two roles.</p><small>2025-11-06 10:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061121095129757.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953487/third-round-of-talks-between-pakistan-and-afghanistan-in-presence-of-mediators-begins-in-istanbul' target='_blank'><strong>Third round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in presence of mediators begins in Istanbul</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan resumed talks with Afghan Taliban representatives in Istanbul today in a third round of engagement aimed at ending cross-border terrorism and consolidating a fragile ceasefire that was initially agreed upon after border clashes last month.
Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday. The talks are expected to continue for two days.
In this round, Pakistan’s delegation is being led by Lt Gen Asim Malik, director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence, and includes senior officials from the military, intelligence agencies, and the Foreign Office.
The Afghan Taliban’s delegation, meanwhile, includes General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq, Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani, Qahar Balkhi, Zakir Jalali and Afghanistan’s chargé d’affaires in Ankara.
Focus of the talks
A joint statement was released by the Turkish foreign ministry following the last round of talks between the two sides. It said that “all parties have agreed on continuation of ceasefire” and “to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and impose a penalty on the violating party”.
The communique further stated that “the principals” from both sides would reconvene in Istanbul on November 6 to discuss implementation.
Earlier, a diplomat from one of the mediating countries said while speaking to Dawn on the condition of anonymity that the two sides will review the implementation of the commitments reached during the previous round of talks and attempt to finalise the modalities for the monitoring and verification mechanism agreed in principle last week.
Meanwhile, officials in both Islamabad and Kabul have kept expectations low about the upcoming dialogue.
Pakistani military and intelligence officials have stated that Islamabad’s position remains unchanged, that Afghan soil must not be used for terrorism against Pakistan — a longstanding demand of Islamabad.
“The Pakistan military and intelligence service have a single-point agenda — the end of terrorism,” military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said earlier this week.
Another security official, speaking on anonymity, said while speaking to Dawn that Islamabad seeks “concrete, verifiable guarantees”.
From borders clashes to talks
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on Oct 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
The information minister had said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by India-abetted“ terrorists.
“The Afghan Taliban regime has been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar had stated.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6 (today).</p><small>2025-11-06 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06152256b1c233f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953506/islamabad-court-withdraws-non-bailable-arrest-warrants-issued-against-imaan-mazari-spouse' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court withdraws non-bailable arrest warrants issued against Imaan Mazari, spouse</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad court on Thursday withdrew non-bailable arrest warrants issued a day earlier against human rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, in a social media posts case, a day after.
The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCIA) had registered a case against Mazari and Chattha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.  Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka had indicted the two in the case last week, in which both denied the charges.
At yesterday’s hearing, the court issued non-bailable arrest warrants to the couple over repeated non-appearance. However, the accused alleged that they had appeared in front of the court and termed the hearing a “sham trial”.
Today’s hearing, presided over by ADSJ Majoka, was called twice in the morning —first at 8:45am and later at 10:16am— but the accused did not appear, after which the hearing was adjourned.
However, later, the couple appeared before the court, and the hearing resumed.  During the hearing, Mazari requested the court to allow her time to hire legal counsel.
“Time should be given to appoint a lawyer,” she said, adding that the rapid pace at which the case was being conducted was “violating our rights.”
She further stated, “We are being punished for speaking the truth.”
Mazari also requested that the indictment be read out to them in court.
In response to this, ADSJ Majoka said that the indictment had already been read three times, including in the presence of legal representatives.
Chattha — whose power of attorney had been submitted earlier by Advocate Samiullah Wazir — also requested the court to remove the state counsel appointed for him.
To this, the court clarified that it had not appointed the state counsel and that only the relevant committee responsible for the appointment could remove them if required.
On the other side, the prosecutor was against granting the accused any more time. He went on to argue that statements of witnesses should be recorded and, if necessary, a state counsel could continue representing the accused.
On the matter of Mazari’s legal representation, ADSJ Majoka directed that the power of attorney for Mazari’s counsel be submitted on Saturday.
He adjourned the hearing to Saturday as well.
He also stated that arguments regarding the continuation or removal of the state counsel will also be heard on Saturday, after which the court will decide the matter.
Over the appearance of both of the accused, the court suspended the arrest warrants against the couple.
Separately, in a post on X, Mazari alleged that “she had only been given one day to hire legal counsel,” adding that “charges against them had not yet formally been framed.”
She further alleged that “despite Hadi submitting power of attorney, the court remained persistent that he should be represented by state counsel.”
Mazari went on to note: “The court adjourned the hearing to Saturday in this case, while many other trials usually stretch on for 2-3 weeks.”
 






In a separate tweet detailing yesterday’s hearing, Mazari had alleged that the judge had  “flatly refused” to read the charges to her.
He “[began] recording of evidence without charge being framed and my plea,” she added.
Mazari continued: “This is not an independent or impartial court but a party to the case. The bias is clear, and this Judge should no longer hear this case.
“This is a sham trial.”
 






At yesterday’s hearing, heated exchanges took place between the accused and the court.
Mazari objected to the court’s previous order, calling it “baseless” and claiming that the record incorrectly stated she had been indicted.  As the hearing resumed after a brief adjournment, Chatha expressed no confidence in the court, alleging bias.
“This court is biased and should not hear this case,” he said.
ADSJ Majoka replied that such an application should have been filed before the indictment. “Had you expressed no confidence before the indictment, I could have transferred the case. Now, this power lies with the High Court,” the judge remarked.
Chatha then alleged that the judge was “under pressure,” which the judge firmly denied.
On October 29, Chattha was arrested outside the courtroom for non-appearance, despite Mazari claiming that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom”.
Social media case
According to the first information report (FIR) of the case, registered by the NCIA, Mazari and Chattha were accused of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts.
It also accused the two of implying that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
The FIR was registered under the following sections of law: Sections 9, 10, 11 and 26 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016.
The FIR alleged that they held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It stated that Mazari and Chattha had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p><small>2025-11-06 10:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06130407e5f6539.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953498/only-sohail-afridi-can-make-decisions-for-peace-in-kp-says-cms-aide' target='_blank'><strong>Only Sohail Afridi can make decisions for peace in KP, says CM’s aide</strong></a><br><p>Shafiullah Jan, the special assistant to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on information and public relations, said on Thursday that only the provincial chief executive could make decisions for ensuring lasting peace in the province.
“We have the mandate. Any decision for lasting peace in the province will be made by the chief minister, and the provincial government will implement it,” Jan said while addressing a news conference in Peshawar.
 






He said law and order was the biggest challenge for the provincial government, adding that the KP government was making efforts to address the issue.
Jan further said that a multiparty conference was scheduled to be held next week and that the finalised terms of reference (ToRs) would be presented to the chief minister for further discussion with the stakeholders, to decide a future course of action for lasting peace in the province.
Meanwhile, PTI Provincial Secretary General Ali Asghar requested all the political parties to share their suggestions, adding that PTI founder Imran Khan and his party were against any military operation in the province.
“The consequences of military operations are faced by the locals who vacate their homes,” he said.
The PTI has been opposing plans to conduct anti-terrorism operations across the province, with its incarcerated founder Imran Khan in August telling then-KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur not to allow the Centre to conduct any military operations.
Imran had made a similar demand in September as well.
However, Gandapur had deviated from the party line while he was the CM and justified the use of mortar shells, drones and fighter jets against terrorists as the constitutional right of the military.
It was against this backdrop that Imran decided to remove Gandapur as the provincial chief executive and nominated Afridi for the post, who was elected as the chief minister on October 13. Imran’s this decision is also being linked to his opposition to military operations in the KP.
Three days before Afridi’s election, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had addressed a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters.
He was asked on the occasion about the Pakistan government’s past engagement with the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the change in the KP leadership.
In his response, the DG ISPR had said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists)? […] Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations?
‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations? It is for everyone to see that today […] who is that person and the political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’
For his part, Afridi announced following his election that a jirga would be held in his hometown of Bara in the Khyber district on Oct 25 to establish enduring peace in the restive province and resist decisions made without the input of residents. He also asserted that the provincial government stood by the ideology of Imran and the interests of the KP residents.
In his first official high-level meeting as the CM on Oct 20, he had maintained that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.
More recently on Oct 29, he used stronger words to criticise military operations in KP while speaking to the media in Peshawar, saying that civilian deaths during security operations constituted a “war crime” and not collateral damage.</p><small>2025-11-06 10:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632356-sindh-launches-student-attendance-system-to-enhance-school-management' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh launches student attendance system to enhance school management</strong></a><br><p>

SAMRS, an initiative of the school education and literacy department (SELD), has been developed under the Sindh Early Learning Enhancement through Classroom Transformation (SELECT) project. It will be rolled out in 600 schools across 12 districts.
In a statement on X, the Sindh information department said the initiative represented a “significant step toward greater transparency and the promotion of data-driven education across the province”.
 






Addressing the launch ceremony in Karachi today, CM Murad stressed the need for Pakistan to have proper databases due to an increase in the population. “The numbers have become so large that you can’t just keep track.”
Underscoring the need to utilise digital platforms, the chief minister said the SAMRS was the “perfect way of doing it”.
“I have said that we will go to the union councils and make it the responsibility of elected representatives to identify children in their villages to assign them a digital ID,” CM Murad said.
Murad noted that the SAMRS has been rolled out in 600 schools as of now, while the province had a total of more than 40,000 schools.
Stressing that each and every child should be incorporated into the SAMRS, the chief minister proposed that the subsequent data should be compared with that of the latest census.
He said the system would be used to gauge the number of out-of-school children, acknowledging that the current reported figures were “scary to say the least”.
CM Murad noted that the SAMRS will also aid in figuring out the number of school dropouts. Last month, he had directed the school education department to make full use of the technology to monitor students’ attendance, reduce dropout rate and address the causes of absenteeism.
Sindh had a 54pc dropout rate for children at the post-primary level in 2024, according to government figures, while 47pc of children across the province — a staggering 7.81 million — were out of school as per the 2023 census.
 
 

The chief minister highlighted the importance of educating children to create a well-civilised and democratic nation.
“Our mines, our minerals, our arms and ammunition — they all go to zero if we don’t have an educated nation,” CM Murad said.
He said the system will first be implemented in schools, then colleges and eventually universities. He also called for “open access” to the system so that educationists and experts can provide their input.
CM Murad noted that the SELECT project was being carried out in collaboration with the World Bank, and the SAMRS was a part of it. He added that the Asian Development Bank and other international agencies were aiding in rebuilding schools.
 






“We’re going to spend more than Rs125 billion this year in rebuilding schools that were affected during the floods,” the chief minister stated.
Murad noted that there had been grievances that the education department was not implementing its development portfolio properly, but “we have seen an improvement compared to last year”. “Still not satisfied, still a long way to go, but yes, it has become better.”
Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah and World Bank Country Director in Pakistan Bolormaa Amgaabazar were among the attendees at the event.
Shah, as per a statement from CM Murad’s spokesperson Abdulrasheed Channa, said teachers will be trained in the initial stages of SELECT to improve teaching quality and that a transparent system will be implemented under the supervision of a Reform Support Unit.
On the SAMRS, Shah said the reasons for students’ absences will be identified and “timely corrective action” will be taken.
He pointed out that the SAMRS would also enable online monitoring of teachers’ attendance and registration. He added that the system will have “full functionality” with geo-fencing and an offline mode.
 


Providing details of the SAMRS, the minister said out of the 600 schools where the system was initially being rolled out, 120 were primary, 480 were middle, and 79 were high schools.
“There are a total of 137,000 pupils registered, including 79,730 girls and 57,501 boys,” Shah said. He listed that illness was the top reason for absenteeism (44 per cent), followed by domestic circumstances (21pc) and family emergencies (16pc).
According to the education minister, there has been a 16pc improvement in school attendance from April to May this year, while the share of students with “high risk” of dropping out has declined from 32.5pc to 23pc.</p><small>2025-11-06 09:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632352-pm-shehbaz-assures-mqm-p-of-local-govt-reforms-under-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz assures MQM-P of local govt reforms under 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

Watch parties surfaced across all five boroughs, pulsing with celebratory music, jubilation, and a sense of endless possibilities. The city itself seemed to hum with electric energy. The air, undeniably different, charged with the promise of something new.
At a time when voter turnout and overall faith in politics have been at record lows, 34-year-old democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, a Queens native and the son of Ugandan-Indian immigrants, has emerged as a ray of hope, not only for New Yorkers but progressives all over the world.
His win signifies a new era for reformists, younger voters, and immigrant communities who poured their hearts out into his campaign, canvassing neighbourhoods, phone-banking, and donating generously. Nearly 70 per cent of his voter base was under the age of 30.
“Seeing someone who shares similar values, background, and culture in a position of power feels very grounding and affirming. It shows that we belong here and that our voices matter,” said Dr Sayali Karke, 27, a medical professional and an immigrant from India.
The mayoral election drew more than two million voters — a turnout last seen in 1969, according to the city’s Board of Elections, when 2.46 million people came out to vote for incumbent Mayor John Lindsay, who, after losing the Republican primary, was reelected on the Liberal line.
Mamdani’s meteoric rise over the past year — from a lesser-known assemblyman to now the 111th mayor of New York, defeating well-established rivals such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa in both the Democratic primary and the general election — is nothing short of monumental.
He’s coming for Trump and we’re here for it
Running on a platform of progressive politics, Mamdani has pledged to prioritise five key policies: universal free childcare, a rent freeze on the city’s one million rent-stabilised apartments, rebuilding ties with his critics, reimagining the police department, and standing up to President Donald Trump’s attacks on the city.
In his first speech as mayor, Mamdani addressed the president directly.
“This is not how we stop Trump; this is how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up,” declared Mamdani, eliciting thunderous applause.
A historic day indeed, to see a Muslim politician challenge the president of the United States on the world’s stage.
And Trump was, in fact, watching. “AND SO IT BEGINS!”, he responded on his Truth Social platform.
Mamdani now faces significant challenges as mayor in reconciling his ambitious agenda with the realities of governance amid deep political hostility and division. Trump has already launched a slew of scornful attacks on social media and threatened to halt federal funds to New York City.
“If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
Aside from the fact that Mamdani has clarified on multiple occasions that he is not a communist but a democratic socialist, the president does not have the authority to withhold federal funds from states. Under the US Constitution, that power lies with Congress.
When Islamophobia met its match
The scourge of Islamophobia presents yet another battle Mamdani and his Muslim supporters will continue to encounter. His campaign team, which included many Muslim staffers, endured harassment and discrimination but continued to press forward with unwavering resolve.
“I was canvassing outside a mosque in Brooklyn, handing out fliers, when a group of young white men walked past, hurling Islamophobic insults because I was wearing a keffiyeh,” recalled a resident of Brooklyn, Zarah Shujjah, who is also an immigrant. “That incident gave me more conviction that we need a Muslim mayor. So, I showed up again the next day, and the next, and the next.”
Throughout the campaign, Mamdani’s candidacy endured waves of racially charged attacks, from criticisms about his lack of experience to outright anti-Muslim slurs. Ellie Cohanim, a former deputy envoy in the first Trump Administration, posted a picture of the burning Twin Towers from September 11, 2001, captioned: “Never forget …. Vote Andrew Cuomo & save our city”. The New York Post ran headlines that conflated Mamdani with terrorism, and Cuomo himself engaged in Islamophobic remarks in an interview with the conservative radio host Sid Rosenberg.
As Islamophobia persists across the United States, Muslim Americans finally feel a sense of solace and pride knowing that when Mamdani is sworn in on January 1, he will be the most powerful Muslim elected official in the country.
“It’s shocking that I have seen a Muslim mayor in my 20s. It feels like a response to the polarising state of the country. We’re going to see more Trumps and Kirks pop up, but we’ll also see more Mamdanis. That’s both exciting and concerning. It’s a reality that represents the current state of US politics,” said Maria Mir, who moved to Brooklyn from Pakistan.
The line between hope and hype
While it’s tempting, and often politically useful, to glorify a newly elected leader in an age of virality, such adulation should be seen with caution. The internet has a way of turning people into symbols, often faster than they can grow into the roles those symbols demand.
Elevating a figure as esteemed as Mamdani creates expectations: promises made on the campaign trail become moral contracts with voters, and supporters rightly expect those contracts to be honoured. It will be important to hold him accountable to his commitments and to the faith of those who propelled him to victory.
That said, accountability and optimism for change are not mutually exclusive. Transitioning from campaigner to the daily grind of city leadership is a radical shift — from setting agendas to balancing budgets and operating within institutional constraints. In a city long dominated by wealth and entrenched interests, the odds are stacked against him. He must be afforded the leeway to falter as he transitions to his new role.
Yet, for now, New Yorkers, and many others around the world can revel in this renewed sense of faith and watch as new beginnings start to unfold.

Cathay said late on Wednesday that the Doha-based carrier had approached it about selling its entire 9.7 per cent stake, and it would repurchase the shareholding through a buyback at HK$10.8374 per share, roughly a 4pc discount to its last closing share price.
The Gulf carrier had bought the stake in November 2017, making it the third-largest shareholder in Cathay after Swire Pacific and Air China.
Cathay is paying roughly a 35pc premium over the price Qatar Airways originally paid for the stake to buy it back. The Hong Kong carrier said it would fund the deal through internal resources and existing credit lines.
“I don’t think there’s anything special to read into it [buying back from Qatar]. I think it’s more likely about Qatar Airways having their own cash needs,” said Kenny Ng Lai-yin, securities strategist at China Everbright Securities International.

Kenny said the deal should be good for Cathay’s stock price as there would be fewer shares floating in the market, which would mean less selling pressure.
Shares of Cathay rose 4.8pc on Thursday, while the Hong Kong-listed shares of Air China climbed 4pc and Swire Pacific’s stock was up more than 1pc.
Based at the world’s busiest cargo airport, Cathay is one of Asia’s largest cargo carriers and has benefited from rising volumes of e-commerce out of China.
Exit strategy allows for ‘long-term growth’
Cathay was Qatar Airways’ first major investment in an Asian airline and was aimed at boosting its global influence and increasing traffic through its Doha hub. There were no Qatar-nominated directors on Cathay’s board, meaning it had little influence over the Swire Pacific-managed airline.
Prior to Qatar Airways’ investment, Cathay flew between Hong Kong and Qatar’s Doha hub as part of a codeshare arrangement between 2014 and 2016, but the route was axed “for commercial reasons”.
Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said the exit reflected the company’s disciplined portfolio strategy and followed a period of strong results, allowing the company to optimise investments and position itself for long-term growth.
The Middle Eastern airline has pursued a strategy of investing in airlines worldwide to strengthen its competitive position, including in British Airways parent IAG, South American carrier LATAM and Virgin Australia .
Cathay Chairman Patrick Healy said the stake buyback reflected “strong” confidence in the company’s future. The airline has laid out an investment plan of HK$100bn over seven years that includes fleet renewal, cabin products and lounges.
Cathay suffered prolonged losses during the Covid-19 pandemic, with Hong Kong one of the last global destinations to end travel restrictions.
 
 

Cathay’s business is recovering, with the airline and budget subsidiary HK Express carrying 20pc more passengers in September than a year earlier.
If the buyback of the Qatar Airways stake is approved, Swire Pacific’s stake in Cathay will rise to 47.69pc from 43.12pc, while Air China’s shareholding will increase to 31.78pc from 28.74pc.
Cathay and Qatar Airways said they would continue their partnership through the oneworld Alliance.</p><small>2025-11-06 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06083701a518a49.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953380/is-k-commander-gunned-down-in-kps-karak' target='_blank'><strong>‘IS-K commander’ gunned down in KP’s Karak</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: A key commander of the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) militant group was killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak in a late-evening police operation, sources told Dawn.
Sources said that acting on an intelligence tip-off, police raided a hideout in Ambari village in Karak district. An exchange of fire ensued, resulting in the death of Nisar Hakim, a key IS-K commander.
Four policemen were also wounded in the shootout, that lasted around four hours.
According to sources, Hakim was believed to be the mastermind of a failed suicide bombing targeting the JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
Karak has long been under the radar of the security and intelligence apparatus for ISKP network and recruitment.
It is one of the most underdeveloped districts in the province with one of the lowest socio-economic indicators, but it is known for its wild berry honey, much of which is exported to the Gulf and the Middle East. Incidentally, the ISKP network, was also associated with the honey trade.

Chasing 264, Pakistan won a tense first ODI by two wickets on Tuesday with only a couple of balls to spare on a pitch that assisted spinners in the later stages of both the innings.
Having elected to field first, the Shaheen Shah Afridi-captained hosts were facing a tough situation when Matthew Breetzke’s South Africa reached 98-0 as their openers dominated the proceedings. Later, the tourists were 191-3 in 33 overs before they suffered a late collapse as the home spinners took charge.
The pitch is likely to favour batsmen early on though spinners could again play a key role in the later stages of the match at the traditionally dry surface.
For South Africa, the focus will be on adapting quickly to the conditions and countering Pakistan’s bowling which has depth as well as variety.
The touring batsmen, in particular, will be looking to build partnerships and produce a better show with greater discipline against the likes of Shaheen, Naseem Shah, Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz and part-time spinner Saim Ayub, who earned the player-of-the-match award for his all-round show – 2-39 in eight overs and 39 runs – in the first game.
The South African players attended a training session at the Iqbal Stadium on Wednesday while the Pakistan team opted to rest.
The tourists participated in warm-up exercises followed by batting, bowling and fielding practice drills.
‘CREDIT TO BATTERS’
Earlier, talking at the post-match ceremony, Shaheen lauded the batters for their match-winning show in the series opener.
“Our bowlers came back in the last 10 overs to restrict South Africa to a reasonable total. But I will give credit to our batters who played well on a wicket that had both turn and swing [in the latter stages of the innings],” Shaheen said.
“They handled the situation well.”
Replying to a question regarding the tense victory in the series opener, the Pakistan skipper said, “That always happens in cricket but we’ll try to make it not happen again.”
Speaking at a news conference after the first ODI, Pakistan wicket-keeper/batter Mohammad Rizwan defended the hosts’ decision to bowl first.
“The decision to bowl first was taken by us while keeping in view the prevailing situation [at the ground]. It was a combined decision by us,” Rizwan told reporters while answering a question.
“Plus there was the dew factor. All of us had the same opinion that we should bowl first keeping in mind that dew will come into play in the latter stages of the day. The batting looked easy early on in the first innings but then came the dew factor.”
Responding to a question, Rizwan said that the hosts should have wrapped up the match earlier as Pakistan were well set at 196-3 in the 39th over with Rizwan (55) and Salman Ali Agha (62) at the crease.
“Yes, we [Salman and Rizwan] should have finished the game. Actually, the wicket was behaving awkwardly where the ball was skidding, gripping and bouncing and we were set.
“We will try not to repeat the mistakes and finish the game in future.”
Regarding the historic international match that the Iqbal Stadium hosted after 17 years, Rizwan said, “On our part, wherever we play at home — including Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, Rawalpindi or Faisalabad — we get the same support from the crowd.
“It is what message the other [visiting] teams get from our crowds matters the most.”
Talking to reporters after the first match, South African pacer Corbin Bosch said that the wicket was good for spinners.
“It was a new ball wicket, and was tough [to bat on]. The ball [particularly in the latter stages] turned and spinners played a crucial role for both the teams,” Bosch told reporters.
The pacer believed that South Africa were slightly short of setting Pakistan a winning target, saying, “We were perhaps 15 runs short on this wicket”.

As he left the stage to a cheering cross-section of the metropolis, the song on the speaker was not one of the many well-worn tunes about New York but the beats from a Bollywood blockbuster, Dhoom.
Mamdani, winning a mandate with a left-wing agenda focused on making New York more affordable, has made history in many ways — as the first Muslim and first South Asian to lead America’s largest city, and, at 34, its youngest mayor in a century.
But Mamdani’s victory is a watershed not just for his identity but how he embraces it — fully.
“I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older, I am Muslim, I am a democratic socialist and — most damning of all — I refuse to apologise for any of this,” Mamdani told supporters inside a Brooklyn music venue.
 


South Asians constitute one of the fastest-growing communities in the United States, totalling more than five million people, and have made major inroads into politics — notably former vice president Kamala Harris, whose mother was from India.
But candidates have handled their identity in sharply different ways. Two once-prominent Indian Americans, Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal, both Republican governors of conservative Southern states, took pains to describe how they had become Christians.
“The comfort level expressing and embracing outwardly your identity has varied from candidate to candidate over the years,” said Kishan Putta, an elected commissioner in Washington DC who serves on a Democratic Party advisory committee on Asian Americans.
Putta, who has followed South Asian candidates for years, also pointed to the victory in Virginia of Ghazala Hashmi as lieutenant governor, noting that the very first line on her website’s online biography is how she was the first Muslim and first South Asian American to serve in the Virginia Senate.
“So it’s not just candidates in cities or places with huge South Asian and immigrant communities,” Putta added. “Candidates are getting much more comfortable in talking about their identity.”

‘Symbolic moment of acceptance’
For Mamdani, like many South Asians, that identity is not always concise to explain. He was born in Uganda to two prominent Indian-born parents — the academic Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair, who is Hindu.
Mamdani has spoken passionately about Islamophobia following the Sept 11, 2001 attacks, counts a kebab counter in diverse Jackson Heights as his favourite restaurant and days before the election campaigned car to car at LaGuardia Airport among taxi drivers, who are often South Asian.

Mamdani’s openness on his background “certainly is a break from what we have seen in the past”, said Sara Sadhwani, a political scientist at Pomona College who has studied South Asian Americans.
“But that very much goes along with Mamdani’s brand of authenticity and embracing difference — fully accepting the nuance of those differences,” she said.
“Even if all Indian Americans don’t completely embrace his politics, it is nonetheless a symbolic moment of acceptance of Indian Americans.”
 


Trump base attacks
US President Donald Trump has furiously attacked Mamdani but has earlier courted Indian Americans, making gains in last year’s election in a community that has historically voted Democratic and by some measures has the highest household income in the United States.
Trump’s stance is not shared by all his base, with online far-right campaigners in recent months writing hateful comments against Indian Americans.
Trump in September yanked up the fee for a visa used by Indian tech workers as part of a broader crackdown on immigration.
 
 

US Vice President JD Vance is married to an Indian American, Usha Vance, but recently raised eyebrows by saying he would be happy if she converts from Hinduism to Christianity. Vance accused critics of anti-Christian bias.
Vivek Ramaswamy, the pro-Trump Indian American tech entrepreneur running for governor of Ohio, said one lesson from Tuesday’s losses was: “Cut out the identity politics. It doesn’t suit Republicans.”
Dinesh D’Souza, a longtime Republican militant born in India, wrote on X: “A very loud group on the Right said, ‘Indians go home,’ and so many of them did — to the Democratic Party. “

— Justice Shahid Karim on the conferment of Hilal-e-Imtiaz on the late Justice Fazal Karim, 17 November 2023
A year ago today, Qazi Faez Isa departed as the chief justice of Pakistan.
His parting gift was to reverse the ruling on dissident votes in the parliament. This, we know, kicked the gates open to the 26th amendment, as once-unbothered lawmakers were promptly forced into voting for the judiciary’s funeral rites.
The bill was passed, and the third branch was destroyed.
But while obeying His Lordship’s decision, the unity regime felt free to disobey that of the other lordships in a different case — reserved seats. It was just enough defiance to secure the numbers for their amendment.
How, you ask, does the executive override the Supreme Court whenever it feels like? By precedent. Two years earlier, it had shrugged off the Bandial Court’s orders to hold elections in 90 days. Only, once the state learns to ignore some judges, it learns to ignore the lot of them.
 
 

As several worthies deciding the reserved seats matter found out: it should have come as no surprise that their 12-member verdict was flung away as casually as that of the Bandial Court’s five — they’d enabled it via bizarre dissenting notes in the 90 days case, and then by supporting the trash-fire practice and procedure law chaining their own hands.
Per historian Edward Gibbon, “Those princes … permitted for a while to hold a precarious sceptre, were dismissed from their thrones as soon as they had performed their appointed task of fashioning to the yoke the vanquished nations.”
And that yoke’s latest form — the Constitutional Bench — has more than delivered: out go reserved seats, in come military trials of civilians, and from the skies new lords parachute into the last holdout: the Islamabad High Court.
Nor is the unity regime satisfied. Its eyes are on a bigger prize: the creation of a so-called Constitutional Court. If allowed to go through, what was the worst judicial regression in over 30 years risks becoming the worst in Pakistan’s history. We look at the facts.
A crazy transplant from civil law
For starters, Pakistan’s entire justice system is built on common law, as opposed to that of civil law countries. To explain, common law systems (such as the United Kingdom and its former colonies, Pakistan and India) develop the law case by case, through precedent.
This can’t be overstated: stare decisis — to stand by what’s decided — makes the law dependable and predictable, with judges leaning on verdicts that have been handed down over decades and centuries. It also means trusting the courts to interpret the law and protect the people.
History is in play here: in common law countries, it was thought that empowered, independent judges would shield the citizen from tyrannical kings (a recurring problem in Pakistan).
 
 

Civil law systems believe in no such thing: there is no strong doctrine of precedent; the code is all; and judges are considered best when applying the law’s black letter as faceless, nameless robots.
But civil law countries are also born from specific nightmares: France, their prime example, was forged in the fire of revolution, when judges were thought enemies of the people and instruments of class privilege. Restoring order to madness, Napoleon made sure to straitjacket the judges into ‘la bouche de la loi’ — the mouth of the law, and no more.
That’s already the opposite of Britannia and its South Asian heirs, where the courts only ever gained in legitimacy when opposing despots. While Napoleon’s France codified against judges, we developed the common law through them.
Take also Germany, another well-known civil law buff: its constitutional court sits atop a culture of obedience and bureaucratic discipline. Pakistan, on the other hand, is always at risk from the gloved hand; its most basic rules of the road remain unsettled; and its judges are routinely pressed into service as the final frontier against democracy’s derailment.
Does that sound like a place where judges should be reduced to bean-counters?
Interestingly, ours is the first ruling class pleading for a civil law system to escape neither degenerate elites (France) nor fascist dictatorship (Germany), but its own Supreme Court.
Supreme confusion: we already have constitutional courts
Though stating the obvious, constitutional review is already vested in our superior courts: the high courts and the Supreme Court. They are also more than happy to exercise that jurisdiction under Articles 4 and 199 (judicial review of executive action and fundamental rights), with the Supreme Court acting as the final arbiter through Articles 184, 185, and 187.
But the unity regime wishes to strip them of that core function. The demoted Supreme Court, as this writer has said previously, shall now concern itself with civil nosebleeds, land disputes, maybe the odd buffalo wandering into a stranger’s rice paddy. That is no apex court, nor what it’s for.
This also breaks the third branch altogether: from a relatively clear path — trial courts to appellate High Courts to a final Supreme Court — we now get a new forum with a dozen detours.
 
 

For one, meaningless distinctions between ‘ordinary’ and ‘constitutional’ judges will fragment what’s already considered one of the most broken legal systems in the world.
For another, constant litigation over jurisdictional boundaries — what is a ‘constitutional’ question and what is not — will fill more dockets, burn more time, and nudge out more cases.
Finally, instead of our judicial structure as one coherent pyramid, we’re set for two competing apexes, with doctrinal chaos as a result.
An extra warehouse for pliant judges
Which brings us to why this amendment is being brought in the first place.
It’s certainly not pendency; a fallacious reason that only the most cynical and intellectually dishonest lawyers can put across with a straight face. As of 2024, per the Law and Justice Commission’s report, Supreme Court cases make up just 2 per cent of total pendency in the country.
That’s right: the main focus of the 26th and 27th amendments — for all the wide-ranging havoc they have brought and will bring to the judiciary — leaves 98pc of cases and 98pc of the litigant public untouched. (Even if we toss in all superior courts, it’s still over 80pc in the cold).
 
 

Because the litigant public was never worth securing, so much as a unity regime, that same public threw out in the last election. As yet another doorstop for the unelected, the new federal court will now serve as a warehouse for pliant judges: think Constitutional Bench with a hundred times the square footage.
And as a means of executive capture, what a joy it will be: a smaller court will require fewer appointments to control; its members can be packed in a single political cycle; favourites can audition from the provinces; and the Supreme Court’s senior career judges with decades of independence baggage can be skipped over at once.
Not least, by stripping their consent from the equation, independent judges will be transferred from province to province in the manner of common bureaucrats. Imagine if, at the first sign of resistance, the centre keeps ping-ponging courageous judges between Quetta and Karachi.
It even works out in converse: those timid souls making a career of doing the executive’s bidding will have added incentive not to get any funny ideas, and continue churning out one mindless judgment after the other.
Back to the future: new court, no precedent
The selling point of any new system is its lack of a difficult past: why sweat history?
And given federal constitutional courts — Europe’s, at least — tend to turn up their nose at precedent anyway, we arrive at the real bonus: decades of rights-friendly case law can be distinguished, overruled, or declared ‘inapplicable’ under the new amendment.
The Constitutional Bench has shown us a helpful preview: its reserved seats decision is gloriously bereft of even the most basic logic, while its military trials verdict seems to be labouring under the impression that Pakistan remains frozen in Bhutto’s emergency, and that judicial independence and the right to fair trial never happened in the interim.
Hence, also, the crux of our neo-PCOs, the 26th and 27th amendments: an embarrassed state of exception can become proud law. Yes, there have been a fair few outliers. But generally, from 2009 to 2023, the post-restoration judiciary guarded its turf.
So the deep state has seen fit to raise a new judiciary instead, and upend the very terms of that restoration: a process begun in earnest when the unity regime crowed with glee that democracy could be overridden based on a fictional 4-3 verdict in the 90 days case. It was the beginning of the end, with that end turbo-charged by the year of Qazi.
 
 

In other ways, however, the judicial branch may well be regressing to the mean. After all, Pakistan has never suffered from a shortage of constitutional courts — what has forever plagued it is a lack of constitutional courage.
Or perhaps ignorance.
It can be assumed the vast majority of regime tools punching the air for a constitutional court haven’t the first idea of the difference between common law and civil law countries (or that Pakistan is a common law country at all); of the role of precedent in shaping the law over decades; of how the the forced transfer of judges is a humiliation; or of how foolish it is to blindly transplant alien organs into a republic with its own zaman, makan, and ikhwan; of how an entire judicature mustn’t be sacrificed to win sordid little grudge matches.
Yet it can equally be assumed they will become domain experts the very second the levers of power fall from their hands, and the benefit of independent judges becomes clear to them as thunder.
Sooner, one can only hope, than when drafting their own bail petitions.</p><small>2025-11-06 07:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632334-govt-finalising-27th-amendment-draft-with-key-defence-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>Govt finalising 27th Amendment draft with key 'defence reforms'</strong></a><br><p>

According to the ISPR, apart from meeting the sultan of Brunei, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah Ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar ‘Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddien, General Shamshad also held meetings with  Yang Berhormat Pehin Datu Lailaraja Major General (Retired) Dato Paduka Seri Awang Haji Halbi bin Haji Mohd Yussof, Brunei’s minister at the PM’s office and minister of defence-II, as well as Major General Dato Paduka Seri Haji Muhammad Haszaimi bin Bol Hassan, commander of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.
During the meetings, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional security environment in the meetings, the ISPR statement said, adding that the CJCSC “underscored Pakistan’s cordial relations with Brunei Darussalam and expressed his commitment to further strengthen military-to-military ties and defence cooperation”.
The CJCSC also visited the ship KDB Darulaman at Muara Naval Base and the Defence Academy of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.
At the defence academy, he “delivered a talk on ‘Pakistan’s contributions to regional peace and stability’ and interacted with the students of command and staff course, including officers from 19 foreign countries”.
According to the ISPR statement, the sultan and civil-military leadership of Brunei Darussalam “appreciated [the] high professional standards of Pakistan’s armed forces and their achievements and sacrifices in [the] fight against terrorism”.
The statement also said that upon his arrival at the Royal Brunei Armed Forces headquarters, “a smartly turned-out military contingent presented a ‘Guard of Honour’” to the CJCSC.
The CJCSC’s Brunei’s visit comes roughly around a week after his trip to Bangladesh, where he called on Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman at Army Headquarters in Dhaka. The two leaders expressed appreciation for the “positive trajectory” of growing defence cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh during the meeting, the ISPR said.
During the visit, the CJCSC also met with Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Mohammad Nazmul Hassan, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan and Principal Staff Officer (PSO) of the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen S.M. Kamrul Hassan.</p><small>2025-11-06 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06083230389ce16.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953444/trump-continues-to-comment-on-pakistan-india-may-conflict-now-says-8-planes-shot-down-essentially' target='_blank'><strong>Trump continues to comment on Pakistan-India May conflict, now says ‘8 planes shot down essentially’</strong></a><br><p>Continuing to comment on the brief military conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year, US President Donald Trump has now stated that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.
“In eight months I ended eight wars, including Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda … Pakistan and India,” he said during a speech at the American Business Forum in Miami late on Wednesday.
“I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them. And then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper — I won’t mention the newspaper because it’s usually fake news — but I heard they are going to war. Eight planes, seven planes were shot down — an eighth was really badly wounded [sic]. But eight planes were shot down essentially,” he said.
 


He reiterated his previous claims that he threatened not to make trade deals unless the two countries agreed to peace.
“I’m not trading with you; we are not making any deals with you if you are at war with each other,” he said.
“A day later, I get a call, ‘We made peace’. They stopped. I said, ‘Thank you, let’s trade’. Isn’t that great? Tariffs did that. Without tariffs that would have never happened.”
The US president has previously stated on several occasions that five to seven planes were shot down during the May conflict between the two neighbouring countries. He had also reiterated his praise for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asum Munir, both of whom he met in Washington in September. Just last month, he had said that seven “brand-new, beautiful planes were shot down” during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India.
India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.
The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.</p><small>2025-11-06 07:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/06112308e225cac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953488/trump-administration-has-revoked-80000-non-immigrant-visas-us-official-says' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration has revoked 80,000 non-immigrant visas, US official says</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s administration has revoked around 80,000 non-immigrant visas since its inauguration on January 20 for offences ranging from driving under the influence to assault and theft, a senior State Department official said on Wednesday.
The extent of the revocations, first reported by the Washington Examiner, reflects a broad immigration crackdown initiated when Trump came into office, deporting an unprecedented number of migrants, including some who held valid visas.
The administration has also adopted a stricter policy on granting visas, with tightened social media vetting and expanded screening.
Around 16,000 of the visa revocations were tied to cases of driving under the influence, while about 12,000 were for assault and another 8,000 for theft.
“These three crimes accounted for almost half of revocations this year,” said the senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
In August, a State Department spokesperson said Washington had revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and breaking the law, including a small number for “support for terrorism”.
The department also said last month that it had revoked the visas of at least six people over social media comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in May said he had revoked the visas of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people, including students, because of involvement in activities that he said went against US foreign policy priorities.
Directives from the State Department this year have ordered US diplomats abroad to be vigilant against any applicants whom Washington may see as hostile to the United States and with a history of political activism.
Trump administration officials have said that student visa and green card holders are subject to deportation over their support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel’s conduct in its offensive in Gaza, calling their actions a threat to US foreign policy and accusing them of being pro-Hamas.</p><small>2025-11-06 06:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0610164365090d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953480/elon-musks-starlink-to-start-services-in-indias-maharashtra-state' target='_blank'><strong>Elon Musk’s Starlink to start services in India’s Maharashtra state</strong></a><br><p>India’s Maharashtra state, home to the financial hub Mumbai, will be the first to roll out Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service in the world’s most populous country, the state’s chief minister said.
The launch of Starlink, which provides high-speed internet to remote locations using low-orbit satellites, has sparked fierce debate in India over issues ranging from predatory pricing to spectrum allocation.
India — projected to have more than 900 million internet users by year’s end — granted Starlink a licence in June.
Maharashtra was “poised to become the first Indian state to formally collaborate with Starlink”, the state’s Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on the Musk-owned platform X late Wednesday.
“This collaboration … will ensure the state leads India in satellite-enabled digital infrastructure.”
In March, India’s biggest telecom service providers — Jio Platforms and its rival Bharti Airtel — announced deals with SpaceX to offer Starlink internet to their customers.
Starlink’s business operations Vice President Lauren Dreyer said she was “excited” to further India’s digital vision.
“Looking forward to connecting schools, medical facilities, and beyond in the most remote and unconnected areas once Starlink receives final approvals”, Dreyer said in a statement.
Major technology firms looking to court users in the world’s fifth-largest economy have made a flurry of announcements about expanding into the country this year.
In October, Google announced it will invest $15 billion in India over the next five years to build a giant data centre and artificial intelligence base there, the largest AI hub it is investing in outside of the United States.

• Says any cut in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s 9.4pc share in NFC award unacceptable
ISLAMABAD: The PTI parliamentary party on Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution calling for the arrangement of a meeting between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, after the chief minister was reportedly denied access on four occasions despite directions issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The resolution, which was later submitted to the National Assembly Secretariat, claimed that Mr Khan is the head of Pakistan’s largest political party and that it is the constitutional and democratic right of the KP chief minister to meet him in Adiala jail.
Members of the parliamentary party deman­ded that the IHC’s orders be implemented, terming the continued denial a violation of democratic norms and parliamentary mandate.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was present during the meeting.
Speaking to media persons, Mr Afridi warned that the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment would amount to an attack on provincial autonomy.
He said that the KP government would take all possible steps to resist what he described as an attempt to roll back powers guaranteed to provinces under the Constitution.
He stated that the proposed amendment was “nothing but an encroachment on provincial rights” and that it would not be tolerated at any cost.
He added that PTI considered itself the guardian of the Constitution and would continue to protect it.
KP CM to visit jail again today
Responding to questions about his repeated attempts to meet the PTI founder in jail, Mr Afridi expressed disappointment that the IHC’s facilitation orders had not been implemented and said his democratic right had been violated.
He announced that he would visit Adiala jail on Thursday (today), noting that meetings with Mr Khan were officially allowed on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
About the NFC Award, Mr Afridi said that KP’s share of 19.4 per cent must not be reduced.
He argued that KP had rendered the greatest sacrifices in the fight against terrorism, with many of its residents martyred, and that decreasing the province’s financial share would amount to ignoring those sacrifices.
Post on Imran’s X account
Meanwhile, a post issued from Imran Khan’s account on the social media platform X, reportedly based on comments shared by his sister, claimed that the rule of law no longer prevailed in the country. It remains unclear who currently operates Mr Khan’s account; however, he has never publicly disassociated himself from posts made in his name.
 






The post described the current leadership as presiding over a period of “oppression” and alleged that incidents such as those of May 9, 2023, and the recent events in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Muridke represented abuses of state authority.
In a message directed at supporters, the PTI founder stated that a nation which embraces the principle of “freedom or death” cannot be stopped from attaining true independence.
He said that legal counsel Salman Akram Raja would transmit all party-related instructions and ensure their implementation.
PTI to oppose 27th Amendment
Separately, PTI Central Infor­mation Secre­tary Sheikh Waqas Akram reaffirmed that the party would go to any extent to block the proposed 27th Constitution Amendment.
 
 

He alleged that a non-representative government was pushing the amendment to weaken provincial autonomy, politicise state institutions, curtail media freedom, restrict judicial independence, and concentrate power.
He said the PTI would not allow the government to undo provincial rights, undermine parliamentary authority, or compromise on judicial oversight, stating that such measures would be unacceptable.

On Monday, Washington circulated the document among several Council members, proposing a mandate of at least two years, until December 2027, along with the possibility of extensions.
Diplomats privy to developments told Dawn that President Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan is attached to the resolution that all UN Security Council members formally received on Tuesday afternoon.
The resolution, one source said, contains several ambiguities.
The draft does not seek a UN mandate for the proposed ISF, which will operate under the newly proposed Board of Peace.
The ISF is also expected to disarm Hamas, but will have no authority over Israeli military activities. The resolution also makes no reference to a “pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” although the concept is included in Trump’s 20-point plan.
Pakistan was among the parties that received the draft resolution last week, although it has not yet taken a public position on it. Even Indonesia has conveyed that it will not send troops to Gaza if the objective is “only to disarm Hamas”.
Jakarta, like the rest of the eight-nation Muslim bloc, is also seeking a UN mandate for the mission — if not for the force — and wants the UNSC to have a role.

• SAEP maintains it is not on strike, can’t issue clearance certificates at passengers’ expense
RAWALPINDI: The PIA on Wednesday managed to “partially restore its flight operations” amid a protest by aircraft engineers under the umbrella of the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP).
The tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP has been going on for three days over the safety of aircraft, causing delays in the departure of domestic and international flights at multiple major airports. On Wednesday, the PIA cancelled six flights to adjust the schedule of already delayed flights.
On Monday night, the aircraft engineers refused to issue clearance certificates to aircraft, and hundreds of passengers were stranded at different airports due to long delays in the flights, especially those scheduled for Saudi Arabia.
The PIA claimed that the engineers were on “strike” while the SAEP said that they were on duty but not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks. Against this backdrop, the PIA management called the SAEP president and general secretary for an inquiry on Tuesday, but they didn’t even show up on Wednesday.
A PIA spokesman confirmed that the two office-bearers were summoned by the PIA management for the final hearing as an investigation against them had been underway. The PIA will initiate legal action against them in line with the law, he explained. He said that PIA flight operations had been partially restored through alternative means, hoping that the situation would become normal very soon.
SAEP Secretary General Awais Jadoon said that they are on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances,” he explained.
He said that the engineers were not on strike, adding that they could not make compromises on the safety of travellers, as they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying.
When asked about their meeting with the PIA management, he explained that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them.

A parliamentary delegation of opposition parties led by Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, who has also been nominated as the opposition leader in the National Assembly, visited the JUI-F chief’s residence in Islamabad.
 






The delegation also included Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Allama Raja Nasir, who has been nominated as the leader of the opposition in the Senate, and PTI’s Asad Qaiser, the former speaker of the National Assembly.
A statement posted by the JUI-F on social media platform X said that the leaders discussed the prevailing political situation.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, Rehman warned those in power against making the Constitution a “plaything”. He said that a little over a year later, the government was pushing through another constitutional amendment in the same manner as before.
 
 

“When amendments are made under coercion, how can the people continue to have faith in the Constitution?” he questioned.
“My fear is that if this continues, public trust in the Constitution will be completely eroded,” he said. The JUI-F said that during deliberations on the 26th Constitutional Amendment, the government was “forced to withdraw 34 clauses that would have undermined key constitutional protections”.
“But now preparations are once again underway to do the same,” he lamented. He further said that the opposition had not yet received the draft of the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, questioning how the legislation could be tabled in Parliament in such a scenario.
“But opposition parties will develop a unified stance on it collectively,” he said. The Maulana further said that the political environment was deliberately being pushed towards confrontation.
“One minister has been working on this amendment for three months. It means that the contents of this amendment came from somewhere else,” the JUI-F chief alleged.
He also accused Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar of deceiving the people, saying that up until recently the PML-N leader had been saying that there was no need for another amendment.
Meanwhile, PTI’s Qaiser said that the JUI-F chief had supported Achakzai’s stance.
“We will look at the 27th Constitutional Amendment collectively. The opposition will be united in the House,” he said.
He further maintained that Achakzai should be notified as the leader of the opposition in the lower house of Parliament as soon as possible.
Speaking to Dawn prior to the meeting, MWM’s Nasir said that there were two main reasons behind the opposition’s criticism of the proposed amendment.
“First, the 26th Constitutional Amendment is currently under litigation and is considered a controversial document,” he pointed out.
“We also oppose the 27th Amendment because we do not know what it entails. How can we support something we are completely unaware of?” he asked. Nasir slammed the incumbent government, saying that it had made a mockery of the state, the democratic system and the nation by showing a lack of transparency.
The meeting of the opposition leaders came the same day that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that clarity on a consensus over the proposed 27th Constit­utional Amendment was expected within two to three days, after which the legislation was likely to be tabled in Parliament next week.
Earlier this week, the PPP said the government had sought its support for the proposed changes to the Constitution. According to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, proposals for this new amendment include setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, ending protection for provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces.
On Tuesday, Deputy PM Dar had confirmed the 27th Constitutional Amendment would be brought before Parliament “soon” but insisted it would not be rus­hed and denied “external hand” in the amendment.</p><small>2025-11-06 03:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/060753576b0f361.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953376/pakistan-among-nations-using-water-inefficiently' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan among nations using water ‘inefficiently’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan is one of six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use amid increasingly arid conditions, contributing to the annual global loss of 324 billion cubic metres of freshwater, according to the first edition of the global water monitoring report by World Bank.
The report, “Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future,” says about one-quarter of inefficient water consumption in rain-fed agriculture and one-third in irrigated agriculture are concentrated in regions experiencing declining freshwater availability.
These hot spots, where water inefficiency coincides with drying trends, are most pronounced in Western Asia, Eastern Europe, and North Africa.
On a national level, the highest share of inefficient agricultural water consumption under drying conditions is observed in Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Pakistan, Thailand, Tunisia and Romania, the report says.

WB report reveals world is losing 324 billion  cubic metres  of freshwater every year

Drawing on two decades of satellite data enhanced through new modelling techniques, the report provides an unprecedented view of how land and water management decisions are shaping water availability.
The past two decades have seen a global shift toward the cultivation of more water-intensive crops. Among drying countries, 37 have transitioned to more water-intensive agriculture, including 22 located in arid and semi-arid regions. This structural shift, coupled with inefficiency, further intensifies water demand in already water-stressed countries.
More than two-thirds of the inefficient irrigation in drying areas is linked to the cultivation of water-intensive crops, underscoring the need for smarter crop choices that align agricultural practices with water sustainability.
The report reveals that the world is losing 324 billion cubic metres of freshwater every year, enough to meet the needs of 280 million people annually. These losses are driven by worsening droughts and unsustainable practices, including poor pricing policies, weak coordination, deforestation and wetland degradation.
Global water use has risen 25 percent since 2000, with a third of that increase occurring in areas already drying out.

• Rahul hopes to repeat his UP success in Bihar with Lalu’s party
NEW DELHI: Two-stage state polls for the 243-seat Bihar assembly starting today (Thursday) are being seen as critical for the durability of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s minority government.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) party crucially shores up the Modi government, in which the BJP stands reduced to 240 seats from the 2024 general elections, well below the halfway mark of 272 in the Lok Sabha.
Mr Kumar’s JD(U) with 12 MPs and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu with 16 Telugu Desam MPs hold Mr Modi’s fate in their palms. Mr Modi, heading the ruling National Democ­ratic Alliance (NDA), has merely 21 MPs above a simple majority, and the two allies from Bihar and Andhra Prad­esh together add up to 28 MPs.
 
 

The NDA is widely seen as being held together in a quid pro quo arrangement whereby Mr Modi’s BJP supports the minority government of Nitish Kumar in Bihar, and he supports Mr Modi. Any setback to Mr Kumar’s hold over Bihar in the assembly polls — a scenario not being ruled out by pollsters — could adversely impact Mr Modi’s hold on Mr Kumar’s support for him. Mr Naidu too is a hard bargainer who began his political career as a Youth Congress leader.
However, much more is making the Bihar state polls on Nov 6 and 11 so crucial for everyone in the fray.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi made a significant comeback for his party in 2024, a gain that elevated him as the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha. But the laurels were won in lockstep with allies, chiefly in Uttar Pradesh where, together with the Samajwadi Party, the Congress was able to pare down Mr Modi’s numbers drastically.
Uttar Pradesh was principally responsible for the BJP’s loss of majority under Mr Modi’s watch. Rahul Gandhi is hoping for an encore, to upset the BJP in Bihar, this with the alliance he has formed with former chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav’s son. To their advantage, Bihar is the only Hindi-speaking state where the BJP has not been able to take power from its allies.
The question is, given the dire threats and pressures on both sides, would the BJP allow the opposition to gain the leg up. Mr Gandhi not for the first time may have put the finger on the nub of the matter. He has accused the election commission of working in cahoots with and for the BJP to steal the Bihar election.
 
 

He asserts this with the support of what appears to be the election commission’s fudged voters lists in recent state polls in Haryana where the Congress was unexpectedly trounced and in Maharashtra, where a Congress alliance was allegedly robbed of victory, were rigged with the connivance of the election commission.
The core of the charge concerns the excessively powerful election body’s drive to carry out a nationwide Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter’s list like the one that was carried out amid controversy in poll-bound Bihar. Mr Modi had changed the rules for nominating the election commissioner thereby giving himself a freehand to choose his man.
The opposition alleges that the election commission is helping the BJP by deleting voters perceived to be opposed to the BJP, primarily Muslims. The issue has galvanised opposition governments in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala who have joined hands with the Congress to widen the allegation into a movement.
The most threatened by any arbitrary act to tweak the voter’s list is West Bengal where the Mamata Bannerjee government enjoys more than a handy support of Muslims. Curiously, the BJP-ruled states of Assam and Tripura have been left out of the coming round of revision of the voter’s list. Opposition has cried foul over the exclusion.
So, what is going to happen in Bihar? Its caste arithmetic is as crucial as it is murky. The state abuts Nepal with which it shares an open border. Recent events in the landlocked country are being watched in Bihar. Gen Z voters are at the heart of this election campaign in Bihar: the state has India’s largest proportion of youth population.
“Nearly 58 per cent of Bihar’s population is under 25 years of age and hence belong to the Generation Z cohort,” says The Wire. “In terms of voters, one in every four voters is a Gen Z. Of them, 1.47 million are first-time voters.”

According to a quarterly report released by the Power Division, the new fiscal year began with Rs1.614tr, compared with Rs2.467tr in the same period last year. It said payables to power producers increased to Rs944bn at the close of September, up from Rs861bn at the start of the fiscal year on July 1. The payables to power producers had amounted to Rs1.688tr as of end-September last year.
The report said past debt parked in the Power Holding Company of the Power Division remained unchanged at Rs660bn during the first quarter of the fiscal year. It stood at Rs683bn by the end of the first quarter last year.
The power division reported that circular debt increased by more than Rs170bn due to inefficiencies and inadequate bill recovery by the Distribution Companies (Discos). However, this was significantly lower than the Rs239bn under the same account and period of the last fiscal year.

Power Division blames Rs79bn rise on inefficiencies, seasonal factors

The report showed that circular debt had increased by Rs73bn in the first quarter of last year, compared to Rs79bn this year. This was despite the fact that the finance ministry had disbursed Rs19bn in budgeted subsidies, compared to Rs28bn in unreleased subsidies during the same period last year. This was on top of Rs178bn in additional recoveries from consumers due to prior-year adjustments.
Excluding the above Rs198bn in additional funds from subsidies and prior-year adjustments, the circular debt would have increased by Rs276bn on account of Rs67bn in interest charges, Rs5bn in pending generation costs, Rs87bn due to distribution companies’ inefficiencies, and Rs84bn in under-recoveries.
The report claimed Rs229bn in receivables from K-Electric as of end-September 2025, including a principal amount of Rs42bn and about Rs187bn in markup.
 
 

The power division in a statement, however, tried to dispel the impression caused by its own report that an increase in circular debt by Rs79bn in the first quarter of the new fiscal year was a renewed upward trend, contrary to the government’s commitment to contain circular debt accumulation.
A Power Division spokesperson said the increase of Rs79bn in the first quarter “should be viewed in full context”. It said during the same quarter last year, circular debt had increased by Rs73bn, but by the end of that fiscal year, the overall stock of circular debt was reduced by Rs780bn. “The current quarterly rise is therefore attributable to seasonal and operational factors that typically influence monthly flows and are expected to reverse over the course of the year,” he said.
Importantly, Disco’s inefficiencies (losses and low recoveries) during July-September were reduced by Rs67bn to Rs171bn, compared to Rs239bn in the same period last year, underscoring the government’s firm commitment to improving operational performance and maintaining financial discipline in the power sector.

People were stuck in traffic jams for hours during the peak evening rush after the main thoroughfare of MA Jinnah road near Numaish Chowrangi was closed by police for security reasons.
The city’s traffic police had announced different diversions after the closure of the route, leading to traffic chaos, prompting Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to take notice.
Karachi Traffic Police (KTP) Deputy Inspector General Pir Mohammed Shah told Dawn that all traffic officers were present on the roads.
He said a portion of the main MA Jinnah road was closed for traffic, which had caused the traffic jam.
The city traffic police chief admitted that the citizens were facing immense inconvenience due to gridlocks. He said the roads near Numaish Chowrangi were closed for traffic because of security reasons, and diversions were provided to the citizens for the smooth flow of traffic.
CM Shah directed Karachi’s additional inspector general of police to restore the flow of traffic. “Traffic police should be activated immediately for restoration of the traffic flow,” he said, and summoned a situation report.
CM Shah warned officers of strict action if the traffic flow was not restored.
“Wherever there is a traffic jam, responsible officers will face action,” he declared, directing timely action for the convenience of the general public.</p><small>2025-11-05 17:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632266-pakistan-develops-jamming-gun-to-counter-cross-border-suicide-drones' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan develops jamming gun to counter cross-border suicide drones</strong></a><br><p>
