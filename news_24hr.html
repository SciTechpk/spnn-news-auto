In a rare display of unity and resolve, Mehsuds of Upper South Waziristan convened a jirga in Makin tehsil to discuss deteriorating law and order and seek their constitutional rights.
The jirga drew thousands of participants not only from Upper South Waziristan but also from North Waziristan and Lower South Waziristan including tribal elders, political workers, lawyers, journalists and students.
MPAs Asif Khan Mehsud and Ajab Gul Wazir, MNA Zubair Khan Wazir, former MNA Maulana Jamaluddin, former senator Saleh Shah and mayor Shah Faisal Ghazi also attended the jirga. Leaders of major political parties including Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Pakistan Peoples Party, Jamaat-i-Islami, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, and Pashtun Tahafuz Movement were also among the participants of the jirga.

Mehsud jirga calls for halt to military operations; demands crackdown on criminals

The participants of the jirga expressed grave concerns over deteriorating security conditions in merged districts, particularly in three districts of Waziristan. They said that increasing incidents of targeted killings, kidnapping for ransom, bomb blasts and other acts of violence left civilians vulnerable.
They said that clashes between security forces and militants often resulted in civilian casualties and widespread displacement. They termed indiscriminate mortar shelling, forced evacuations and collateral damage to civilians as gross violation of human rights and deviation from state’s constitutional responsibilities.
Through a unanimous resolution, the jirga demanded immediate and effective action by state institutions including federal and provincial governments and security forces to normalise situation. The resolution called for a halt to military operations and shelling on civilian areas. It demanded crackdown on criminal elements, respectful engagement with tribal communities and launch of sustainable development initiatives in the area.
Speakers said that tribal people had always been patriotic citizens of Pakistan. Casting suspicion on their intentions or subjecting them to perpetual scrutiny under the pretext of security concerns was unjust and discriminatory, they added.
The jirga urged the state to integrate tribal people with dignity into national mainstream and ensure their inclusion in decision-making process to promote long-term peace and national cohesion.
The jirga was convened to discuss the worsening security situation in Upper and Lower South Waziristan as well as North Waziristan during the last one year. The residents of the region say that they face severe threats to life and livelihood, with markets deserted, schools closed and economic activities paralysed. They say that thousands of families live under constant psychological and financial stress.
The participant of the jirga said that they would no longer remain silent if their legitimate demands were ignored. They said that they would peacefully raise their voice at all available democratic and constitutional platforms.

It also said that a woman and her son were injured in Botigrama in Sirikot area due to roof collapse during torrential rains in the last 24 hours.
The PDMA also reported damage to 22 houses due to downpour in several districts.
In an advisory issued to deputy commissioners across the province, the PDMA said that the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had informed that moist currents were penetrating most parts of the region and were likely to intensify in the next couple of days.
It said that a westerly wave was also expected to approach on July 13 (evening night) and under the influence of these meteorological conditions, rain with thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds with isolated and scattered heavy falls at times very heavy were expected in Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Buner, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan, Kolai Pallas Kohistan, Torghar, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Hangu, Bannu, Karak, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank, North and South Waziristan from July 11 to 17 with occasional gaps.
According to it, heavy to very heavy rains could generate flash floods in local nullah/streams of Galiyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Kolai-Palas Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Bajaur, Battagram, Buner, Hangu, Torghar, Haripur, Karak, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Khyber, Kohat, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Peshawar, Shangla, Kurram, Lakki Marwat, Malakand, Mansehra, Mohmand, Orakzai, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu and Tank during the period.

Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur formally inaugurated the initiative during an event at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat here, according to an official statement.
The event was also attended by adviser to the CM on finance Muzammil Aslam, adviser to the CM on health Ihtisham Ali, additional chief secretary (P&D) Ikramullah Khan, additional chief secretary (home) Abid Majeed, health secretary Shahidullah Khan, senior officials from the health department and representatives of international partner organisations.
The chief minister said that the provincial government was working with renewed commitment to eradicate poliovirus from the province.

CM says achieving targets challenging, not impossible

“Alongside polio eradication efforts, special attention is also being given to protecting children from other diseases. For this purpose, an action plan has been developed to strengthen the immunisation programme,” he said.
The chief minister said it was not just an action plan, but a clear reflection of the provincial government’s commitment to eliminating polio.
He said that the real task was on-ground implementation of the action plan, so all relevant departments, institutions and district administrations should ensure its full and effective execution.
Mr Gandapur said that although achieving the targets of the action plan was challenging, it was not impossible.
He said with better teamwork, determination and hard work, those targets could be accomplished.
The chief minister said Rs8 billion was allocated in the current fiscal year’s budget for the immunisation programme.
“We are also deeply grateful to our development partners for their generous support and continued collaboration in this shared mission to safeguard the wellbeing of our children,” he said, pledging the elimination of polio and deadly diseases from the province.
On the rationale behind the IAP, chief secretary Shahab Ali Shah said that the province had the lowest immunisation coverage in the country, with the southern districts posing challenges to vaccination efforts.
He described the target as ambitious yet attainable in light of the enhanced institutional capacity and resources.
The chief secretary emphasised a focused and coordinated approach to ensure that every child whether living in urban areas or remote rural communities was reached through the plan.
During a detailed presentation at the event, officials said currently, 55 per cent of children in the province were fully immunised, leaving a large number at risk, while the new IAP sought to close that gap by vaccinating approximately 1.42 million children under the age of two every year.
The list of diseases on target included diphtheria, tetanus, mumps, hepatitis B, pertussis, rotavirus, rubella, polio, meningitis, pneumonia, typhoid and measles.
The IAP outlined an eight-point strategy to ensure no child is left behind, with special focus on underserved and hard-to-reach areas. A central element of the strategy involves comprehensive outreach to all mapped communities, including those in security, compromised or geographically remote locations.
Officials said operational capacity had been enhanced through a significant increase in dedicated transportation budgets expanding from Rs80 million to Rs448 million over three years, enabling field teams to reach distant and rural communities with consistency.
They said the plan focused on upgrading over 1,800 fixed immunisation sites across the province, including basic health units, rural health centres and hospitals.
The officials said those facilities were being equipped with trained staff, complete stocks of essential vaccines, working cold chain equipment and a 15-day buffer supply of syringes to prevent disruption in service delivery.
They said in urban and semi-urban districts that showed low coverage rates, targeted immunisation drives would be launched.
The first such campaign is scheduled to begin in Peshawar, with an aim to identify, digitise and vaccinate every missed child in the area.
In order to ensure results and accountability, the action plan incorporates strong governance mechanisms. Monthly and quarterly performance monitoring will be based on reliable data indicators, such as vaccinator performance, geographic outreach, and site functionality.
Also, third-party coverage assessments will be conducted every six months to validate government data and identify underserved populations, according to IAP.
It added that in parallel, a survey across the province was being carried out to understand behavioral barriers that prevent families from seeking immunisation services.
The plan said the findings would inform future communication strategies tailored to address disparities across gender, geography and socioeconomic status.
According to it, this comprehensive approach, driven by digital data, community engagement and field-level monitoring, represents a turning point in the province’s public health efforts.
“With political commitment at the top and mechanisms in place for delivery at the grassroots, the government is now focused on translating its promises into measurable impact,” said the IAP.

According to SBP data released on Thursday, the central bank’s reserves rose primarily on the back of official inflows, though no specific breakdown was provided.
Bankers said the SBP purchased over $8bn from the interbank market during FY25, supported by record-high remittances of $38.3bn.
These inflows were primarily driven by incentives offered to banks on transactions from overseas Pakistanis. However, the government is now considering scrapping these incentives, though no final decision has been made.
The central bank also maintained a tight grip on dollar outflows throughout the year, particularly during the final quarter, frustrating importers who struggled to secure foreign exchange. This control on imports, combined with heavy dollar buying, led to a shortage that gradually pushed the exchange rate upward.
Some bankers noted that to attract more remittances, banks were offering higher rates to overseas senders — exceeding official dollar quotes — to capitalise on per-transaction incentives.
The dollar’s appreciation in the local market continued on Thursday. The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan reported the interbank rate at Rs284.76, up 10 paise from the previous day, while the open market rate rose 50 paise to Rs287.50.
This rise came despite the US dollar weakening globally against major currencies, with the greenback slipping further from a two-week high on Thursday.
Currency analysts believe the SBP’s reserve build-up could continue in FY26, potentially reaching $20bn. However, this would depend on sustained remittance inflows, rollover of a significant portion of external debt, and smooth relations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Pakistan faced little difficulty in securing commercial loans during FY25, largely due to its continued participation in the IMF programme — a factor expected to sustain investor confidence and ease access to external financing.
As of July 4, the country’s total foreign exchange reserves stood at $20.028bn, including $5.526bn held by commercial banks, according to SBP data.

They added that Areeba, 16, died from torture in the D-1 area near Madina Masjid.
Khokhrapar SHO Allah Bachayo told Dawn that her body was found dumped in a street within the congested and impoverished neighbourhood.
He said the teenage girl had prepared lunch for her father at home of her uncle. She was reportedly taking the meal to him when she was kidnapped and killed in the same neighbourhood.
The officer said there were three or four houses in the street, with one under construction.
The police searched the under-construction building and found one of her slippers. Her father recognised it to be his daughter’s footwear.
During a further search, the meal (porridge) she had prepared was also found discarded at the scene.
Three suspects had been detained for interrogation, the officer said. He added that there were torture marks on her body.
The girl had been strangled with a scarf, which was found wrapped around her neck, he added.
He said the body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.
The officer said her parents had separated around some six years ago.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that a post-mortem examination report was awaited.
Man killed ‘by brother’
A man was allegedly killed by his brother in Patel Para on Thursday evening, police said. They added that Dilawar, 40, was stabbed to death by his brother Jehangir inside a house.
Jamshed Quarters SHO Anser Ahmed Butt told Dawn that the deceased was preparing tea in the kitchen when his brother attacked him with a knife. The suspect, along with the knife, managed to escape from the scene.

However, implementation has been slow and fragmented, resulting in delays and setbacks. Judicial oversight offers a mechanism to bridge this gap by ensuring compliance, accountability and institutional coordination.
Judicial activism in Pakistan refers to the assertive role played by the higher courts in interpreting the Constitution, expanding the scope of fundamental rights, and intervening in matters traditionally reserved for the executive or legislature. This has enabled the courts to address various social and environmental issues that lack adequate government attention. Courts have recently adopted a progressive interpretation of Article 9 (right to life) and Article 14 (dignity of man) to include access to clean water, air, healthcare and a healthy environment. This approach has brought environmental concerns and climate change impacts under the ambit of constitutional rights.
The expansion of public interest litigation and the exercise of suo motu powers under Article 184(3) of the Constitution have empowered the judiciary to act on issues of public importance without waiting for formal complaints. These tools have enabled civil society and citizens to raise environmental concerns directly before the courts.
As climate threats intensify, the gap between policy and implementation will become starker, putting millions at risk due to delayed action. At a time when the global order is becoming increasingly anarchical, weak climate governance can lead to chaos and disorder. For Pakistan, this is particularly dangerous due to its geography and heavy reliance on a river system fed largely by snow and glacial melt. The lack of coherence and clarity between federal and provincial responsibilities exacerbates the situation, while the growing gap between demand and supply of essential resources for a burgeoning population worsens the crisis.
The country is heading towards a serious crisis with no bailout plan for the most vulnerable. Past judgements have acknowledged the disproportionate impacts of climate change on the vulnerable, reinforcing the concept of environmental justice. It is time for the courts to step in to safeguard long-term climate goals by issuing binding decisions to protect environmental and climate commitments from being undermined by political changes or short-term interests. The judiciary can enforce timelines, require periodic reporting and conduct regular hearings to monitor institutional performance. This will give public agencies a strong incentive to implement climate measures and improve interdepartmental coordination.
Judicial oversight can also reveal structural weaknesses and recommend improvements in legal frameworks, technical cap­acity and institutional mandates. One entry point is the management of protected parks, forests and biodiversity hotspots. The blatant disregard for conservation rules in national parks and guzara forests highlights the need for judicial activism to promote constitutionalism, transparency and accountability in environmental protection. Guzara forests owned by the community and managed by the forest department run the risk of becoming a new breeding ground of exploitation and environmental degradation if not protected by law.

It is time the courts stepped in to safeguard climate goals.

The Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP), which falls under the administrative jurisdiction of the Islamabad Capital Territory, can serve as a case study and model for harmonising policy with implementation as well as development with nature. Straddling KP and Punjab, the ICT presents a unique opportunity for addressing issues related to land use in adjacent areas, including guzara forests, and their long-term impact on national parks. Developing a governance framework that considers the strategic impact of land use around fragile ecosystems can serve as a blueprint for managing both protected and surrounding lands.
A successful intervention in MHNP can be replicated provincially to conserve ecological assets and restore degraded ecosystems using nature-based solutions in line with Pakistan’s NDCs. Every habitat damaged or destroyed contributes to microclimatic changes, altering its immediate and broader environment.
As the crisis deepens, the judiciary must play a key role in narrowing the implementation gap by enforcing legal obligations, protecting citizen rights and driving institutional reform. Its continued engagement — balanced with respect for democratic institutions — is vital for achieving sustainable, rights-based climate action in Pakistan.

Finally, some prominent public figures are expressing concerns about this issue. The health minister, in his budget speech, claimed that rapid population growth poses a greater problem than health. The finance minister has repeatedly identified climate change and rapid population growth as twin existential threats facing Pakistan. The minister for planning and development has remarked that we have hit the accelerator on population growth instead of pulling the brakes.
The Parliamentary Forum on Population, a cross-party initiative, has strongly supported the idea of tabling a resolution in the National Assembly to restore the balance between rapid population growth and available resources. Meanwhile, the media, though preoccupied with politics, now seems more willing to discuss population issues, particularly during prime time talk shows. The fear of backlash has diminished, leading to greater openness about this previously undiscussed topic.
A significant policy announcement was the Punjab chief minister’s approval of merging the population welfare and health departments. This merger aims to enhance service delivery by eliminating duplicate service structures. Sindh boasts an outstanding minister overseeing both population welfare and health.
Has the moment we have been waiting for finally arrived? Has it come too late compared to the rest of the developing world, leaving us decades behind? Should we now seize the moment? The answers to all three questions are yes.

On World Population Day today, we must reflect on how other states managed their populations.

The signals of distress from those who can effect change will only matter if they are followed by action. First and foremost, reducing population growth is not a top-down mandate and definitely not about population control. It is about managing the needs and rights of the people of Pakistan, not infringing upon their fundamental right to decide family sizes. Policies and programmes aimed at lowering population growth rates will be effective only if people are equipped with information and given the opportunity to make rational choices.
The new population narrative of ‘tawazzun’, fully endorsed by the Council of Islamic Ideology, emphasises recreating the balance between dwindling resources and a rapidly increasing population as a means of ensuring the rights of current and future citizens. The state has the responsibility of providing opportunities for education and employment for young adults, for women who face health risks from unplanned pregnancies, and for newborns to survive their first day of life.
We must learn from countries like Indonesia, Bangladesh and Iran, which successfully managed their populations and maintained human development goals as the rationale for lowering growth rates decades ago. Decades ago, they utilised population management to deliberately build healthier and more educated future generations through investments in voluntary family planning services and campaigns.
Pakistan’s realities have changed after the 18th Amendment, yet one reason for our stagnation is the lack of national consensus on our position reg­arding rapid population growth; there has been a lack of clarity about whether it is a positive or negative factor for Pakistan’s present and future well-being. The prime minister must publicly dec­lare the government’s position. A strong federal role, without encroaching on provincial authority, must be established. Forming a ‘Pop­u­lation and Development Commission’, headed by the prime minister and including all chief ministers, could set policy and ensure financing support, especially for under-resourced provinces and regions.
The provinces bear the primary responsibility for improving access to family planning services, particularly for poorer families. An eclectic effort is required to address the needs of millions facing unplanned pregnancies across Pakistan. A 2023 Population Council study found that 46 per cent of pregnancies in Pakistan are unplanned or mistimed, with this proportion unchanged since 2012. Millions of unplanned births could have been prevented if access to family planning had been expanded over the past decade.
Social protection programmes, such as BISP, have huge potential to reach the poorest families in remote areas, subsidising their access to services. This approach has proved effective in Punjab and should also be extended to poorer regions. We must incorporate family planning into the social protection package as a pro-poor policy. Ironically, both Mamta in Sindh and Agosh in Punjab are social protection programmes that focus solely on pregnancy care without leveraging the opportunity to provide family planning advice and services to non-pregnant and younger women.
Focusing on population management in silos will not be effective. Empowering women is necessary and critically important for helping families achieve their desired family size. No country with a low gender parity index can expect progress in social or economic indicators. Women must be empowered to make critical decisions about their children and their own lives. Women and girls lack decision-making power in most aspects of their lives. For instance, most women and girls want to work, and yet only a small minority are able to do so.
Pakistan’s female labour force participation rate has stagnated at 24pc for many years. It is high time to change this by announcing incentives for employers and female quotas in the workplace. Even symbolic announcements prioritising women would signal a shift in public policy.
Similarly, efforts to improve public education cannot be overlooked. We are lagging behind with stagnating or even declining school enrolment rates. It is not surprising that key health indicators like infant and child mortality that are closely linked to female education, have hardly shown improvement in the last decade.
Finally, key stakeholders have recognised that the significant weight of 82pc assigned to population numbers in the NFC award has had a pernicious impact. Addressing the NFC formula’s population weightage is crucial to avoid skewed census results driven by the political leadership’s desire for a larger share of the common pool and assembly seats. At the same time, reducing the NFC allocation does not guarantee services, especially for the poorest. Alternative resource-allocation mechanisms are needed to incentivise provinces to invest in more funding towards reducing infant and maternal mortality and fertility through high-quality, voluntary family planning services.
We must immediately seize the moment — our foremost priority must be to fulfil the fundamental rights and aspirations of the people.

Months after serious investors had shied away from bidding for the national flag carrier, they now appear ready to put down their money for one of the state’s most financially troubled assets. The resumption of PIA’s flight operations to Europe after the EU lifted a four-year safety ban, its return to profitability and, importantly, the undisclosed assurances given by the authorities to address investors’ concerns over inconsistent policies, the company’s legacy issues, taxes, etc, seem to have done the trick.
The government has approved four parties to potentially bid for a 51-100pc stake in the airline. The pre-qualified bidders will proceed with the buy-side due diligence of the company, which may last between two to three months and lead to final bidding towards the end of the year. The prospective buyers, most of whom have formed consortiums to make joint bids, come from a diverse range of business backgrounds: fertilisers, real estate, power generation, cement, aviation, financial services, etc. It will be the first significant sale of an SOE since a Supreme Court decision suspended the sale of the Pakistan Steel Mills two decades ago — unless the deal falls through for some reason.
Successive governments have advocated privatisation of publicly owned businesses for ensuring market development, strengthening competition, encouraging innovation and attracting private investments. Yet most have pursued it only under pressure from the country’s international creditors or as a means to raise funds to finance their deficits rather than as a policy decision to reduce the government’s footprint in the economy. The current exercise is also driven by pressures from the IMF. Hence, the likelihood of another pause in the sale of the other SOEs is hard to rule out once the PIA deal goes through.
That said, the fruits of the current privatisation push for the economy cannot be reaped without effective policy and regulatory reforms, removal of legal and institutional weaknesses, transparency, etc. The sale of state-run businesses to reduce the burden on the budget is only a short-term goal; the long-term one should be to encourage domestic and foreign private investment.
Previously, we have seen that privatisation has paid dividends when the process is accompanied by structural and governance reforms. The banking and telecom industries are two prominent instances of this success.
The enhanced investor interest in PIA is largely attributed to the SIFC’s ‘support’ for the process. While it does give the privatisation authorities a much-needed head-start, it will not be sustainable unless preceded by policy and regulatory reforms. The absence of foreign investors despite the SIFC in the PIA privatisation effort underscores this observation.

The team arrived on July 8 for a th­­­ree-day aviation security inspection.
Accompanied by a representative of the British High Commission, the UK team began its assessment with an inaugural meeting attended by the Chief Security Officer and all relevant airport stakeholders.
“All aviation security stakeholders including PAA officials, ASF personnel, and representatives from PIA, British Airways, Air Blue, Kitchen Cuisine, Ras Menzies and others attended the initial briefing,” the PCAA said.

Saudi auditors to assess seven major airports next month

The inspection focused on security deployment, internal controls, scre­ening procedures, issuance of passes, vehicle and staff checks, CCTV operations, perimeter security, deployment of quick response forces, drone arrangements, and the ASF’s emergency response capabilities.
The team also reviewed catering and flight operations.
At the conclusion of the visit, the UK inspectors commended the efforts of the Airports Security Force to ensure safe air travel.
Saudi visit soon
Meanwhile, a Saudi aviation security team is scheduled to conduct a security audit of seven major Pakistani airports—including Isla­mabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Faisalabad, Sialkot, and Multan—starting in August, according to PCAA spokesperson Shahid Qadir.
“Director General of Saudi Ara­bia’s General Authority of Civil Av­­iation (GACA) has approached Pa­­kistan’s DG PCAA, Nadir Shafi Dar, to conduct an aviation security au­­dit of seven Pakistani airports,” PCAA spokesperson Shahid Qadir said. “A Saudi aviation security team will visit Pakistan in August and October to conduct the audit,” he added.
The Saudi team will coordinate closely with the Directorate of Aviation Security (AvSec) of the PCAA, which will host the visiting delegation.  The audits come as Pakistan’s civil aviation sector shows marked improvement in international benchmarks.
Pakistan achieved a score of 86.73 per cent in the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s Uni­versal Security Audit Programme (USAP), significantly higher than the global average of 71pc and India’s 73pc, according to the CAA.
Direct US flights
PCAA Director General Nadir Shafi Dar, a veteran aviation specialist, has also initiated engagement with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in pursuit of direct flight operations to the United States.
The move follows the recent restoration of flights to the European Union and progress toward re-entry into the United Kingdom’s aviation network.

• Govt accused of overlooking more than 2,000 crimes committed against religious minorities
DHAKA: Bangladesh’s former police chief pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity committed during a crackdown on protests last year, while ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina was formally indicted, prosecutors said after the trial resumed Thursday.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024, according to the United Nations, when Hasina’s government attem­pted to crush a student-led uprising.
Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is prosecuting former senior figures connected to Ha­­sina’s ousted government and her now-banned party, the Awami League.
Former inspector general of police (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Mamun “pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity”, Muhammad Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor at the ICT, told reporters.
Islam said Mamun has agreed to assist the court by acting as a witness, giving “all the knowledge he has regarding the crimes committed during the July-August uprising”.
The court has approved separate accommodation to ensure Mamun’s safety. The tribunal on Thursday also rejected defence lawyers’ requ­est to have the charges against Hasi­­na and her interior minister Asaduz­zaman Khan Kamal dismissed.
Both Hasina and Kamal were formally indicted in the same case.
Amir Hossain, the state-appointed counsel for Hasina and Kamal, however, remained hopeful.
“The trial is at an initial stage, and there are several other phases,” he said.
Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to India as the protests ended her 15-year rule. She has defied an ext­radition order to return to Dhaka, where her trial in absentia opened on June 1. Hasina faces at least five charges at the ICT, including “abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy and failure to prevent mass murder during the July uprising”.
Prosecutors say that Hasina held overall command responsibility for the violence.
She was already convicted of contempt of court in a separate case on July 2, receiving a six-month sentence. Fugitive former minister Kamal is also believed to be in India.
Attacks on religious minorities
A rights group in Bangladesh accused the government on Thursday of overlooking more than 2,000 crimes committed against religious minorities in the country and excluding them from reforms.
The Hindu-Buddhist-Christian Unity Council has been voicing concern over targeted attacks on religious minorities since the fall of ousted former premier Sheikh Hasina last year.
“We have recorded 2,442 incid­ents from August 4 last year to June 30 this year, involving murders, rapes and gang rapes, vandalism of temples, homes, and businesses,” Monindra Kumar Nath, general secretary of the council, told a news conference.
The council alleged such attacks have continued even after the int­e­rim government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus took charge of the Muslim-majority country of 170 million people.
His administration has often dismissed the accusations, saying the crimes against minorities are politically motivated, the victims believed to have supported Hasina’s Awami League party in the past.
“Instead of giving due attention to our concerns, the government chose to label them as false, fabricated, and exaggerated,” Nath said, alleging the accused were “enjoying impunity”.
The unity council criticised the government for excluding religious minorities from any of the reform commissions tasked with proposing measures to end all forms of discrimination in the society.

• Rubio voices optimism over potential ceasefire
GAZA CITY: Gaza’s civil defence agency on Thursday said at least 52 people, including eight children, were killed by Israeli forces in the Palestinian territory battered by more than 21 months of war.
The latest deadly strikes and gunfire came just hours after Hamas, which runs Gaza, announced it was willing to release 10 prisoners as part of indirect ceasefire talks with Israel.
Civil defence official Mohammad al-Mughair told AFP that 17 people were killed in a strike in front of a medical point in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza.
 
 

Mughair said eight children and two women were killed in the strike.
Yousef Al-Aydi, 30, said he was among dozens of people, mostly women and children, waiting for nutritional supplements in front of the medical point.
“Suddenly, we heard the sound of a drone approaching, and then the explosion happened,” he told AFP by phone.
“The ground shook beneath our feet, and everything around us tur­ned into blood and deafening screams.”
“What was our fault? What was the fault of the children?” asked Mohammed Abu Ouda, 35, who had also been waiting for supplies.
“I saw a mother hugging her child on the ground, both motionless — they were killed instantly.”
Four people were killed and several injured in a pre-dawn air strike on a family home in Al-Bureij camp in central Gaza, Mughair added.
AFP footage from Al-Bureij showed a family including three young children sitting among rubble outside their tattered tent after an air strike hit a house next door.
Mughair reported 27 more people killed in bombardments across the territory, including 15 people in five separate strikes in the area of Gaza City.
One person was killed southwest of the southern city of Khan Yunis by “Israeli military fire”, Mughair said.
Three more, including a woman, were killed by Israeli gunfire on civilians near an aid centre in the northwest of nearby Rafah, he added.
More than 600 people have been killed around aid distributions and convoys in Gaza since late May, when Israel began allowing in a trickle of supplies, the United Nations said in early July.
Sticking point
Hamas on Thursday said it opposes any ceasefire deal that includes a large Israeli military presence in Gaza, after offering to release some prisoners.
Indirect negotiations aimed at securing a truce in Gaza between Hamas and Israel entered their fifth day in Qatar on Thursday, an official with knowledge of the talks told AFP.
The current negotiations — taking place after 21 months of fighting and multiple previous rounds of talks that failed to yield a breakthrough — began in the capital Doha on Sunday in hopes of clinching a deal based on a US-backed framework that envisages an initial 60-day truce.
“Hamas and Israel remain in Qatar,” the official said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of talks.
Hamas said disagreements over the free flow of aid into Gaza and Israel’s military withdrawal were sticking points, as were its demands for “real guarantees” for a lasting peace.
Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim told AFP on Thursday: “We cannot accept the perpetuation of the occupation of our land and the surrender of our people to isolated enclaves under the control of the occupation army (Israel).
“This is what the negotiating delegation is presenting to the occupation so far in the current round of negotiations in Doha.”
Hamas was particularly opposed to Israeli control over Rafah, on the border with Egypt, and the so-called Morag Corridor between the southern city and Khan Yunis, he added.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was “hopeful” about the prospect of a ceasefire in Gaza, telling reporters on Thursday that negotiations were “closer” than they had been in some time.
“We’re hopeful… It appears that generally the terms have been agreed to, but obviously now you need to have talks about how you implement those terms,” Rubio said on the sidelines of a meeting of Southeast Asian countries in Malaysia.
“I think perhaps we’re closer than we’ve been in quite a while, and we’re hopeful, but we also recognise there are still some challenges in the way.”
He acknowledged that previous rounds of talks had fallen apart at similar stages. “One of the fundamental challenges is Hamas’ unwillingness to disarm, which would end this conflict immediately,” Rubio said.
The top US diplomat added that “the Israelis have shown some flexibility”.

The prime minister, while chairing a review meeting on the NTC’s performance, instructed a third-party review of its recent performance and remodelling the organisation on modern lines to meet the requirements of the new tariff regime effectively.
The premier said the government was committed to addressing the NTC’s training and resource deficiencies and aligning its operations with modern requirements. He directed the immediate activation of the NTC’s Appellate Tribunal and sought a briefing on the implementation of the given directives by the next month.
E-commerce push with Alibaba
In a separate meeting with a six-member delegation of Alibaba Group, led by Alibaba International Markets President James Dong, Prime Minister Shehbaz underscored the strategic importance of e-commerce for Pakistan’s export-driven economic vision and directed the formation of a dedicated committee to devise a roadmap for the sector’s growth.

Directs overhaul of PNSC, formation of committee to boost e-commerce

The prime minister highlighted that over 300,000 locally manufactured Pakistani products are currently being sold on Alibaba’s platforms and emphasised the need to increase this number substantially. He called for proactive engagement with the private sector to enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to access international markets through digital platforms.
 
 

Mr Dong praised the contributions of Pakistani entrepreneurs in global trade and reiterated Alibaba’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s e-commerce ecosystem. “Currently, more than 300,000 Pakistani products are listed on Alibaba’s website, with textiles being the most in-demand category,” he noted.
PNSC restructuring
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz directed the relevant authorities to formulate a comprehensive plan to transform the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) into a shipping company of international standard.
Presiding over a meeting to review the restructuring, reforms and performance of the PNSC, he said that the country’s shipping sector held vast potential for investment. He directed that a comprehensive plan be prepared to encourage private investment in the shipping sector. He also called for steps to increase the number of ships and promote the competitive use of PNSC vessels for cargo movement to and from Pakistan.
Meeting with Qatari princess
Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz met Sheikha Asma Al Thani, the pioneering Qatari mountaineer, and congratulated her on becoming the first woman in the Gulf and Qatar to successfully summit Nanga Parbat, the world’s ninth-highest mountain.
The prime minister lauded Sheikha Asma’s remarkable courage, resilience and determination in achieving this significant milestone, the PM Office said in a statement.
In recognition of her achievement and commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s natural beauty, the PM formally appointed Sheikha Asma as the Brand Ambassador for Pakistan’s Mountains and Tourism.
The PM highlighted Pakistan’s immense pride in being home to five of the world’s 14 highest peaks, making it a premier destination for mountaineers and adventure seekers.
He thanked Sheikha Asma for promoting Pakistan’s mountain ranges on the international stage and invited her to return for future expeditions. She has al­­ready summited nine of the world’s 8,000-metre peaks and aims to climb all 14.
Sheikha Asma expressed her gratitude to the people of Pakistan for their hospitality and praised the support of local porters and guides during her recent ascent. Reflecting on her experience, she described K2 as the best peak and said that it is a “complete mountain” with its beauty unparalleled.

• Claims Rs191bn saved in FY25 as power losses dip due to governance reforms
• Govt eyes 6,000MW surplus supply for crypto, data centres
ISLAMABAD: The Power Division is making another attempt to convince the federal cabinet to curtail returns on solar net metering and remove electricity duty on consumer bills being resisted by the provinces.
Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Power Minister Awais Leghari said he would be presenting a revised plan to the federal cabinet in a week or two based on consultations with some stakeholders to stagger the recovery of investment on net metering to two to three years from the current one and a half years.
Mr Leghari also announced that the Power Division on Thursday moved a summary for cabinet approval to finalise rules for wheeling charges, a key step towards operationalising the competitive electricity trading market.
He added that the government was exploring plans to offer 5,000-6,000MW of surplus electricity at marginal costs to industries such as data centres and crypto mining, and discussions were underway with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The minister said that a change in the net metering arrangement would not reduce the electricity tariff, but there would be no further increase in rates. Unless measures are introduced, the expansion of solar systems could add to the surplus on the grid. The combination of the sale of surplus power and the containment of solar expansion would help grid stability, he said.
Mr Leghari said the consumers had adopted solar net metering under a government policy and would not be penalised, but its return had become unjustified. If not corrected, even the net metering consumers would be bearing billions of rupees worth of electricity bills in future.
He said the government had saved over Rs3 trillion from negotiations with the independent power producers, cancelled over 10,000MW of new power plants out of 17,000MW committed capacity and saved over Rs4tr in future payments, whereas correction of net metering was also on the agenda.
Mr Leghari said he had written letters to the chief ministers to convey that power distribution companies (Discos) would no longer act as collection agents of electricity duty for provinces.
He said that only one chief minister had so far responded, and once the remaining three give their feedback, a case would be presented before the federal cabinet for a final decision.
Mr Leghari said the Power Division had been able to reduce recovery, transmission and distribution losses through good governance.
He said the government suffered a Rs591 billion loss in fiscal year 2024 due to less billing and higher technical losses of Discos.
This money could have utilised in the development or any other meaningful sector, he added.
The minister said in fiscal 2025, this loss was brought by Rs191bn to Rs399bn through good governance.
 






The government has appointed board of directors to Discos “on merit and without any political consideration”.
He said Discos had been given the target of Rs100bn annual reduction over the next five years, but their losses had been cut by Rs191bn even before the start of that five-year period.
This was achieved through improvement in recoveries, he said, explaining that the Discos had suffered Rs315bn loss in FY24 when recovery against billing stood at 92.4 per cent.
The bill recovery was improved to 96.6pc in FY25, bringing down these losses to just Rs132bn, as the recovery rate of five Punjab and Islamabad companies was beyond 101pc.
Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, mostly attributed to electricity theft, fell slightly from Rs276bn in FY24 to Rs266bn in FY25, with losses decreasing from 18.3pc to 17.6pc.
The minister added that savings could have been higher — around Rs225 billion — had the government been able to appoint new boards for Hyderabad and Sukkur Electric, which remain delayed due to litigation.
He revealed the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) had uncovered massive electricity theft at four steel and furnace factories using tampered meters.
He claimed the factory owners wielded significant influence and attempted to remove security officials and Disco staff involved in the investigation. However, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and government institutions backed the anti-theft campaign.
The minister said the Power Division and Discos would focus on recoveries, dismantle networks of theft and improve governance and overall efficiencies.
Responding to a question, Mr Leghari said the Power Division believed that since K-Electric’s overwhelming reliance would now be on the national grid, the uniformity of tariff should extend to fuel costs as well as quarterly adjustments.
He said K-Electric’s import from the grid had increased to 1,600MW from 1,000MW, which would further go up by another 400MW with additional interconnection within a month.
He said the Power Division would engage with the power regulator and present a detailed point of view before the federal cabinet for an amicable and sustainable solution.
The power minister conceded that LNG import contracts were made almost a decade ago on the assumption that LNG-based power plants would operate on LNG and consume 100pc of imports.
However, he stressed that no power plant should be operated without a fuel-based merit order. Therefore, the previous assumptions did not materialise.
“We believe that violation of economic merit order is a mortal sin,” he said, adding that the only solution was to review LNG contracts as had been done in the case of independent power producers.

The CJP made these remarks in a meeting with the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) chairman, Rabiya Javeri Agha, on Thursday.
The meeting discussed initiatives for the protection and promotion of human rights, according to an official statement.
CJP Afridi appreciated the NCHR for its efforts to address rights-based challenges.

IFJ asks apex court to review Peca, directs govt to amend it

Ms Agha briefed the CJP on NCHR’s ongoing initiatives, policy interventions and monitoring mec­hanisms related to the implementation of constitutional and legal safeguards for fundamental rights.
 
 

They reaffirmed the need for co­ordination among state institutions to address systemic gaps in the human rights protection framework.
The CJP emphasised the judiciary’s commitment to upholding constitutional values, due process, and the protection of citizens’ fundamental freedoms.
The meeting ended with a “shared resolve to work collectively for a more just, inclusive and rights-respecting society,” the official statement added.
Peca review
The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) secretary general, Anthony Bellanger, has requested the Supreme Court to review the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) as a matter of priority and provide necessary directions to the government to amend the law.
In his letter addressing the CJP, Mr Bellanger said “swift action” was needed to “address this critical situation for Pakistan’s media and pro-tect press freedom as guaranteed in Article 19 of Pakistan’s constitution”.
 
 

The letter was delivered to the apex court on Thursday by Shakeel Ahmad, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) secretary general.
The letter stated the increased political polarisation, widespread protests and social disruption meant media professionals across Pakistan were “facing increased challenges while performing their duties”.
They are also facing a “heightened level of legal persecution including litigation, intimidation and cases filed under Peca”.
“We understand that Pakistan is a signatory of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and United Nations Conventions that confer freedom of speech and expression and key democratic rights, but the curtailing of these fundamental rights under Peca is of great concern for the IFJ and international journalist community,” the letter explained.

• Nation braces for fresh spell of heavy rain from July 13
• Moist currents and westerly wave to intensify rains
• Glacial melt raises river flood risk in northern areas
LAHORE / RAWALPINDI: Five people lost their lives and at least 40 were injured in Lahore on Thursday as torrential monsoon rains lashed the city, submerging roads and low-lying areas.
The deadly downpour came as a fresh spell of heavy rainfall is forecast to hit several parts of the country from July 13 to 17, with authorities warning of urban flooding, landslides and rising river levels.
The National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) warned of potential flooding in rivers due to a sharp rise in temperatures in northern regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan and upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The warming trend is accelerating glacial and snowmelt, increasing river flows.
 
 

According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), moist currents are currently entering the country and are likely to intensify from July 13. A new westerly wave is also expected to approach the country on the evening of July 13.
Under the prevailing weather conditions, rain-wind/thundershowers accompanied by scattered heavy to very heavy falls are expected in several parts of the country.
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Haveli, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, Mirpur, the rainfall is forecast from July 11 to 17.
Gilgit-Baltistan (Diamer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit and others) is likely to receive showers on the night of July 11 and again from July 13 to 16 with occasional gaps.
In Khyber Pakht­u­nkhwa, rain, windstorm and thundershower with scattered heavy falls (at times very heavy) is expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Shangla, Battagram, Buner, Kohat, Karak, Bannu, Tank, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Waziristan, Orakzai, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Hangu and Kurram from July 11 to July 17 with occasional gaps.

Southern Punjab districts such as Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur may witness rain on July 11 and again from July 13 to 17.
In Balochistan, areas including Quetta, Zhob, Lasbela and Khuzdar are forecast to receive rain on July 11 and between July 13 and 16.
In Sindh, moderate rain-wind/thundershower is expected in Tharparkar, Mirpur Khas, Sanghar, Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, Jacobabad, Khairpur, Shaheed Benazirabad, Hyderabad and Karachi from July 15 to July 17 with occasional gaps.
Hazards, warnings
The PMD warned that heavy to very heavy rainfall could cause flash flooding in local streams and nullahs in Murree, Galiyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, hill torrents of D.G. Khan, northeast Punjab, Kashmir and parts of Balochistan from July 14 to July 17.
Urban flooding is likely in low-lying areas of Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Peshawar and Nowshera from July 13 to 17.
Landslides and mudslides may disrupt roads in hilly regions of KP, Murree, Galiyat, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan from July 14 to July 17.
Windstorms and lightning may damage weak structures, including kutcha houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.
Farmers have been advised to plan agricultural activities accordingly, while travellers and tourists have been urged to avoid vulnerable areas and monitor weather updates.
The Met Office has requested all authorities concerned to remain on alert and take necessary measures to avoid loss of life and property.
The NEOC noted an increase in glacial melting in areas including the Ghujerab and Shimshal rivers (Hunza), Braldu River (Shigar), Husher and Saltaro rivers (Ghanche) and Uzhnu Gol (Chitral).
It advised the residents near rivers and streams to stay vigilant, especially during nighttime and heavy rainfall.
Lahore faces urban flooding
Lahore witnessed an unprecedented monsoon fury on Thursday, recording 182mm of rainfall in just a few hours, which submerged several major roads and low-lying areas.
According to Rescue officials, five people died and 40 were injured in rain-related incidents across Punjab in the last 24 hours.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) reported rainfall in Lahore for over seven hours. Rainfall recorded in other areas included Sialkot (77mm), Gujranwala (67mm), Chakwal (65mm), Jhelum (64mm), Hafizabad (60mm), Gujarat (52mm), Mandi Bahauddin (47mm), Attock (45mm), Faisalabad (51mm), Narowal (44mm), Okara (33mm), Toba Tek Singh and Sheikhupura (25mm), Rawalpindi and Kasur (23mm), Mangla (19mm), Sargodha (18mm), D.G. Khan (16mm), Jhang (11mm), Mianwali (10mm) and Sahiwal (8mm).
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said drainage was ensured “in the shortest possible time” in Lahore despite the heavy rainfall.
He said the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) and district administrations remained on the ground to manage water removal from highways, underpasses and other vulnerable places.
He noted that this second monsoon spell will continue until July 13 and more rains are expected in divisions including Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur.
Mr Kathia said 36 people have lost their lives and 96 sustained injuries in rain-related incidents this season. A total of 42 houses were damaged and four livestock lost.
Most deaths were caused by roof collapses in dilapidated buildings. He urged citizens to avoid unsafe structures, live electric wires and flood-prone areas.

“Nine people abducted from both coaches have been killed, and their bodies have been recovered,” said Zhob Assistant Comm­issioner Naveed Alam, adding that the bodies were being transported to Rak­hni for dispatch to their native towns in Punjab.
Shahid Rind, the Balo­chistan government’s spo­kes­­person, confirmed the incident and said that Fitna al Hindustan — a term used for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan — had carried out attacks at three different places — Kakat, Mastung and Sur-Dakai.
“There are reports about the kidnapping of some passengers from Sur-Dakai area,” he said, adding that security forces had launched a search operation to safely recover any remaining kidnapped passengers.
According to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab — a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.
The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint.
“They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”
After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area.
Security forces suspended traffic on the highway and began a large-scale search operation to locate the perpetrators.
According to sources, the attackers checked the CNICs of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.
“There are reports about the killing of nine passengers who were kidnapped by the armed men,” a senior police official told Dawn.
The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said they had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.

The demo announced by the family members of imprisoned AAC leader Mumtaz  Nagari was attended by a large number of people from all walks of life,  including the members of the religious outfits. They organised a rally from Budulas Nagar and staged a protest at Harapu, the district headquarters of Nagar, blocking the highway for all kinds of traffic.
On May 15, the GB police arrested a dozen AAC leaders for alleged anti-state activities and hate speech during the recent Pakistan-India tensions and sent them on judicial remand. The protesters chanted slogans for the release of detained AAC leaders.
Speaking at the protest, the speakers said that AAC leaders had been illegally arrested for raising their voice for the people. They said it was an injustice to arrest activists who raised their voice to highlight issues faced by poor people.
They said the detained leaders were innocent, adding that the AAC leaders were not criminals or anti-state. Due to the protest, traffic remained suspended for at least four hours on the KKH.
Later, negotiations were held between the family members of detained AAC leader Mumtaz Nagari and GB Assembly member Ayub Waziri, Chief Min­is­ter’s Special Assistant Mu­­hammad Ali and Deputy Commissioner Asghar Khan.
The government representatives assured the participants that the issue would be settled in one week, as the case was under trial. The protesters subsequently postponed the protest for five days, warning that they would take to the streets again if their demands remained unmet.

Speaking at the annual Pakistani Mango Festival, held this year at the University of the District of Columbia, Bischoping said: “Looking ahead, we are poised to continue growing our cooperation across a range of shared interests. On the economic front, we hope to expand mutually beneficial trade and commercial opportunities, especially in Pakistan’s growing critical minerals sector.”
Bischoping noted that US businesses were taking note of Islamabad’s reform agenda.
“We welcome Pakistan’s efforts to implement ref­orms that will enable private sector-led economic growth across numerous sectors. US firms seeking opportunities are drawn to a predictable and fair investment and regulatory environment. Suppo­rting these deals is good for bu­­siness — for both the Uni­ted States and Pakistan.”
The annual festival, which promotes Pakistan’s prized mango exports, has also become a cultural and diplomatic gathering point. This year’s event drew US officials, lawmakers, business leaders, think tank experts, journalists — and even some undeclared PTI supporters — all under one roof despite a tornado warning and torrential rain that caused the Potomac River to flood nearby streets.
 
 

Pakistan’s Ambassador Rizwan Shaikh opened the evening with humor: “Mango, a majestic fruit, seems to have magical qu­­alities as well. Mango and monsoon arrive together in Pakistan. Today, we brought the mangoes only — but the fruit brought the monsoon.”
Looking out at the stormy sky, he added: “We can see that mangoes have transported the monsoon to Washington as well.”
The event showcased signature Pakistani mango varieties — Chaunsa, Sindhri, Langra, and Anwar Ratol — alongside mango ice cream, mango kheer, and gift boxes, each including at least one prized mango.
Bischoping, while celebrating the occasion, also acknowledged enduring security ties: “As we pursue economic opportunities, we must also remain focused on our shared interest in counterterrorism. The United States and Pakistan share a common interest in combating terrorism, including threats from groups like ISIS, to keep both Americans and Pakistanis safe.”

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Yahya Afridi took up Mr Chaudhry’s plea on Thursday.
The former PTI leader had filed an appeal against the LHC’s order issued on May 20, which rejected the plea.
Advocate Faisal Farid Chaudhry, who represented Mr Chaudhry, argued the high court dismissed the plea without perusing the case record and relying upon facts “sourced through AI and social media platforms”.
The petition had also questioned whether multiple FIRs over a single offence violated fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and whether a single trial should be conducted under the doctrine of similarity to ensure fairness and justice.
During the hearing, CJP Afridi observed the court will dictate the order in the presence of both parties to protect their rights.
He then called Punjab Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi and Mr Chaudhry to his chambers.
Earlier on April 8, the apex court had ordered the Anti Terrorism Courts (ATCs) to conclude within four months the trials of suspects allegedly involved in violence on May 9.
It also directed the ATCs to submit progress reports on trials to relevant high courts every two weeks.
On Thursday, CJP appreciated that the trial courts were working and the litigants were exempt from attendance in different districts. The CJP reminded Mr Chaudhry he also got an exemption from personal attendance from the LHC.
During the hearing, Mr Naqvi raised objections to the plea, stating the case at the high court was never heard on merits.
The LHC had ruled on the petition’s admissibility.
The Supreme Court also rejected a plea to halt cases relating to May 9 violence until the present case was decided.
The CJP stated the high court will consider and decide whether to stay the proceedings at the trial court or not.
In case the Supreme Court issues any decision, the case of the parties at the trial court may be affected, observed CJP.
The petitioner highlighted that he was primarily alleged to have committed abetment in connection with the events of May 9 and following his arrest, the authorities engaged in a systematic pattern of malafide conduct to substantiate base-less allegations.
The petitioner remained in police custody for nearly six months, during which no meaningful investigation was conducted, nor was his statement recorded as mandated by law, the petition alleged, adding he was booked in 11 “false, frivolous and politically motivated” cases in Lahore.
The petition stated the malafide intent became apparent when all FIRs implicating the petitioner were initiated through complaints lodged exclusively by police officers.
These complaints were registered on identical dates, with the reported times conspicuously overlapping.
The petitioner was not originally nominated in all FIRs. Instead, his alleged involvement was contrived through supplementary statements recorded at later dates, a practice evidently employed to manufacture charges retroactively.
The fragmented and duplicative proceedings across multiple FIRs violated the principles of justice but also subjected the petitioner to undue harassment and prejudice, the petition alleged, adding the failure to consolidate the cases under one trial has compelled the petitioner to approach the Supreme Court.
The fragmentation of cases across multiple stations not only created unnecessary procedural complexities but also subjected the petitioner to “undue harassment and prejudice”.
“Such an approach undermines the principles of fair trial and judicial economy, which demand that justice be administered efficiently and without duplication.”

• Azma says Imran’s sons will not be allowed to create unrest
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: In the lead-up to the ‘Free Imran Khan Movement’ expected to be launched on Aug 5, the PTI in the northern Punjab region has decided to rely on its grassroots workers to galvanise its support – a move which contrasts with its earlier practice of depending on heavyweights to drum up support for its protests.
Since the incarceration of the party founder in 2023, the embattled political party has failed to mobilise workers, particularly in Punjab, due to a crackdown on its top- and middle-tier leadership by the provincial government as well as a disconnect between the party leaders and the cadre.
Seemingly, in order to bridge this gap, the North Punjab chapter of the party has established committees at the district and tehsil levels to run awareness campaigns for the release of Mr Khan.
A meeting chaired by chapter’s president Malik Taimoor Masood decided that the movement would be officially launched on August 5. It was further decided that Malik Yasir Patwali, Fayaz Tabassum and Yasir Jamal will lead the awareness campaign in Attock. In Rawalpindi Metropolitan, the task has been assigned to Malik Azeem, Tayyaba Raja and Muslim Shehzad. In Rawalpindi City, Zubair Khan, Wajahat Qayyum Abbasi, Parveen Rehmani and Hafiz Zahid will lead the campaign and Sardar Mansoor and Hasnain Sunbal will mobilise workers in Murree.
Similarly, three PTI workers, Farrukh Mehmood Sial, Rizwan Dani and Muhammad Afzal, have been nominated from Jhelum, while Aftab Ahmad Sahi, Malik Hammad and Ehtisham Kiani have been assigned duties in Chakwal. Ghulam Dastagir and Sajida Begum will work in Mianwali and Arslan Manch and Zohaib Umar will rally workers in Khushab. The party workers have been charged with mobilisation duties in Sargodha and Bhakkar as well.
The campaign will start at the district and tehsil levels, featuring corner meetings, door-to-door canvassing, and public engagement under the leadership of local MNAs, MPAs, ticket-holders, and organisational office-bearers. It was also decided that each district and tehsil would regularly submit performance reports to the designated representatives of the North Punjab chapter. These activities will be monitored and reports will be forwarded by the PTI North Punjab president to the senior leadership.
Speaking to Dawn, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said the party aimed to gain momentum ahead of the Aug 5 anniversary of Imran Khan’s imprisonment and workers were being mobilised in this regard.
He said at present, they had not decided to take the protest to Islamabad, and for now it would be public meetings and rallies in respective cities and provinces. He said all the district committees would report to PTI Punjab President Aliya Hamza, who would then inform the central leadership about the progress on mobilisation.
‘Unrest in Pakistan’
Meanwhile, the Punjab government’s information minister, Azma Bukhari, said Imran’s son — Kasim and Suleman — would not be allowed to create unrest in Pakistan. Earlier this week, Aleema Khan had said that the ex-PM’s son would be visiting Pakistan to join the campaign for the release of their father. She, however, did not share a timeline in this regard.
In a presser in Lahore, Ms Bukhari said that Imran Khan’s sons would not be allowed to create unrest in the country. “Why did Khan’s sons not visit Pakistan when he was injured. Now suddenly, they are missing Pakistan,” she questioned. The minister said Mr Khan’s sons would not be allowed to create unrest in Pakistan. “Jemima has reportedly barred her sons from visiting Pakistan… The instigators will not be allowed to use children to spread unrest,” she warned.
On the other hand, Imran’s ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith accused the government of preventing her children from speaking to their father and threatening to arrest them if they came to Pakistan. “My children are not allowed to speak on the phone to their father Imran Khan. He has been in solitary confinement in prison for nearly 2 years,” Ms Goldsmith said in a post on X on Thursday.
She said, “Pakistan’s government has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars. This doesn’t happen in a democracy or a functioning state. This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta.” Her statement came after a warning from PM’s adviser Rana Sanaullah that Imran Khan’s sons would be arrested if they joined any violent PTI protest in Pakistan.
 






On the other hand, PML-N’s Senator Irfan Siddiqui hinted that the government might not arrest them on arrival, but the law would take its course if they joined the protest movement of the PTI.
“In my personal opinion as the government has so far not taken any official stance, Suleman and Kasim should be allowed to come. They should come and carry out their activities.”

Lahore’s JFK Animal Rescue and Shelter said it received reports about an “extremely horrific situation after an Instagram influencer was seen posting torturing and killing animals, including bunnies and cats”.
The organisation said it immediately contacted the police, who reached the location to find dead bodies of animals and blood, with the suspect found “laughing” when approached.  The shelter said it would register a case against her and the animals were moved to shelters by the Police Animal Rescue Centre (PARC).
Visuals shared by the shelter showed cats, rabbits and birds of prey in captivity at the site.
Lahore Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Syeda Shehrbano Naqvi addressed the incident in a video, saying: “We just came back from a case where a girl … was torturing animals and she had rabbits, some exotic animals, cats and a lot of other stuff.”
She said the suspect had been posting graphic imagery of animal cruelty and violence on social media. The policewoman urged the public not to gift pets to someone suffering from mental issues.
“Please, start talking about animal cruelty because animal cruelty leads to us being cruel towards children [and] us being cruel towards vulnerable communities.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

She told Dawn.com the suspect was arrested and admitted to a mental healthcare facility. “She had run away several times from rehabilitation in the past as well,” the officer added.
ASP Naqvi said a case was registered on PARC’s complaint at Defence B Police Station under Pakistan Penal Code Section 289 (negligent conduct with respect to animal), Section 3 (penalty for cruelty to animals and for sale of animals killed with unnecessary cruelty) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1890, and Sections 10A (cruelty to animal prohibited), 12 (certificate of lawful possession) and 15 (restriction on dealings in animals, trophies or meat) of the Punjab Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation, and Management) Act, 1974.
The reason given by the ASP for the FIR was “cruelty towards animals after caging them and then killing animals and posting videos/pictures of the graphic content on Instagram and other social media platforms.”
PARC was established as a pioneering institution in Lahore in 2023, making significant strides over the past year in rescuing and protecting animals from abuse, neglect and abandonment.
Since its inception, PARC has safely relocated 1,130 animals to protection centres where they received proper care and treatment. These efforts have played a vital role in reducing animal suffering in urban settings. It generated a detailed report on animal abuse and the protection of animal rights in May, saying it had rescued 1,379 animals, 50 of them from extreme cruelty, in two years.
 
 

Pakistan has almost no animal welfare policy or service in place. The most prominent law for animal protection, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1890) — which dates back to the colonial era — is limited in scope and lacks understanding of animal welfare in today’s context.
The federal government did pass a law in 2018, increasing the fines for animal cruelty. It increased the maximum fine to Rs100,000 for animal cruelty, which had remained at the Rs50 level since the law was first passed in 1890, for first-time offenders. The minimum fine was raised to Rs10,000. There was a similar increase in fines for other offences against animals.
However, the law is only applicable in the federal capital, and does not extend to the rest of Pakistan. This is because animal welfare became a provincial subject after the 18th Amendment, and provinces are required to enact their own laws.
That is yet to happen, resulting in punishment for offences against animals in the rest of Pakistan staying the same as they were under the 1890 law.</p><small>2025-07-10 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/102214329c58cf6.jpg?r=221802' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923338/iran-threats-in-uk-significantly-increased-intelligence-watchdog' target='_blank'><strong>Iran threats in UK ‘significantly increased’: intelligence watchdog</strong></a><br><p>A United Kingdom parliamentary committee on Thursday blamed Iran for at least 15 attempts to kill or kidnap British-based individuals since 2022, saying the threat from Iran had “significantly increased”.
London’s response has been too focused on “crisis management”, said parliament’s intelligence and security committee, with concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme dominating their attention too much.
Tehran swiftly issued a “categorical rejection of the unfounded, politically motivated and hostile allegations”.
The committee’s claims were “baseless, irresponsible, and reflective of a broader pattern of distortion intended to malign Iran’s legitimate regional and national interests”, said its London embassy.
The report comes after growing alarm in Britain at alleged Iranian targeting of dissidents, media organisations and journalists in the UK, including accusations of physical attacks.
Iran in March became the first country to be placed on an enhanced tier of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme, which aims to boost Britain’s national security against covert foreign influences.
It requires all persons working inside the country for Iran, its intelligence services or the Revolutionary Guard to register on a new list or face jail.
“Iran poses a wide-ranging, persistent and unpredictable threat to the UK, UK nationals, and UK interests,” Kevan Jones, chairman of the watchdog committee, said in the report’s conclusions.
“Iran has a high appetite for risk when conducting offensive activity and its intelligence services are ferociously well-resourced with significant areas of asymmetric strength.”
Jones said it bolstered this through proxy groups, “including criminal networks, militant and terrorist organisations, and private cyber actors” to allow for deniability.
‘Willing and able’
His committee’s report said that while Iran’s UK activity “appears to be less strategic and on a smaller scale than Russia and China”, it “should not be underestimated”.
The physical threat posed had “significantly increased” in pace and volume, and was “focused acutely on dissidents and other opponents of the regime” as well as Jewish and Israeli interests in the UK, it said.
“The Iranian Intelligence Services have shown that they are willing and able — often through third-party agents — to attempt assassination within the UK and kidnap from the UK,” the report said.
“There have been at least 15 attempts at murder or kidnap against British nationals or UK-based individuals since the beginning of 2022.”
Similarly, security minister Dan Jarvis said in March that Britain’s MI5 domestic intelligence service had tallied 20 Iran-backed plots “presenting potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents”.
The watchdog committee took evidence for two years from August 2021 for its report, a period which saw Tehran implicated in a plot to kill two London-based Iran International television anchors.
In March last year, one of the Persian-language outlet’s journalists was stabbed outside his London home. Two Romanian men have been charged in relation to the attack and face extradition to the UK to stand trial.
The counter-terrorism unit of London’s Metropolitan Police led the investigation. Iran’s charge d’affaires in the UK has said that the Tehran authorities “deny any link” to the incident.</p><small>2025-07-10 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10171556d1ea756.jpg?r=174542' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923308/anp-leader-maulana-khan-zeb-cop-gunned-down-in-kps-bajaur-police' target='_blank'><strong>ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb, cop gunned down in KP’s Bajaur: police</strong></a><br><p>Awami National Party (ANP) politician Maulana Khan Zeb and a policeman were shot dead on Thursday by unidentified suspects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, according to the police.
Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafiq told Dawn.com that the politician was shot dead in Shindai Mor while campaigning for the July 13 peace parade, adding that a policeman was also killed in the attack.
“Three other people were injured in the shooting,” DPO Rafiq said. “This was a targeted killing carried out by unidentified shooters on motorcycles.”
DPO Rafiq added that evidence had been collected from the crime scene.
Khan Zeb was a member of the ANP’s central cabinet and held the office of secretary of ulema affairs, according to the party website.
ANP President Senator Aimal Wali Khan issued a statement condemning the killing, stating that the party would file a first information report against the state.
“State institutions are complicit in this incident because they have maintained criminal silence,” the ANP chief was quoted as saying. “After consulting with Khan Zeb’s elder brother, Sheikh Jahanzada, an FIR for the killing will be registered against the state.”
In a post on X, Wali Khan posted photos of himself and Khan Zeb with the caption “devastated”.
Meanwhile, ANP KP President Mian Ifitkhar Hussain strongly condemned the incident and declared three days of mourning in a statement shared on X.
“This attack is not only an attack on the Awami National Party but also on the Pashtun consciousness and peace,” Hussain was quoted as saying.
According to the statement, Hussain announced that the ANP’s KP chapter would observe three days of mourning, suspend all activities, and hoist black flags alongside party flags.
The statement added that Hussain was leaving for Bajaur and urged the party to maintain “morale, unity, and organisational discipline”.
Similarly, the office of KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur issued a statement condemning the incident and vowed to bring the suspects to justice.
According to the statement, the CM condemned the shooting and ordered the relevant authorities to investigate the incident and promptly arrest the shooters.
“Those involved in the incident will not be able to escape the grip of the law,” Gandapur was quoted as saying.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) issued a statement condemning the killing, hailing Khan Zeb as “a leading peace campaigner and political leader of the ANP”.
“We demand a swift and impartial inquiry into this tragic incident,” the rights body wrote in a statement on X.
“The federal and provincial governments must ensure that normalcy returns to the terror-stricken districts of the province and that people who have suffered for decades can lead their lives peacefully and without fear.”
 






Politicians in KP have been targeted in attacks in the past.
This year, the home of Bajaur MNA Mubarak Zeb Khan was attacked twice, with an improvised explosive device exploding outside his house in May and suspects launching a rocket at the residence in June.
He was not home during the IED attack and was unharmed in the second incident.
Meanwhile, in March, the brother of former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was shot dead in KP’s Swabi.
The former senator confirmed on social media that his elder brother, Shakeel Ahmad Khan, was shot dead in front of his house by unidentified gunmen in the village of Ahad Khan in Swabi.
“He was brutally killed in front of his home in an innocent village,” Mushtaq wrote. “My brother was very dear to me, he was my greatest help. It (his murder) is the greatest atrocity.”

The Royal Navy aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport on June 14 in the state capital and has been grounded ever since, despite efforts to repair it. The Indian Air Force said last month it would help in the repair and return of the jet, which made an emergency landing when it was flying over the Arabian Sea off Kerala’s coast.
A British High Commission spokesperson had told Reuters the United Kingdom had accepted an offer to move the aircraft to the maintenance, repair and overhaul facility at the airport.
AP reported today that officials said engineers hoped to repair the plane in the next few days before it could fly back to the UK “sometime next week”.
The British High Commission confirmed to the outlet that a British engineering team was deployed to “assess and repair” the aircraft.
“There has been speculation in India that if the engineers fail to rectify the aircraft, it could be partially dismantled and transported in a cargo plane,” the report said, adding, however, that the UK’s Ministry of Defence “dismissed the speculation” in an emailed statement.
Earlier this month, the UK’s Minister for the Armed Forces Luke Pollard said in parliament that a Royal Air Force crew were in Thiruvananthapuram and working with Indian counterparts.
Meanwhile, Kerala’s tourism board had taken advantage of the aircraft’s presence, posting an AI-generated image of the plane with coconut trees in the background on July 2. The post was captioned “Kerala, the destination you’ll never want to leave.”
 






“This was part of our tourism campaign. It has been one of the most innovative and eye-catching ones … It’s all in good humour and creativity,” Biju K, Kerala’s tourism secretary, had told Reuters.
In the viral social media post, originally created by entertainment website The Fauxy, the jet can be seen giving the state of Kerala five golden stars, calling it “an amazing place”.
“I don’t want to leave. Definitely recommend,” the image quotes the jet as saying.
“Though tourism is under the government, it has moved out of government space in promoting the destination,” said Roy Mathew, director of Stark Communications, the tourism department’s brand promotion agency.</p><small>2025-07-10 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/10195044291465c.jpg?r=195049' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923330/police-arrest-8-sbca-officials-owner-in-lyari-building-collapse-case' target='_blank'><strong>Police arrest 8 SBCA officials, owner in Lyari building collapse case</strong></a><br><p>At least eight officials of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) were arrested on Thursday along with the owner of a building that recently collapsed in Karachi’s Lyari, claiming 27 lives.
The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding on Sunday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the SBCA saying it had issued multiple prior notices to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that the arrests were made today after a first information report (FIR) was registered a day ago.
“Nine officials and the present owner of the building were nominated in the FIR registered on a complaint of an official of the local government department. However, eight directors and deputy directors were arrested but one official was not arrested as he was sick,” he said. adding that the owner was arrested as well.
The provincial government had suspended SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro and announced strict action against all those responsible for the incident on Monday. Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said a fact-finding committee had been formed to present a report on the incident, adding that the Sindh chief minister ordered the home minister to immediately register an FIR.
The FIR was registered at the Baghdadi Police Station on the complaint of Hamadullah, a section officer of the Sindh Local Government and Housing Town Planning Department, under Sections 34 (common intention), 217 (public servant disobeying direction of law with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture), 218 (public servant framing incorrect record or writing intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture), 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings), 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab), 337-Ai (whoever, by doing any act with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person, or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt to any person causes shajjah-i-khafifah) and 427 (mischief causing damage amounting to Rs50) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The FIR said the building, spread over 527.3 square yards, was constructed in 1986. Its owner constructed the five-storey plus ground floor building in two portions, and for a considerable period, both portions (buildings) were in dilapidated condition and were unlivable. It added that one building with 20 apartments collapsed on July 4 due to the “criminal negligence” of the SBCA officials and the owner.
The FIR said the SBCA officials were aware of the dilapidated condition of the building over the years till the collapse.  It added that the officials “completely failed” to perform their official duty and “committed negligence and carelessness”.
The FIR further said that the officials “deliberately” did not mention in the official record that the building was dilapidated. It also added that the present owner of the building and other unknown owners also knew that it was not livable for humans. Despite this, the owners gave several flats on rent to members of the Hindu community and committed negligence.
The complainant said he wanted legal proceedings against the SBCA officials and owners of the building.</p><small>2025-07-10 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/102042139a609e9.jpg?r=205240' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923332/us-federal-judge-blocks-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-despite-supreme-court-ruling' target='_blank'><strong>US federal judge blocks Trump’s birthright citizenship order despite Supreme Court ruling</strong></a><br><p>A federal judge on Thursday again barred President Donald Trump’s administration from enforcing his executive order limiting birthright citizenship nationwide after the United States Supreme Court restricted the ability of judges to block his policies using nationwide injunctions.
US District Judge Joseph Laplante in Concord, New Hampshire, made the ruling after immigrant rights advocates implored him to grant class action status to a lawsuit they filed seeking to represent any babies whose citizenship status would be threatened by the implementation of Trump’s directive.
Laplante agreed the plaintiffs could proceed as a class, allowing him to issue a fresh judicial order blocking implementation of the Republican president’s policy nationally.
The question of whether to issue an injunction was “not a close call”, he said, noting children could be deprived of US citizenship if Trump’s order took effect.
“That’s irreparable harm, citizenship alone,” he said. “It is the greatest privilege that exists in the world.”
The judge said he would stay his ruling for a few days to allow the Trump administration to appeal and would issue a written decision by the end of the day.
The ACLU and others filed the suit just hours after the Supreme Court on June 27 issued a 6-3 ruling, powered by its conservative majority, that narrowed three nationwide injunctions issued by judges in separate challenges to Trump’s directive.
The suit was filed on behalf of non-US citizens living in the country whose babies might be affected. Under the Supreme Court’s decision, Trump’s executive order would take effect on July 27.
Looking to seize upon an exception in the Supreme Court’s ruling, the lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the decision allows judges to continue to block Trump policies on a nationwide basis in class action lawsuits.
The three judges who issued nationwide injunctions found that Trump’s directive likely violates the citizenship language in the US constitution’s 14th amendment.
The amendment states that all “persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside”.
The Justice Department has argued that Trump’s order conforms with the constitution and has asked Laplante to find that the plaintiffs cannot sue as a class.
The Supreme Court’s ruling did not address the legal merits of Trump’s order, which the Republican president issued as part of his hardline immigration agenda on his first day back in office in January.
Trump’s order directs federal agencies to refuse to recognise the citizenship of US-born children who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or a lawful permanent resident, also known as a “green card” holder.
More than 150,000 newborns would be denied citizenship annually if it takes effect nationally, according to Democratic-led states and immigrant rights advocates who have challenged it.</p><small>2025-07-10 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613386-anp-leader-leader-among-two-killed-in-bajaur-firing' target='_blank'><strong>ANP leader among two killed in Bajaur firing</strong></a><br><p>

India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence, triggering a military escalation. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
A day earlier, Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval of masterminding terrorism in Pakistan, alleging Indian support for terrorist groups.
Echoing similar sentiments, Field Marshal Munir said, while chairing the 271st Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters (GHQ), said today: “Following its manifest defeat in direct aggression against Pakistan, post-Pahalgam incident, India is now doubling down to further its nefarious agenda through its proxies of Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan.”
In July last year, the government designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna-al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
A statement from the ISPR said the CCC participants offered prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks by “Indian-sponsored proxies”.
“Taking stock of recent successes against terrorist proxies, forum resolved that blood of our martyrs will not go waste and the safety and security of people of Pakistan remain topmost priority for the armed forces of Pakistan. Forum strongly asserted that it is imperative to take decisive and holistic actions at all levels against the Indian-backed and sponsored proxies.”
 






The ISPR said the forum also noted the Indian military’s “baseless insinuations to offset its comprehensive defeat”, in an apparent reference to the deputy Indian army chief alleging last week that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict.
“Invoking third parties in what is unmistakably a bilateral military confrontation reflects a disingenuous attempt at bloc politics aimed at falsely projecting India’s self-assigned role as a net security provider to accrue benefits in a region that is visibly growing disillusioned with Indian hegemonic ambitions and Hindutva-driven extremism,” the ISPR quoted Field Marshal Munir as saying on the matter.
 
 

The army brass also conducted a holistic review of the prevailing internal and external security dynamics, with particular emphasis on the recent developments in the Middle East and Iran, noting the “growing propensity for ‘use of force’ as a preferred policy tool”, saying it warranted “persistent development of self-reliant capabilities as well as national unity and resolve”.
The forum’s members were further briefed on the military’s ongoing drive with quick adaptation towards the “evolving threat spectrum and changing character of war”. The army chief also appreciated the leadership of the Pakistan Navy and the Pakistan Air Force for “further strengthening tri-services synergy”.
Field Marshal Munir also shared details of the country’s “proactive and successful” diplomatic manoeuvres, including recent visits to Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where he had accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
 
 

“Forum was also briefed on the historic and unique visit of the COAS to US, where meetings with top-tier leadership afforded an opportunity to share first hand Pakistan’s objective perspective on bilateral, regional and extra-regional developments.”
The ISPR said that in his concluding remarks, the army chief expressed “full confidence in the operational readiness of Pakistan Army against complete threat spectrum”.</p><small>2025-07-10 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1016423617e36ca.jpg?r=164242' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N leaders issue conflicting statements on allowing Imran’s sons to enter Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>PML-N leaders have issued differing statements on whether PTI founder Imran Khan’s sons would be allowed entry into Pakistan to run a political movement for their father’s release, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they “can stage protests but within legal limitations”.
Imran’s sons — Suleman Khan (28) and Kasim Khan (26) — had called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this week, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan said the two brothers would come to Pakistan as part of an upcoming PTI protest movement.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023 in a case related to state gifts, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million graft case and and faces pending trials related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
Speaking on Geo News’ programme ‘Geo Pakistan’ today, Irfan Siddiqui said: “In my personal opinion — as the government has so far not taken any official stance — they should be allowed to come. They should come and carry out their activities.”
He noted that the sons have spent their entire lives abroad, so they would be “well-aware of what a protest is, how it is staged, and what the boundaries are that we cannot cross”.
“In my opinion, they should not be deprived of this right. If they want to run a movement for their father, then they should,” Siddiqui reiterated.
However, he also hinted at their potential arrests: “If they come here and cross the limitations of laws […] They will also come prepared for that, knowing that ‘if we are fighting the laws, then the law will take its course’.”
 


While Kasim recently posted on X about his father being “fully cut off” from the sons, he has not addressed the matter of joining Pakistan’s politics.
Although the government has not officially commented on the matter, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik told Dawn.com that Article 16 was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.
Article 16 of the Constitution says that “every citizen shall have the right to assemble peacefully and without arms, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of public order.”
“Every country has visa conditions, including visit visas. If the visa conditions are violated, the visa can be cancelled,” he said.
To a question on whether they would be allowed to come to Pakistan, he said the interior ministry would have to look at whether the two had applied for a visa or not or possessed a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis.
He added that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.
Last night, he said that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals.
Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said the sons could face arrest if they led a violent movement, while Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said they “should come” to Pakistan.
Siddiqui downplayed the matter altogether, saying that the government was not considering it a “serious issue”. “This will not cause any political upheaval […] there will be no storm if his children come to Pakistan,” he said.
“Why these kids now?” he asked, giving an allegory of taking out two cards that were lying in a pocket deep inside.
He listed that neither Ali Amin Gandapur — the PTI’s only chief minister currently — could do anything for the PTI, nor their protests, or “revolt”, or the call to overseas Pakistanis to halt remittances.
“This card that they are playing will not succeed either. It will aggravate their difficulties because, in the end, politics is to be discussed at the table,” the PML-N senator asserted, referring to the PTI’s demand for Imran’s release.
Regarding talks, the PML-N leader said the only obstacle was Imran himself.
Siddiqui also highlighted various skill challenges that Imran’s sons would face in Pakistan’s political arena.
“Those children have not grown up in Pakistan’s environment at all. They might even melt if you leave them in Karachi’s heat on I.I. Chundrigar Road; those poor kids’ nature is such,” he quipped.
The lawmaker added: “They are maybe not able to speak in Urdu either, so they do not have a language to address this nation.”
However, he acknowledged that their faces were recognisable as they were Imran’s sons. “They are sensible, educated and must be politically well-aware as well.”
Siddiqui termed the potential entry of Imran’s sons into politics as a move to employ emotional appeal.
“They (the sons) are being called because [PTI’s] options within the land of Pakistan have been exhausted,” the lawmaker said, recalling the 2022 mass resignations and the May 9, 2023 riots.
He also pointed out that such a move would go against Imran’s “philosophy that has been against family politics very clearly”.
 
 

Asked by the show hosts whether he was underestimating the sons, given that the PPP’s Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari and his sisters entered politics despite having stayed abroad, Siddiqui replied that the latter had still not “gotten a chance to run a movement as the scenario had changed entirely” compared to the dictatorships in the 1900s.
The PML-N leader noted that ex-president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s wife Nusrat and daughter Benazir used to speak in Urdu and participated in a movement.
Jemima slams govt’s ‘plan’ to arrest sons
Meanwhile, Imran’s former spouse, Jemima Goldsmith, assailed the government for potential plans to arrest her sons if they visited Pakistan.
“My children are not allowed to speak on the phone to their father. He has been in solitary confinement in prison for nearly two years,” she wrote on X.
“Pakistan’s government has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she noted.
“This doesn’t happen in a democracy or a functioning state. This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta,” Goldsmith lamented.
