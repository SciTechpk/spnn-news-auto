The Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate, with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
Retired Justice Syed Shabbar Raza Rizvi, a former Lahore High Court judge, continued his arguments today when the hearing began at 11:30am.
During yesterday’s hearing, senior lawyer Muhammad Akram Sheikh and retired Justice Rizvi, sought a full court comprising all 24 current SC judges, as opposed to multiple petitioners’ request for a bench of 16 judges present in the apex court when the Amendment was passed.
 


The hearing
As Rizvi continued his arguments, Justice Mandokhail said, “Even if we accept your stance that the Supreme Court and the bench are separate, then this shows that the bench’s suo motu power is maintained but has been taken away from the Supreme Court.”
However, Rizvi replied that while the CB had been given some powers under the 26th Amendment, none were taken away from the apex court.
Referring to the provision that was introduced through the 26th Amendment, Justice Hilali observed, “The amendment has been made in the Constitution. Article 191A has come into existence and constitutional benches have been made under it.
“Now you are saying there should be a full bench. So will we need to go into the pre-Amendment era […] and suspend the 26th Amendment for it?” she asked, adding that how Article 191A can be “bypassed”.
Rizvi responded that Article 191A should be read in conjunction with other provisions, not on its own. He argued that Article 191A had not “ended the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under Article 184(3)” (original jurisdiction).
 
 

At this, Justice Mazhar observed that the powers under Article 184(3) had been transferred to the CB under Article 191A, adding that the latter provision “clearly mentioned” the same.
The petitions
Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan,  Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s counsel Munir A. Malik, and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and senior lawyer Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed.
Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request. The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself.
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
 
 

These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.

Senior Civil Judge Mubashir Hassan Chishti presided over the proceedings and directed that Gandapur — who did not show up today — be arrested and presented before the court.
The hearing was adjourned till October 28.
The case dates back to October 30, 2016, when Islamabad police said they had recovered five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol and three tear gas shells from then-KP revenue minister Gandapur’s car outside Bani Gala, where the residence of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan is located.
The incident had taken place against the backdrop of authorities preventing PTI supporters from reaching Bani Gala on Imran’s call to execute a plan to ‘lockdown’ the capital later on November 2.
Gandapur had rejected police claims, saying that two of the five assault rifles found on him were licensed while the others were official weapons provided to his security guards. He had also claimed that the teargas launcher and bottles of liquor were not his and that he had been carrying honey in the liquor bottle.
Subsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the capital’s Bhara Kahu police station.
Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times since over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024, September 4, 2024, July 19, 2025 and Sept 10, 2025.</p><small>2025-10-21 07:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/21074808f9a1034.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950292/aws-outage-cable-damage-leave-net-users-high-and-dry' target='_blank'><strong>AWS outage, cable damage leave net users high and dry</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: As people around the world struggled with several popular apps due to a massive outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday, users in Pakistan expressed frustration after another alleged ‘cable fault’ degraded internet speeds on certain internet service providers (ISPs) in Karachi and across the country.
The widespread outage of Amazon’s cloud services unit took down many popular internet services, impacting streaming platforms, messaging services such as Reddit and Snapchat, and some banks and businesses.
Also affected were Amazon’s Shopping, Prime Video service and Disney+, as well as Perplexity AI, the Fortnite game, Airbnb, Duolingo, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and trading app Robinhood.
Mobile telephone services and messaging apps Signal and Whatsapp were also affected in Europe, according to Downdetector, a website monitoring internet problems. Some UK banks, such as Lloyd’s were also impacted, and pointed to Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the problem.
After few hours of disruptions, systems were gradually coming back online, with AWS saying it was seeing “significant signs of recovery” for some impacted services. AWS’s maintenance site said its engineers scrambled to fix the underlying DNS issue once they became aware of “increased error rates” hitting multiple services. More than four hours later, though some problems persisted, AWS said it was on the path “towards full recovery” and most of its operations were “succeeding normally”.
The DNS issue identified has to do with the Domain Name System protocol used on the internet to associate information with various domain names.
Although the DNS problem was “fully mitigated”, it caused a huge backlog of stymied requests that had to be worked through, AWS said.
‘Cable fault’
Meanwhile, internet users in Pakistan complained of service degradation and slow browsing speeds on certain ISPs, which was once again attributed to a fault in the submarine cable.
There was no statement or acknowledgement from the ISPs in question, the IT ministry, or the regulator, Pakistan Telecommunications Authority.
When approached for comment, IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja attributed it to the global shutdown of Amazon cloud services. “Snapchat and other major apps [are] down due to Amazon web service outage worldwide,” she told Dawn.
However, many internet users claimed they had been informed by their ISP that services were suffering due to cable damage. Taking to X, digital expert Habibullah Khan claimed that the disruption was due to a fault in the PEACE cable.
“It’s a cable cut on the core system. They are running tests to localise the fault location,” he posted.
 






The PEACE cable system originates in China and connects to Pakistan.
According to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), the cables landing in the country are operated by PTCL, Cybernet and TransWorld Associates.
Three undersea cable networks operated by the PTCL are AAE-1 (Africa, Asia and Europe), SMW4 (South-East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe) and the IMEWE (India-Middle East-Western Europe).

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
A statement from the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at Islamabad’s NIH said the latest case of poliovirus was detected in a 12-month-old boy from Ghari union council in Torghar, marking the second case in the district this year.
“With this detection, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 30 – including 19 from KP, nine from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” it said.
The statement added that during the month of September, the Pakistan Polio Programme collected 127 sewage samples across 87 districts in the country.
Of these, 81 samples tested negative for poliovirus, while 44 were found positive; two samples are currently under process in the laboratory, it added.
Balochistan reported 21 negative sample and two positive; Punjab reported 22 negative, 8 positive and one which was still under process; KP reported 24 negative and 10 positive; Sindh reported seven negative, 21 positive and one which was under process; Islamabad reported four negative and one positive; Azad Jammu and Kashmir reported three negative; and Gilgit-Baltistan reported one negative and one positive.
“While the overall trend indicates a decline in positive detections, reflecting the impact of recent high-quality vaccination campaigns, virus circulation persists in certain high-risk areas. These detections highlight the continued need for strong, targeted efforts to interrupt transmission,” the statement said.
It added that the Polio Eradication Initiative was intensifying efforts to sustain comprehensive vaccination coverage and ensure the “highest quality campaigns in vulnerable” areas.
The statement said that the fourth national polio vaccination campaign for 2025 was conducted last week, vaccinating over 44 million children, while the campaign in south KP was currently in progress.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-10-21 06:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/21101246d028875.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950351/lahore-karachi-among-top-5-most-polluted-cities-in-world' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore, Karachi among top 5 most polluted cities in world</strong></a><br><p>Lahore and Karachi were among the top five most polluted cities in terms of air quality on Tuesday, according to monitoring platform IQAir.
In past few years, air pollution has become one of the most pressing public health and environmental crises facing Pakistan. Various cities of the country, most notably Lahore, deal with smog especially in the winter months. The phenomenon is attributed mainly to industrial emissions, vehicular pollution, stubble burning and air movement.
Ranked the world’s third most polluted city yesterday, Lahore rose to the second spot today with an air quality index (AQI) reading of 234, categorised as “very unhealthy”. The provincial capital trailed just behind New Delhi, which had an “hazardous” AQI of 489.
Karachi recorded an AQI of 182, falling in the “unhealthy” range and just barely behind Kuwait’s capital at 183. India’s Mumbai came in at fifth with an AQI of 169.

IQAir’s AQI is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). An AQI between 151 and 200 is considered “unhealthy”, one ranging from 201 to 300 is categorised “very unhealthy”, and any figure above 301 is “hazardous”.
According to IQAir, the AQI for Lahore and Karachi were the highest recorded so far this month.
In Lahore, concentration of the pollutant PM2.5 — cancer-causing microparticles small enough to enter the bloodstream — was measured at 158.8 microgrammes per cubic metre of air (μg/m³), 31.8 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) guidelines.
PM2.5 level in Karachi was recorded 100 µg/m³, 20 times the WHO’s annual guideline value.
IQAir advised residents in Lahore and Karachi to avoid outdoor exercise, run air purifiers and prioritise wearing masks. It also recommended closing all windows to avoid dirty air from outdoors.
 
 

Smog is set to intensify across Lahore and other parts of Punjab due to a combination of local emissions and pollutants carried by low-speed winds from India, following Diwali celebrations, according to the provincial government.
In a bid to combat smog, the Punjab government started water sprinkling operations from Sunday night and activated anti-smog guns in the most affected areas.
In Lahore, these measures were deployed across the city, including Karim Block, Allama Iqbal Town, Multan Road, Ravi Bridge, Shahdara Flyover, GT Road, Thokar Niaz Baig, and Upper Mall.
Besides local pollutants, winds blowing from India are also likely to play a role in worsening the situation over the week.
Separately, the Lahore police said yesterday it arrested 83 people and registered 77 cases as part of its ongoing anti-smog operation.
Air pollution poses a hazardous risk to people’s health, with respiratory issues witnessing a spike during winter when smog intensifies. According to WHO Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo, 256,000 people died in Pakistan every year due to air pollution.</p><small>2025-10-21 06:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/21105239adba8c3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950352/china-hawk-sanae-takaichi-named-japans-first-woman-prime-minister' target='_blank'><strong>China hawk Sanae Takaichi named Japan’s first woman prime minister</strong></a><br><p>Japan got its first woman prime minister on Tuesday after Sanae Takaichi, a China hawk and social conservative, forged an 11th-hour coalition deal.
Japan’s fifth premier in as many years will lead a minority government and has a full in-tray, not least a scheduled visit by US President Donald Trump next week.
Parliament appointed Takaichi, an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, as prime minister on Tuesday, after she unexpectedly won a majority in a first round of voting.
She will formally take office after meeting the emperor later.
 






The former heavy metal drummer became on October 4 head of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed almost non-stop for decades but is losing support.
Six days later the Komeito party, uncomfortable about Takaichi’s conservative views and an LDP slush fund scandal, quit their coalition.
This forced Takaichi to form an alliance with the reformist, right-leaning Japan Innovation Party (JIP), which was signed on Monday evening.
JIP wants to lower the consumption tax rate on food to zero, to abolish corporate and organisational donations and to reduce the number of MPs.
Takaichi pledged on Monday to “make Japan’s economy stronger, and reshape Japan as a country that can be responsible for future generations”.
“She’s a strong-minded person, regardless of being a woman,” pensioner Toru Takahashi, 76, told AFP in Takaichi’s hometown Nara.
“She’s not like Trump. But she’s clear about what’s right and wrong.”
Nordic
Takaichi has promised a cabinet with “Nordic” levels of women, up from two under outgoing premier Shigeru Ishiba.
These could include the right-wing Satsuki Katayama in charge of finances and the half-American Kimi Onoda as economic security minister, local media said.
Japan ranked 118 out of 148 in the World Economic Forum’s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report. Around 15 per cent of lower house MPs are women and corporate boardrooms are overwhelmingly male.
Takaichi, 64, has said she hopes to raise awareness about women’s health struggles and has spoken candidly about her own experience with menopause.
But she opposes revising a 19th-century law requiring married couples to share the same surname, and wants the imperial family to stick to male-only succession.
In Nara, company worker Keiko Yoshida, 39, told AFP she hopes Takaichi will “make Japan a more liveable place for women”.
“I’d be happy if we saw more policies from a woman’s perspective: support for childcare, and help for women returning to work after having children,” agreed student Nina Terao, 18.
Abenomics
Details of a trade deal between Washington and Tokyo remain unresolved, and Trump also wants Japan to stop Russian energy imports and boost defence spending.
“I’d like her to be a prime minister who can clearly say ‘No’ when needed,” Satoshi Sakamoto, 73, another Nara pensioner, told AFP.
Beyond Trump, Takaichi’s many challenges include reversing the decline of Japan’s population and injecting some vim in the flatlining economy.
Being in a minority in both houses of parliament, the new coalition will need support from other parties to push through legislation.
Takaichi has in the past backed aggressive monetary easing and expanded government spending, echoing her mentor, former premier Shinzo Abe.
Despite walking back on these “Abenomics” calls in the LDP leadership contest, her victory has boosted Japanese stocks to record highs.
She previously said that “Japan is completely looked down on by China”, and that Tokyo must “address the security threat” posed by Beijing.
But she has since toned down her rhetoric on China, and stayed away last week from a festival at the Yasukuni shrine — she has been a regular visitor before — honouring Japan’s war dead.
Takaichi will also be under pressure to restore the fortunes of the LDP after a string of poor election results that cost Ishiba his job.
Smaller parties gaining support include the populist Sanseito, which calls immigration a “silent invasion”.
“Prices have gone up, and it’s tough,” Nara pensioner Satoe Tominaga, 77, told AFP, saying she was “50-50” about Takaichi.

As they met at the White House for their first summit, Trump said the deal had been negotiated over four or five months. Albanese described it as an $8.5 billion pipeline “that we have ready to go.”
The full terms of the agreement were not immediately available. The two leaders said part of the agreement had to do with processing of the minerals. Albanese said both countries will contribute $1 billion over the next six months for joint projects.
 






The United States has been looking for access to rare earths and critical minerals around the world as China tightens control over global supply. China has the world’s largest rare earths reserves, according to US Geological Survey data, but Australia also has significant reserves.
The two leaders also planned to discuss the $239.46 billion AUKUS agreement, reached in 2023 under then-President Joe Biden, in which Australia is to buy US nuclear-powered submarines in 2032 before building a new submarine class with Britain.
Navy Secretary John Phelan told the meeting the United States and Australia were working very closely to improve the original AUKUS framework for all three parties “and clarify some of the ambiguity that was in the prior agreement.” Trump said these were “just minor details.” “There shouldn’t be any more clarifications, because we’re just, we’re just going now full steam ahead, building,” Trump said.
Australian officials have said they are confident AUKUS will proceed, with Defence Minister Richard Marles last week saying he knew when the review would conclude.
Cooperative and warm relationship
Ahead of Monday’s meeting between the two leaders, Australian officials have emphasized Canberra is paying its way under AUKUS, contributing $2 billion this year to boost production rates at US submarine shipyards, and preparing to maintain US Virginia-class submarines at its Indian Ocean naval base from 2027.
The delay of 10 months in an official meeting since Trump took office has caused some anxiety in Australia as the Pentagon urged Canberra to lift defence spending. The two leaders met briefly on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month.
Australia is willing to sell shares in its planned strategic reserve of critical minerals to allies including Britain, Reuters reported last month, as Western governments scramble to end their reliance on China for rare earths and minor metals. Top US officials last week condemned Beijing’s expansion of rare earth export controls as a threat to global supply chains. China is the world’s biggest producer of the materials that are vital materials for products ranging from electric vehicles to aircraft engines and military radars.
Resource-rich Australia, wanting to extract and process rare earths, put preferential access to its strategic reserve on the table in US trade negotiations in April.
Ties with China
The United States has a large trade surplus with Australia, which is among the countries with the lowest US tariff.
Australia’s biggest trade partner is China, with exports of iron ore and coal long underpinning its national budget, despite efforts by Albanese’s government to diversify export markets after Beijing’s $20 billion boycott of Australian agriculture and coal from 2020 to 2023.

• Calls for promotion of cottage SMEs to achieve industrial development
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif on Monday revealed that the government was forming a National Commission for Minorities (NCM) to safeguard their rights.
“Parliament has given its approval and work is in progress on proposed National Commission for Minorities and the government has rolled out targeted support programmes from scholarships for minority students at primary through tertiary levels to representation of minorities in federal and provincial assemblies,” the PM said at a ceremony held at the PM House on Diwali.
He extended Diwali greetings to the Hindu community and other religious minorities, calling the festival a “beautiful message of joy, peace and tolerance” and reaffirming the government’s commitment to protecting minority rights.
Addressing the event, which was attended by religious and diplomatic figures, members of minority communities and parliamentary representatives, the prime minister said the presence of Hindu, Christian and other minority leaders at the event reflected “the living reality of Pakistan’s pluralism”.
 






He reiterated that every citizen regardless of faith has the constitutional right to practise religious rituals without fear or intimidation. He urged Muslims and non-Muslims to work “shoulder to shoulder” to resist hatred, intolerance and extremism and to preserve Pakistan as a land of tolerance and peaceful coexistence.
 
 

Minister of State for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kheal Das Ko­­histani, on the occasion, paid tribute to the prime minister for organising Diw­ali celebrations officially at the PM House, making a unique historic moment.
Industrial production
PM Shehbaz Sharif on Monday directed the Power Division to develop effective policy recommendations aimed at enhancing domestic industrial production. He also urged all institutions involved in industrial production to take comprehensive measures to facilitate investors and industrialists.
 






Emphasising the government’s commitment to supporting the agriculture and industrial sectors, the prime minister directed the formulation of a policy to maximise the beneficial use of the country’s power production.
“Electricity production can be best leveraged to increase the output of agricultural and industrial goods,” he said while chairing a meeting on power sector reforms.
During the meeting, the prime minister was briefed on a potential reform package focused on the comprehensive and efficient utilisation of the country’s power resources.
Registration of cottage SMEs
Later, presiding over a separate meeting on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), PM Shehbaz directed the authorities concerned to encourage the registration of cottage SMEs to enable them avail business loans and pave the way for country’s industrial growth.
The prime minister appreciated the initiatives to enhance women’s participation in SMEs and called for awareness on such measures. He emphasised setting up a clear timeline for the implementation of Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority’s (Smeda) roadmap and its early execution.
 






The prime minister said the country’s industrial growth was linked with the development of cottage SMEs and cited the developed countries where they provide raw material to large industries. The premier directed to conduct the training for SMEs in rural areas for processing of agricultural commodities.
He expressed satisfaction with the industries and production ministry’s efforts for Smeda’s restructuring and SME development.
During the briefing on Smeda’s restr­u­cturing and initiatives, it was informed that offices had been established in Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan for SME development, which was welcomed by the public and chambers of commerce.
The meeting was told that a Smeda board comprising private sector experts had been formed, and the appointment of the chief executive officer will be finalised in the coming days. The participants were told that following the directives of the steering committee, a significant progress had been witnessed in SME capacity building, loan provision, and collaboration.
Besides, an AI-powered women entrepreneurship platform is being established to provide women with comprehensive business-related information, including registrations, tax matters and skill awareness.
Moreover, a roadmap for integrating SMEs into the formal economy was also presented during the meeting.

“A narrative is being built that I will go for confrontation with the federal government. Yes, I will, if anything is done by it against the Constitution. I will continue to speak for the supremacy of the Constitution,” he told a provincial assembly session chaired by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati here.
The chief minister said that he wrote letters to the chief justice of Pakistan and federal and provincial governments and even petitioned the Islamabad High Court for ensuring his meeting with detained founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Imran Khan but to no avail.
 


He said he would challenge the federal government over the continued denial of his meeting with Imran and would boycott meetings called by it.

Mr Afridi said that after exhausting all legal options for the purpose, he would place his case before the people to devise the future course of action.
He said that the law and order situation was worsening as the decisions were taken behind closed doors.
“Our [PTI’s] stand is that policies for KP should be made by the province’s government and its residents only,” he said, vowing to resist any decisions taken behind closed doors.
The chief minister said his government welcomed peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban in Doha but had reservations about it as elders and public representatives from KP should be part of the dialogue as advocated by the PTI founder.
He announced that no political worker would be arrested under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order in the province, while the police won’t register FIR against any student leader.
Mr Afridi also announced the establishment of police stations for women across the province.
He said that the meeting called by the prime minister was about Afghan refugees and food security and not the law and order situation, so he sent the chief secretary as the province’s representative besides Muzammil Asalam who was aware of the situation in KP.
“Our stand on Afghan refugees is clear. Those, who have lived here for over 40 years, should be sent back in a dignified way. Those stationed on the border should not create issues about the repatriation of Afghan refugees,” he said.
The chief minister said that the police and the counter-terrorism department were leading the fight against terrorists from the front.
“The vehicles gifted by the federal government to our police force have become outdated, so we have decided to return them,” he said.
Earlier, Leader of the Opposition in the assembly Dr Ibadullah said working for peace in the province was the top priority of every MPA. He urged the chair to call a meeting of the house’s peace committee.
Dr Ibadullah said that the opposition would never allow any action that went against the interest of the province.
“The opposition will stand with the government in case of any positive step taken in the interest of the province,” he said.
The opposition leader vowed to highlight the government’s weak performances.
He insisted that the opposition never opposed Mr Afridi’s meeting with Mr Imran.
Mr Swati observed that the first meeting of the house’s peace committee would be held soon after the finalisation of its terms of references, with all relevant government officers being asked to show up.
Treasury lawmaker Adnan Qadri said Mr Afridi’s victory in the chief minister’s election was the victory of the people and the defeat of all “other powers.”
He said people from tribal districts thanked the PTI founder for nominating Mr Afridi from among them as the province’s chief executive.
”Those who held news conferences against the new chief minister disheartened the tribesmen,” he said.
Mr Qadri also condemned the alleged killing of TLP workers during street protests in Punjab and demanded their names be made public.
MPA Dr Amjad Ali said if the Pakistan Army could take over 34 posts on Pak-Afghan border, why they didn’t eliminate 500 terrorists from Bajaur district in the last three months. He said Pakistan wanted talks with India after border clashes but never held negotiations with Pakhtuns.
The MPA said he, as the minister for mines and minerals, was denied access to mines in merged tribal districts by security forces citing the delicate law and order situation as the reason.
“The Katlang area where a drone strike was carried out, has vast pink topaz reserves. Pink topaz is found in Brazil or Katlang only,” he said.
Mohammad Nisar of the opposition ANP said for the first time, he felt the house was serious about discussing the issues of merged tribal districts.
He said terrorists were identified in some villages but even then, 13 civilians, including women, children and elderly, were martyred with no body of the terrorists found.
“We are not aliens. We want an end to the buffer zone. We want developmental funds to be spent in our merged areas,” he said.
The lawmaker said efforts were under way for the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, to get control of KP’s mines and minerals and declare the merged districts federal territory,” he said. The speaker congratulated Hindu community’s members on diwali, the festival of lights.
The house also passed a resolution by a majority vote, urging the provincial government to inform the United Nations that the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa do not accept Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the nation’s representatives nor does they recognise Israel.
The resolution was tabled by Abdul Salam Afridi, whose another resolution seeking medical facilities for Imran and his wife in jail, was also adopted.
The chair later adjourned the sitting until 2 pm today (Tuesday).

Speaking to a private TV channel, Mr Asif indicated progress in discus­­s­i­ons with American aviation authorities.
“Hopefully, permission will be granted soon,” he said, adding that the government is working on meeting international standards and enhancing safety protocols, which could lead to expanded global routes.
A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) spokesman highlighted the significance of US routes for PIA, emphasising the strong demand for non-stop flights from Pakistanis living in North America.

National flag carrier, Etihad enter into codeshare agreement

According to an aviation expert, a team from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had recently visited Pakistan to conduct a safety audit.
 
 

A positive outcome from these audits could result in PIA achieving Category 1 status from the FAA, which is crucial for the resumption of direct flights to the US.
PIA codeshare with Etihad
Meanwhile, PIA announced on Monday it has entered into a codeshare agreement with UAE’s Etihad Airways.
The partnership, set to take effect from Oct 31, will extend to cargo services and frequent flyer programmes.
“This agreement marks a milestone for PIA,” a spokesperson said, adding that it will encompass passenger flights as well. The arrangement will primarily benefit routes not directly serviced by PIA, allowing passengers access to Etihad’s expansive network.
The codeshare is expected to enhance PIA’s service offerings and contribute to increased revenue, the spokesperson noted.

Almost all of its 19 Ramsar sites — wetlands of international importance designated as such under the Ramsar Convention — are ecologically impaired. For three-quarters of the year, the Indus delta, which is recognised by the WWF as a priority ecoregion in its Global 200 initiative, does not receive even the minimum amount of water (environmental flows) required to sustain its health. Pristine lakes have become contaminated bowls. The Indus, one of South Asia’s longest rivers, is imperilled by frequent obstructions, diversions and pollution. The principle of considering water bodies as living beings is thus violated.
Rivers are now being recognised and respected as living beings. Seen as the harbingers of life, rivers are a vital organ of our ecosystems. So far, 369 initiatives have been propagated for granting rights to nature — no longer considered a weird idea as rivers have already been granted legal rights in New Zealand, India, Bangladesh and some other countries.
 
 

In 1972, law professor Christopher Stone of the University of Southern California propounded the idea of vesting legal rights in natural objects. An unusual dream, it has now turned into reality in several countries. As of June 2023, the UN Harmony with Nature initiative had listed 30 countries with existing and proposed laws and policies on the rights of nature.
In 2008, Ecuador became the first state to include the ‘rights of nature’ in its constitution. The constitution recognised the rights of ‘Pachamama’ (Mother Earth) to “maintain and generate its cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes”. Following in Ecuador’s footsteps, in 2010, Bolivia adopted the ‘Law of the Rights of Mother Earth’, followed by the ‘Framework Law of Mother Earth and Integral Development for Living Well’.

Rivers are now being recognised as living beings.

In 2017, New Zealand set a new benchmark as the first country to give a river — the Whanganui — legal personhood. In the same year, the Ganges and Yamuna rivers were granted living-person status in India, effectively treating injury to rivers as injury to human beings. Later on, the Indian supreme court quashed the verdict based on the lack of practical application of the ruling. Also in 2017, Madhya Pradesh recognised the Narmada river as a living entity, in consideration of its religious significance and its importance for potable water and agriculture.
In 2019, the high court division of the Bangladesh’s supreme court ruled that the Turag river was a living entity and granted it legal personhood. The same status was extended to all rivers in the country. The court decreed that rivers be protected from pollution and encroachment.
In 2017, the Victorian government in Australia passed the Yarra River Protection Act to recognise the river as a living entity. Victoria adopted new legislation that recognised all waterways as living entities.
In Canada, the Minganie Regional County Municipality and the Innu Council of Ekuanitshit recognised the Magpie river as a legal person, granting it nine rights, including the rights to exist and flow. Meanwhile, Colombia’s Atrato river was granted the right to protection, conservation, maintenance and restoration. More significantly, it was accorded the right to have a legal guardian based on the decision of the constitutional court of Colombia.
Against this backdrop, the Indus river system merits a comprehensive appraisal. The environmental fragility of our aqua ecosystem tumbled below the critical threshold long ago. The Indus delta has been degraded to irreparable levels. In 2005, a panel of international exp­­-erts prescribed a minimum daily fl­­ow of 5,000 cusecs to maintain its ecological health. The pa­­nel also recommended a flush flow of 25 MAF once every five years. However, the minimum environmental flows are missing below Kotri Barrage except during the monsoons. Ironically, they are demonised as wastage of water due to lack of environmental literacy.
 
 

France recognised environmental flows in 1984 when it legislated for habitat protection through the legal minimum flow for existing and new dams under the French Environmental Code of 2000. The UK also recognised environmental flows as “minimum acceptable flows” under the Water Resources Act. Germany, too, made minimal flows for ecological consideration mandatory in 2010. The Swiss Residual Water Regulations provides assurance of adequate residual flow in a watercourse. In the US, the Connecticut legislature passed a law to protect environmental flows in 2005.
Pakistan should also adopt legislation for the rights of nature and instal environmental safeguards for its freshwater bodies and the Indus delta.

It said US President Donald Trump and Chinese Premier Li Qiang were expected to be present with leaders or representatives of Russia, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. Brazil President Lula da Silva and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will attend as observers at the Asean-related summits.
“This means Mr Modi will have the chance to meet all counterparts from the Quad and key founder members of Brics as well, as India prepares to host both summits in the next year, if he does travel to Kuala Lumpur this week,” The Hindu said.
It said although India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has not so far confirmed Mr Modi’s participation, Malaysian Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan announced last week that he would attend the Asean-related summits, including the EAS, and government officials said Mr Modi was “likely” to attend.

‘India is the only common factor between two groupings often antithetical to each other’, says The Hindu

India was meant to be the host of the Quad Summit this year, but with India-US tensions overshadowing the past few months, officials have indicated the Quad Summit could be held in 2026. India will also take over as chair of the Brics, and host the summit of the 11-nation grouping of emerging economies in 2026.
“India is the only common factor between the two groupings often antithetical to each other, as one includes the US and its allies, while the other includes Russia and China,” the paper said.
In addition, President Trump’s trade tariffs, threats against India for buying Russian oil, sanctions on Iran (a new Brics member), and threats to slap 100pc tariffs on the Brics members that he accuses of backing a common currency to counter the US dollar, have added to the strain.
“The downward trend in global economic growth, uncertainty in investment flows and interest rates, unilateral measures and supply chain disruptions have come to define the current international economic landscape,” MEA Secretary (Economic Relations) Sudhakar Dalela told a conference in Delhi last week.
“India’s Brics chairship comes at a time when the world is navigating through multiple challenges, particularly affecting the Global South countries,” he said, describing India’s plans to host the summit in the 20th year of Brics.
Meanwhile, Indian and American officials working on setting up the meeting between Mr Modi and Mr Trump at the sidelines of the Asean summit, have also been discussing scheduling the Quad summit, but no date has emerged thus far, a number of diplomatic sources told the paper.
If the US-India-Australia-Japan summit cannot be held this year, as is looking more likely, it will be the second year in a row that India-US tensions will have derailed New Delhi’s plans.

It just didn’t carry enough negative connotations; the rest of the world preferred sobriquets such as ‘failed state’ or ‘the most dangerous country in the world’. It left most of us who live in Pakistan with the sense that we had a tendency to attract attention for all the wrong reasons. And whatever our image, it wasn’t going to be one highlighting our softer attributes.
Now, it seems, we ourselves are trying to create a tough brand. Of being known as hard, a powerful state which no one can ride roughshod over, be it enemies within Pakistan or external.
These are not mere words. Just over the recent week, a protest originating from Lahore was not allowed to make its way to Islamabad, a destination which has been overrun by many others in the past. This was followed by a crackdown on the TLP, which had announced the protest, combined with allegations of state violence leading to loss of life. And while, the TLP itself has been guilty of violence on more than one occasion, the pattern of the state’s reaction has now become familiar. In the past couple of years, there have been protests in different parts of the country where political parties such as the PTI as well as citizen rights movements such as the PTM or BYC have all alleged loss of life. Religio-political organisations such as the TLP were treated a bit differently but not anymore. Those who convey the master’s message claim that the party will now be disbanded.
Around the same time, Islamabad’s relations with Kabul are also at an all-time low. It seems as if the time for playing nice is over and if the terrorist attacks in Pakistan continue, Islamabad will inflict pain on Afghanistan to change its big, bad ways. If earlier the pain was inflicted through refugee repatriation or border controls, now there will be more — the targeting of terrorists based there and skirmishes on the border. Over the weekend, these tensions led to our Gulf brethren entering the fray to soothe the two neighbours. What a turnaround; once seen as the patrons of the Afghan Taliban, Pakistan now needs intermediaries to make nice with them.

Picking so many battles leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time.

And these battles are being fought at a time when there are reports aplenty of another aggression from India. Be it official or unofficial voices, or even some from across the border, there are warnings enough of unfinished business on the eastern border. And what if this happens at a time when the western border is also tense? Especially as it’s not just the borders which can pose a threat? The tensions with both the neighbours are closely linked to the deteriorating security situation in two provinces — Balochistan and KP. Pakistan’s view is that the eastern and western neighbours are encouraging infiltration of terrorists and providing them with the finances. And so serious is this external factor that the debate over how the discontent in these provinces has been feeding into the violence has been abandoned.
 
 

In the tough posturing with aggressive neighbours and militant groups, there is confidence that Punjab and Sindh are under control. At this time and age, the absence of a mass people’s movement and violence means all is well. And if in one province, the water issue has led to simmering anger and in the other the government’s legitimacy is under question, these are smaller problems, for repression or concessions (as in Sindh on the water issue and in Azad Kashmir) can lead to a sense of quiet.
So much so that the state felt confident in cracking down on the TLP. Success has been declared, for there was no pushback and the street remained quiet. And there is so much applause that few are brave enough to ask what this will mean for the PML-N, whose members may have to face a backlash in their constituencies, as they did in 2018. This security threat will be an additional burden for them.
But overall, between the crackdowns on the people, parties, rights movements, militants and angry neighbours, it is difficult not to wonder whether the tough posturing or the effort at shaping a hard state may also be one that is overstretched. At odds with forces within as well as enemies without, what if the burden proves too much?
This is not to say it can’t win all these battles. Perhaps it can, though it is worth cautioning against excessive confidence. But there is another downside. Picking so many battles, especially with genuine grassroots movements or mainstream political parties, leaves the state in a mode of crisis management all the time.
Indeed, it is so busy fearing and controlling the people in general that it has no space and goodwill left to push through any reform which is politically hard. If an election has been managed in order to impose unpopular leaders, who is going to push the traders to pay taxes? It is easier to keep them happy and burden others. If a right-wing organisation has to be brought down, who will plan to improve the education sector and take on the wrath of the teachers who may take to the streets? One can only imagine decisions that have been postponed because Imran Khan and Ali Wazir have to be kept behind bars.
The list can go on and on. There is a price to be paid for this tough posturing. And what it really cost the hapless people of Pakistan will continue to be calculated for long after this period is over. For the moment, we can only guess what the eventual burden might be.

The groundbreaking ruling has strengthened protections for wor­k­ing women across the country.
The order came in response to a complaint filed by Ms. Zainab Zahrah Awan, who was terminated in April 2024 while on duly sanctioned maternity leave.
The Ombudsperson ruled that such termination not only viola­tes the Protection against Har­as­sment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, but also breaches fundamental constitutional rights — including dignity, equality, and protection of motherhood — guaranteed under Articles 14, 25, and 37 of the Constitution.

No woman should be forced to choose between her career and motherhood, ombudsperson rules

FOSPAH directed that Rs800,000 be paid to the complainant as compensation and Rs200,000 deposited into the national treasury, declaring the termination letter null and void and restoring the complainant’s employment status.
 
 

In her detailed judgement, the Om­­budsperson emphasised that maternity protections are non-negotiable and inviolable rights, reinforced by Pakistan’s commitments under international instruments such as CEDAW, ICESCR, and ILO conventions.
“Safe motherhood is not a favour — it is a fundamental right,” the order stated, adding, “No woman should be forced to choose between her career and motherhood.”
The Ombudsperson reaffirmed that all employers must uphold women’s dignity and equality at the workplace.
The decision sets a significant precedent for women’s workplace rights in Pakistan, underscoring that any termination during maternity leave is unlawful and amounts to gender-based discrimination.

The action came in an apparent response to an attack on the SNGPL team, in which security forces reportedly also suffered casualties. However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) or other security agencies about their losses until going to press.
Sources said the militants were killed after intelligence reports were received about their presence in a nearby jungle, prompting the security forces to launch an offensive in which eight suspects were gunned down.
 
 

Following the action, the forces cordoned off the area and initiated wide-ranging search-and-clearance operations in the surrounding terrain. Reinforcements were dispatched to secure the site and to pursue the fleeing suspects.

Two suspects killed in Swabi encounter; attack on Bannu police station repulsed

Officials told reporters that the slain militants allegedly were members of a cell that had been planning a direct attack on the pipeline project. They said the group intended to sabotage the installation — a project of national importance aimed at providing energy, employment and improved services to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Investigations were ongoing and local authorities said they would share further details as the clearance operation and forensic work proceeded.
Two killed in Swabi
Separately, two militants were killed in a joint operation conducted by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Mardan and the Swabi district police before midnight, Ziauddin Ahmad, the district police officer, said on Monday. The incident took place three days after a hand grenade was hurled at the Kalabat police post by unidentified men, in which a constable was martyred.
According to a separate press release, the CTD and Swabi police were engaged in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in mountainous Maini village when four alleged militants riding two motorcycles opened fire on the law enforcers.
“The CTD operation party retaliated with full vigour. As a result, terrorists were killed on the spot, and their two accomplices escaped, taking advantage of darkness,” said DPO Ahmad.
Soon after the incident, a search and strike operation was launched in the area. The slain men allegedly belonged to the TTP Tayyip Akbar Group and were wanted in numerous cases, including attacks on the police.
Attack repelled
Separately, an attack targeting the police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu district late Sunday night was thwarted by the police. A police official said that a group of militants attacked the police station with advanced light and heavy weapons in a bid to breach the building.
“But the personnel deployed there were fully alert as they had noticed the terrorists’ movements with the help of thermal vision cameras,” he said, adding that the law enforcers countered the attack vigorously and forced the assailants to flee.
The official said that after hearing about the attack on the police station, local residents armed with weapons also came out of their houses and assisted police in their action against terrorists. He said that all policemen remain safe in the attack.
 
 

Meanwhile, two policemen who had been kidnapped from the Peepal Bazaar in Bannu on Monday were freed by their captors. A police official said that two police officials, including Naheedullah and Eid Muhammad, were kidnapped by unknown armed men when they were returning to their duty place after performing their duty with the polio teams.

A long-term ceasefire was reached in Doha early on Sunday, where both sides pledged to continue the diplomatic process and find a permanent solution to the prevailing problem — cross-border incursions by Afghanistan-based terrorist groups. Qatar and Turkiye have played a key role in bringing about the truce, and representatives of both Islamabad and Kabul will meet in Istanbul on Saturday to take the process forward.
Though the Pakistani state and the Afghan Taliban once maintained cordial relations, matters have nosedived during the hard-line group’s second innings. At the heart of the matter is the sanctuary provided by the Afghan Taliban to the banned TTP and other militant groups that have staged bloody attacks in Pakistan. Though the Taliban deny this, there is overwhelming evidence that suggests that terrorist groups indeed have havens in Afghanistan.
 
 

Over the last few months, the attacks have increased significantly — over 600 attacks over the past year, according to one report — causing heavy casualties amongst Pakistani security men. It is because earlier attempts at dialogue failed to stop such attacks that the state took action, hitting militant targets across the border.
But while this may have sent a strong message to Kabul, if the hostilities continue, it will bode ill for peace in South Asia, as Pakistan will have to face adversaries on two hostile borders. Therefore, the state may have to combine deterrence through military means — in case of further attacks — with sustained diplomacy through common friends and regional allies to arrive at a long-term solution.
 
 

After the Doha parleys, the Taliban spokesman said there would be no “hostile actions” against Pakistan. While such promises have been made during earlier diplomatic encounters as well, for example earlier this year under Chinese auspices, it is hoped this time the Kabul regime is serious about stopping cross-border militant activity.
As Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar noted, a “verifiable monitoring mechanism” is needed to implement the broad details agreed to in Doha, which should be the goal during the next meeting in Turkiye. Though the Taliban may remain in denial, the international community agrees that they continue to host terrorist groups. Therefore, as the de facto government in Afghanistan, it is their duty to prevent these outfits from harming neighbouring states.
While some militant groups — the TTP, Al Qaeda — may respond to the Taliban ‘requests’, others, such as IS-K, are unlikely to oblige. However, it is the Taliban’s job as the governing entity in Afghanistan to ensure the security of regional states is not harmed by groups based on its soil.

• Stakeholders say malpractice has pushed textile mills towards costly imports, deepening financial woes
• Investigators allege armed men assault PCGA team 
LAHORE: A startling case of large-scale cotton adulteration has surfaced in Sindh, where a ginning factory in Tando Adam was allegedly found mixing cotton waste into high-grade lint to produce what industry insiders are calling “burger cotton.”
According to reports, a four-member monitoring team of the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) — formed to curb such malpractice — raided the factory after receiving credible complaints. However, the operation turned violent when the factory owner allegedly summoned nearly a hundred armed men who assaulted and detained the visiting committee members for several hours on Sunday.
The incident has sent shockwaves through the cotton ginning industry nationwide. In protest, an emergency meeting of the PCGA’s monitoring committee and Sindh-based ginners was convened in Tando Adam, where participants resolved to register an FIR against the factory management after the Diwali holidays.
Some ginners in collusion with textile mill representatives and laboratory staff, had been blending cotton waste into lint bales — a practice that has steadily eroded the quality of Pakistani cotton – for several years. This malpractice has discouraged textile mills from purchasing domestic cotton, pushing them instead towards costly foreign imports and deepening the industry’s financial crisis.
Ahead of the cotton year 2025-26, the PCGA had decided to expose such “black sheep” in the sector. Separate monitoring committees were set up for Punjab and Sindh with the authority to inspect ginning factories and take disciplinary action against violators.
The Sindh monitoring committee, led by well-known ginner Ramesh Lal, had already inspected several units since May. While a few factories were earlier found involved in adulteration and warned, no fresh complaints had surfaced until recently. Following renewed reports from textile buyers, a four-member team — comprising Haji Liaquat Ali Laskani, Seth Gopal Das, Seth Kishan Chand, and Seth Jay Dada — conducted a surprise raid on the Tando Adam factory.
According to the investigators, they discovered that three ginning units were operating within a single compound, where workers were pressing bales in a sophisticated manner — filling the outer layers with premium lint while packing the inner cores with cheap cotton waste. This ensured that laboratory samples taken from the surface appeared to meet quality standards.
As the committee members attempted to enter the facility, they reportedly faced stiff resistance. The factory owner called in over a hundred armed men, who beat and threatened the PCGA team at gunpoint before releasing them after considerable delay. Sources said heaps of cotton waste were seen openly being mixed into lint during the raid.
Ihsanul Haq, a representatives of the ginning industry said such adulterated lint, nicknamed “burger cotton” in Sindh, was being produced and sold at high prices with the alleged connivance of ginning owners, textile mill procurement agents, and lab staff — allowing all parties to profit while damaging the reputation of Pakistani cotton exports.
In the wake of the attack on the PCGA team, the PCGA monitoring committee and Sindh ginners held an emergency session in Tando Adam on Sunday evening, chaired by senior members of the association, to review the situation and finalise legal and disciplinary measures against those involved.
The meeting decided that All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) officials and major textile groups would be immediately informed about the reported mixing of cotton waste in the said ginning factory. Another meeting of cotton ginners was scheduled for Thursday, after the Diwali holidays, to formulate a strategy for strict disciplinary action against the concerned cotton ginner and to seek a ban on factories mixing cotton waste with quality lint.
The meeting further resolved to urge textile mill owners to dismiss those selectors and laboratory staff who, in collusion with ginning factory owners, blend cotton waste into quality lint. Participants stressed that producing high-quality cotton domestically would help significantly boost the country’s exports.
The association has also demanded immediate government protection for its inspection teams and a nationwide crackdown on adulterated lint production to safeguard the integrity of Pakistan’s cotton industry — a sector already struggling to maintain competitiveness in the international textile market.

The proposed name of the alliance makes the matter to be taken up for hearing by the ECP today (Tuesday) all the more interesting as they want the alliance to be registered as Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — the name of an opposition alliance led by Mehmood Khan Achakzai.
The  applicants include Pakistan Aman Tehreek Chairman Ali Sher Yousafzai,  Pakistan Falahi Tehreek Chairman Fazal Aman Khan, and Pakistan Welfare  Party Chairman Muhammad Farooq.
The TTAP, which sees the move as an attempt to take away its title and sabotage its resistance movement, has formed a legal team to defend its position before the ECP.

ECP set to review proposed name that matches nomenclature already in use by Achakzai-led opposition alliance

Those  who will appear before the ECP on behalf of the alliance and its  components include Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and retired Justice Shahid  Malik.
A source in the TTAP said the alliance had been formed to  resist unconstitutional and undemocratic moves and strive for the supremacy of the Constitution. He said alliances had been formed in the past which were not registered with the ECP but carried forward their respective movements. That is why the alliance had not been registered, he added.
 
 

Veteran politician Mahmood Khan Achakzai, who also heads his own Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), was made chairman of the TTAP, weeks after the February 8 general elections. The PTI, PkMAP and Balochistan National Party-Mengal are among the major parties of the alliance.
The alliance alleges that the mandate of PTI was stolen and it does not acknowledge the present government as a genuine representative of the voters. The opposition alliance recently put on hold its countrywide public meetings and protests, mainly, in the wake of floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.

The national side’s pace spearhead will lead Pakistan in the upcoming three-match series against South Africa.
 






Shaheen replaces Mohammad Rizwan as the Pakistan ODI skipper after the wicket-keeper led the team during a disastrous ICC Champions Trophy campaign before series losses in New Zealand and the West Indies.
Rizwan, handed captaincy in 2024, had led the team to series wins in South Africa, Australia and Zimbabwe in his early days as captain, however. But the recent failures apparently were a decisive enough factor for the Pakistan Cricket Board to sack Rizwan.
For Shaheen, it’s going to be a second stint as the Pakistan captain, the left-armer having been snubbed after a short spell — five T20Is against New Zealand — at the helm after replacing Babar Azam in late 2023 following Pakistan’s dismal World Cup campaign.
The 25-year-old, who has been captaining Pakistan Super League side Lahore Qalandars for the last few years, seems to be Pakistan white-ball head coach Mike Hesson’s pick as the team’s leader going into the build-up for the 2027 World Cup.
 
 

“Shaheen’s appointment for the upcoming series was finalised today following a meeting held in Islamabad, which was attended by white-ball head coach Mike Hesson, Director High Performance Aqib Javed and members of the selection committee,” a short press release by the PCB said.
Shaheen has represented Pakistan in 66 ODIs and 92 T20Is, taking a combined 249 wickets. In 32 Tests, excluding the ongoing second Test against South Africa at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, Shaheen has claimed 120 wickets.
The PCB regime, led by Mohsin Naqvi since February 2024, has chopped and changed captains repeatedly. It first removed Shaheen as captain to bring back Babar Azam as white-ball skipper in the first half of 2024.
Later, Babar, owing to the team’s poor performance in the T20 World Cup, decided to step down, after which Mohammad Rizwan was given the reins of the white-ball team.</p><small>2025-10-20 19:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629633-defence-minister-dismisses-ttp-talks-says-only-engaged-with-afghan-taliban' target='_blank'><strong>Defence minister rules out TTP talks, says Pakistan only engaging Afghan Taliban</strong></a><br><p>

A post on his Instagram account confirmed his demise, saying: “The news of the demise of Asrani ji, the king of laughter, ruling over millions of hearts has immersed us all in deep sorrow. He gave a new identity to Indian cinema with his unique acting, simplicity and humor. The life they put into every character, will live in our memories forever. Their departure is not just for the film industry, but the loss of everyone who ever smiled at their acting.”

Indian wire agency ANI reported that his last rites were performed at Santacruz Crematorium in the presence of his family.
His manager, Babu Bhai Thiba, told the outlet that Asrani died at 3pm at Arogya Nidhi Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra. “He is survived by his wife, sister, and nephew,” the manager added.
The outlet added that over his long and successful career, Asrani became one of Hindi cinema’s “most loved faces” who became known for his “perfect comic timing and screen presence”, adding that he appeared in over 350 films across five decades.
It added that he began his career in the 1960s and reached his peak in the 1970s, “when he became one of the most dependable character actors of the time”.
The media outlet further said that among his “most memorable roles” were in Mere Apne, Koshish, Bawarchi, Parichay, Abhimaan, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat and Rafoo Chakkar while among his hit films were Bhool Bhulaiyaa, Dhamaal, Bunty Aur Babli 2, R… Rajkumar, All The Best and Welcome, among others.
“However, one of his most iconic performances remains his role as the eccentric jail warden in the 1975 classic Sholay, which became a part of Indian pop culture and is still remembered today,” the report added.
The Indian Express reported that he was born in Jaipur on January 1, 1941. It added that while reflecting on the “enduring appeal” of his Sholay character, Asrani told the BBC earlier this year, “As Sholay completes 50 years, I can tell you — there has not been a single function or event where I haven’t been asked to recite those dialogues. It’s all because of Sippy saab’s direction and the writing of Salim-Javed. I got a chance to learn how to truly prepare for a role, and what a lesson it was. I salute Ramesh Sippy saab, I salute Salim-Javed saab. Even after 50 years, people still remember that role and those lines by heart.”
Various Indian celebrities paid tribute to the actor on his passing and told about the impact he left on them.

The two countries agreed to a ceasefire in Doha at the weekend after days of border clashes that killed dozens, the worst such violence since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021. Ground fighting between the one-time allies and Pakistani airstrikes across their contested 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control terrorists it says operate from safe havens in Afghanistan.
“Anything coming from Afghanistan will be [a] violation of this agreement,” Asif said in his office at Parliament in Islamabad. “Everything hinges on this one clause.”
 
 

The Taliban administration and Afghanistan’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“In the agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkiye and Qatar, it was clearly spelled out that there would not be any incursions,” the minister said.
“We have a ceasefire agreement as long as there is no violation of the agreement which is already in force.”
The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militant group operated out of Afghanistan to attack Pakistan “in connivance” with the Taliban, the defence minister said.
Kabul has previously denied such accusations.
In a separate interview to Al-Jazeera Arabic, he said the primary objective of the ceasefire agreement was to “eliminate the menace of terrorism”.
Asif added that terrorism has been affecting the Pak-Afghan border areas for years.
He elaborated that both countries concluded that the immediate eradication of terrorism was essential. The two sides, he added, would make serious efforts to curb terrorism; otherwise, regional peace could face grave threats.
Asif said the agreement was primarily reached through the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye, adding that both countries’ presence served as a guarantee for the accord.
The defence minister also appreciated the role played by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in facilitating the agreement.
Asif maintained that another meeting would be held next week in Istanbul to finalise the details of the agreement, and an effective mechanism would also be devised to resolve the existing issues between the two countries.
He further said that his Afghan counterpart had also acknowledged terrorism as the main cause of tension in bilateral relations, which would now be addressed.
The defence czar stated that Pakistan has suffered immense human and financial losses over the past years due to terrorism. However, he expressed hope that peace would now return and relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan would normalise.
As a result, he said, Pakistan-Afghanistan trade and transit activities would resume, enabling the latter to use the former’s ports once again.
Asif also added that Afghan refugees holding valid visas and documents would be allowed to stay in Pakistan. However, a large number of undocumented refugees would continue to be repatriated, he added.
The minister said it was premature to claim satisfaction over the resolution of all concerns. “We will have to see in the coming weeks and months how effectively the agreement is implemented,” he said.
In a separate interview to Arab News, he ruled out the notion that Pakistan had conducted the airstrikes in Kabul on the urging of the United States, saying: “It is total nonsense and nothing else.”
He questioned why Pakistan would do so, saying the country had had enough of its involvement in Afghanistan for the past few decades.
“We want to stay away and live like decent neighbours. We don’t want to have any involvement in Afghan affairs,” Asif said, adding that Pakistan had “no business” in Afghanistan’s relationship with India or any other country.
“Absolutely not. Whatever they want to do in their own territory and doesn’t spill over to our territory, doesn’t become our business.”
Doha talks and press release controversy
Speaking later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Asif said the Doha talks were not held in a bitter atmosphere and credited the Qatari and Turkish officials for it.
“Not even an opportunity for confrontation was provided on any conflicting point,” he said, adding that all talk of amendments and additions or deletions was done through the Qatari and Turkish officials.
“Direct interaction only happened at the opening, where both sides talked … but all of the engagement was done through Qatar and Turkiye.”
Asif added the draft agreement was only one page, contrary to a longer version he said was circulating on social media. He added that an upcoming meeting in Turkiye would further refine the details, such as the mechanism to implement the deal’s aspects.
Questioned about his own thoughts about whether the ceasefire would hold, the defence minister said: “I have guarded optimism on the matter; I am hopeful but also remain cautious. Can only say something conclusively given the circumstantial evidence. It is too early at the moment, we must remain hopeful of course.”
The minister added that he hoped that the Afghan Taliban would act as a “unified government” and conclude the matter with Pakistan instead of returning tomorrow and saying that separate factions were behind the tensions.
He elaborated that in the case of any violation, Qatar and Turkiye would be asked to play their role. Asif added that the mechanism for this entire process would be decided in the meeting on the October 25.
The defence minister also stated that the entire TTP leadership was present in Afghanistan, adding that the matter would be taken up in Istanbul as well. He further said that the talks should not be taken to mean that Pakistan would negotiate or hold talks with the TTP, dismissing such a notion.
Questioned about changes in Qatar’s press releases on the ceasefire with “tensions on the border” removed in a subsequent statement, Asif acknowledged that there was debate on wherever the word was used, but ultimately Qatar’s press release had nothing to do with the draft of the agreement, adding that he could not divulge its contents.
“It is between them. It has absolutely no effect on the agreement,” he said, adding that the incident had no particular implications as were being derived by others.</p><small>2025-10-20 18:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201114291fea1c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950135/positive-step-saudi-arabia-china-welcome-pakistan-afghanistan-ceasefire-affirm-support-for-peace-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>‘Positive step’: Saudi Arabia, China welcome Pakistan-Afghanistan ceasefire, affirm support for peace efforts</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia joined other nations on Monday in welcoming the ceasefire agreed between Pakistan and Afghanistan after days of border hostilities, affirming its support for efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability between the two countries.
 
 

The ceasefire was agreed early yesterday morning during talks between Afghan and Pakistani delegations in Doha with the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye. A next round of negotiations between the two sides is scheduled to be held in Istanbul on October 25.
A statement posted on the Saudi foreign ministry’s X account said it “expresses the kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s welcome of the signing by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Afghanistan of an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries, during the round of negotiations held in Doha.”
 






“The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security that achieves stability and prosperity for the brotherly peoples of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“This kingdom hopes that this positive step will lead to an end to tensions on the border between the two countries,” the statement said.
Saudi Arabia — which signed a defence pact with Pakistan last month under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both —  also appreciated the “diplomatic efforts and constructive role” of Turkiye and Qatar in mediating the ceasefire between Islamabad and Kabul.
Yesterday, Turkiye’s, Oman’s and Qatar’s foreign ministries had also issued statements welcoming the ceasefire.
China, Russia welcome Pak-Afghan ceasefire
Meanwhile, in separate statements issued on Monday, China and Russia welcomed the ceasefire agreement reached between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“China welcomes the immediate ceasefire agreed between Pakistan and Afghanistan and commends the peace effort of countries who contributed to the ceasefire,” the Chinese foreign ministry said.
China vowed to “continue playing a constructive role for the improvement and development of Pakistan-Afghanistan relations”.
 






Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, welcomed the agreement as well, calling on both countries to “expand their cooperation, including in countering terrorism,“ Anadolu Agency reported.
Islamabad and Kabul’s intention to engage in dialogue and resolve their disagreements through diplomatic means “forms the basis for maintaining peace between the two countries, which are friendly to us, and serves as an important factor in ensuring regional security,“ the Turkish news agency quoted her as saying.
Border clashes
The skirmishes on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan began on the night of October 11, when Afghan forces launched an attack on Pakistani border posts. According to the media affairs wing of the Pakistani military, its 23 troops were martyred in the clashes that continued into Oct 12 while over 200 Taliban and affiliated militants were killed.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
Later, clashes again broke out on the night of Oct14 along the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram sector. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said
the Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khawarij — the term state has designated for the banned  terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — had tried to attack Pakistani border posts in the area but the attacks were effectively repulsed.
Subsequently on Oct 15, the ISPR said security forces had repulsed another attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban.
However, the Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid alleged earlier in the day that Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in the Spin Boldak district of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province.
Later in the day, state media reported citing security sources that Pakistan had carried out precision strikes in Afghan capital Kabul and the province of Kandahar, targeting terrorists’ hideouts and leadership.
This was a little before a 48-hour ceasefire was announced between the two sides. Dawn reported that it was the second ceasefire between the neighbours since hostilities erupted on Oct 11, though the first truce was not publicly announced. It quoted diplomatic insiders as saying that both Saudi Arabia and Qatar had intervened on that occasion to defuse tensions.
The ceasefire was extended on October 17.
While delegations from Pakistan and Afghanistan were expected to meet in Doha for talks to end border hostilities, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Oct 17, according to a Dawn report.
It said incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province, as security sources claimed that precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, reportedly killing dozens of fighters.
This development followed a gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan.
The border clashes had erupted against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists.
Pakistan has been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan, since the TTP broke a ceasefire deal with the government and vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Islamabad had hoped for cooperation on counterterrorism, particularly against TTP. Instead, the Taliban’s refusal to rein in the TTP has become the core irritant.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations.</p><small>2025-10-20 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20190720320684e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950169/weather-out-of-our-control-but-trying-our-best-to-make-the-semis-says-rameen-ahead-of-south-africa-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Weather out of our control but trying our best to make the semis, says Rameen ahead of South Africa clash</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan bowler Rameen Shamim said on Monday that although the weather was out of their control, the team was trying their best to make the semi-finals ahead of their pivotal South Africa ICC Women’s World Cup encounter on Tuesday.
Monsoon rains in Colombo have seen Pakistan’s last two matches end in washouts against England and New Zealand, respectively, costing the team a chance to pick up more points in their last-four push.
The washed-out New Zealand fixture on Saturday saw South Africa become the second team to qualify for the semi-finals of the tournament, with the Green Shirts still searching for their first win.
Speaking at the pre-match press conference in Colombo, Rameen said: “Yeah, obviously, rain is not in our control. We cannot control the weather. Yeah, unfortunately, we are upset because we were up to the mark against England.
“… But we are confident because we played some good cricket in the last two matches. And now we have to play against South Africa and Sri Lanka.”
The off-spinner added that playing a series against South Africa in the lead-up to the World Cup would come in handy going into the Tuesday clash.
“We are really prepared against them because we have played a series against South Africa before this World Cup. So, we know what to do in the next two matches, and our aim is just to win those two matches,” she said.
The Green Shirts played a home series in Lahore in September against the Proteas, where they lost the first two games before beating the visitors in the final ODI on a spin-friendly track.
 
 

They also faced each other in a World Cup practice match in Colombo ahead of the tournament itself, where the Proteas won by four wickets.
Although the conditions at the R. Pramedasa Stadium have been seamer-friendly, the pitch has seen turn later in the innings and with the pitches getting older as the tournament progresses — Pakistan will be looking for a spin-friendly pitch like Lahore from last month.
The Pakistan bowler added that although the circumstances for the semis were not in their control, adding, “We just want to win those upcoming matches and just leave our mark.”
South African pacer Masabata Klaas also alluded to the challenge Pakistan posed going into the encounter.
“Oh, obviously Pakistan is [a] strong team. We cannot just go there and think that we’re just going to walk in the park. But then one thing that’s going to work for us is to stick to basics and do what we’ve been doing from day one of the World Cup,” the right-arm medium pacer said.
She added that her side would not be taking the Green Shirts for granted.
The Proteas go into the clash with a result in a rain-affected encounter in Colombo against Sri Lanka — where they won by 10 wickets in a 20-over contest.
For Pakistan, their skipper Fatima Sana’s form with the ball has been a positive going into this must-win encounter. The right-arm pacer has taken nine wickets at an outstanding average of 16 so far.
The Women in Green will also be looking for the weather to relent in the Sri Lankan capital, which caused their pre-match practice session to be moved indoors yet again — at an alternate venue near the Sinhalese Sports Club.
 






What needs to fire for the Green Shirts is their batting, which again faltered in their stop-start clash against New Zealand — with the scoreline at  92-5 with half their batting innings to go.
A much improved batting performance — and results from the rest of the World Cup matches somehow going in their favour is what the Green Shirts need to sneak past the rains and book a berth in the semi-finals.</p><small>2025-10-20 17:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629597-no-room-for-hatred-terrorism-affirms-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>'No room for hatred, terrorism', affirms PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

The meeting came in the wake of a feud between the PPP and PML-N, coalition partners in the federation, that has seemed to cool down for now. Ties between the allies came under immense strain recently as they engaged in a war of words over flood relief, after Bilawal asserted that the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by floods in the country, while Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz accused his party of “politicising” the issue.
Concerted efforts were made by leading figures, such as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari, who stepped in to defuse tensions, with the latter also calling on Naqvi to play his role for a possible rapprochement.
A statement from the PPP issued today said Bilawal met Naqvi and discussed issues of mutual interest, political affairs and the country’s situation, with the latter informing the PPP chairman on the steps taken to establish peace and security in the country amid a tense situation on both the international and domestic fronts.
 






Expressing his satisfaction with the measures, Bilawal said: “Current challenges can be faced only through unity and consensus,” while Naqvi was similarly quoted by the statement as saying: “Everyone has to work together for the internal stability of Pakistan.”
After weeks of acrimony between the ruling allies, the two main parties in the ruling coalition seemed to make a breakthrough on Thursday, with a PPP leader claiming the prime minister had acceded to one of their main demands.
“The prime minister has agreed to utilise BISP for helping flood victims and that the PPP will be taken on board while decision-making about flood victims and farmers,” PPP Information Secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan had told Dawn.
The understanding, he said, was reached during a meeting at the Prime Minister’s House with a PPP delegation led by Bilawal. All eyes will now be on how the premier convinces the PML-N-led Punjab government. Chan said the PM had agr­eed to all the PPP’s demands “as they were justified and logical”.
Before charting its future course, the PPP has decided to adopt a wait-and-see policy, giving the government one month to act on promises made by PM Shehbaz on its demands.
The development came after an hour-long meeting of its central executive committee on Saturday that covered a wide range of issues, including the PPP’s strained relations with the PML-N, the post-flood situation, recent tensions with Afghanistan and the ongoing economic challenges faced by the country.</p><small>2025-10-20 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20214458812bb74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950180/two-aswj-workers-shot-dead-in-suspected-targeted-attack-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Two ASWJ workers shot dead in ‘suspected targeted attack’ in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>At least two people, both workers of the outlawed Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ), were shot dead in a suspected targeted attack in the Nagan Chowrangi area of Karachi on Monday.
The attack comes over a week after another worker of the ASWJ was shot dead on the main University Road in Karachi, while in a separate attack in March, a local leader of the party was shot.
“A religious scholar-cum-shopkeeper and his employee were shot dead in a suspected targeted attack at Nagan Chowrangi on Monday evening,” SSP Central Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi told Dawn.com.
The incident occurred near an ASWJ office, he said.
“Armed pillion riders resorted to direct fire on the shopkeeper and his employee and fled,” said Siddiqi, adding that the incident “appeared to be a targeted killing” but the exact motive has not yet been ascertained.
“They sustained critical bullet injuries and were transported to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors pronounced them dead on arrival,” added the police official.
“The deceased have been identified as 32-year-old Shah Ahmed, and 30-year-old Abu Bakar,” New Karachi police said in a separate statement.
“One of the deceased, Shah Ahmed, used to sell caps and perfumes,” SSP Central told Dawn.com.
Giving details of the investigation, he said, “Investigators have collected five bullet casings fired from a 9mm pistol. CCTV footage has also been obtained from the spot”.
AWSJ spokesperson Umar Muawiyah, told Dawn.com that the incident marked the second such attack against their party leaders in recent times, decrying the lack of security around their head office at Nagan Chowrangi.
However, Siddiqi told Dawn.com that they had enhanced vigilance in the area “informally.”
The ASWJ, a splinter group of the Sipah-e-Sahaba (SS), was formed after the government of former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf banned a handful of religious parties, including the SS in 2002.
In a first, suspect arrested via ‘facial recognition’
Separately, in a first for Karachi Police, a man was arrested using a “facial recognition” camera.
Detailing the development, South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said, “an alert was received by ERV data operator that a motorcycle rider was passing through an area having a criminal history”.
“EVR staff immediately responded, stopped the person and checked his CNIC”, confirming the suspect’s identity.
DIG South, in his statement said, “There were six FIRs registered against him including under terror charges, Telegraph Act at different police stations.”
“He was arrested in five cases in the recent past while was declared as absconder in other cases,” he added.</p><small>2025-10-20 17:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629615-naqvi-bilawal-call-for-unity-among-political-parties-for-pakistans-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Naqvi, Bilawal call for unity among political parties for Pakistan's stability</strong></a><br><p>

Khan, who hails from Mardan, rose to fame back in 2016 when a photographer shared a photo of him pouring tea on Instagram, which went viral. He approached the LHC in April against the blocking of his identity documents by Nadra and the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports.
An order issued today by LHC Justice Justice Jawad Hassan noted that the petitioner informed the court his grievance was redressed.
“Learned counsel for the petitioner … submits that after this court had taken cognizance of the matter, the competent authority called the petitioner to appear before the verification board constituted at the concerned office of Nadra and after due verification, his CNIC has been unblocked, thereby redressing his grievance,” the order noted.
It added that Khan’s counsel said the petitioner did not want to proceed with the main writ petition since his CNIC was unblocked by Nadra, also confirmed by the law officer after obtaining instructions from the concerned quarters.
The judge subsequently dismissed the main petition, noting it had “borne fruit”.
Speaking to the media after the hearing, Barrister Umer Ijaz Gilani said the issue was taken up at the government’s “highest level”, after which the verification process was initiated by Nadra, with the result being that the CNIC was determined to be wrongfully blocked.
Khan himself said he was a Pakistani and would always remain one.
Khan, who used to work at Islamabad’s Sunday Bazaar on Peshawar Chowk, had become popular overnight. Within no time, countless people had begun visiting his shop just to take selfies with him and soon, a modeling agency also entered into a deal with him and shot a few commercials to make good use of the craze.</p><small>2025-10-20 16:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201627245739e20.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950159/cm-afridi-blames-centres-flawed-policy-for-terrorism-resurgence-in-kp' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi blames Centre’s ‘flawed policy’ for terrorism resurgence in KP</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.
The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations, which are also resisted by tribal people as they often lead to displacements.
Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan. A military operation looms over the Kurram district, where people have started leaving their homes, while a targeted action is planned in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil.
In his first official high-level meeting since he assumed the role of the KP CM on October 15, Afridi presented “important policy directives and announcements”, a post on his office’s X account said.
“Terrorism has returned to the province due to the federal government’s wrong policy,” the post quoted CM Afridi as saying.
He further claimed that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other Constitutional rights”.
 






“The Centre should realise our sacrifices and release our funds on time. We can only strengthen our police and combat terrorism once we get our funds,” the chief minister said, lauding the KP police’s “unparalleled sacrifices” to eradicate terrorism.
“The bulletproof cars provided by the interior minister (Mohsin Naqvi) are defective and old. This is a mockery of KP Police. These vehicles should be recalled,” Afridi said.
Affirming that law and order were the provincial government’s top priority, he vowed there would be no compromise on it.
“The police would not face a shortage of funds. All required resources will be provided on a priority basis. The police will be equipped with modern equipment and arms.”
Responding to the KP chief minister later in the day, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry alleged that funds provided by the federal government were not appropriately used by the provincial government in the fight against terrorism.
He asserted that the vehicles dismissed as being inferior by the chief minister were of international standards and the same as those used by federal ministers, institutional officers and anti-terror operations.
“Losses are close to zero wherever these vehicles are used.”
The state minister alleged that the provincial police was being thrown before terrorists with the move and nothing was being made available to it. He said the move reflected CM Afridi’s “immature thinking”, proved his detractors right and increased the threat to law enforcement agencies.
“This is a highly unfortunate decision.”
 






Afridi vows no MPO detention or ‘political’ cases
CM Afridi also vowed that “no political individual” will be detained in KP under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, which gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected individuals to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order.
In a petition to the Supreme Court last year, PTI founder Imran Khan sought a bar on “indiscriminate and unlawful use of detention orders” under the MPO against political workers, rights activists and political opponents.
 
 

“Freedom of expression and constructive criticism is a fundamental Constitutional right of everyone,” Afridi was quoted as saying in the post.
He further said that no one will be arrested under a “political” first information report (FIR).
“These FIRs were registered due to political vendetta. The province has its own specific political culture; we will not let it be ruined. The [KP] police will never subject anyone to political vendettas. No FIR should be registered against any student,” said Afridi, who has remained the provincial president of the PTI’s student wing, the Insaf Students Federation (ISF).
“The situation of KP Police should under no circumstances be like that of Punjab Police,” the chief minister quipped, ordering strictly that there should be no torture of prisoners.
While vowing there would be no political interference in the police, the KP CM also warned that there should be no public complaints against it. He further said there should be separate enclaves for the police and the media in the provincial government’s housing schemes.
‘Strict action against those who succumbed to pressure’
While alleging that there was an attempt to “steal the public mandate” during the 2024 general elections in KP, Afridi hailed the provincial bureaucracy and police for “protecting the mandate of the province’s people”.
“However, unfortunately, some government officials could not bear the pressure and did not protect the public mandate,” the PTI leader said.
He vowed to reward those who stood with the people during last year’s elections and to take “strict action” against those who did not do so, directing the chief secretary to identify such people.
CM Afridi further asserted, “Zero-tolerance policy against corruption is our party’s most important agenda. […] Strict action will be taken against whoever engages in corruption.”
The chief minister also warned that if the public was not satisfied with any government official’s performance, that official would be removed from their role.
“I have not come to work in the traditional way. We will have to work outside the traditional manner,” Afridi was quoted as saying.
 
 

He also announced the establishment of Tribal Medical College and Tribal University of Modern Sciences for the merged districts, adding that playgrounds will be built on the tehsil level in all merged districts (erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas). A Safe City project aimed at reducing crime was also announced for these areas.
The PTI leader said a “University of Investigation and Modern Journalism” dedicated to slain journalist Arshad Sharif will be built, while announcing another Revival Plan for Peshawar’s development.
The chief minister also pledged to end the “reference culture” for postings and transfers of government employees and to ensure implementation of the two-year policy for these.</p><small>2025-10-20 15:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20185220fbdf97b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950171/tiktok-removed-254m-videos-in-pakistan-in-second-quarter-of-2025' target='_blank'><strong>TikTok removed 25.4m videos in Pakistan in second quarter of 2025</strong></a><br><p>Popular video-sharing platform Tiktok removed more than 25 million videos over community guidelines violations in Pakistan, in the second quarter of 2025 (April-June), its Community Guidelines Enforcement Report said on Monday.
Tiktok has repeatedly been banned in the country by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) over complaints about indecent and immoral content. The first such ban came in October 2020, but was lifted 10 days later, after the company assured the telecom regulator that it would block accounts “spreading obscenity.”
According to a press release, the popular video-sharing platform said, “TikTok removed a total of 25,448,992 videos in Pakistan for Community Guidelines violations.”
“TikTok proactively removed 99.7 per cent of the videos, with 96.2pc of these videos removed within 24 hours,” added the platform.
“The report, which covers data from April to June 2025, details the proactive steps TikTok has taken to identify and remove content that violates its Community Guidelines, ensuring a positive experience for its global community,” the press release said.
Globally, the platform removed “a total of 189m videos,” which accounted for 0.7pc of all content uploaded on the platform.
The statement continued: “Of the removed videos, 163,962,241 videos were detected and taken down using automated detection technologies, while 7,457,309 videos were reinstated after further review.”
“The proactive removal rate stood at 99.1pc, with 94.4pc of the flagged content removed within 24 hours of posting,” it added.
On the matter of fake accounts, the platform said, “to uphold TikTok’s integrity,
in this quarter, the platform has removed 76,991,660 fake accounts, along with the an additional 25,904,708 accounts that were suspected to be under the age of 13.”
“A significant portion of total removed videos globally —30.6pc —contained sensitive or mature themes that did not align with TikTok’s content policies,” it said.
“An additional 14pc of videos breached the platform’s safety and civility standards, while 6.1pc violated privacy and security guidelines.”
“45pc of the removed videos were flagged as misinformation, and 23.8pc of the
videos removed were flagged as edited media and AI-generated content,” added the video-sharing platform.
In their Q1 2025 report, the platform said it had removed 24,954,128 videos in Pakistan between January and March.</p><small>2025-10-20 14:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20123541e8fdb71.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950138/shan-leads-from-the-front-as-pakistan-make-wasteful-south-africa-pay-in-second-test' target='_blank'><strong>Shan leads from the front as Pakistan make wasteful South Africa pay in second Test</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan punished poor catching from South Africa to accumulate 259-5 on the opening day of the second and final Test in Rawalpindi on Monday.
Had the tourists not dropped five catches on a turning pitch they would have been in a better position after Pakistan won the toss and batted.
Skipper Shan Masood, dropped on 71 off a luckless Keshav Maharaj, top-scored with 87 while Abdullah Shafique — dropped four times — made 57.
Saud Shakeel and Salman Agha will resume on Tuesday unbeaten on 42 and 10 respectively, with the home team seeking a 2-0 series win against the world Test champions.
South African pacer Kagiso Rabada trapped Mohammad Rizwan with the fifth delivery with the second new ball for 19 to give some respite to his team.
Maharaj, who missed the first Test in Lahore through injury, took 2-63 and fellow spinner Simon Harmer 2-75.
With the bulk of the bowling done by Maharaj and Harmer, spinner Senuran Muthusamy — who took 11 wickets in the first Test — was surprisingly used for just four overs.
The final session also saw Masood fall to an uppish sweep off Maharaj, caught by Marco Jansen, after hitting two fours and three sixes in his innings.
Earlier, Shafique’s chancy knock finally ended when he edged Harmer to wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne after adding an invaluable 111 runs for the second wicket with skipper Masood.
The struggling Babar Azam, again cheered by a home crowd willing him to return to form, was dismissed for just 16 when Tony de Zorzi took a low catch at silly point for Maharaj’s first wicket.
Azam has gone 29 Test innings without a century.
Maharaj himself dropped Shafique on 15 off his own bowling and then saw Aiden Markram drop the same batter on 41 and 53.
Shafique also survived on nine when a Jansen delivery rolled onto the stumps but did not dislodge the bails.
Shafique admitted he was lucky.
“You need luck in cricket and I was lucky today,” said Shafique.

“Catches get dropped in cricket and today we benefitted from them and now we need to post a 350-plus total from here.”

In the morning session South Africa’s only breakthrough came from Harmer, who bowled Imam-ul-Haq for 17 with a sharp turner that beat the bat and hit off-stump.
Rabada was also unlucky when Tristan Stubbs dropped Shafique in the slips off the fourth ball of the match when he was on nought.
“It was an even day because we controlled their run rate,” said Maharaj.
“We know how important are catches but no-one means to drop catches although it was frustrating.”
Having won the first Test in Lahore by 93 runs, Pakistan included a third spinner in Asif Afridi, dropping fast bowler Hasan Ali.
At 38 years and 299 days, Asif became the second oldest Pakistani Test debutant, behind Miran Bakhsh, who made his debut at 47 years and 284 days against India in 1955.
