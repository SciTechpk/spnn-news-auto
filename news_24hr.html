The order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, also said that the seven petitions had been dismissed over non-prosecution. It also mentioned that it was for the court to determine how to regulate its proceedings and “it cannot be dictated to by the advocates”.
Yesterday, commotion was witnessed at the SHC after a two-judge  constitutional bench, comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, dec­lined to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea
to become a party in proceedings on the seven petitions. The bench set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions.
Lawyers for the petitioners, however, objected to the jurisdiction of the bench and urged the court to decide their objections first.
The proceedings drew a large number of lawyers inside and outside the courtroom, with many shouting slogans, clapping and later staging a protest outside the SHC against one of the judges. The petitioners and their lawyers also walked out of the courtroom in protest over their objections not being addressed and the court’s refusal to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea.
In its order released today, the SHC bench recalled that when Advocate Ebrahim Saifuddin was called from among the petitioners’ lawyers for arguments on maintainability, he declined to present his arguments. “According to him this court was required to first decide the preliminary objections raised by Salahuddin Ahmed and Faisal Siddiqui.”
The order also referred to Advocate Saifuddin with regards to another petition, mentioning that when he was directed to present arguments on the maintainability of the plea, he left the courtroom.
Similarly, the bench observed, when Advocate Siddiqui was called to address the court on the question of maintainability, he argued that objections regarding the jurisdiction of the court should be decided first. “When his request was declined by the bench, he left the courtroom stating that he would not proceed any further.”
About Advocate Salahuddin Ahmed, the order stated that upon being called for arguments on the issue of maintainability, the lawyer insisted that objections he had raised regarding an earlier order dated September 22 be decided first. Advocate Ahmed, too, refused to address the matter of maintainability and left the court, the order added.
Regarding other pleas, the bench noted that the counsels for the petitioners were not present at the time and might have left the court room.
On these grounds, the court dismissed the petitions for non-prosecution. The order stated that the counsels were given the opportunity to be heard and address the maintainability of the pleas, which they “deliberately” did not avail.
In its order, the court also touched upon the dismissal of Justice Jahangiri’s application to become a party in the proceedings on pleas against the cancellation of his degree.
Justice Jahangiri, “with the permission of the court, addressed this court with dignity and patience, however not on the point of any petition or listed application, which, if any, are accordingly dismissed for non-prosecution as he also left the courtroom despite being given an opportunity of being heard on any petition or listed application”.
“The petitioners and the intervener (Justice Jahangiri) have wilfully refused to pursue this matter and walked out during the hearing when asked to argue on the maintainability of these petitions. The reasons are obvious, demonstrating a deliberate lack of interest and constituting a gross abuse of the process of the court,” the order read.
It further stated that superior courts had the “inherent power” to dismiss constitutional petitions for non-prosecution or default to regulate proceedings under Article 199 of the Constitution — which defines the jurisdiction of a high court — in cases where “a persistent lack of diligence justifies [the] dismissal”.
Regarding yesterday’s proceedings, the order further stated that the lawyers “began raising slogans against the judiciary and completely disrupted the decorum of the court. Such conduct is highly unbecoming and not expected from senior members of the legal profession. Prima facie, such conduct amounts to contempt of court”.
However, it continued, “by way of indulgence and by showing maximum judicial restraint, we have decided to refrain ourselves from issuing any such notices”.
The order also explained that objections raised by Advocates Ahmed and Siddiqui largely pertained to a court order dated September 22. “It was a judicial order that was still in the field,” the court observed, adding that the appropriate course for the lawyers would have been to approach the Supreme Court.
Addressing objections regarding the “bias of the bench”, the court stated that “it is well settled now that whether a judge recuses or not is his decision based on his conscience. Neither of us were of the view that any ground for recusal was made out”.
Referring back to the “rumpus” during the proceedings, the court directed the registrar to preserve all CCTV recordings and any audio recording of inside and outside the courtroom from September 25.
Filing of the petitions
The case pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s degree centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations.
The seven petitions that have been dismissed were filed last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the KU syndicate, challenging decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU’s decision, restraining the university from taking coercive measures.
The court had observed that every citizen’s right to fair trial was protected but that no hearing had been provided to Justice Jahangiri before the cancellation of the degree, which appeared obj­ec­­tionable, illegal and without authority.
The petitions were fixed for Thursday’s hearing after the Sindh Higher Education Commission (SHEC) filed an urgent application seeking vacation of the interim stay order.</p><small>2025-09-26 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26151548d5fbaa0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944760/uk-to-launch-digital-id-scheme-to-curb-illegal-migration' target='_blank'><strong>UK to launch digital ID scheme to curb illegal migration</strong></a><br><p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday announced plans for a new nationwide digital ID in a bid to curb illegal migration, but the move faces strong opposition in country that has long-resisted such moves.
The new digital ID will be held on people’s phones and there will be no requirement for individuals to carry or be asked to produce it, said the government.
However, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” a statement said.
 
 

“This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key ‘pull factors’ for people who come to the UK illegally,” it added.
The government said the drive will also make it simpler to apply for services like driving licences, childcare and welfare, while streamlining access to tax records.
The announcement comes as Labour, the party in government, prepares to hold its annual conference, with Starmer under intense pressure, particularly over immigration.
“Digital ID is an enormous opportunity for the UK … it will also offer ordinary citizens countless benefits,” Starmer said.
“We are doing the hard graft to deliver a fairer Britain for those who want to see change, not division,” he added.
The UK has traditionally resisted the idea of identity cards and does not have a central civilian registry or identification requirements in public.
The Conservative-led government in 2011 repealed legislation by Tony Blair’s government that created voluntary national identity cards and a resident registry database.
Political opposition
Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservatives, wrote on X that her party “will oppose any push by … the government to impose mandatory ID cards on law abiding citizens.
“We will not support any system that is mandatory for British people or excludes those of us who choose not to use it from any of the rights of our citizenship,” she added.
 






The left-wing Liberal Democrats also said that they “cannot support a mandatory digital digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives”.
And Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party that polls predict will form the next government, said: “I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.”
 






A petition demanding that ID cards not be introduced had collected more than 650,000 signatures early on Friday, but recent polling suggests majority support for the move among the public.
At the moment, UK citizens generally use driving licences, passports and utility bills as means of identification, depending on the situation.
The government says is “will listen to a range of views on how the service will be delivered”, as part of a public consultation to be launched later this year.
It also promised that the scheme will be available for those who aren’t able to use a smartphone.
“The public consultation will engage with groups who aren’t as experienced with the digital world, like the homeless and older people, learning from other countries that have done this well,” said the government statement.</p><small>2025-09-26 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/261419467cbd0c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944755/quetta-atc-refuses-to-extend-byc-chief-mahrang-balochs-physical-remand-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>Quetta ATC refuses to extend BYC chief Mahrang Baloch’s physical remand: lawyer</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Friday refused to extend the physical remand of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers, according to the group’s lawyer.
Advocate Israr Jatak, a member of BYC’s legal team, told Dawn.com, “Quetta ATC-1 refused to extend the physical remand of five accused, namely Mahrang, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Beberg Baloch and Gulzadi and ordered them to be sent to jail on judicial remand.”
In a hearing presided over by Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) produced Mahrang and others in court today after the completion of their 15-day physical remand granted on September 11.
Advocate Shoaib Mengal, along with Advocate Jatak, appeared in the court on behalf of the accused.
The CTD requested the court for an extension to the physical remand of the accused, but Judge Mubeen refused, asking for the accused to be handed over to jail custody.
On September 11, a Quetta ATC judge extended the physical remand of Dr Mahrang and other organisers of the group on the police’s request.
The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.  Mahrang, along with other BYC members, was arrested on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”. The arrests were made a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
She was taken into custody under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order — for a period of 30 days (first term). Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2025-09-26 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26143418efcd7b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944754/5-people-including-2-cops-injured-in-accidental-firing-at-balochistan-governors-residence-in-zhob-police' target='_blank'><strong>5 people, including 2 cops, injured in accidental firing at Balochistan governor’s residence in Zhob: police</strong></a><br><p>At least five people, including two cops, were injured on Friday in an accidental firing incident at the residence of Balochistan Governor Jaffar Khan Manndokhail in the province’s Zhob district, police said.
Speaking to the media, Zhob Superintendent of Police (SSP) Shaukat Mohmand said that three students and two police officers had been injured in the incident.
“The firing happened by mistake and was done by the station house officer’s gunman,” the police officer said. He added that the gunman had dropped his gun on the ground, which had resulted in it going off.
The injured students, who had come to meet the governor, were pupils at the Zhob Government Boys Degree College, he added.
The official said that the condition of all the injured people was stable and they had been taken to a nearby hospital for medical intervention.
According to initial investigations, police have termed the incident an accident, he said, adding that further investigation was underway.
Earlier this month, a teenage girl was killed when the gun she was cleaning accidentally went off at her home in Sindh’s Abdul Rehman Shar village.
Last year, a minor boy was killed on the spot in Karachi when the pistol of his father accidentally went off.</p><small>2025-09-26 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26140115f883548.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944753/million-year-old-skull-could-change-human-evolution-timeline' target='_blank'><strong>Million-year-old skull could change human evolution timeline</strong></a><br><p>A digital reconstruction of a million-year-old skull suggests humans may have diverged from our ancient ancestors 400,000 years earlier than thought and in Asia not Africa, a study said on Friday.
The findings are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990, and have the potential to resolve the longstanding “Muddle in the Middle” of human evolution, researchers said.
But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed, and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.
The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.
But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.
“This changes a lot of thinking,” said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.
“It suggests that by one million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,” he added.
If the findings are correct, it suggests there could have been much earlier members of other early hominins, including Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, the study says.
It also “muddies the waters” on longstanding assumptions that early humans dispersed from Africa, said Michael Petraglia, director of Griffith University’s Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, who was not involved in the research.
“There’s a big change potentially happening here, where east Asia is now playing a very key role in hominin evolution,” he told AFP.
‘A lot of questions’
The research, published in the journal Science, used advanced CT scanning, structure light imaging and virtual reconstruction techniques to model a complete Yunxian 2.
The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.
The resulting model “shows a distinctive combination of traits,” the study said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.
But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, the researchers said.
“Yunxian 2 may help us resolve what’s been called the “Muddle in the Middle”, the confusing array of human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago,” Stringer said in a press release.
Much about human evolution remains debated, and Petraglia said the study’s findings were “provocative” though grounded in solid work.
“It’s sound, but I think the jury’s still out. I think there will be a lot of questions raised,” he said.
Andy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was “not always a perfect indicator for human evolution”.
“They’ve got this interpretation that I just don’t really think is taking into account the genetic histories of these things that we do know,” he told AFP.
The findings are only the latest in a string of recent research that has complicated what we thought we knew about our origins.
Homo longi, also known as “Dragon Man”, was itself only named as a new species and close human relative in 2021, by a team that included Stringer.
The authors said their work illustrates the complexity of our shared history.
“Fossils like Yunxian 2 show just how much we still have to learn about our origins,” said Stringer.</p><small>2025-09-26 09:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26133537f5d6f74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944746/imaan-mazari-files-grievance-letter-over-inaction-in-workplace-harassment-case-against-ihc-cj-dogar' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari files grievance letter over ‘inaction’ in workplace harassment case against IHC CJ Dogar</strong></a><br><p>Rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir on Friday filed a grievance letter over “inaction” on her workplace harassment complaint against Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar.
Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had issued condemnatory statements and called for the judge’s dismissal from the post of the IHC top judge.
On Sept 15, Mazari approached an inquiry committee of the IHC and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), filing a complaint under Section 4 (procedure for holding inquiry) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010.
As Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz took cognisance of Mazari’s complaint, the IHC  administration stripped the judge of her powers to entertain harassment complaints. Instead, IHC’s Justice  Inaam Ameen Minhas was appointed as the competent authority to oversee the case. This prompted Mazari to approach the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against Justice Dogar’s shunting of a female judge for taking up a harassment complaint against him.
In today’s letter, addressed to Justice Minhas — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — Mazari said that the competent authority under the act was “required to communicate the charges to the accused within three days of receipt of the complaint, and the accused was required to submit a written defense within seven days from when the charge was communicated to him”.
“I am unaware of the status of my complaint, as I have not been informed by the competent authority in this regard,” she wrote.
Mazari called for a “clear urgency” to address the matter, saying, “I request redressal of my grievances at the earliest.”
She also brought up the matter of Justice Imtiaz’s removal as the competent authority and the appointment of Justice Minhas as a replacement, saying the move was “unlawful” as the “accused cannot alter the competent authority or impede my complaint by abusing his position of authority”.
She also highlighted “continuing acts of reprisal” by CJ Dogar following the complaint. “As you must be aware, such reprisals are strictly prohibited under the 2010 Act, and as competent authority, you are required to ensure that I am not subjected to such reprisals,” she said.
According to the letter, on Sept 16, Mazari’s client Mahrang Baloch’s case was fixed for a hearing before him, and Mazari’s proxy counsel requested a transfer of the case to any other bench due to the pending complaint.
“The accused refused to transfer the case, requiring me to appear before him despite the fact that under the law, no woman subjected to such treatment would be required to be in the presence of her alleged harasser,” she wrote.
“The aforementioned facts and circumstances clearly depict the brazen abuse of authority by the accused to shield himself from inquiry in my complaint,” she noted.
Mazari further said that her application seeking preservation of CCTV footage from the day of the incident remained “unanswered”, requesting “immediate intervention in securing this crucial evidence”.
Mazari had submitted an application to the IHC’s registrar for the preservation of CCTV footage of the “unfortunate incident” that took place with her.
In the application, she said: “I write to you today to seek [the] preservation of CCTV footage of the Honourable Chief Justice’s courtroom no.1 from September 11, 2025 between 9am and 11am, as an unfortunate incident took place with the undersigned counsel, as a result of which it is imperative that the exchange recorded on the CCTV footage is preserved.
“I would also request [the] provision of a copy of the CCTV footage from the aforementioned date and time on the USB I have annexed herewith this instant application.”</p><small>2025-09-26 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26124634a163f5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944745/at-least-11-dead-3-wounded-as-truck-crashes-in-kps-di-khan-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>At least 11 dead, 3 wounded as truck crashes in KP’s DI Khan: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>At least 11 people were killed, and another three were injured after a truck crashed in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan, rescue 1122 said on Friday.
Speaking to Dawn.com, spokesperson Rescue 1122, Bilal Ahmad Faizi, said that, “Eleven people lost their lives and three were injured as the truck’s brakes failed, causing it to crash in the Dana Sar Daranda area of DI Khan.”
“The deceased include five women, a child, and a man,” he said, adding that the three injured were rushed to the District Headquarter Hospital DI Khan.“
He further said that the truck was travelling from the Khanozai area of Balochistan.
“Seven of the bodies were also taken to the hospital by the Rescue 1122 team, while four bodies were moved to the hospital by the local people,” he said.
The deceased people have not yet been identified.
Public Relations Officer of DI Khan Police Yaqoob Khan, in a statement, said, “Police are compiling a report for the identification of the deceased and arranging for the bodies to be handed over to their families.”
Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.
On September 11, two women were killed, while four people were injured after a jeep they were travelling in plunged into a ravine in Mansehra. Two days prior, on September 9,  five members of a family were killed in a road accident on the Hazara Motorway in Haripur. The accident took place when a trailer en route to Rawalpindi collided with a car near the Maqsood interchange on the motorway.
In July, five people lost their lives in a collision between a car and a truck on Chashma Road in DI Khan district.</p><small>2025-09-26 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625603-12-of-a-family-killed-three-injured-in-dera-ismail-khan-road-accident' target='_blank'><strong>12 of a family killed, three injured in Dera Ismail Khan road accident</strong></a><br><p>

She has made multiple visits to the doctor, knows the procedure required to fix the pain and has the money for it as well. Yet, her days and nights are spent in agony because a private hospital in Lahore, located in her neighbourhood, refuses to treat her.
Why? Because she does not have a man’s consent — her ‘non-existent’ husband’s. Maryam is unmarried, and so, she continues to suffer.
Unfortunately, Maryam’s story is not unique. Across Pakistan, women are routinely told to get a man’s approval before receiving medical care, from reproductive health to diagnostic procedures and even emergency surgeries.
Such practices by healthcare providers don’t just reflect a larger societal thinking, but also disempower women, beginning with households and eventually seeping deeper into the system.
Gatekeeping healthcare
As per the 2024 UN National Development Report, only 12 per cent of women in Pakistan can themselves decide about getting medical treatment in case of a health issue, while 17pc said the decision was taken by the head of the household. Another 28pc said that the matter was decided upon in consultation with other women of the family. On the other hand, a staggering 42pc of women said that everyone in the house, except for the patient in question, got to decide whether a medical treatment was necessary.
This gatekeeping is even more severe in rural areas, where access to basic healthcare is scarce.
 
 

But what seemingly looks like social or moral injustice — which it definitely is — is also an economic crisis in disguise. When women are denied bodily autonomy, it is not just a violation of their rights; it is also a denial of economic agency. And when half the population of the country is excluded from making decisions about their own health, the cost is borne by not just women, but by their households and by the country at large. This cost is counted not only in lives lost, but in lost productivity, higher poverty, and stalled national growth.
According to 2025 estimates by the World Health Organisation, 27 mothers and 675 babies under a month old die every single day from preventable complications in Pakistan. That accounts for over 246,000 newborn deaths, nearly 10,000 maternal deaths, and 190,000 stillbirths annually. While maternal mortality has fallen, from 276 deaths per 10,000 live births in 2006 to 155 in 2024, we still rank among the worst in South Asia.
A system built to fail
The denial of healthcare autonomy is not simply a result of outdated thinking, but is in fact enabled by a structural failure in our healthcare system. There is no national law requiring spousal consent for adult women, yet the absence of a clear enforcement framework allows hospitals to impose their own arbitrary rules, thus infantilising women.
These arbitrary practices thrive within a broader system that is chronically underfunded and blind to gender-specific needs. Pakistan’s public health spending has hovered around 1pc of the gross domestic product (GDP) for the last five years.

This chronic underinvestment has left rural clinics understaffed and urban hospitals overcrowded and costly. Despite high maternal and neonatal mortality rates, there is limited state-level investment in gender-sensitive infrastructure, staff training, or outreach. Reproductive health services — particularly for conditions like endometriosis, PCOS, or miscarriage — are rarely available at the primary healthcare level, despite their prevalence.
Even when legal frameworks exist to support women, access is far from guaranteed. Pakistan’s penal code permits abortion to save a woman’s life, and in early stages for “necessary treatment”, yet stigma, moral policing, and provider bias routinely block care. Without enforcement and sensitivity training, legality remains meaningless for those who need it most.
When facilities are accessible, cultural norms pose another barrier. Women are more likely to seek medical care from female healthcare providers, yet only 46.9pc of registered doctors are women. For patients, a shortage of female doctors deters care-seeking among female patients, particularly where purdah norms prevail.
Unsurprisingly, Pakistan ranks last on the global gender gap index calculated for 146 countries by the World Economic Forum in 2025, and ranked 131st in health and survival, though a slight improvement from its 132nd place in 2024. These are not just rankings — they are reflections of how we’ve built our systems and who we have left out.
The price of denied autonomy
When women are unable to access timely medical care, their participation in the economy suffers. Untreated health issues, particularly reproductive ones, can lead to chronic conditions, lost workdays, and long-term dependency.
According to data by the International Labour Organisation, Pakistan’s female labour force participation is among the lowest in South Asia — rising from 13.95pc in 1990 to just 21.67pc in 2019 — with the lack of reproductive health access being a key, though often overlooked, contributor. Women experiencing undiagnosed or untreated reproductive health issues may be forced to withdraw from both formal and informal employment.
 
 

Moreover, women also shoulder disproportionate out-of-pocket medical costs, and delayed treatment often leads to health complications, requiring costlier interventions or prolonged care. Women from underprivileged backgrounds, especially in rural areas, may resort to borrowing, asset sales, or foregoing treatment altogether — further perpetuating cycles of poverty.
On a macro level, a high fertility rate, 3.6 births per woman in 2024, combined with weak maternal health indicators, means Pakistan risks missing its demographic dividend — the economic growth potential that arises when a country has a relatively large working-age population and fewer dependents.
If women, especially young and healthy ones, are unable to access timely healthcare or participate in the labour force due to poor reproductive health outcomes, this window of opportunity closes before Pakistan can reap its full benefits. Countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia have leveraged investments in women’s health and education to grow their economies. Pakistan, without similar investments, may fail to capitalise on its expanding working-age population.
What needs to change
For women in Pakistan, the right to decide about their own health is far from guaranteed. A national protocol affirming that every adult woman can give informed consent for her own medical care is long overdue — one that leaves no room for interpretation and penalises institutions that flout it.
But legal clarity alone won’t help if care remains out of reach. Reproductive health services for common, and often debilitating conditions like PCOS, miscarriage care, and endometriosis are concentrated in big city hospitals. At the primary healthcare level, these are either missing or handled without privacy, dignity, or trained staff. Raising public health spending above the current 1pc of the GDP and earmarking resources for women’s health could make these services accessible to millions.
At the same time, it is important to understand that the people providing healthcare matter just as much as the facilities. Training healthcare workers to provide respectful and non-judgmental care, especially for young, unmarried, or marginalised women, would restore trust in a system many avoid until it is too late.
Retaining female doctors is equally crucial. While they make up the majority of medical graduates, unsafe workplaces, rigid schedules and and the lack of support drive many out of the profession. Flexible hours, secure facilities, and re-entry programmes would keep them in service and improve access for female patients.
Perhaps, the hardest shift will be in social attitudes. Women should not have to justify a hospital visit, nor seek permission to protect their health. Public awareness campaigns, built on empathy, could help dismantle these norms and affirm that adult women are capable decision-makers.
Denying women the right to make decisions about their own bodies weakens households, burdens the healthcare system, and constrains national growth. This is not just a health crisis or a gender issue — it is a national development failure.
The question is no longer whether women should have autonomy. The question is: how much longer can Pakistan afford the cost of denying it?

Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
A report issued by the PMD said that the earthquake originated at 8:17am PKT today, with its epicentre in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan at a depth of 195 kilometres, at a latitude of 36.51 degrees north and longitude of 70.98° east.
Shocks were reported by the PMD to have been felt in Chitral, Peshawar and Swat, while the Pukhtunkhwa Times posted on X that “mild” tremors were also felt in Attock, Lower Dir and Upper Dir.
 






At the start of the month, a 6.0-magnitude earthquake in Afghanistan killed over 1,400 people and flattened homes, with tremors jolting KP and Punjab. However, no casualties or damages were reported in Pakistan.
A few days later, another earthquake of magnitude 5.9 originated in the Hindu Kush region, and was felt in the twin cities and parts of KP.</p><small>2025-09-26 06:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/26115115a9c87d2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944741/asia-cup-4-key-takeaways-from-pakistans-win-against-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>Asia Cup: 4 key takeaways from Pakistan’s win against Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>FOR all the talk about their apparent mediocrity after their twin thrashings against India in the Asia Cup, Pakistan have at least upheld the status of being the second best team in the continent.
The status was sealed on Thursday, when Pakistan edged Bangladesh by 11 runs in a tense, low-scoring Super Four encounter.
The win meant Pakistan have beaten all their opponents in the campaign apart from India, and that the archrivals will meet for the third time in three weeks in the Asia Cup final — the first between the two side’s in the tournament’s 17-edition history.
To make it to the title clash, Pakistan needed to get past defending champions Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, and the national side did that in the space of three days.
Both Bangladesh and Pakistan had come into Thursday’s encounter on the back of their respective wins against Sri Lanka.
The contest, therefore, was finely poised before Pakistan flexed their muscle, however, in bits and pieces in what was a show of poor batting throughout the 40 overs.
Shaheen, Haris in the groove
Batting may still remain a headache for Pakistan, but what must be pumping the team’s dugout up is how the fast bowlers have come into their element at just the right time in the tournament.
While Shaheen — who looked better with the bat than ball at the start of the tournament — picked up his bowling rhythm from Tuesday’s win against Sri Lanka (3-28), Haris, returned from the bench, to fire 2-26 in Sunday’s six-wicket loss to India.
Both combined against Bangladesh to deliver six scalps, putting up on display a classic, trademark Pakistan pace bowling show. After Shaheen dismantled Bangladesh’s powerplay, Haris arrived later on to finish the job, and made impact with the wicket of Saif Hassan, Bangladesh’s most dangerous batter in the tournament.
There was calculated aggression on display from the duo, who mixed up hitting hard lengths with searing yorkers and deceptive slower ones to shine in the wickets columns and given their form, Shaheen and Haris could show up as box office items in the final.
Batting Weaknesses persist
Although Pakistan were clinical with the ball, they struggled big time with the bat, regardless that it was a tricky surface to play on. It was expected from Pakistan’s top-three to build onto their decent shows against India the last time the side played in Dubai, but both failed miserably against Bangladesh.
Sahibzada Farhan seemed in touch when he cracked a backfoot cover drive early on but how he casually drove the next ball into the fielder’s hands was poor decision-making from the right-hander.
Fakhar Zaman, meanwhile, looked clueless against the Bangladesh spin attack before departing cheaply. And Saim Ayub added a ninth duck to his T20 career stats trying to pick the wrong delivery up over the infield. Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s poor run in the Asia Cup continued as his credentials as a T20 batter were questioned once again, while Hussain Talat was also dismissed on a loose delivery.
Lower-order flourish
Had it not been a lower-order flourish, ignited by Shaheen’s 13 off 19 — which included two massive sixes — and marshalled by Mohammad Haris, who stuck around to add a 23-ball 31 before Mohammad Nawaz smashed 25 off 15 (a four and two sixes), Pakistan wouldn’t have been able to cross even the 100-mark.
The effort deep into the innings, infact, saw Pakistan add 80 off the last eight over after having reeling at 49-5 by the end of the 11th over. Despite the top-ordee failure, the lower-order’s utility came in handy for Pakistan, which is a huge confidence-boostimg point ahead of a clash which would require heaps of it.
Bangladesh were poor too
Bangladesh, for their part, were ordinary. Chasing 136, they never found rhythm. Regular wickets crippled their response, with Shamim Hossain’s 30 the only notable resistance. Saif Hassan briefly threatened before Haris accounted for him, and the rest folded without offering a fight.
Crucially, Bangladesh also let Pakistan off the hook in the field, spilling chances that could have swung momentum. In a game decided by slim margins, such sloppiness proved costly.
Pakistan’s spinners also deserve credit for applying the brakes. Saim Ayub’s tidy spell of 2-16 kept Bangladesh on the leash, while Nawaz bowled with control to choke the middle overs. It was the kind of collective effort that ensured the pace bowlers’ early breakthroughs did not go to waste.
For Bangladesh, the failure to chase down a modest target underlines a gulf in execution. For Pakistan, the win reinforces the formula that has carried them so far: pace potency, lower-order grit and just enough from the rest. But against India in a final, where mistakes are punished ruthlessly, more will be needed.

‘The Air We Breathe’ will be held at the Expo Centre in Lahore on October 11, under the umbrella of Breathe Pakistan — an initiative to combat climate change that aims to mobilise citizens to incorporate environmental sustainability in their daily lives.
Air pollution has become one of the most pressing public health and environmental crises facing Pakistan, and Lahore in particular is no stranger to this phenomenon.
Once celebrated for its gardens, the city now ranks among the most polluted in the world, with PM2.5 levels far exceeding WHO safety limits, a DawnMedia statement said.
“Other major cities — including Karachi, Faisalabad, and Peshawar — face similar challenges, driven by industrial emissions, vehicular exhaust, stubble burning, and poor enforcement of environmental regulations.”
“Vulnerable groups — children, the elderly, and low-income communities — bear the greatest burden, with devastating impacts on health, productivity, and life expectancy,” it said.
Notable speakers are expected to include Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, federal and provincial ministers, justices of the Supreme Court and Lahore High Court, senior UN officials, global health experts, economists, and corporate leaders.
The conference will spotlight actionable solutions, foster high-level dialogue, and drive collective action for cleaner air in Pakistan. Sessions will cover a broad range of themes, including governance and policy frameworks, financing clean air, smog and industrial responsibility, judicial activism, public health impacts, nationwide air quality standards, and regional cooperation on transboundary pollution.
The conference is being organised in collaboration with the United Nations and the Government of Punjab. The Pakistan Business Council will be a knowledge partner, while IPSOS, CFP, and Carbon Track will be research partners.
The initiative is also supported by leading commercial stakeholders and several other public and private organisations, including English Biscuit Manufacturers, Bank of Punjab, Environment Protection & Climate Change Department, Punjab, OMODA & JAECOO-Nishat Group and NDMRF, among others, “reflecting a strong and growing alliance across sectors to address the urgent challenges posed by steeply rising air pollution in Pakistan,” DawnMedia states.

The premier was accompanied by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, while the US President was joined by US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as per an earlier statement from the PM office.
PM Shehbaz thanked Trump for “his public endorsement of Pakistan’s role in counterterrorism and stressed the need to further enhance cooperation in security and intelligence,” as the two discussed matters of regional security.
The premier described Trump as a “man of peace”, lauding his “sincere” efforts in ending conflicts around the world. PM Shehbaz branded Trump’s style of leadership “bold, courageous and decisive,” and thanked the US president for his role in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in their four-day military conflict in May.
He helped “avert a major catastrophe in South Asia,” the statement quoted the PM as saying.
“The Prime Minister also extended a warm and cordial invitation to President Trump to undertake an official visit to Pakistan, at his convenience,” the PM office said.
On the situation in the Middle East, PM Shehbaz “lauded President Trump’s efforts to bring about an immediate end to the war in Gaza, especially his initiative to invite key leaders of the Muslim world in New York, earlier this week, for a comprehensive exchange of views for restoration of peace in the Middle East, in particular Gaza and the West Bank.”
Thanking Trump for the recent tariff agreement signed with Pakistan, PM Shehbaz hoped that “under President Trump’s leadership, the Pakistan-US partnership would be further strengthened to the mutual benefit of both countries.”
“In this regard, the Prime Minister invited the US Companies to invest in Pakistan’s agriculture, IT, mines and minerals and energy sectors,” the PM Office added.
Photos released after the meeting showed both PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir exchanging views with Trump. Trump was also all smiles as he flashed his signature thumbs up sign during a group photo.
 






The meeting, which was closed to the press, was originally slated to begin at 4:30pm Washington time (1:30am PST) but was delayed by approximately 30 minutes as the US president spoke to reporters after signing executive orders. The meeting itself lasted approximately one hour and 20 minutes.
Photos from the White House press pool before it began showed PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir waiting patiently on the Oval Office’s gold-gilded furniture as, across the room, the US president wrapped up his previous engagement.

The army chief could also be seen speaking to White House staffers as media personnel packed up their equipment. When US Secretary of State Rubio entered the room, he could be seen enthusiastically greeting both leaders.
The visit, the first formal bilateral interaction between the two leaders, comes six years after former premier Imran Khan met Trump during the latter’s first term in July 2019.
Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Trump said that a “great leader” was coming to the White House.
“We’ve got the prime minister of Pakistan coming and the field marshal … [he’s] a great, great guy and so is the prime minister, both,” he told reporters.
President Trump was also conscious of the delay, telling the media: “They are coming and they may be in this room right now. I don’t know because we are late.”

The meeting itself, however, was closed to the press — a break from Trump’s usual modus operandi, as he is known for inviting select cameras and reporters into the Oval Office for photo-ops.
Radio Pakistan reported earlier that the two were “expected to discuss matters of mutual interest as well as regional and global situation”.
The development comes as the premier is in the US for the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. During his whirlwind tour, PM Shehbaz has attended UNGA sessions, a key multilateral summit of the Muslim bloc, as well as side meetings with the heads of international financial institutions in New York.
The premier will now make his way back to New York, as he is due to address the UN General Assembly on Friday.
‘Pak-US ties gradually warming up’
Earlier, at a media briefing in New York, a senior State Department official told Dawn that ties between Washington and Islamabad were “gradually warming up” in Trump’s second term.
For years, the United States had viewed India as a counterweight to China’s growing influence in Asia, while Pakistan was seen as a close Chinese ally.
Since Trump returned to office in January 2025, US relations with India have come under strain over visa hurdles for Indians, steep tariffs imposed by Washington on Indian goods, and the president’s repeated claim that he personally brokered an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May following cross-border hostilities.
The senior official emphasised that US relations with Pakistan were not tied to its partnership with India.
“We have an independent relationship with Pakistan,” he said, recalling recent American investments worth hundreds of millions of dollars in Pakistan’s mineral sector, and noting continued US interest in petroleum exploration.
Responding to a question, the official added that Washington was still reviewing the recently concluded defence deal between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
On July 31, the two countries announced a trade agreement under which the US imposed a 19 per cent tariff on Pakistani goods. Trump has yet to finalise a similar deal with India. Analysts note that in response to tensions with Washington, New Delhi has begun recalibrating its ties with China as a hedge.
Earlier this year, Trump welcomed Field Marshal Munir to the White House — the first time a US president hosted Pakistan’s military leader without senior civilian officials present, underscoring the military’s central role in bilateral relations.
“We’re working through a number of issues when it comes to counterterrorism, when it comes to economic and trade ties,” the senior State Department official said when asked about Pakistan.
 
 

“And so the president remains focused on advancing US interests in the region, that includes through engaging with Pakistan and their government leaders.”
On India, the official said Trump believed in being frank about frustrations in the relationship but still considered it strong. Washington, he added, continued to see New Delhi as “a good friend and partner” whose ties with the US would “define the 21st century”.
Islamabad has publicly backed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to defuse tensions with India, even as it has condemned Israeli bombardments in Gaza, Qatar and Iran.
Prime Minister Sharif also joined Trump on Tuesday in a meeting with leaders of several Muslim-majority countries, where the US president discussed Israel’s assault on Gaza and shared American peace proposals on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
PM Shehbaz meets Bangladesh’s Yunus
Prior to the meeting with Trump, PM Shehbaz also met Bangladesh’s chief adviser, Muhammad Yunus, in New York, according to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan.
In this meeting, the premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening “constructive and forward-looking ties” with Bangladesh, rooted in mutual respect, trust and shared aspirations of regional peace and prosperity, the Radio Pakistan report said.
The two leaders reviewed the current state of Pakistan-Bangladesh bilateral relations, discussing ways to strengthen cooperation in areas including trade, regional connectivity and people-to-people exchanges, it added.
For his part, Yunus appreciated Pakistan’s initiative to deepen engagement and highlighted the importance of enhancing bilateral trade and cultural linkage, it said.

• Fund questions use of emergency funds, delays in governance reforms
• $1bn tranche hinges on progress in review talks
ISLAMABAD: An Inter­national Mone­tary Fund (IMF) review mission began its work simultaneously in Karachi and Islamabad on Thursday, holding discussions with authorities on mixed programme performance without the customary opening engagement with Minister for Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb, who is currently on a visit to the United States.
Sources said the introductory meeting with Mr Aurangzeb, initially scheduled for Sept 25, has now been moved to Monday (Sept 29) in his absence. In the meantime, two IMF teams — one dealing with monetary policy and the other with fiscal policy — are engaged with the State Bank of Pakistan and federal government entities.
 
 

The mission is expected to stay for about two weeks and will also hold forward-looking discussions, pressing the authorities to expedite implementation of end-December 2025 targets.
According to the sources, the government has already used one-third of the Rs390 billion budgetary allocation for natural disasters and emergencies, clearing Rs130bn in past dues owed to commercial banks for incentives and fees linked to remittances sent through formal channels.
The government will now have to justify these payments from the emergency fund at a time when it is also seeking relaxations from the IMF on account of flood damages. Moreover, no allocation has been made in the current budget for such incentives, though an estimated Rs100bn would be required.
The IMF mission also expects clarity on the scale of recent flood damages during its stay, but the government has yet to finalise estimates. Authorities are hoping the Fund will allow relaxations in primary budget surplus and fiscal deficit targets to create space for flood-related expenditure without resorting to new taxes or cuts in development spending.
 
 

The government has missed several key end-June 2025 targets, including FBR’s revenue collection, retail taxation and provincial cash surpluses, and could face difficulties on these counts.
At the same time, the governance and corruption diagnostic report — pending with the authorities for review and publication — has still not been released, leaving the associated governance action plan in limbo. Progress on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) governance reforms has also stalled, despite commitments made with the IMF.
Although provincial legislatures successfully enacted agriculture income tax laws in time, their actual implementation and collection from September-October remains uncertain, especially given the flood situation in Punjab and Sindh. This uncertainty also clouds the government’s ability to assess and deliver the required support for flood-affected people, sectors and facilities.
 
 

On the positive side, Pakistan has almost met all quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2025, but it continues to lag behind on indicative targets and structural benchmarks. These gaps could affect the pace of implementation in the months ahead.
Since the $7bn Extended Fund Facility and $1.4bn climate-linked Resilience & Sustainability Facility are reviewed twice a year, both sides will have to reach an agreement on past performance as well as future commitments.
If the review is successfully concluded, Pakistan will qualify for disbursement of about $1bn (equivalent to 760 million IMF special drawing rights) by the end of next month.

This helped the government to start the new fiscal year on a healthy note, unlike last year’s lacklustre beginning in the absence of IMF support.
The total inflows, both loans and grants, in the first two months of the current fiscal year amounted to $1.377bn when compared to $714m last year, showing an increase of 93pc. Inflows in August alone amounted to $680m, almost 152pc higher than last year’s $270m in the same month. In July this year, a total of $698m loans and grants flowed into the country compared to $444m in the same month last year, representing a 57pc increase.
The $1.345bn in foreign loans and $33m in grants in the first two months of the fiscal year flowing into the country were about 103pc higher and 31pc lower than last year’s $662m loans and $43m grants, respectively, as finalisation of the Extended Fund Facility with the IMF was taking time and later materialized after the budget approval.

Boost from IMF support helps Pakistan secure $1.345bn in loans and $33m in grants

The target for total foreign inflows for the current year has been set at $19.9bn compared to $19.4bn last year.
In July-August 2023, Pakistan was able to materialise more than $3.2bn mainly due to signing of the 9-month Stand-By Agreement (SBA) with the IMF. As a result, Pakistan received a major injection of $2bn in time deposits from Saudi Arabia. In fact, total inflows in July 2023 amounted to $5.1bn, which also included $1.2bn from the IMF and an$1bn from the UAE.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs on Thursday said that it had received a total of $1.377bn in foreign inflows in the first two months of FY26 compared to $714m in the same period last year.
The EAD said that out of $1.377bn inflows, the 465.4bn were received for project financing compared to $441m in first two months of last year, showing a nominal increase of almost 6pc. The non-project loans amounted to $912m in two months compared to $272m last year, showing a massive growth of almost 235pc.
This meant about $680m loans were received in two months for budget support compared to just $272m in the same period last year, showing an about 150pc increase in inflows for budget financing. This is despite the fact that the annual target for budget support this year was set at $13.5bn compared to $15bn last year.
 
 

The authorities were also able to materialise $200m against the Saudi oil facility in the first two months, at a rate of $100m each month, for the fiscal year, against an annual target of $1bn.
Against a full-year target of $5bn from multilaterals (excluding IMF), Pakistan got $780m in two months from multilateral lenders against $293m of the same period last year, when the annual target was $4.5bn.
Total inflows from bilateral lenders (excluding three strategic and friendly countries) in the first two months of the year totalled $232m, against an annual target of $1.36bn. This was 43pc higher than the $162m recorded in the same period last year, when the full-year target was $523m.
Total inflows from bilateral and multilateral lenders amounted to $1.013m in two months of this year against the annual target of $6.4bn. Last year, the government secured $456m from bilateral and multilateral sources against the annual target of $5.05bn.
Inflows from overseas Pakistanis increased to $365m in the first two months of the current year in the shape of Naya Pakistan Certificates, up from $259m last year. The government has estimated a total of $609m through these certificates during the current year.
The full year $19.9bn target for the current fiscal year includes $6.4bn from both multilateral and bilateral lenders, including $5.05bn from multilaterals and $1.36bn from bilateral lenders, $400m in international bonds, $3.1bn foreign commercial loans, $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn SAFE deposit from China.

• Villages in Multan, Lodhran and Bahawalpur submerged after Noraja Bhutta breaches
LAHORE: Punjab Minister for School Education Rana Sikandar Hayat said on Thursday that 3,000 schools had been destroyed in the floods, severely affecting the education of thousands of students.
He was speaking during a meeting with Unicef’s Representative to Pakistan, Pernille Ironside, to discuss progress on various educational plans. The meeting also decided to strengthen cooperation for better outcomes.
The minister informed the Unicef representative that the school education department was facing immense challenges due to floods in the province.
He said that the department had already been facing a shortage of facilities, but the disaster had destroyed thousands of schools, many of which were still under water.
“The department is now confronted with the challenge of rehabilitating these schools,” he said, adding that three shifts were being started in functioning schools to meet the educational needs of displaced students.
The minister said that it would take around three months to rehabilitate the damaged schools. In the meantime, the government planned to rent private buildings and establish tent schools in flood-hit areas to ensure continuity of classes.
 
 

He added that the government had waived semester fees for students belonging to flood-hit areas and that scholarships would also be provided to them.
Several villages submerged
Meanwhile, despite official claims of receding floodwaters across Punjab, three breaches at the Noraja Bhutta embankment on the Sutlej River have led to catastrophic ponding, submerging several villages in the districts of Multan, Lodhran, and Bahawalpur for over a week.
The situation remains dire in the eastern areas of Jalalpur Pirwala, Lodhran and Bahawalpur, where villages, including Noraja Bhutta, Basti Lang, Kotla Chakar, Bahadurpur, Mouza Kanu, Kandeer, Jhaiyu, Deepal, Tarut Basharat, Daily Rajanpur, Belaywala, Dunyapur, Jhangra, Muradpur Soiwala and Sabra are surrounded by 8 to 10 feet of stagnant water. The relentless pressure has caused widespread destruction of homes and property.
“The water isn’t going down. About 70 per cent of houses have already collapsed, and the rest will follow if nothing is done,” said Altaf Lang, a distressed local resident. “The standing water has changed colour, and we are now seeing the spread of waterborne diseases. This is a health crisis in the making.”
Residents point to a major infrastructural obstacle: the nearby motorway. They allege that the culverts designed to allow water to pass underneath are insufficient and are instead acting as a dam, trapping the water on one side.
“The motorway isn’t usable for traffic now anyway. The authorities should breach it to let this water drain,” argued Altaf Lang. “The current culverts are not for water passage; they are just for locals and cattle to cross. They are completely blocked.”
NHA General Manager Kashif Nawaz told Dawn that there was no question of breaching the motorway and that water was passing through culverts underneath. He added that efforts were being made to secure the motorway by placing stones around vulnerable points, without closing the culverts.

Speaking at the post-match ceremony, player-of-the-match Shaheen Afridi said: “I attacked up-front as the team needed an early breakthrough — the three overs in the powerplay made all the difference.”
He dedicated his award to his wife and son.
The left-arm pacer scored a vital 19 of 13 balls and got 3-17 with the ball, striking in his signature manner in the very first over of the innings yet again.
Skipper Salman Ali Agha said, “If we can win these kinds of games, then we must be a special team.”
He commended Mohammad Haris’s crucial 31 runs down the order, terming him a “special player”.
On a pitch that spun prodigiously, Pakistan were staring down the barrel at 49-5 in the 11th over before Shaheen and Haris injected some momentum into the innings.
Mohammad Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf added some crucial runs as Bangladesh were horrendous in the field — dropping multiple chances, including POTM Shaheen.
Pakistan’s bowling effort was a combined effort, coupled with a frantic head coach heading up and down the dressing room stairs at crucial intervals.
In the end, the Tigers could not counter the quality of the Pakistani pace attack as well as the prodigious spin on offer.

Mid-innings analysis: Pakistan have a sub-par total on the board, and it makes you wonder why Salman was happy at losing the toss. Did the error occur in reading the pitch, or did the batters not apply themselves enough? To stay in the tournament, the onus is on the bowlers to find some inspiration.

Mid-innings analysis by Umaid Wasim: Pakistan need to play out of their skins in the last 10 overs. The batters have succumbed to pressure, none of them able to apply themselves and play accordingly. Need Salman and Haris to stick together and take the team to a competitive total.

The Punjab government had set up holding centres under Pakistan’s Illegal Foreigner Repatriation Plan (IFRP) and began identifying Afghan nationals who lacked valid documents or had overstayed in Pakistan for more than a year.
Undocumented Afgh­ans were placed in these holding centres until they were transported to the Torkham border for crossing into Afghanistan.
 
 

Punjab Home Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi told Dawn that no Afghan refugee camp was operational in the province following the closure of Mianwali’s Kot Chandna camp. He said that Afghans intercepted by law enforcement agencies were taken to district-level holding centres, where the Punjab government, through deputy commissioners, provided board, lodging and food. From there, they were transported to Torkham at the government’s expense.
“All Afghans residing in Pakistan have to leave except those holding valid visas,” he asserted.
According to the UN refugee agency, more than 3.5 million Afghans were living in Pakistan, including some 700,000 who arrived after the Taliban takeover in 2021. About half of them were undocumented.
While Pakistan hosted Afghans for decades during successive conflicts, the government argued that the rising number of refugees posed security risks and strained public services. Following the repatriation policy, many Afghans voluntarily left the country, while others were identified, taken to holding centres, and later transported to the border.
 
 

In its notification denotifying the Mianwali camp, the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and States and Frontier Regions said all land and non-movable assets in the area would be handed over to the Punjab government or the district deputy commissioner concerned by the respective Provincial CAR through written handover.

Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the bench will consist of Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan.
Filed by Justice Jahangiri in person, the plea asks that the Sept 16 restraining order be set aside and suspended while his current petition is pending, and the division bench that issued it be restrained from proceeding further.
The two-judge division bench, headed by Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and consisting of Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, had issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed by lawyer Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution while raising serious questions about the validity of his law degree from the University of Karachi. The petition seeks a writ of quo warranto, questioning “by what authority” Justice Jahangiri holds judicial office.

Islamabad Bar Council moves petition to become party to the case

On Sept 23, Justice Jahangiri had also requested the Supreme Court to fix his appeal saying he could only serve as a judge of IHC till a particular age and time lost due to the operation of the impugned order cannot be regained by him.
In a two-page application moved before the Supreme Court, Justice Jahangiri had stated the Supreme Court must urgently intervene in the matter so that the petitioner can be restored and could continue to dispense justice in the high court that he serves in.
On reasons for urgency the application pleaded that the crucial decision to restrain a judge from performing his judicial function was made without even hearing the counter position, adding he was never heard.
Meanwhile, the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) also moved a petition to become party in Justice Jahangiri’s appeal. The petition was moved jointly by members of IBC namely Syed Ahmad Hassan Shah, Naseer Ahmad Kiyani, Raja Muhammad Aleem Khan Abbasi, Syed Qamar Hussain Shah Sabzwari, Zulfiqar Ali Abbasi and Adil Aziz Qazi.
Moved under Article 185(3) of the Constitution, the IBC petition argued that the Sept 16 order was arbitrary, capricious and against the settled principles of law, where Supreme Court remains bound to intervene to obviate miscarriage of justice.
It was a settled law that no injunction can be passed without the three ingredients of a prima facie case, irreparable loss and balance of convenience of being met.

• Former judge also defends survey of Gyanvapi Mosque, claims Hindus worshipped there for centuries; also backs court’s stance on held Jammu & Kashmir
NEW DELHI: Contrary to the Ayodhya judgement of the Supreme Court in 2019, former Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud has spawned a fresh controversy by claiming that “the very erection of Babri Masjid (in the 16th century) was a fundamental act of desecration”.
Retired Justice Chandrachud was a member of the five-judge bench led by the then CJI Ranjan Gogoi which, in November 2019, had given the green signal to build the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya.
 
 

At the time, the court permitted construction of the Ram Temple on the disputed site, but stressed that the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) findings could not prove the Babri Masjid was built after demolishing a pre-existing structure.
“Title to the land must be decided on settled legal principles and applying evidentiary standards which govern a civil trial,” the bench held.
However, in an interview with journalist Sreenivasan Jain for Newslaundry on Wednesday, Mr Chandrachud pointed to archaeological evidence but acknowledged its legal limitations.
“There was adequate evidence from the archaeological excavation. Now, (what’s) the evidentiary value of an archaeological excavation is a separate issue altogether,” he said. “All that I want to say really is this, there is evidence in the form of an archaeological report.”
The former CJI’s controversial response was to a question asked by Jain, noting the inner courtyard dispute arose partly from Hindus “committing illegal acts like desecration and creating disturbance”.
He argued that Muslims, who did not challenge the outer courtyard, saw their lack of resistance turned against them in the judgement. “The fact that you didn’t put up a fight, while the Hindus did, actually weighs against the Muslims,” Jain said, calling it a critical reading of the judgement.
Mr Chandrachud responded, saying: “When you said that it was the Hindus who were desecrating the inner courtyard, what about the fundamental act of desecration — the very erection of the Mosque. You forget all that happened? We forget what happened in history?”
The former CJI referred to ASI’s conclusion that a Hindu-origin structure from the 12th century existed beneath the mosque. Calling it evidence of “what happened in history,” he accused commentators of taking a “selective view of history” and ignoring inconvenient facts.
“How can you (then) shut your eyes? So, what is really being done by many of these commentators, that you referred to, is that you have a selective view of history, ignore evidence of what happened beyond a certain period in history…” he said.
But when asked if such history could justify the mosque’s demolition in 1992, Mr Chandrachud rejected the idea.
“Not at all. Supreme Court judgement applies conventional yardsticks of determining the adverse possession and it is on the basis of evidence and conventional yardsticks that we have applied and come to the conclusion,” he said.
“The criticism that the judgement is based on faith and not on evidence is a criticism, I dare say, of those who have not read the judgement.”
Contrary to what Mr Chandrachud had told Newslaundry, The supreme court, in its ruling, was categorical that ASI’s report could not alone establish title.
The judgement noted a “gap of several centuries” between the structure dated to the 12th century and the 16th-century mosque, with “no evidence… in relation to the course of human history between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries” or “whether the pre-existing structure was demolished for the construction of the mosque”.
Mr Chandrachud also addressed another contentious case — the Gyanvapi Mosque dispute. Explaining why the Supreme Court permitted a survey there despite the Places of Worship Act, he said the site’s religious character was not settled.
“Hindus had worshipped in the mosque’s cellar undoubtedly through the ages,” he said, calling the claim “undisputed,” even though Muslims have consistently challenged it.
On Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Chandrachud defended upholding the government’s reorganisation of the held state, stressing that “security considerations” meant authorities must “take a call on what’s in the interest of the nation”.
Asked about post-retirement roles, he said he does not believe in strict limits on judges taking government posts. “I do not subscribe to doctrinaire ideas about what retired judges should or should not do. To each their own.”

• Justice Panhwar suggests creating unified seniority list of all high court judges
ISLAMABAD: Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar on Thursday ruled that the transfer of a judge from one high court to another under Article 200(1) of the Constitution cannot be declared “against the public interest” merely because it affects the seniority of a few existing judges.
“The best interest of public at large is always with the expeditious disposal of their cases and not in forum shopping,” emphasised Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar in a detailed judgement.
Justice Mazhar had presided over the Supreme Court’s five-judge Constitutional Bench that heard a joint petition by five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — who had argued that three transferred judges, including IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, should not be treated as IHC judges until they took a fresh oath under Article 194, read with Schedule III of the Constitution.
Justice Mazhar observed that the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) had also filed a petition, initially fixed along with these petitions, but later withdrew it on April 17. This, he said, clearly showed that the parent bar association accepted the transfer of judges and did not consider it contrary to public interest or judicial independence.
Article 200 of the Constitution makes it clear that “public interest” is not a precedent or a hard and fast rule and the pros and cons are left to the consultees to decide, being the sole arbiters in terms of the relevant constitutional article.
Had the consultees felt that a proposed transfer was politically motivated, mala fide, or against public interest, they could have withheld consent during the consultation process. However, in this case, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and other chief justices of the high courts gave their unanimous assent.
“All the transfers were by consensus, and no transferee judge approached this court to claim that his transfer was made without consent, under duress, or for punitive or political reasons,” Justice Mazhar observed, adding that the CJP’s concurring note even applauded the transfer.
Nothing was articulated, Justice Mazhar noted, to explain how the transfers adversely affected public interest. “Has the IHC’s working come to a halt? Have the transferee judges failed led to perform their duties? Has the court stopped functioning?” he wondered.
 
 

On the issue of seniority, Justice Mazhar clarified that such disputes fall within the administrative authority of the high court’s chief justice. Whether the transfer was permanent or temporary, this should be specifically mentioned in the notification of transfer.
 
 

In a separate note, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar proposed the creation of a unified national seniority list of all high court judges. This list, he suggested, should be maintained and annually notified by the president’s office in consultation with the CJP, to apply specifically to IHC transfers, subject to the principle of diversity. Such a reform, he argued, would ensure transparency, equality and consistency in judicial administration and matters of elevation.

But this flexibility does not apply to high-net-worth individuals, who remain subject to stricter reporting requirements under Section 7E of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001. The clarification came in the wake of misinformation, circulating on social media, regarding amendments to the income tax return form.
The FBR has so far received 2.7 million tax returns. Tax bar associations have meanwhile requested an extension of the filing deadline.
According to an official statement, the income tax return form for 2025 — released on July 7 — exp­licitly requires taxpayers to declare the market value of their assets, as outlined on page 66 of the form.

FBR says high-net-worth individuals subject to more strict reporting requirements; those who have submitted returns do not need to revise

Recent scrutiny of filed returns, however, reve­aled a widespread anomaly: a significant number of taxpayers had entered zero in the asset valuation section, raising concerns over compliance and data accuracy.
 
 

To address this, the FBR has restricted the en­­try of zero in the asset valuation column. “All tax­­payers are now requi­red to declare the value of their assets,” said FBR Chairman Rashid Mah­mood Langrial, stressing that no amendment had been made to the law — only a technical adjustment in the system to prevent the misuse.
The FBR further exp­lained that asset valuation data — except disclosures by high-net-worth individuals — is not used to calculate tax liability. Therefore, any inaccuracies in this field will not result in tax notices.
 
 

Even so, taxpayers have been urged to declare values reasonably alig­n­­ed with prevailing market conditions, as a matter of transparency and good faith.
The statement added that individuals who have already filed their ret­u­rns will not be required to revise or refile them. Asset valuation entries are neither considered in tax assessments nor in the reconciliation of wealth statements.
It also confirmed that the IRIS system is fully operational, and taxpayers are urged to file their returns before the September 30 deadline.
The FBR also rejected misleading claims circulating on social media re­­garding amendments to the return form, clarifying that no SRO had been issued in this regard.
Meanwhile, the Pakis­tan Tax Bar Association and Karachi Tax Bar Association have written to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, calling for an inquiry into the technical issues affecting return filings.
They have also formally requested an extension of the deadline to ensure taxpayers receive adequate support in submitting their returns.

• Insists court will first hear and decide maintainability of petitions
• Petitioners and their lawyers walk out of courtroom, stage protest
KARACHI: Heated sce­nes were witnessed at the Sindh High Court on Thursday as a two-judge bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Islamabad High Court Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on seven petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.
The two-judge constitutional bench (CB) comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, however, set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions before it.
Justice Jahangiri, accompanied by IHC Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, pleaded for a right of hearing, saying he was the aggrieved party and Karachi University (KU) had not issued him a notice before canceling his degree.
Lawyers for the petitioners, however, objected to the jurisdiction of the bench and urged the court to decide their objections first.
The proceedings drew a large number of lawyers inside and outside the courtroom, with many chanting slogans, clapping and later staging a protest outside the SHC against one of the judges.
The petitioners and their lawyers also walked out of the courtroom in protest over their objections not being addressed and the court’s refusal to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea.
Some lawyers later claimed that the bench had dismissed the petitions for non-prosecution, though the written order is expected to be issued today (Friday).
The petitions had been filed last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the KU syndicate, challenging decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that canceled Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU decisions, restraining the university from taking coercive measures.
 
 

The court had observed that every citizen’s right to fair trial was protected but that no hearing had been provided to Justice Jahangiri before the cancellation of the degree, which appeared obj­ec­­tionable, illegal and without authority.
The petitions were fixed for Thursday’s hearing after the Sindh Higher Education Commission (SHEC) filed an urgent application seeking vacation of the interim stay order.
Justice Jahangiri also appeared in person, filing an application to intervene in the proceedings. However, Justice Agha remarked that the court would first examine the issue of maintainability.
Senior lawyer Faisal Siddiqui, representing a petitioner, questioned how the issue could be decided without hearing the aggrieved person.
Justice Jahangiri introduced himself at the rostrum and reiterated that, as the affected party, he had a fundamental right to be heard.
Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed pointed out that Justice Memon was also part of a division bench that, in September last year, had suspended KU’s cancellation order.
He added that the matter had originally been fixed before another constitutional bench headed by Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed for Sept 30, but was later transferred without explanation to the present bench.
He argued that the matter should return to CB-II, as transfers of cases are the domain of a three-judge committee, and questioned how a constitutional bench could override an administrative order. Advocate Siddiqui also argued that the case should be heard by a regular bench rather than a constitutional bench.
The petitioners’ lawyers further questioned the SHEC’s urgent application, arguing that the commission itself had admitted it had no role in the matter and should be removed as a respondent. They expressed surprise that the SHEC was now seeking an urgent hearing.
Justice Jahangiri told the bench that he had always upheld his oath as a high court judge, testifying that his degree was genuine. “I did not act as a puppet, nor did I make decisions at the behest of any sector commander,” he asserted.
The IHC judge, recently barred from exercising judicial powers by an IHC division bench, asked the SHC to grant him the right of hearing.
 
 

The petitioners and their lawyers, however, left after the bench maintained it would decide maintainability first.
Later, speaking to the media, Barrister Ahmed demanded that the bench recuse itself, voicing strong resentment over the transfer of the case, the conduct of the hearing and the court’s refusal to hear the aggrieved judge.
In a pointed remark aimed at the ruling PPP, he said: “The Sindh High Court should remain a court of law and not turn into a ‘People’s High Court’.”

Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah met the Country Director of Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE) in Pakistan Uzma Yousuf, who was accompanied by her delegation. Secretary School Education Zahid Ali Abbasi and other senior officials also attended the meeting.
The discussions focused on strengthening Sindh’s education framework, particularly in the areas of curriculum development, teacher training, foundational learning and assessment reforms. 
Both sides agreed to establish a joint working group to devise actionable strategies and recommendations.
Mr Shah said the Sindh government was committed to introducing Cambridge programmes in public schools. 
Under the initiative, at least one school in each district will offer O and A Level subjects, providing students from disadvantaged backgrounds with access to international-standard education, he added.
He mentioned that the government would support students with registration and examination costs, and aimed to subsidise the programme to maximise participation. 
“We do not want talented children to be held back due to lack of resources. Our goal is to ensure equal opportunities for all,” the minister said.
Ms Yousuf underscored the importance of teacher training and early educational reforms, noting that preparing students for O Levels requires structured improvements from early childhood through grade eight. 
She assured Cambridge’s full cooperation in supporting reforms, capacity-building and advisory services, describing teacher development as a “sustainable goal with long-term impact”.

The two parties, who are coalition partners in the Centre, have recently been arguing over the means for flood relief, with the PPP insisting on the use of BISP and the PML-N disapproving of the proposition. On Wednesday, after the PML-N questioned the transparency of  BISP, the PPP accused its senior partner of showing an “irresponsible attitude” by refusing to use the programme’s data to compensate flood-affected people in Punjab.
BISP is a national safety net programme in Pakistan that provides cash assistance to poor and vulnerable families, particularly targeting women.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi today, Bilawal said: “Across the country, the agriculture sector was already struggling, but after the floods, it has been badly affected. Our national food security may also be at risk.
“I had appealed to the federal government to declare a climate emergency and an agriculture emergency to address the losses caused by the floods,” he said. He added that he had also called for the power bills of farmers in affected districts to be waived.
He appreciated the federal government and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for following through on his requests.
Talking about the Sindh government, he said that he had spoken to the Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah about ways to support small farmers and landowners.
He said that through the Benazir Hari Card, the provincial government would support small farmers who owned between one and 25 acres of land. He added that the Sindh government would also support farmers with fertiliser.
“Our effort is to support the wheat crop so that we do not need to import wheat,” he said.
“If provincial and federal governments take timely action, we can not only mitigate the losses from this flood but also avoid a heavy import bill. It is better to spend our resources on our own farmers and the agriculture sector so that Pakistan’s economy can reach a position where we export instead of importing.”
Bilawal highlighted that the effects of the floods were ongoing. He said that while it had impacted the low-lying areas of Sindh, “the scale of loss in Punjab, especially south Punjab, is historic“.
“While it is very important to consider what you will do going forward, the most important thing is what you are doing today,” he said. Therefore, the support provided by the provincial government will be amplified if the BISP is used to reach those areas that are still underwater.
“A natural calamity is not the responsibility of any one province; across the world, the federal government plays the leading role. It is also the responsibility of the federal government to deliver relief to the affected people through BISP,” he said.
He said that while the most damage had been sustained by Punjab, it should not be forgotten that Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had also suffered.
“So, BISP is the sole method through which the federal government can provide immediate relief to the affected people. This has been the standard practice,” he said, adding that the Centre had done the same in the past and during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“If we don’t do this today, I must ask: what is the fault of the people of South Punjab when they face such devastating floods, their homes are destroyed, and they are living on the road?” he said, calling on the federal government to “review its policy”.
He further said the federal government should have sought international help from the outset.
“When the floods began, the federal government should not have waited for any provincial help. It should have issued an international appeal immediately. I am not criticising […] but if you are spending Rs100, you could have spent Rs200; if you were helping 100 people, you could have helped 200,” he said.
“By talking to the international community, by seeking a review of International Monetary Fund (IMF) restrictions, your hand would have been stronger if you had made a timely global appeal as you did previously. This time it should have happened, and it did not,” he said.
 






‘PPP politicising floods’
’Later in the day, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif accused the PPP of “politicising” the floods.
“The PPP is our ally and I respect them, but unfortunately, they have been politicising the floods in Punjab,” the CM said, addressing a ceremony in Dera Ghazi Khan.
“I don’t know their agenda, but I want to tell [President] Asif Zardari and [PPP Chairman] Bilawal … please help your party’s spokesperson understand that if, Gob forbid, there is a disaster in Sindh, Punjab would stand with it.”
The chief minister then turned her attention to BISP.
“Nowadays, people are talking about distributing aid through BISP. I do not want to criticise them … but they only give Rs10,000 [under this programme]. On the other hand, I will give them (flood victims) Rs1 million.”
Maryam termed flood relief through BISP a “very simplistic solution” and went on to say, “What will people who have lost their homes, cattle, and crops do with just Rs10,000?”
She said she wanted to rebuild the damaged houses and compensate for destroyed crops, but BISP “does not provide enough money”.
Reacting to criticism of not seeking international assistance for flood relief, she said, “The thing is, I am Nawaz Sharif’s daughter, and I will not beg for aid.”
“How long will Pakistan continue to beg the international community for aid? The NFC (National Finance Commission) gives billions to the provinces. What is this money being used for?” she said.
