Kohat Regional Police Officer Abbas Majeed Marwat said in a statement, “Six passengers have been killed in a tragic incident of firing on a passenger vehicle in Lower Kurram.
“A search operation has been launched after the terrorist incident,” he said, adding that 12 suspects were detained in the operation and a large number of weapons were recovered from them.
“Terrorists will not be spared under any circumstances. No one will be allowed to disturb regional peace,” RPO Marwat stated.
Earlier today, Kurram District Police Officer Kurram Malik Habib Khan said that the unknown assailants fled the scene after the attack. “The bodies have been taken to the hospital,” he said, adding that an investigation into the incident was underway.
Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Hameed Hussain condemned the incident in a statement, calling it “an attempt to disrupt the peace of the area”.
“Such incidents are regrettable even after the establishment of check posts on the main highway,” he said.
Kurram has been marred with tribal violence stemming from decades-old land disputes, which claimed at least 130 lives last year. Following months of conflict, the warring tribes reached a ceasefire agreement in January this year, followed by a year-long peace deal signed in July by the Lower Kurram and Sadda tribes.
In April, three people were killed and several others went missing when unidentified assailants attacked a group of people travelling from Parachinar to Peshawar in the Bagan area of Lower Kurram, triggering protests across the tribal district.

The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has predicted the flood situation in the rivers but affected communities complain that the response on the ground is too little, too late that has left a trail of devastation in their fields.
The government had evacuated 529,938 people from Multan division, including 351,230 from district Multan, 102,645 from Khanewal, 56,763 from Vehari and 19,300 from Lodhran.
 
 

The District Muzaffargarh administration evacuated 68,043 people from its three tehsils, including Muzaffargarh, Alipur and Jatoi.
The government has established 25 flood relief camps in different areas of Multan, including Lakwala, Muhammadpur Mahota on Head Muhammadwala, Sher Shah, Bund Bosan and Sikandri Nala.
A flood relief camp has been established at Head Muhammadwala where over 250 families are residing.
The flood-affected persons said they were living in the open for the last two days and did not receive any help from the government. They said they were forced to leave their houses without picking their belongings, which could be destroyed in water or get stolen.
Replying to a query about the commissioner and district administration’s claims to have served the food and fodder for cattle, the people said they received rice two times in the last two days and no one provided them with fodder for their animals. They complained about the absence of clean water to drink, medical help and washroom facility, saying that children and women were facing problems due to non-availability of washrooms.
 
 

Flood-affected people living at a BHU said there were two washrooms for more than 2,000 people and that they were receiving only one-time meal while their children were contracting diseases due to contaminated water.
In tehsil Shujaabad and Jalalpur, people living in low-lying areas complained about the police and district administration for issuing them threats of dire consequences for not leaving their homes. They said that there was no electricity in the flood relief centres and there were a lot of mosquitoes.
Sajjad from Shujaabad said that assistant commissioner office employees and police officials ordered him to leave the house but he refused.
“The officials asked me to leave the house or they would set it on fire. I had to leave my belongings and now I am living without a roof, food and washrooms under the sky.” He said there were several families living in the camp and some were provided with cloth tents and it did not stop rainwater.
 
 

Multan Commissioner Amir Kareem Khan visited flood-prone areas, including Basti Muhammadpur Ghota, Jhok Venus, Sher Shah, Lukwala Bund, Hajipur and Basti Langrial, to review ongoing relief operations. The number of flood relief camps across the division was increased to 90.
In Burewala, Sahoka and surrounding settlements were submerged after a breach in the Sahoka-Chishtian Road which resulted in disconnecting hundreds of villages from the city.
“Our village is now an island,” explained Ayesha Bibi from Sahoka.
“The main road is under water. We are using makeshift boats to get to safety but where do we go? We have heard about relief camps but we have not seen any.”
In Manchanabad, temporary protective embankments at Mauza Rateeka, Lala Amar Singh, and several other villages were washed away, submerging thousands of acres of agricultural land and rice, cotton and maize crops. The floodwaters also cut off road access to multiple settlements.
In the Arifwala area, Basti Saboka, Yasin Kay, Balara Dilawar, and Balara Arjan were submerged. Several villages have lost road connectivity due to broken roads.
In Vehari, rescue teams relocated people and their livestock from the affected villages, including Lakhha Saldira, Sahooka, Farooqabad, Jamlera.
More than 80 villages were submerged and rural link roads eroded after high flood in the Ravi River at Kamalia. Officials said over 60,000 people were evacuated and 890 of them were given first aid. Their 61,999 animals were also evacuated. The road leading to Chichawatni, Faisalabad and M-3 interchange was submerged with floodwater near Kalaira Adda at Kamalia.

After posting a competitive 169-5, Afghanistan — who beat the United Arab Emirates on Monday — restricted Pakistan to 151-9 with disciplined bowling and sharp fielding.
Pakistan had beaten Afghanistan in the tri-series opener on Friday but were second best this time.
They faltered at regular intervals in their chase with early strikes from Fazalhaq Farooqi (2-21) removing openers Sahibzada Farhan (18) and Saim Ayub, before Fakhar Zaman’s 25 kept the innings afloat.
But the middle order failed to capitalise with Salman Agha (20), Hasan Nawaz (nine), and Mohammad Nawaz (12) all going cheaply.
Rashid Khan (2-30) and Noor Ahmad (2-20) tightened the screws in middle overs, while experienced Mohammad Nabi (2-20) dismissed key batters.
Pakistan slumped to 111-9 in the 17th over, before Haris Rauf’s blistering 34 not out off 16 balls offered late fireworks.
Earlier, Afghanistan’s top order flourished through a superb partnership between Sediqullah Atal (64 off 45) and Ibrahim Zadran (65 off 45) despite the early loss of opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz.
The duo stitched together 113 runs for the second wicket, setting a strong foundation. Despite a late wobble caused by Faheem Ashraf (4-27), Afghanistan eventually had enough on the board and joined Pakistan with two wins from three matches.
“I think 170 was gettable,” rued Pakistan skipper Salman. “I thought the bowlers did a good job. We lost too many wickets in the middle overs. After eight overs, we were going well but we lost many wickets.
“When you lose that many wickets, it becomes very difficult. The Afgha­nistan spinners are quality spinners. If you give any sniff to them, they are good enough to grab it. If we did not lose that many wickets in the middle overs, it could have been a different story.”

“Within the next month, parents will be able to… link their account with their teen’s account” and “control how ChatGPT responds to their teen with age-appropriate model behaviour rules”, the generative AI company said in a blog post.
Parents will also receive notifications from ChatGPT “when the system detects their teen is in a moment of acute distress”, OpenAI added.
Matthew and Maria Raine argue in a lawsuit filed last week in a California state court that ChatGPT cultivated an intimate relationship with their son Adam over several months in 2024 and 2025 before he took his own life.
The lawsuit alleges that in their final conversation on April 11, 2025, ChatGPT helped 16-year-old Adam steal vodka from his parents and provided a technical analysis of a noose he had tied, confirming it “could potentially suspend a human”.
Adam was found dead hours later, having used the same method.
“When a person is using ChatGPT, it really feels like they’re chatting with something on the other end,” said attorney Melodi Dincer of The Tech Justice Law Project, which helped prepare the legal complaint.
“These are the same features that could lead someone like Adam, over time, to start sharing more and more about their personal lives, and ultimately, to start seeking advice and counsel from this product that basically seems to have all the answers,” Dincer said.
Product design features set the scene for users to slot a chatbot into trusted roles like friend, therapist or doctor, she said.
Dincer said the OpenAI blog post announcing parental controls and other safety measures seemed “generic” and lacking in detail.
“It’s really the bare minimum, and it definitely suggests that there were a lot of (simple) safety measures that could have been implemented,” she added.
“It’s yet to be seen whether they will do what they say they will do and how effective that will be overall.”
The Raines’ case was just the latest in a string that have surfaced in recent months of people being encouraged in delusional or harmful trains of thought by AI chatbots — prompting OpenAI to say it would reduce models’ “sycophancy” towards users.
“We continue to improve how our models recognise and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress,” OpenAI said on Tuesday.
The company said it had further plans to improve the safety of its chatbots over the coming three months, including redirecting “some sensitive conversations… to a reasoning model” that puts more computing power into generating a response.
“Our testing shows that reasoning models more consistently follow and apply safety guidelines,” OpenAI said.</p><small>2025-09-03 06:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/03021607f7dafbf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939234/justice-sattar-presents-charge-sheet-on-judicial-ills-against-ihc-chief-justice-dogar-ahead-of-full-court-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Sattar presents charge sheet on ‘judicial ills’ against IHC Chief Justice Dogar ahead of full court meeting</strong></a><br><p>Islamabad High Court (IHC) Justice Babar Sattar on Tuesday presented a charge sheet against Chief Justice Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, highlighting the “judicial ills plaguing the high court” ahead of a full court meeting.
The new judicial year began in the IHC on Tuesday with Justice Dogar convening a full court meeting attended by all judges. Officials said the chief justice scheduled another full court session for 2pm today (Wednesday), issuing formal notices directing all IHC judges to attend.
Although the detailed agenda was not made public, such meetings are generally convened at the start of the judicial year to review the court’s performance, discuss administrative affairs, and set priorities for the coming months.
The full court meeting, to be chaired by Justice Dogar, will bring together all serving judges of the IHC for collective deliberations on judicial and administrative matters.
Sources said the judges sought a revision of the full court’s agenda, expressing strong reservations about the IHC’s state of affairs and suggesting remedial measures. The letters were also shared with other judges.
Justice Sattar’s letter, seen by Dawn.com, said the full court meeting was “long overdue but welcome step towards correcting the illegalities that have seeped into the administration of Islamabad High Court”, pointing out that the process had begun during the term of the previous top judge.
“I am writing to you in request inclusion of the matters listed below for discussion in the full court meeting. I have only included here brief explanations or questions to articulate their relevance, but I am sure you’ll get my drift.
“Some might counsel that this is an exercise in futility in view of the egregious disregard for judicial independence, institutional norms and the principle of comity amongst judges that has been witnessed in our midst since your transfer to Islamabad High Court. But one must never lose hope in the innate capacity of human beings to assume control of their agency and do the right and decent thing,” Justice Sattar wrote.
IHC’s diminishing role as a guardian of fundamental rights: Justice Sattar said the primary responsibility of the judiciary in a rule of law polity was to protect constitutionally-guaranteed fundamental rights against the abuse of power by the state.
He questioned whether IHC judges truly believed that the court was discharging that “pivotal constitutional duty” today and whether they believed that citizens perceived them as protectors and defenders of fundamental rights.
Failure to exercise supervision and control over subordinate judiciary: On this issue, Justice Sattar asked if the IHC was discharging its obligation to supervise and control courts subordinate to it in a manner so that judges manning such courts could discharge their judicial functions without fear, as required by Article 203 of the Constitution.
“Should the Islamabad District judiciary continue to look like a game of musical chairs played predominantly by deputationists or does IHC have the responsibility to develop district judiciary as an independent institution possessed of integrity and efficiency?”
 
 

Lack of transparency and logic in fixation of cases and preparation of rosters: About this issue, Justice Sattar said that as opposed to respecting institutional norms, Justice Dogar had created rosters excluding senior judges, including the senior puisne judge, from heading divisional benches.
“Should fixation of cases rest on the whims of the CJ or should there be transparency in who hears what case, while matching expertise of judges to the work they are asked to do? We write in our judgments every day that public officials aren’t kings and their administrative powers are neither unfettered nor should be exercised in a colorable manner. The cause lists issued under your watch reflect that cases are mostly marked to transferred judges and additional judges, leaving out permanent judges of IHC who found your transfer to IHC disagreeable. While exercising the administrative powers of IHC should one not remember that judges, including the CJ, are public officials too and not kings?”
Use of administrative powers to undermine judicial independence: Justice Sattar lamented that under Justice Dogar’s leadership and watch, “we have seen the office refusing to issue cause lists in breach of judicial orders, we have seen cases being transferred from the docket of one court to another despite the lack of any power in the office of the CJ to do so, and most recently we have seen issuance of rosters to deprive two judges (including me) of their dockets in a move to render them dysfunctional vis-à-vis their single-bench dockets”.
The judge said that the above might be successful manoeuvres in “rendering some judges irrelevant” and the country’s judicial history was replete with “similar malevolent practices that spread during authoritarian times”. He, however, questioned whether such “subversion of judicial independence” was justifiable.
Composition of committees to undermine high court’s collegiate character: On this issue, Justice Sattar said Justice Dogar had constituted committees “such that they exclude most of the senior judges of IHC from participating in its administrative functions.
“You’ve excluded the two senior-most judges of IHC from the Administration Committee in breach of IHC rules and entrenched institutional norms abided by all high courts, including the LHC from where you’ve come.
“Do you think manning IHC committees with additional judges appointed earlier this year and judges transferred from other provinces along with you strengthen IHC as an Institution and promote collegiality amongst judges?”
Assumption of powers to transform chief justice’s office into a monocracy: The judge said the IHC chief justice had “assumed powers to issue a circular requiring judges to seek an NOC (no-objection certificate) from you to travel out of the country, essentially placing judges on the Exit Control List”.
Justice Sattar said neither the Constitution nor the law vested such rule-making power in the office of the chief justice to “lord over his peers”.
“The draft rules circulated for consideration during the full court meeting also seek to concentrate all administrative powers in the office of the chief justice. You might have read Lord Acton’s words that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Will transforming the office of chief justice into an autocracy, in an effort to reduce the judiciary to a regiment, bolster judicial independence essential for the discharge of our adjudicatory duties?” Justice Sattar pondered.
 
 

Performance evaluation of judges and reporting of judgments: Regarding this issue, Justice Sattar said judges were the highest-paid public officials and should be strenuously held to account for their performance by the public.
However, he questioned whether there should not be an agreed objective framework for their performance evaluation.
“Under your watch IHC has issued skewed statistics regarding discharge of judicial work at IHC. These statistics are designed to cultivate an impression that some judges work super efficiently, while others don’t work at all. What if a curious researcher were to investigate the nature (and number) of cases marked to the ‘performing’ judges versus others, and the nature, quality and length of orders that make up their disposal figures? Should we not put together a consensual performance-evaluation criteria as well as guidance for which judgments are to be reported, to earnestly seek to enhance our performance and hold ourselves to account, instead of engaging in deceptive advertising?”
Concluding his letter, Justice Sattar said: “You will appreciate that it takes decades to build institutions, but they can be destroyed exponentially.  We have seen this happen to Islamabad High Court in the last couple of years.
“While I may be accused of letting hope trump experience in writing to you to encourage and facilitate intra-institutional debate to stem the rot that is reducing this judicial organ into nothingness, I am partial to Rousseau’s opinion regarding the capacity of human beings for virtue. History doesn’t remember kindly those who only make hay while the sun shines. And history also reminds us that all good (and bad) times come to an end sooner rather than later.”
Justice Sattar expressed hope that the IHC chief justice would read the letter to “appreciate the spirit in which it is written”.
 
 

He added: “I apologise in advance if the content causes any offence, for that is not the intent. We are all grown adults who should be able to speak candidly about the state of our institution’s disrepair. Without honest identification and admission of our failings, there can be no corrective action.”
It may be mentioned that Justice Sattar previously wrote letters to Justice Dogar on multiple issues, including amendments in the IHC Rules and formation of administrative committees, among others.
Recently, the IHC chief justice constituted a division bench exclusively for clearing the backlog of nearly 2,000 tax references.
Justice Sattar is a member of this special bench.
IHC administration transferred all the cases pending in the dockets of Justice Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan to the other available judges.</p><small>2025-09-03 06:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0310345743180b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939363/republican-us-house-committee-releases-thousands-of-epstein-files' target='_blank'><strong>Republican US House committee releases thousands of Epstein files</strong></a><br><p>A Republican-led US House of Representatives committee on Tuesday said it released more than 33,000 pages of files on the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as party leadership looked to end a push by a bipartisan pair of lawmakers to force a vote on the matter.
The case of Epstein, who died by suicide in prison in 2019, has caused a political headache for Republican President Donald Trump, after many of his supporters embraced a slew of conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein.
A July Reuters/Ipsos poll found that majorities of Americans and of Trump’s Republicans believe the government is hiding details on the case.
The files released on Tuesday largely included court documents and other previously released information.
“Nearly everything Republicans just supposedly ‘released’ … has already been released,” said Democratic US Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts in a post on X.
 






 






Republican US Representative Thomas Massie and Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, have proposed a measure that would require the Justice Department (DOJ) to release all of its unclassified Epstein records, including those held by the FBI and US attorneys’ offices.
 






Massie and Khanna will hold a press conference with Epstein victims on Wednesday morning. Massie told the Axios news outlet on Tuesday that he would push ahead despite the latest document release.
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Massie’s petition was “inartfully drafted” because it lacked language that would protect the identities of victims who were sexually abused by Epstein.
 
 

Johnson also said the petition is “moot” due to the work of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which released thousands of pages of files.
“It’s superfluous at this point, and I think we’re achieving the desired end here,” Johnson said.
The materials released on Tuesday included at least eight videos of apparent police interviews with victims. Several of the interviews are timestamped from 2005 and 2006.
In one video, a girl whose appearance and name are edited out said Epstein paid her $350 for a massage and sex when she was 17 years old.
 
 

“He has the girls take off their clothes and give him a massage,” she said in the 17-minute video.
Other records include audio recordings from the criminal investigation of Epstein in Florida, including what appeared to be an interview with a victim whose name and date of birth were edited out.
The committee has subpoenaed the DOJ and Epstein’s estate for documents and convicted Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell for a deposition.</p><small>2025-09-03 05:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621690-pti-divided-over-kalabagh-dam-after-gandapur-voices-support-for-project' target='_blank'><strong>PTI divided over Kalabagh Dam after Gandapur voices support for project</strong></a><br><p>

A magnitude-6.0 earthquake hit the mountainous region bordering Pakistan on Sunday, leaving residents huddled in the open air for fear of powerful aftershocks and desperately trying to pull people from under flattened buildings.
The earthquake killed more than 1,400 people and injured over 3,300, Taliban authorities said, making it one of the deadliest in decades to hit the impoverished country.
The vast majority of the casualties were in Kunar province, with a dozen dead and hundreds hurt in nearby Nangarhar and Laghman provinces.

In Kunar’s Nurgal district, victims remained trapped under the rubble and were difficult to rescue, local official Ijaz Ulhaq Yaad told AFP on Wednesday.
“There are some villages which have still not received aid,” he said.
Landslides caused by the earthquake stymied access to already isolated villages.
The non-governmental group Save the Children said one of their aid teams “had to walk for 20 kilometres (12 miles) to reach villages cut off by rock falls, carrying medical equipment on their backs with the help of community members”.
The World Health Organisation warned the number of casualties from the earthquake was expected to rise, “as many remain trapped in destroyed buildings”.

‘Normalise’ survivors’ lives
In two days, the Taliban government’s defence ministry said it organised 155 helicopter flights to evacuate some 2,000 injured and their relatives to regional hospitals.
In the Mazar Dara village of Kunar, a small mobile clinic was deployed to provide emergency care to the injured, but no tents were set up to shelter survivors, an AFP correspondent said.
On Tuesday, a defence ministry commission said it had instructed “the relevant institutions to take measures in all areas to normalise the lives of the earthquake victims”, without providing further details on the plans to do so.
Deputy government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said a camp had been set up in Khas Kunar district to coordinate emergency aid, while two other centres were opened near the epicentre “to oversee the transfer of the injured, the burial of the dead, and the rescue of survivors”.
According to the United Nations, hundreds of thousands of people could be affected by the disaster.
Multiple countries have pledged assistance, but NGOs and the UN have voiced alarm that funding shortfalls after massive aid cuts threaten the response in one of the poorest countries in the world.

After decades of conflict, Afghanistan is facing endemic poverty, severe drought and the influx of millions of Afghans sent back to the country by neighbours Pakistan and Iran in the years since the Taliban takeover in 2021.
“This earthquake could not have come at a worse time,” said Jagan Chapagain, IFRC Secretary General, in a statement late Tuesday.
“The disaster not only brings immediate suffering but also deepens Afghanistan’s already fragile humanitarian crisis.”

Djokovic snuffed out Taylor Fritz’s hopes of becoming the first American man to win a Grand Slam singles title since 2003 with a 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 quarter-final victory on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court.
The win sent the 38-year-old Serbian — chasing a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam victory — into a mouthwatering semi-final against Spanish second seed Alcaraz on Friday.
 






Djokovic clinched victory when fourth seed Fritz double-faulted on match point in the 10th game of the final set and could not hide his relief at finally emerging victorious.
“In this kind of match a few points on either side decide the winner,” he said. “It was an incredibly close match. It was really anybody’s match.”
Fritz was left ruing his failure to make the most of the opportunities that came his way, converting only two of 13 points during an absorbing three-hour 24-minute battle.
The American fourth seed squandered five break points in the opening set that would have made it 5-4, instead allowing Djokovic to wriggle off the hook and take a one-set lead.
Then, after battling back to break Djokovic to get to 5-5 in the second, Fritz was broken immediately to surrender the initiative.
Djokovic duly held to take a two-set lead, and while Fritz hit back to take the third set, the veteran Serb regrouped to wrap up victory in the next set.
“I thought I was really lucky to save some crucial break points in the second set,” Djokovic said. “I think for most of the second and third sets he was the better player.”
Djokovic will meet Alcaraz in the last four with the 22-year-old Spaniard in blistering form.
The five-time Grand Slam champion needed just one hour and 56 minutes to seal a convincing 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 defeat of Czech 20th seed Jiri Lehecka.
Alcaraz has not dropped a set during a relentless march into the semi-finals and was once again in complete control against Lehecka.
“I just played a really — or almost perfect match,” said Alcaraz, who has won 35 of his last 36 matches since the start of the Italian Open in May.
“It seems like, OK, just two more steps to do, and let’s see what happens. But yeah, I’m just feeling great and hungry to make it.”
Sabalenka walkover
In the women’s draw on Tuesday, world number one and defending champion Sabalenka moved into the semi-finals after Czech quarter-final opponent Marketa Vondrousova pulled out with a knee injury.
Sabalenka, bidding to become the first woman to successfully defend the US Open since Serena Williams completed a hat-trick of titles in 2014, extended sympathy to Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion.
 






“So sorry for Marketa after all she’s been through. She has been playing amazing tennis and I know how badly this must hurt for her,” said Sabalenka, who has now reached the US Open semi-finals or better for five tournaments in a row.
The walkover sets up a repeat of last year’s US Open final in the last four, with Sabalenka facing American fourth seed Jessica Pegula on Thursday.
Pegula reached the semi-finals earlier on Tuesday after a 6-3, 6-3 defeat of unseeded Czech Barbora Krejcikova.
Pegula entered the US Open on the back of a dismal run of form that had seen her make early exits at WTA tournaments in Washington, Montreal and Cincinnati.
But she has rediscovered her confidence while moving stealthily through the rounds at New York, albeit against a series of unseeded opponents.
“I think I’ve been playing some really good tennis,” Pegula said after completing a 1hr 26min victory.
Pegula said she is welcoming the chance to avenge last year’s final defeat to Sabalenka.
“I think it would be cool to be able to get revenge, obviously,” she said.</p><small>2025-09-03 05:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/03095506bf9fc9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939320/gb-to-auction-hunting-permits-for-118-animals' target='_blank'><strong>GB to auction hunting permits for 118 animals</strong></a><br><p>GILGIT: The Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) Wildlife and Parks Department will auction permits for 118 animals — including four Astore markhors, 100 Himalayan ibex, and 14 blue sheep — for the 2025–26 hunting season.
The bidding ceremony is scheduled to be held today (Wednesday) at the Forest, Parks and Wildlife Complex in Gilgit.
For the upcoming season, the base price of an Astore markhor permit has been raised to $200,000, while blue sheep and Himalayan ibex permits are set at $30,000 and $10,000, respectively.
 
 

Last year, the base rates were lower: $150,000 for markhor, $9,000 for blue sheep, and $5,500 for ibex. In the 2024-25 season, 118 permits were offered, but only 60 were purchased. The highest bid for a markhor reached $161,000, earning the GB government more than Rs30 million.
Officials note that prices in other regions, such as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, can reach $500,000 for markhor hunts. However, local outfitters and tour operators argue the sharp fee hikes are damaging their businesses and discouraging international clients. They warn of losses for both outfitters and the local communities who rely on trophy hunting revenue.

Only half of the permits offered in last season found buyers amid various challenges

Ikram Beg, a Gilgit-based outfitter, said participation in the programme has dropped due to inflated rates, causing “devastating” impacts on livelihoods.
Similarly, Syed Sumsam Ali Bokhari, chairman of Safari Club International Pakistan Chapter, warned that rising prices undermine Pakistan’s competitiveness compared to neighbouring countries.
 
 

In Tajikistan, a markhor hunt costs about $160,000 including logistics; in Nepal, blue sheep hunts average $29,000; and ibex hunts in Central Asia range between $8,500 and $9,900.
Mr Bokhari added that security concerns, geopolitical tensions, and recent terrorist attacks in hunting regions such as Chitral further reduced the country’s attractiveness as a destination.
He urged the GB wildlife department to reconsider its pricing strategy to align with regional market trends.
Launched in 1990 in Bar Valley, Nagar, GB’s trophy hunting programme involves local communities, who receive about 80 per cent of hunting revenues for conservation and development projects.
While it has been credited with protecting endangered species, stakeholders fear the latest price hikes could jeopardise its sustainability.

Google parent Alphabet’s shares were up 7.2 per cent in extended trading on Tuesday as investors cheered the judge’s ruling, which also allows Google to keep making lucrative payments to Apple that antitrust enforcers said froze out search rivals. Apple shares rose 3pc.
US District Judge Amit Mehta also ruled Google could keep its Android operating system, which, together with Chrome, helps drive Google’s market-dominating online advertising business.
The ruling results from a five-year legal battle between one of the world’s most profitable companies and the US, where antitrust regulators and lawmakers have long questioned Big Tech’s market domination. Mehta ruled last year that Google holds an illegal monopoly in online search and related advertising.
But the judge approached the job of imposing remedies on Google with “humility,” he wrote, pointing to competition created by artificial intelligence companies since the case began.
“Here, the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judges forte,” Mehta wrote.
While sharing data with competitors will strengthen rivals to Google’s advertising business, not having to sell off Chrome or Android removes a major concern for investors who view them as key pieces to Google’s overall business.
Google faces a major threat from increasingly popular AI tools, including OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT chatbot, which are already eroding Google’s dominance. If allowed to access the data Google is required to share, AI companies could bolster their
development of chatbots and, in some cases, AI search engines and web browsers.
“The money flowing into this space, and how quickly it has arrived, is astonishing,” Mehta wrote, saying AI companies are already better placed to compete with Google than any search engine developer has been in decades.
Deepak Mathivanan, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald, said the data-sharing requirements pose a competitive risk to Google but not right away.
“It will take a longer period of time for consumers to also embrace these new experiences,” he said.
US antitrust enforcers are considering their next steps, Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater said on X.
Google said in a blog post it was worried data sharing “will impact our users and their privacy, and were reviewing the decision closely.” Google has said previously that it plans to file an appeal, which means it could take years before the company is required to act on the ruling. The case is likely to end up in the Supreme Court.
“Judge Mehta is aware that the Supreme Court is the likely final destination for the case, and he has chosen remedies that stand a good chance of acceptance by the Court,” said William Kovacic, director of the competition law centre at George Washington University.
Billions in payments
The ruling was also a relief for Apple and other device and Web browser makers, whom Mehta said can continue to receive advertising revenue-sharing payments from Google for searches on their devices. Google pays Apple $20 billion annually, Morgan Stanley analysts said last year.
Banning the payments is even less necessary amid the rise of AI, Mehta wrote, where products such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT “pose a threat to the primacy of traditional internet search.” The ruling also made it easier for device makers and others who set Google search as a default to load apps created by Google’s rivals, by barring Google from entering exclusive contracts.
Google itself had proposed loosening those agreements, and its most recent deals with device makers Samsung Electronics and Motorola and wireless carriers AT&T and Verizon allow them to load rival search offerings.
Big Tech crackdown
In addition to the case over search, Google is embroiled in litigation over its dominance in other markets.
The company recently said it will continue to fight a ruling requiring it to revamp its app store in a lawsuit won by “Fortnite” maker Epic Games.
And Google is scheduled to go to trial later this month to determine remedies in a separate case brought by the Justice Department, where a judge found the company holds illegal monopolies in online advertising technology.
The Justice Department’s two cases against Google are part of a larger bipartisan crackdown by the US on Big Tech firms, which began during President Donald Trump’s first term and includes cases against Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple.</p><small>2025-09-03 04:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/030804136a7409f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939249/khawaja-asifs-outburst-comes-under-friendly-fire-in-na' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif’s outburst comes under ‘friendly fire’ in NA</strong></a><br><p>• Hanif Abbasi suggests defence minister resign instead of ‘abusing bureaucracy for publicity’
• PTI boycotts NA proceedings, holds parallel ‘public assembly’ outside Parliament House
ISLAMABAD: Differences within the federal cabinet surfaced on Tuesday during a National Assembly debate on the flood crisis when Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi openly criticised Defence Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif for his remarks on the government’s handling of the disaster.
Although he did not name his cabinet colleague, Mr Abbasi made multiple references to the defence minister’s speech on the floor of the house a day earlier.
He even suggested that Mr Asif resign from the cabinet instead of “levelling allegations against parliament and abusing bureaucracy only to gain [media] publicity”.
Meanwhile, members of the opposition PTI boycotted the proceedings and staged a parallel “public assembly” outside Parliament House to protest alleged political victimisation.
Speaking in the debate, Mr Abbasi accused some politicians of attacking institutions simply to go viral on social media. “If this is all they have to say, they should leave the government benches and sit in the opposition, because such language does not suit treasury members,” said Mr Abbasi, who was elected MNA from Rawalpindi.
 


On Monday, Khawaja Asif had described the recent devastation as a “man-made disaster”, blaming politicians and bureaucrats for unchecked encroachments on waterways and for allowing housing societies and hotels on riverbeds.
He also urged local government elections, criticising his own party’s government in Punjab for failing to hold them.
He also blamed a “contracting company” for the flood devastation in his home constituency, Sialkot.
Responding to the defence minister’s speech, Mr Abbasi said that those who had been a part of the system for the past 40 years were now criticising the system and “demanding local government elections”.
Mr Abbasi took the floor when Mr Asif had already left the assembly hall after briefly attending the proceedings.
“Does a contractor dare to carry out substandard work and run away with money in Rawalpindi?” said Mr Abbasi, stating that it was the responsibility of the MNAs to keep a check on such activities.
He said blaming the entire bureaucracy was unfair, noting that the obsession with going viral in politics had become a “disease”. “I have seen politicians resigning from the cabinet whenever a finger is raised at them. They left the ministry but stayed in the party,” he said while indirectly suggesting the defence minister resign from the cabinet.
Federal Minister for Water Resources Mueen Wattoo said surveys were underway to assess flood-related losses, including damage to crops, livestock, and houses, with compensation to be provided to all affected families. He said estimates were being finalised to ensure timely financial assistance.
PTI’s protest
Earlier, before leading a walkout, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said his party was standing with the flood victims and the leadership had already directed the party workers to visit the affected areas.
However, he said the party had decided to boycott the National Assembly proceedings to protest the policies of the “fascist” government, adding that the PTI members had already submitted their resignations from the standing committees.
 






Meanwhile, talking to reporters after his meeting with former prime minister Imran Khan at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party’s decision to resign from standing committees was “final and irreversible”.
Quoting the jailed former prime minister, he reportedly said that Imran Khan fully endorsed the party’s decision to boycott by-elections and supported the resignations submitted by members from parliamentary committees.

• Flagship project falls short on water rights, power output
ISLAMABAD: The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) has declared the Rs507 billion Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project a failure in terms of objectives, planning and execution, saying it neither secured Pakistan’s water rights nor delivered the designed energy output, as its multiple tunnel faults and collapses have raised serious questions about the quality of work on a project of national importance.
In its performance audit report for 2022-23, submitted to the president and parliament, the AGP noted that the findings did not even include the major collapse of the headrace tunnel last year, which has kept the project shut. The report was finalised based on responses from Wapda’s management to audit objections.
According to the report, the project faced considerable delays despite the provision of tunnel boring machines (TBMs) meant to speed up excavation, mainly due to design changes.
“The project could not reap envisaged benefits of generation of planned electricity, establishment of water rights over Neelum River, selling of carbon credits under CDM, and completion of mitigation measures to safeguard the environment,” the AGP said.
Although the first unit was commissioned in 2018, contractors failed to complete pending punch list items, fulfil contractual obligations, or supply spare parts needed for smooth operation. “The major collapse in the tailrace tunnel (TRT) of the powerhouse just a few years after construction also casts doubt on the quality of design and works,” it added.
The report recalled that Wapda was to execute the project in line with the original PC-I, approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) in December 1989 at a cost of Rs15.012bn. After three intermediate revisions, Ecnec approved the fourth revised PC-I in May 2018 at Rs506.808bn, against which Rs423.446bn had been spent up to June 2023.
The project was delayed by almost eight years, raising its cost from Rs84.502bn (first revised PC-I) to Rs419.454bn, a cost overrun of Rs334.952bn. The AGP said the project was not executed efficiently as resources were poorly managed and timelines under PC-I were ignored. Contractual issues also remained unresolved due to contractors’ delays.
On its effectiveness, the audit concluded the project failed to deliver its objectives of cheap electricity and securing water rights over the Neelum River. The TRT collapse forced the powerhouse to remain shut until March 2023, leading to massive generation losses and worsening load shedding. “Neither the envisaged benefits of generating 5,150GWh annually were achieved nor water rights over the Neelum River established, particularly after Pakistan lost the Kishenganga case in the International Court of Arbitration,” the report noted.
The four generating units came online between July and December 2018. Funding was arranged through cash development loans from the federal government, Wapda’s own equity, the Neelum-Jhelum surcharge on electricity consumers, and local and foreign loans. The audit was conducted under INTOSAI Auditing Standards, Performance Audit Manual, and relevant rules.
Key audit findings included failure to generate the planned 5,150GWh annually, failure to establish water rights on the Neelum/Kishenganga, a nine-year time overrun, and a cost overrun of Rs338.944bn. Other serious lapses cited were an increase in the project’s payback period from five to 12 years, non-realisation of $50.133m in revenue under the Clean Development Mecha­nism, reduced annual generation, and environmental damage due to poor studies at the planning stage worth Rs3.05bn.
The report also highlighted Rs70.44bn in lost revenue due to non-approval of reference tariff by Nepra, Rs20.387bn in generation losses from the TRT collapse without inquiry, unjustified excess payment of Rs1.78bn to contractors without verifying raw stone aggregate quantities, non-recovery of costs for unexecuted telecom works and advance payments for an 11kV overhead line, undue benefits to contractors due to non-reinstatement of spoil deposits, non-indemnification of a Rs42bn insurance claim for the TRT collapse, and non-supply of spare parts and failure to execute punch list items by contractors.
The AGP concluded that the Neelum-Jhelum project fell short on nearly every planned objective, leaving behind massive financial losses, unresolved contractual disputes, and serious structural flaws.

• Pakistan, Russia keen to boost trade; Putin invites Shehbaz to visit
ISLAMABAD: Chinese President Xi Jinping in a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday pledged support for Pakistan’s home-grown capacity for development, expressing readiness to build China-Pakistan Economic Corridor 2.0 and upgrade the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement, and step up cooperation in industries, agriculture, and mining sectors.
Separately, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that bilateral trade between Pakistan and Russia required to be enhanced and stressed on taking steps in this regard, while also extending invitation to PM Shehbaz to visit Russia in November.
The PM, who held separate meetings with President Xi and President Putin in Bejing during his visit to China to attend SCO summit, expressed gratitude to both countries for what he called ‘unflinching support to Pakistan’s territorial integrity, sovereignty’ and hope that the strong ties would add to the progress and prosperity of the region.
According to PM Office, Pakistan and China on Tuesday reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening the iron-clad and all-weather strategic cooperative partnership through enhanced cooperation, reflecting their unique bilateral relationship.
The bilateral ties and cooperation were discussed in a meeting between PM Shehbaz and Chinese President Xi at the Great Hall of the People, wherein they agreed that the relationship between both countries was unique and unparalleled, which should be reflected in their enhanced cooperation.
PM Shehbaz appreciated “China’s unflinching support to Pakistan’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, and socio-economic development, as well as the significance of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as a flagship project of President Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to help both countries to build an even stronger Pakistan-China community with a shared future”.
He reaffirmed the desire to continue working closely with China for the successful implementation of the next phase of upgraded CPEC, with its five new corridors.

The PM Office quoted President Xi as saying that China would continue to assist Pakistan in all fields of economic growth and development, especially as the two countries were now ushering in second phase of CPEC that would focus on Pakistan’s most important economic sectors.
 
 

PM Shehbaz renewed his “most cordial” invitation to President Xi to undertake an official visit to Pakistan next year when both countries would celebrate the 75th anniversary of establishment of Pakistan-China diplomatic ties.
Security issue
Also, President Xi said China supports Pakistan’s efforts to combat terrorism and hopes “effective measures” would be taken to “ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects, and institutions in Pakistan, to create a secure environment for bilateral cooperation”.
According to Reuters, China pressed Pakistan to improve security of Chinese nationals, who have been repeatedly attacked by militants while working on Beijing-funded multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects in the South Asian country.
However, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who joined the PM in China and attended the meeting with President Xi, confirmed to Dawn that the Chinese head of state has raised the issue of Chinese nationals’ security in Pakistan. “He (President Xi) said security is important,” the minister quoted the Chinese president as saying.
Meeting with Putin
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz met President Putin and expressed gratitude to the Russian president for supporting Pakistan, saying that was viewed as ‘a balancing act in the region’.
Both leaders agreed to further enhance the bilateral ties and cooperation between the two countries in diverse fields.
 






PM Shehbaz said Pakistan respected Russia’s ties with India and wanted to establish very strong relations of its own, which would be “supplementary and complementary”.
Responding to Putin’s invitation to attend the SCO Heads of Government Summit in November, the premier replied that he was looking forward to it.
President Putin said, “Pakistan has always been a traditional partner and remains as such in Asia, and we cherish these ties,” adding that both sides had agreed to intensify their bilateral relations.
He noted that their bilateral trade needed to be enhanced and stressed taking steps to address the issue.

A sixth round of Iran-US talks was suspended after Israel and the US struck Iranian military and nuc­lear facilities and Iran ret­aliated with waves of ballistic and hypersonic missiles against Israel.
“We indeed pursue rat­ional negotiations. By raising issues such as missile restrictions, they set a path that negates any talks,” the secretary of Iran’s Sup­reme National Sec­­­urity Cou­­ncil, Ali Lar­ijani, said in a post on X.
 






Western countries cla­im Iran’s uranium enrichm­ent programme could yield material for an atomic warhead and that it seeks to develop a ballistic missile to carry one.
Iran says its nuclear programme is only for ele­ctricity generation and other civilian uses and that it is enriching uranium as fuel for these purposes.
It has denied seeking to create missiles capable of carrying nuclear payloads and says its defence capabilities cannot be open to negotiation in any talks over its atomic programme.
Larijani’s comments follow last week’s launch by France, Germany and Bri­tain of a “snapback mechanism” that could re-impose UN sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme.
The three countries  have urged Iran to engage in nuclear negotiations with the US, among other conditions, in order to have the imposition of the snapback sanctions delayed for six months.

Narendra Modi won’t be there, perhaps because saluting China’s military prowess just five years after border clashes, and barely four months after Chinese technology gave Pakistan an edge in the post-Pahalgam hostilities, would not have played well at home. But at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin over the weekend, he was holding hands with Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping on what was the Indian prime minister’s first visit to China in seven years.
Apart from talks with Xi, he spent more than 45 minutes in Putin’s limousine. Obviously, we don’t know what they discussed. There was never much of a chance that Modi (if he was so inclined) could sway the Russian president from his aggression against Ukraine. The Chinese leader, meanwhile, held out the prospect of partnership in place of rivalry, and Modi expressed no disagreement.
This could be notched up as yet another triumph for the first seven months of Trump’s presidency. The non-alignment that India’s first PM judiciously favoured has left its marks, notwithstanding all of the relatively recent hostility against ‘Nehruvian socialism’.
While maintaining cordial ties with three US administrations, Jawaharlal Nehru was also attached to the idea of friendship with the Soviet Union and China. There have been fractures over the decades with Washington and Beijing, but the Moscow connection has survived the demise of the USSR.

China knows how to play the long game.

Russia, however, wasn’t a key source of crude oil until the sanctions following its attack on Ukraine. The irony is that until last year the US pretty much encouraged India to purchase Russian crude to maintain oil prices, and had no objection to the refined product being sold on to Europe or America, so that they could claim they weren’t buying it from Russia. The largest refinery belongs to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, which helps to explain why a sudden halt to Russian imports would be a non-starter for the crony capitalism that has helped to sustain the BJP regime.
 
 

Previous US presidents wooed India as a counter-balance to China, as part of a strategy that has only persuaded the latter to extend its military prowess. Trump presumably knows that China imports more Russian crude than India, yet his aides have described the Ukraine conflict as ‘Modi’s war’ and derided India as a ‘laundromat’ for Russia. That’s absurd, given that Moscow would be disinclined to shift its aggressive stance as long as Beijing and Delhi are on board. The Ukraine war would not screech to a halt if India stopped purchasing Russian oil.
It might be different if China withdrew its support from Russia, but that too is unlikely. Inadvertently or otherwise, the US has facilitated rapprochement between India and China. ‘Hindi-Cheeni bhai bhai’ might remain a historical memory, but the South Asian region would no doubt benefit from unexpected bonhomie between the world’s two most populous powers. The days of ‘Howdy Modi’ and ‘Namaste Trump’ seem to be long gone.
Around the time of Trump’s second inauguration, a global poll indicated that India was among the very few Global South nations that saw his return to power as positive. Opinions have been shifting, though, and even the 52 per cent of Indians who approved of Trumpianism in June might be differently inclined after the 50pc tariffs threatening to strangle India’s economy.
 
 

That’s yet an­­ot­her obstacle in the path of India’s economic illusions, and it re­­m­ains to be seen whe­ther a prospective partnership with China mi­­ght prove transformative. But Modi is also struggling domestically, after the disappointing last election and credible accusations of fraud. That may seem Trumpian in some ways, but the US and India are very different entities.
Both Modi and Trump benefit from largely ineffectual oppositions. That might change, and the aftermath could remain troublesome. It must be said, though, that Modi’s reported refusal to chat with Trump over the phone was more assertive than Pakistan’s deference to Washington. Neither side has offered a credible explanation for why the war stopped. Whatever the details, the outcome stretches beyond regional circumstances.
China’s transcendence might be a long time coming, but, unlike Trump, Xi knows how to play the long game. Could a better world order emerge?
It’s not impossible, but the scant mention in the Tianjin agenda of the genocide in Gaza and beyond serves as yet another reminder that trade trumps transgressions against human rights. China’s trajectory as a US rival remains shrouded in mystery, but Trump might solve it sooner than we expect.

This marks the fourth contraction in the last five months, with July offering only a brief respite through marginal growth. The persistent decline reflects mounting pressure on the country’s trade performance as exporters face subdued external demand and a high cost of doing business.
According to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) on Tuesday, exports fell by 12.49pc year-on-year to $2.42 billion in August, down from $2.76bn in the same month last year. On a month-on-month basis, export proceeds declined by 9.98pc.
During the first two months of the current fiscal year (July-August FY26), exports edged up by a marginal 0.65pc to $5.11bn, compared to $5.07bn in the same period of the previous year. The export growth of 16.91pc recorded in July was not enough to offset the broader trend of stagnation and decline.
The weakness in export performance was evident in previous months as well, with declines of 0.59pc in June, 10.07pc in May, and 7.36pc in April. Although March recorded a modest growth of 3.08pc, the trend reverted to negative in subsequent months.
 
 

In FY25, total exports stood at $32.11bn, reflecting a 4.67pc increase from $30.68bn in the previous fiscal year. However, the growth momentum weakened sharply after October, with several months registering negative or single-digit gains.
Despite the overall slump, global buyers have recently shifted apparel sourcing away from Bangladesh and China, opening up an opportunity for Pakistani exporters to capture market share. However, this potential remains underutilised due to structural challenges at home.
Trade deficit widens
Meanwhile, imports rose 6.42pc year-on-year to $5.28bn in August, up from $4.96bn in the same month last year. On a monthly basis, however, imports fell by 9.35pc.
In the first two months of FY26, the import bill increased by 14.23pc to $11.2bn from $9.73bn a year earlier. For the full FY25, imports rose 6.57pc to $58.38bn, compared to $54.78bn in the previous fiscal year.
As a result of declining exports and rising imports, the trade deficit widened significantly. In August, the deficit rose by 30.13pc to $2.86bn, compared to $2.21bn in the same month last year. Cumulatively, the deficit for July-August stood at $6.02bn, up from $4.66bn in the corresponding period last year.
For FY25, the annual trade deficit expanded by 9pc to $26.27bn, from $24.11bn a year earlier, raising concerns about the sustainability of external accounts in the face of fragile export growth and a rising import bill.

In low-income countries alone, eight of out ten people live without all three — healthy air, water, and land — according to the report, ‘Reboot Development: The Economics of a Livable Planet’. New evidence shows that the loss of forests disrupts rainfall, dries soils, and worsens droughts, costing billions of dollars.
The report also identifies a nitrogen paradox where fertilisers boost yields, but overuse in some regions harms crops and ecosystems, costing as much as $3.4 trillion annually. And air and water pollution silently damage health, productivity, and cognition, thereby sapping human potential, the report estimates.
If managed well, however, nature can create jobs, drive economic growth, and build resilience.  Using natural resources more efficiently could reduce pollution by as much as 50 per cent. Improving farm-level practices of nitrogen fertiliser use can deliver 25 times greater benefits than their cost, while boosting crop yields.
Improving water and sanitation services could be lifesaving: chlorinating water at point of use could save a quarter of the children that prematurely die from water-related issues. “Pollution markets” not only reduce air pollution, they are also cost effective: each dollar spent yields about $26 to $215 in benefits.
Around 80 pc of the people in low-income countries live with all three environmental stressors — degraded land, polluted air, and water stress. By contrast, in high-income countries 43 per cent of people are not exposed to any of the three stressors.
The report says the scale of impacts is so vast that humans have transitioned from being passive beneficiaries of the planet to becoming the dominant force in its transformation.
Today humans and their livestock account for an astonishing 95 per cent of total mammalian biomass (by weight) on Earth, leaving wild mammals a vanishing 5 per cent.
The Earth has transgressed six of the nine environmental thresholds — termed “Planetary Boundaries” — needed for human progress, the report says.

• Suicide causes one in every 100 deaths; mental health disorders cost the world economy an estimated $1tr annually
ISLAMABAD: More than one billion people suffer from mental health disorders, with suicide claiming over one in every 100 lives and leaving families worldwide to cope with its devastating impact, the WHO has warned.
Speaking to reporters, Devora Kestel, the interim head of the WHO’s non-communicable disease and mental health department said, “Globally, suicide accounts for more than one in every 100 deaths, and for each death, there are 20 suicide attempts.”
She added that those suicides “affected countless more lives and livelihoods, as friends, carers and loved ones were forced to grapple with unimaginable hardship.
Conditions such as anxiety and depression are taking an immense human and economic toll. While many countries have bolstered their mental health policies and programmes, greater investment and action are needed globally to expand services to prote­­ct and promote people’s mental well-being.
Mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression are highly prevalent in all countries and communities, affecting people of every age and income level. They are the second leading cause of long-term disability, contributing significantly to the loss of healthy life. They drive up healthcare costs for affected people and families, while inflicting substantial economic losses on a global scale.
Meanwhile, the new findings published in two reports — World Mental Health Today and Mental Health Atlas 2024 — highlight some areas of progress while exposing significant gaps in addressing mental health conditions worldwide.
These reports serve as critical tools to inform national strategies and shape global dialogue ahead of the 2025 United Nations High-Level Meeting on noncommunicable diseases and the promotion of mental health and well-being, scheduled for September 25 in New York.
“Transforming mental health services is one of the most pressing public health challenges,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebre­yesus, WHO Director-General. “Investing in mental health means investing in people, communities, and economies — an investment no country can afford to neglect.
Every government and every leader has a responsibility to act with urgency and to ensure that mental healthcare is treated not as a privilege, but as a basic right for all.”
Key data
The reports show that while prevalence of mental health disorders can vary by sex, women are disproportionately impacted overall. Anxiety and depression are the most common types of mental health disorders among both men and women.
Suicide remains a devastating outcome, claiming an estimated 727,000 lives in 2021 alone. It is a leading cause of death among young people in all countries and across socioeconomic groups.
Despite global efforts, progress in reducing suicide mortality is too low to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of a one-third reduction in suicide rates by 2030. On the current trajectory, only a 12 per cent reduction will be achieved by that deadline.
The economic impact of mental health disorders is staggering. While healthcare costs are high, the indirect costs — particularly from lost productivity — are even greater. Depression and anxiety alone cost the global economy an estimated $1 trillion each year.
The reports reveal a concerning stagnation in mental health investment. Median government spending on mental health remains at just 2pc of total health budgets — unchanged since 2017. Disparities between countries are stark; while high-income countries spend up to $65 per person on mental health, low-income countries spend as little as $0.04. The global median number of mental health workers is only 13 per 100, 000 people, with extreme shortages in low- and middle-income countries.
Reform and development of mental health services are progressing slowly. Fewer than 10pc of countries have fully transitioned to community-based care models, with most still in the early stages of transition.
Encouragingly, most countries report having functional mental health promotion initiatives such as early childhood development, school-based mental health programmes and suicide prevention strategies.
Over 80pc of countries now offer mental health and psychosocial support as part of emergency responses.

Flooding across the northwestern state killed at least 29 people and affected over 250,000 last month, with the state’s chief minister calling it “one of the worst flood disasters in decades”.
The region is often dubbed India’s breadbasket, but more than 940 square kilometres (360 square miles) of farmland are flooded, leading to “devastating crop losses”, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
PM Modi on Monday assured him of the federal government’s “full support”.

Over 1,000 boats, 30 helicopters deployed to rescue the stranded, supply food

Authorities have said they fear a “huge loss of livestock”, the full extent of which will only be clear when the waters recede, according to a bulletin issued by the state authorities late Monday.
India’s army and disaster teams have carried out vast rescue operations, deploying more than 1,000 boats and 30 helicopters to rescue the stranded or supply food. “The most important thing is to save the lives of people and helpless animals trapped in the water,” Mann said in a statement.
Rivers in the region cross into Pakistan, where floodwater has also engulfed swathes of land.
Floods and landslides are common during the June-September monsoon season in the subcontinent, but experts say climate change, coupled with poorly planned development, is increasing their frequency, severity and impact.
Northwest India has seen rainfall surge by more than a third on average from June to September, according to the national weather department.
In the capital Delhi, relentless rains have swollen the Yamuna river — which breached its danger mark on Tuesday, inundating several areas and creating traffic snarl-ups lasting for hours.
Deadly floods triggered by record-breaking rain also killed dozens in India-held Kashmir last month.

• Belgium to recognise Palestinian state at UNGA
JERUSALEM: Israel intensified its military build-up on Tuesday as reservists began responding to call-up orders ahead of a planned offensive to capture Gaza City, nearly two years into a devastating war.
Despite mounting pressure at home and abroad to end its campaign in the Palestinian territory, Israel is gearing up to seize Gaza’s largest city — intensifyi­­ng bombardments and operati­ng in the outskirts in recent days.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 56 people on Tuesday, including 10 in an air strike on a residential building in the southwest of Gaza City.
AFP footage from the aftermath of the strike in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood showed Pa­­­lestinians carrying a dead girl from the rubble of the top floor.
“We were sleeping safely in our homes and suddenly we wo­­ke up to the sound of bombing and destruction and found most of our neighbours murder­­ed and injured,” said Sanaa al-Dreimli.
The United Nations estimates that nearly a million people live in Gaza City and its surroundings, where a famine has been declared.
In a statement, the Israeli military said it had been preparing in recent days “ahead of expanded combat operations and the large-scale mobilisation of reservists”.
Speaking at an event in Jeru­salem, Defence Minister Israel Katz said: “Tens of thousands of reservists have left their homes, families and jobs to once again answer the national call — the return of all prisoners and the neutralisation of Hamas.”
Approving the military’s pla­ns for the conquest of Gaza City in late August, Katz said he had authorised the call-up of about 60,000 reservists.
Israeli media reported that some 40,000 reservists were being called up in the first mobilisation wave.
On the ground in Gaza City, weary Palestinians told AFP they felt helpless and desperate ahead of the looming offensive.
“There is no place for us to go, and no means to get there. We are exhausted physically and mentally from displacement and from the war,” 60-year-old Amal Abdel-Aal, who lives in a tent in western Gaza City, told AFP by telephone.
“We have come to wish for death.”
Palestinian state
Belgium on Tuesday became the latest Western country to say it will recognise the State of Palestine at the UN General Assembly this month, following similar announcements by Australia, Canada and France.
“Palestine will be recognised by Belgium at the UN session! And firm sanctions are being imposed against the Israeli government,” Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot wrote on X.
In July, French President Emmanuel Macron said France would recognise a Palestinian state at the UN meeting, due to be held from September 9 to 23 in New York. More than a dozen other Western countries have since called on others to do the same.
Prevot said the decision came “in view of the humanitarian tragedy” unfolding in Gaza, where Israeli offensives have displaced most of the population at least once and the UN has declared a famine.
“In the face of the violence perpetrated by Israel in violation of international law, given its international obligations, including the duty to prevent any risk of genocide, Belgium had to take strong decisions to increase pressure on the Israeli government and Hamas terrorists,” Prevot wrote.
“This is not about punishing the Israeli people, but rather about ensuring that its government respects international and humanitarian law and taking action to try to change the situation on the ground,” he added.
In a post on X on Tuesday, the military’s Arabic-language spo­kesman warned Gazans of the upcoming “expansion of comb­­at operations towards Gaza City”.
“We wish to remind you that in Al-Mawasi enhanced services will be provided, with an emphasis on access to medical care, water and food,” Avichay Adraee said, referring to an area in the south which Israel designated a humanitarian zone in the early months of the war but which has been hit by repeated strikes.
In mid-August, UN human rights office spokesman Thame­­en al-Kheetan said Palestinians in Al-Mawasi had “little or no access to essential services and supplies, including food, water, electricity and tents”.

The KP CM’s support for the long-proposed-but-never-built project stirred a veritable hornet’s nest, with even his own party leaders opposing his endorsement for the controversial project.
However, the maverick politician’s views prompted endorsement from unlikely quarters — the Punjab government, led by PML-N.
A day earlier, at rain-hit event held at KP House in Islamabad, the KP CM had expressed ‘conditional support’ for projects like the Kalabagh Dam, saying they were necessary for the sake of future generations.
However, in the same bre­­­ath, he said that the reservations of all stakeholders, including provinces, should be addressed prior to its construction.
Political circles have been abuzz since then, with many struggling to decide whether to view his remarks as courageous or foolhardy.
In another interaction with journalists in the capital on Tuesday, CM Gandapur referred to international studies that favoured the construction of the controversial Kalabagh Dam.
He said he had brought up the issue during a recent meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI), but claimed that some “foolish people” were against it.
Meanwhile, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari on Tuesday said that for the first time, the Punjab government had found itself in agreement with the KP CM on this issue. Speaking at a presser, she said that Punjab endorsed what Mr Gandapur had said about the Kalabagh Dam.
She said that Pakistan was among the countries most severely affected by climate change, making the construction of new dams a national necessity. She even suggested that all provinces should work on a joint action plan.
But the KP CM’s statement had his own party puzzled. PTI leader and former National Assembly speak Asad Qaiser told Dawn Mr Gandapur’s statement did not reflect party policy.
“The party has always made it clear that there should not be any controversial project in Pakistan. At the moment, there is need to strengthen the federation. The policy of Imran Khan is very clear, no such project can be started without consensus and the same has been suggested by the party’s Central Executive Committee,” he said.
Asked why he thought the chief minister would make such a statement, Mr Qaiser said that Gandapur should not have discussed the controversial issue.
“I cannot fathom how he has made the statement without discussing it within the party. I would say that it is his personal opinion and not party policy”, he added.
Meanwhile, PTI Sindh leader Haleem Adil Sheikh called the proposal a “dead horse” which the party has never supported.
In a statement, Mr Sheikh said that jailed PTI founder Imran Khan had repeatedly opposed the controversial dam’s construction during his tenure, making the party’s stance clear.PPP leader Nisar Khuhro also expressed his annoyance over the KP CM’s statement, recalling that Sindh, KP and Balochistan have opposed the project in the past.

• Five security men martyred in Kech IED blast
QUETTA: At least 13 people were killed and 35 others injured in a suicide bombing near Shahwani Stadium in the Sariab area here on Tuesday night, shortly after the conclusion of a public meeting of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal) held to mark the death anniversary of the late Sardar Attaullah Mengal.
BNP President and MNA Sardar Akhtar Mengal, who presided over the gathering, remained unhurt as the blast occurred when he was leaving for home. Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Asghar Khan Achakzai of the Awami National Party (ANP), and former senator Mir Kabeer Muhammad Shai of the National Party were also present, but escaped unhurt.
However, former BNP MPA Mir Ahmed Nawaz Baloch and the party’s central labour secretary Musa Jan were among those injured along with several party workers and supporters.
“We have received 13 bodies and 35 injured at the hospital,” Dr Wasim Baig told Dawn, adding that the condition of several injured was critical.
Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Hamza Shafqaat, however, confirmed the death toll at 11 at that time. “So far, 11 people have lost their lives while over 30 are injured,” he said, warning that the toll could rise as many were in serious condition.
 
 

Officials confirmed it was a suicide attack. The bomber detonated his explosives-laden jacket in the parking area as participants were leaving the meeting.
According to police, the explosion occurred about 15 minutes after the meeting ended, when crowds were dispersing.
“The blast took place in the parking area of the stadium,” said BNP’s senior vice president Sajid Tareen, adding that Sardar Mengal was still present at the time but later reached home safely.
Six vehicles, including bulletproof cars belonging to politicians, were damaged in the explosion. Mir Kabeer Muhammad Shai survived as he was inside his bulletproof vehicle when the blast occurred.
In a late-night statement, the Balochistan Home Department said a high-level investigation had been ordered. Authorities had collected evidence from the site, it said, adding that the injured were being provided the best possible medical care.
The deceased were identified as Muhammad Ishaq, Najeebullah, Shan, Muhammad Hanif, Madad Khan, Waqir Ahmed, Hafeez, Abdul Nabi, Nasarullah, Allah Bakhsh, Najeebullah, son of Asadullah, Allah Bakhsh and Muhammad Waqar.
Kech IED blast
Separately, five security personnel were martyred and three others injured on  Tuesday when a convoy of security forces was targeted in a blast in the  Buleda area of Kech district, near the Pakistan-Iran border.
Officials said the convoy of Frontier Corps personnel was passing near Babar Post when a powerful explosion struck one of the vehicles.  Five soldiers lost their lives in the attack, while three others sustained injuries.
A senior security official confirmed that the blast occurred close to the convoy. He said an improvised explosive device (IED),  planted by unidentified miscreants on the roadside, was detonated when the convoy was passing through the area.

Both teams observed a minute of silence for the flood victims in Pakistan and the earthquake victims in Afghanistan before the match.
Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan said that they would aim for crossing 170 after winning the toss and batting, but his team fell just short of that mark as Pakistan’s bowlers, led by Faheem, kept the lid on scoring.
However, the Pakistani reply never got going as the Afghan bowlers kept taking wickets at regular intervals, with pacer Haris Rauf being the highest scorer for the Green Shirts.
 






Faheem was the pick of the bowlers for Pakistan, picking a career best of four wickets for 27 runs and picking up the prized scalps of player of the match Ibrahim Zadran and Sediqullah Atal as both batters scored 50s for their side.
Pakistan still top the table in the tri-series, with both sides scheduled to play the UAE ahead of the final on Sunday.
The Afghan batting innings suffered an early blow as Saim Ayub got rid of Rahmanullah Gurbaz in just the second over of the innings after the Afghan opener hit him for the first maximum of the match.
The part-time spinner gave away just 18 runs in his quota of four overs, keeping the Afghan batters in check.
Pakistan’s fast bowlers hit back of a length at the start of the innings, being wary of not bowling too full on the high-scoring Sharjah pitch.
Haris, who took four wickets in the previous encounter, was welcomed to the crease with a maximum by Zadran in the fifth over, courtesy of a pull shot off a short delivery that went over the mid-wicket boundary.
Pakistan’s bowlers kept a lid on Afghanistan’s scoring in the powerplay — with the Afghan Atalan getting just 34 in the first six overs for the loss of one wicket.
Zadran and southpaw opener Atal kept the scoreboard ticking, reaching 73-1 at the halfway mark of the Afghan innings.
Both batters subsequently upped the scoring rate for Afghanistan — taking 20 off the 14th over bowled by Sufyan Muqim, with Atal bringing up his second 50 of the tournament.
The left-handed opener finally fell for 64 of 46 deliveries in the 16th over when he misqued a shot trying to hit Faheem Ashraf over long-on.
Zadran continued to hit boundaries, reaching the 50-run mark in 38 balls and hitting back-to-back fours to end the 17th over by Haris.
Azmatullah Omarzai fell to Faheem, who took a catch of his own bowling after the Afghan all-rounder top-edged a ball after being dropped earlier. Zadran was the next to follow, mistiming a slower ball to Muhammad Nawaz at deep mid-wicket.
The Afghan batters continued to get the odd boundary and finished on 169-5 at the end of the first innings.
Pakistan’s chase suffered early setbacks as both openers were back in the dressing room with just 27 on the board, courtesy some sharp bowling by Afghan pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi.
Both Saim and Sahibzada Farhan fell to him as the left-arm pacer bowled tight lines and lengths in his first spell.
Pakistan’s innings momentum returned in the sixth over of the innings, courtesy a six by skipper Salman Ali Agha and one by Fakhar Zaman that ended up on the enclosure roof.
That was short-lived as Fakhar fell to the wily off-spin of Muhammad Nabi and the Pakistan skipper got run out in a casual manner while returning for a second run.
The Afghan spinners then took wickets at regular intervals as none of the Pakistani batters crossed the 30-run mark, barring Haris — who top-scored with four sixes to bring some respectability to the Green Shirts’ final tally.
Pakistan had brought in Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris in place of Hasan Ali and Salman Mirza — the latter duo having played against the UAE in the previous encounter for the Green Shirts.
In the tournament being played as a warm-up ahead of the Asia Cup — which starts on September 9 — Pakistan started with thrashings of Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates, thanks to several players chipping in with impactful contributions. The tournament’s final is set for Sept 7.
After seasoned pacer Haris Rauf and skipper Salman Ali Agha led Pakistan to a 39-run win over Afghanistan in the opener, Saim Ayub and Hasan Nawaz scored half-centuries each to see the side down UAE by 31 runs.
The UAE fixture saw Pakistan cross the 200-mark as Hasan Nawaz launched a late onslaught after opener Saim Ayub had set the stage. Experienced fast bowler Hasan Ali then wrapped up the proceedings with 3-47 as UAE’s Asif Khan’s blistering 77 off 35 went in vain.
Under white-ball head coach Mike Hesson, Pakistan are building up to next year’s T20 World Cup without now discarded senior pros Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan.
Pakistan shuffled their bowling line-up in the previous match against the UAE to bring in Hasan Ali and Salman Mirza in place of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris — the latter duo having played against Afghanistan in the previous match.
Teams:
Pakistan: Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan, Fakhar Zaman, Salman Agha (captain), Hasan Nawaz, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Sufyan Moqim.

A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued tonight said: “During early hours of September 2, 2025, in a cowardly terrorist attack, khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khwarij targeted FC Headquarters in Bannu district.
“The Indian sponsored kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by the vigilant and resolute response by own troops. In their desperation, the kharjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The ISPR added that in a display of “unwavering courage and professional excellence”, troops engaged the terrorists with precision and eliminated all five of them. The ISPR said six soldiers belonging to the FC and Pakistan Army were martyred in the intense exchange of fire after “putting up a heroic fight”.
The ISPR said the clearance operation in the area would continue and the perpetrators of the “heinous and cowardly act” would be brought to justice.
“The security forces of Pakistan in step with nation remain steadfast in their resolve to eradicate Indian sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further strengthen our unwavering commitment of safeguarding our nation at all costs,” it concluded.
Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu.
Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan earlier told Dawn.com that five policemen were injured during the operation that was led by Bannu District Police Officer Saleem Abbas inside the FC lines.
Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed said during a media briefing that police, army and FC personnel swiftly responded to the attack and killed four within an hour of the attack and later the fifth was also eliminated.
The IG said a clearance and search operation was carried out at the site. The operation’s conclusion was later confirmed by RPO Khan.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
Last month, police, alongside security forces in Hoveed and Wazirabad areas of Bannu, arrested “14 terrorist facilitators“ and destroyed their hideouts.
On August 3, a police constable was martyred in a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in Bannu, where an exchange of fire also left three terrorists dead and three policemen injured.
In July, ter­rorists used a quadcopter to attack a police station in Miryan, Bannu, making it the fifth such attack at the installation in a month.
According to data released by the Islamabad-based think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), the country witnessed an alarming spike in militant violence in August this year, registering a 74 per cent increase in militant attacks compared to July, becoming the “deadliest month in over a decade“.</p><small>2025-09-02 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621606-cm-gandapur-says-mistrust-between-establishment-imran-khan-persists' target='_blank'><strong>CM Gandapur says mistrust between establishment, Imran Khan persists</strong></a><br><p>

In recent years, Russia and Pakistan have engaged in strengthening bilateral ties with each other. In July, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk said Islamabad and Moscow were “natural allies”. On June 3, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in a meeting with PM’s aide Syed Tariq Fatemi, reaffirmed Russia’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan, following a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed last September on multi-sector collaboration.
The meeting between the two leaders took place in Beijing today amid their visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of States (CHS) summit a day ago.
Addressing the Russian president, PM Shehbaz said: “Relations between the two countries have improved in recent years due to your personal commitment and interest.”
He expressed the resolve that Pakistan was also keen to strengthen the bilateral relations further, adding that they were moving in the right direction.
The premier added that after their meeting in Astana last year, both countries witnessed a flurry of delegation visits at the higher level, adding they also signed protocols to promote the agriculture, iron, steel, energy and transport sectors.
The prime minister also underlined the significance of the trade corridor connecting Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, noting that this initiative would boost regional connectivity and prosperity.
Expressing his satisfaction, he said both sides were keenly committed to building their relations.
The prime minister also expressed gratitude to the Russian president for supporting Pakistan, which was viewed as “a balancing act in the region”.
 






He said Pakistan respected Russia’s ties with India and wanted to establish very strong relations of its own, which would be “supplementary and complementary”.
PM Shehbaz expressed that these beneficial ties would add to the progress and prosperity of the region and assured President Putin of working closely in this context, as he had found him to be a “dynamic leader”.
Responding to Putin’s invitation to attend the SCO Heads of Government Summit in November, the premier replied that he was looking forward to it.
Meanwhile, President Putin said, “Pakistan has always been a traditional partner and remains as such in Asia, and we cherish these ties,” adding that both sides had agreed to intensify their bilateral relations.
The president noted that their bilateral trade needed to be enhanced and stressed taking steps to address the issue.
He also expressed his grief and extended his condolences to the people and the government of Pakistan on the losses suffered from catastrophes and natural disasters, including the recent flooding.
 






President Putin expressed optimism that Pakistan would overcome such challenges under the current leadership.
He also opined that the two countries kept cooperating at the inter-parliamentary levels, adding, “Pakistan is a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and both countries are keeping contacts within the framework of the United Nations, which is an important platform.”
Prior to their meeting, the prime minister appreciated Putin’s leadership for making sincere efforts to promote bilateral relations with Pakistan.
He observed that after their meeting in Astana during last year’s SCO-CHS summit, they had agreed to work closely to bolster the bilateral cooperation.
PM Shehbaz expressed confidence that together, both countries would make further efforts to promote bilateral ties and cooperation, particularly in commerce and trade.
He added that Pakistan-Russia bilateral trade witnessed a spike as Islamabad imported oil from Moscow last year that led to an increase in the trade volume.
PM, Tajik president express satisfaction with ongoing bilateral cooperation
Separately, PM Shehbaz met Tajikistan’s president and both leaders expressed their satisfaction with the ongoing cooperation between their countries in all areas of mutual interest.
The two leaders agreed to enhance collaboration in diverse fields, including trade and investment, connectivity, energy, regional security, culture, and people-to-people exchanges.
 






Both also reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations rooted in shared cultural, historical, and religious ties.
They further shared perspectives on regional and global issues of common concern.</p><small>2025-09-02 15:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621584-magnitude-54-earthquake-jolts-islamabad-kp-regions' target='_blank'><strong>Magnitude-5.4 earthquake jolts Islamabad, KP regions</strong></a><br><p>

Kim rode into the Chinese capital in his signature armoured train on Tuesday, ahead of his attendance at a military parade to be held by China to commemorate the end of World War Two. He has never attended a world event with so many other foreign leaders, and it marks one of his most momentous diplomatic moves since holding historic summits with Donald Trump during the US president’s first term, analysts and South Korean officials said.
While more than two dozen national leaders will attend, the Kremlin has said Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim will flank Chinese President Xi Jinping on either side during the parade.

“It’s elevating North Korea’s position to kind of the big boys, and then Kim can project that image back home like he did with his summit with Donald Trump, he can really show off his world statesman side,” said John Delury, a senior fellow at The Asia Society. “Kim Jong Un is a global brand.”
Some Western analysts have dubbed the trio an “Axis of Upheaval,” but South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) told lawmakers in Seoul on Tuesday that the event may be unlikely to lead to real trilateral cooperation soon.
What is more clear, however, is the political, economic, and military benefits to Kim and North Korea, which is under numerous international sanctions for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, and the government’s human rights abuses.
“This China visit is a bold move by Kim Jong Un as he makes a debut in multilateral diplomacy by displaying the optics of allying with China and Russia and it’s likely he will go on to take dramatic steps both domestically and internationally,” South Korean lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters after a closed-door briefing by the intelligence agency.

South Korea’s parliament speaker will also be attending the event and said on Tuesday he would raise the issue of peace on the peninsula if he gets a chance to see Kim, but that he was not sure a meeting would happen.
Kim visited North Korean missile production facilities immediately before leaving for China, underscoring the country’s status as a nuclear power, said Hong Min, a senior research fellow at Seoul’s Institute for National Unification.
“In addition, North Korea’s legitimacy for possessing nuclear weapons is indirectly supported by watching and applauding a military parade featuring China’s advanced [nuclear] weapons,” he said.
‘Nothing but opportunities’
In 2023, Kim embarked on a significant diplomatic gambit with Putin that led to summits in Russia and in North Korea, a mutual defence treaty, and the sending of thousands of troops and weapons for Russia’s war with Ukraine.
The Beijing visit will help restore North Korea’s relations with China, which have frayed as Kim cultivated those Russian ties, and help Pyongyang secure economic aid in the face of continued sanctions, the NIS said.

It could also help Kim hedge his bets in case the war in Ukraine winds down and Russia no longer needs as much help, and could send signals to Washington by displaying China’s support, the agency concluded.
“From Kim’s perspective, this visit and these events present nothing but opportunities and benefits,” said Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert with the US-based Stimson Centre, noting that the last time a North Korean leader was present at a big, multilateral event like this outside the country was in 1959.
Beyond Xi and Putin, Kim will have his first chance to meet with leaders of many countries, even if only informally, and potentially expand cooperation or simply make a first impression on otherwise wary officials, Madden said.
“As we have seen in the past, the impact of the North Korean leaders presence, shorn of the trappings of the … propaganda machine, is almost always disarming to foreign leaders,” he said. “Foreign leadership who have avoided North Korea may change their minds if they meet Kim.”
Moreover, Sang Uk, a military expert at the Asan Institute in Seoul, said, “I do believe that the sales for weapons are one of the purposes of this visit.”
That is likely secondary to the political messaging, however, and given that United Nations Security Council resolutions technically remain in force on North Korea, any arms deals would have to happen under the table, he said.</p><small>2025-09-02 10:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621533-treasury-opposition-unite-in-backing-water-reservoirs-to-curb-flood-devastation' target='_blank'><strong>Treasury, opposition unite in backing water reservoirs to curb flood devastation</strong></a><br><p>
