Last week, President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, enacting it into law.
Speaking to reporters in Chiniot, the PM’s aide said that the amendment would deal with “public issues, such as local bodies, population, the National Finance Commission … health-related issues”.
“There is a need to review how we can better serve the people according to the present needs of the provinces and the Centre,” Sanaullah stated.
“This is being debated and if there is any consensus, then we can bring the 28th Amendment forward,” said the PML-N leader.
Referring to the recent resignations by judges of the Supreme Court and LHC, the PM’s aide said that “those who stepped down did so due to their personal motives”.
He maintained that the parliament has the constitutional right to pass amendments, while judges are meant to protect the laws of the state.
 


The 27th Constitutional Amendment bill was tabled in the Senate on November 8, just hours after it was approved by the federal cabinet in a meeting chaired by PM Shehbaz via a video link from Baku. It was subsequently referred to the parliamentary standing committees on law and justice, which approved it the very next day with some minor changes to the initial draft.
The bill proposed the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) as well as changes to the military leadership structure.
The law minister tabled it in the Senate for voting on Nov 10. The contentious bill was approved by the upper house of Parliament after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The PML-N led coalition government had managed to secure a two-thirds majority to get the bill passed with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines.
On November 12, the bill was passed by the National Assembly after the introduction of some changes, mostly related to the chief justice of Pakistan.
In the house of 336 members, 224 votes were required to meet the mandatory two-thirds majority for the passage of the bill. The ruling lawmakers cast 234 votes in its favour, while four votes were polled against the bill by the JUI-F members. The JUI-F has 10 MNAs, but only four attended the sitting. The PTI members, meanwhile, boycotted the process by staging a walkout.
The bill, however, was referred back to the Senate due to the fresh changes and was approved after a second round of voting amid the opposition’s protest.</p><small>2025-11-17 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634109-ecp-decides-to-hold-islamabad-local-govt-elections' target='_blank'><strong>ECP decides to hold Islamabad local govt elections</strong></a><br><p>

The draft, which has been revised several times as a result of high-stakes negotiations, “endorses” the plan, which allowed for a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to take hold on October 10 in the war-wracked Palestinian territory.
The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of fighting, sparked by Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.
The latest version of the text, seen by AFP, authorises the creation of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) that would work with Israel and Egypt and newly trained Palestinian police to help secure border areas and demilitarise the Gaza Strip.
The ISF also would work on the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” protecting civilians and securing humanitarian aid corridors.
In addition, it would authorise the formation of a “Board of Peace,” a transitional governing body for Gaza — which Trump would theoretically chair — with a mandate running until the end of 2027.
Unlike previous drafts, the latest version mentions a possible future Palestinian state.
Once the Palestinian Authority has carried out requested reforms and the rebuilding of Gaza is underway, “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” the draft says.
That eventuality has been firmly rejected by Israel.
“Our opposition to a Palestinian state on any territory has not changed,” Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday.
However, Hamas and other armed groups have criticised the draft resolution, warning it would pave the way for foreign control over Palestinian decision-making, Al Jazeera reports.
The group said it would hand Gaza’s governance and reconstruction to a supranational body, stripping Palestinians of self-rule, and described plans for an international force as imposing foreign guardianship.
The factions insisted that humanitarian aid should be managed by Palestinian institutions under UN supervision and also rejected disarming Gaza or curbing the right to resist. Hamas called for international mechanisms to hold Israel accountable for rights abuses and border control policies.
The UN Security Council vote is set for 2200 GMT (3:00 am on Tuesday Pakistan time).
Russian objections
Veto-wielding Russia has circulated a competing draft, saying the US document does not go far enough towards backing the creation of a Palestinian state.
Moscow’s text, seen by AFP, asks the Council to express its “unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution”.
It does not authorise a Board of Peace or the deployment of an international force for the time being, instead asking UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to offer “options” on those issues.
The United States has intensified its campaign to earn support for its resolution, hitting out at “attempts to sow discord” among Council members.
“Any refusal to back this resolution is a vote either for the continued reign of Hamas terrorists or for the return to war with Israel, condemning the region and its people to perpetual conflict,” the US ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, wrote in The Washington Post.
The US has made known that it has the backing of several Arab and Muslim-majority nations, publishing a joint statement of support for the text signed by Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan, and Turkey.
Several diplomats told AFP that despite Russian criticism and hesitance on the part of other member states, they expect the US draft to be adopted.
“We expect broad support for the resolution,” said one diplomat at the UN, requesting anonymity to discuss negotiations on the resolution. “Although Russia has at times hinted at a possible veto, it would be difficult to oppose a text backed by Palestine and the region.” That would likely also be the case for China, which also holds a veto, the diplomat said.
“The Russians know that while a lot of Council members will go along with the US plans, they share concerns about the substance of the US text and the way Washington has tried to fast-track it through New York,” Richard Gowan of the International Crisis Group told AFP.
He, however, said he doubts that Moscow will use its veto on a resolution backed by Arab nations.
“I think it is more likely that China and Russia will abstain, register their skepticism about the plan and then sit back and watch the US struggle to put it into action,” Gowan said.
‘Suspicious’ flights from Israel show ‘agenda to cleanse Palestinians’
South Africa said today that the surprise arrival of 153 Palestinians on a plane last week indicated “a clear agenda to cleanse Palestinians” out of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
The group landed in Johannesburg on a chartered flight last Thursday without departure stamps from Israel in their passports. Reports said a shadowy organisation named Al-Majd was involved in their travel from Gaza.
“We are suspicious, as the South African government, about the circumstances surrounding the arrival of the plane,” Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told reporters.
South African border police kept the group on the plane for 12 hours before President Cyril Ramaphosa allowed them entry on a standard 90-day visa exemption.
It emerged later that a previous flight carrying 176 Palestinians had arrived on October 28, according to the local Gift of the Givers charity that is assisting the arrivals.
“We do not want any further flights to come our way because this is a clear agenda to cleanse out Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank and those areas, which South Africa is against,” Lamola said.
“It does look like it represents a broader agenda to remove Palestinians from Palestine into many different parts of the world, and is a clearly orchestrated operation,” he said, without providing further details.</p><small>2025-11-17 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17225117fd0a6aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955667/pakistan-bets-on-ai-to-tackle-smog-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan bets on AI to tackle smog crisis</strong></a><br><p>Lahore, once celebrated as the City of Gardens, now chokes each winter under a grey shroud of smog — its skies thick with toxic haze that has become the city’s defining feature.
Every November, as the monsoon fades, a suffocating layer of smoke and dust engulfs Lahore, India’s capital New Delhi and much of northern South Asia.
The mix of crop burning, vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions drives air pollution to deadly levels, forcing authorities to shut schools, businesses and highways.
This winter, as air quality plummets again, the Punjab government is betting on an unconventional ally to fight back: artificial intelligence (AI).
Authorities say they are deploying one of the region’s most technologically advanced clean-air programmes, with AI systems at the centre of forecasting, enforcement and public response.
 


Some 100 AI-powered air-quality monitoring stations have been established across Punjab, home to nearly 130 million people, according to Punjab Environment Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb.
These smart stations continuously analyse pollution data using machine-learning algorithms to predict air-quality surges before they occur. The information feeds into a 24-hour “smog war room” — a real-time climate intelligence hub integrating satellite feeds, ground sensors and international databases.
Aurangzeb told Anadolu that across major industrial and urban centres, 8,500 cameras, drones and thermal sensors are linked to this AI dashboard, tracking emissions from factories and brick kilns. “Each emission source is geo-tagged, QR-coded, and algorithmically assessed for compliance,” she said.
From smoke to smart data
Punjab has also created a specialised Environmental Protection Force (EPF) digitally connected to the AI command centre. When sensors detect an emission spike, nearby EPF units receive automatic alerts and are dispatched with drones and smart devices to verify violations and seal polluting sites.
Another innovation is the deployment of AI-guided anti-smog guns across Lahore, programmed to activate automatically when particulate levels exceed safe limits.
Early pilot tests showed a 70 per cent improvement in air quality in Lahore’s Kahna area within hours of operation, Aurangzeb said.
Citizens are also part of the digital ecosystem. Through the Air Quality Index Punjab app, Green Punjab app and helpline 1373, residents can report pollution sources directly. The system categorises complaints and assigns them automatically — with a reported 96pc closure rate.
Using satellite data from Nasa and Pakistan Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission, the AI network also detects crop-burning incidents in real time and cross-references them with farm-loan databases to target enforcement.
According to the government, the system has helped reduce stubble burning by 65pc in a year, while in Punjab’s industrial belt, it says 95pc of factories now operate under emission-control systems.
‘No silver bullet’ for smog
 
 

But while AI may be transforming enforcement, experts caution that technology alone cannot solve Pakistan’s deep-rooted pollution crisis.
Air pollution kills an estimated 128,000 Pakistanis each year, according to Fair Finance Pakistan. Analysts say real progress requires cleaner fuels, modern refineries and a shift away from outdated industrial practices.
Imran Saqib Khalid, a climate governance expert in Islamabad, said Lahore’s smog cannot be fixed without tackling its primary sources.
“Vehicular emissions contribute significantly to air pollution in Lahore, which can be addressed through the use of high-quality fuel, along with an improved public transport system,” he told Anadolu.
Pakistan, he said, lacks modern refineries capable of producing cleaner fuel. “Although we have started to import improved-quality fuel, it is not enough to meet our needs.”
Khalid also pointed to the country’s thousands of brick kilns, many of which burn low-quality coal or even old tyres. “Even the so-called ‘zigzag technology’ kilns fail to meet national environmental standards because of poor-quality fuel,” he said, adding that zigzag firing, while efficient in theory, “cannot deliver results without fuel reform”.
“Air pollution is a complex issue but it has been addressed elsewhere in the world. It will take time and effort — there is no silver bullet solution,” he said. “It cannot be done through surface-level measures such as smog guns and smog towers.”
Environmentalists acknowledge that Punjab’s use of AI marks a new seriousness in tackling smog, but they say lasting improvements demand systemic reforms.
Yasir Hussain, a Karachi-based environmentalist, said the government’s approach this year shows more coordination than previous efforts but still lacks long-term impact.
“Artificial rain and smog guns don’t have a permanent or lasting effect,” he said. “Within an hour, pollution levels return because so much gas and particulate matter come from vehicles, industrial units, brick kilns and stubble burning.”
He believes the electric vehicle policy introduced this year could make a difference over time. “This government has taken some measures to mitigate smog, but there is a long way to go,” he added.</p><small>2025-11-17 17:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17190112828dc38.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955655/compensation-package-for-martyred-injured-civil-armed-forces-personnel-raised-interior-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Compensation package for martyred, injured civil armed forces personnel raised: interior ministry</strong></a><br><p>The government on Monday revised the compensation package for martyred and injured Civil Armed Forces (CAF) personnel, according to a notification issued by the interior ministry.
CAFs are defined as a federal paramilitary force working under the interior ministry, according to Section 18, sub-section 21 of Schedule II of the Rules of Business, 1973, such as the Federal Constabulary, Frontier Corps, Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts and Pakistan Coast Guards.
The decision to revise compensation to be on par with the Islamabad police was made by the interior ministry in August this year and approved by the cabinet on August 25.
According to today’s notification, the minimum compensation will be Rs10 million (Grade 1-9), while the maximum is now Rs20m (Grade 20 and above).
“If a member of the CAFs is shaheed (martyred), permanently disabled, injured with serious injury or minor injury, as the case may be, while on bona fide government duty, an award under these rules may be granted to him or his family, as the case may be,” the notification read.
The package also includes Rs3m in cash compensation in the event of being “incapacitated and released from services for having become invalid as a result of injury in encounters, bomb blasts, riots or watch and ward duty or terrorist activity”.
Rs1m in compensation would be provided to personnel incapacitated in the aforementioned incidents listed, but who are still serving in the department. Serious injury would award Rs200,000, while minor injury would award compensation of Rs100,000.
In 2020, compensation amounts were revised so that the deaths and injuries of civil armed forces personnel “related to security” would award maximum compensation of Rs3m (Grade 1-16) and a maximum of Rs10m (Grade 20 and above).</p><small>2025-11-17 17:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634085-rana-sanaullah-says-28th-amendment-to-be-tabled-soon' target='_blank'><strong>Rana Sanaullah says 28th Amendment to be tabled soon</strong></a><br><p>

Of the 29 PPP members, the speaker could not cast his vote and of the 9 PML-N members, one female member abstained. Two PTI legislators — regional president Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi and leader of the opposition Khawaja Farooq Ahmed — voted against the move.
Haq, who had arrived in the hall along with four loyalists, left along with them soon after delivering his speech.
Three PTI members did not attend. One member each of the Muslim Conference and the Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party (JKPP) also abstained. Apart from them, three PTI forward bloc members — Ansar Abdali, Mazhar Saeed and deputy speaker Chaudhry Riaz — also abstained.
After the votes were counted, AJK Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, who was chairing the session, announced PPP’s Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore as the new premier.
Under the AJK Constitution, a vote of no confidence against the sitting prime minister automatically counts as a vote in favour of the lawmaker proposed as his successor in the same resolution.
Rathore is the 16th prime minister elected in AJK since 1975, when the parliamentary form of government was introduced in the region.
The newly elected prime minister said that the change would be felt not only in faces but in the system itself — and that this would be the true measure of success.
Announcing several administrative measures, he said secretaries would be entitled to only one official vehicle and that the total number of secretaries would not exceed 20. He also declared the abolition of the posts of special secretary and senior additional secretary.
He said the downsizing process would be carried down to the lowest tiers. Rathire announced the merger of the Education Department’s technical wing into the department and the drafting of a fresh transport policy. Until the new policy was finalised, no officer below grade 18 — except those in administration, the police and monitoring assistant engineers — would be permitted to use an official vehicle.
All departments, the AJK premier said, would be required to deposit extra government vehicles into the official transport pool within a week. There would be no compromise on biometric verification.
He ordered the Public Service Commission (PSC) to be reactivated and announced the cancellation of notifications for posts that had been advertised through the PSC and then withdrawn up to January 1, 2020. The PSC would hold examinations within a month and appoint qualified candidates to those posts.
The AJK premier further announced that for appointments up to grade 18 — except where recruitment was 100 per cent quota-based — at least 50pc of vacancies would be filled through direct recruitment. All departments were directed to implement this within a month.
He said the government would fully implement the Third-Party Act in accordance with the high court’s decision. The law would be enforced not only in government departments but also in semi-government organisations and autonomous bodies, including the Bank of AJK.
A uniform time-scale policy, Rathire said, would be introduced across all departments, with no time-scale increases granted above grade 19. In departments where section officer and assistant director posts existed, all admin officer positions would be abolished.
To address public grievances, the prime minister, ministers, the chief secretary, secretaries and department heads would hold open courts in every district. Complaint boxes would be installed in the offices of the prime minister and the chief secretary and opened every 15 days under their joint supervision. Judicial reforms would also be introduced, in consultation with the superior judiciary, to ensure administrative justice.
Regarding hydropower projects, the AJK PM said an agreement with the federal government would be secured in cooperation with the PML-N leadership. Improving internet speeds and strengthening the local government system were also listed as priorities.
Referring to the needs of low-paid staff, he said that as the son of Raja Mumtaz Hussain Rathore, he felt a duty of care toward junior employees, and had therefore decided to regularise all Grade-1 employees serving in permanent posts — provided they had no pending court cases and the move did not affect anyone’s pension or legal rights. He also announced one month’s additional salary for all Grade-1 employees, to be paid from departmental development budgets.
He ordered that all driver posts be upgraded to Grade-5 and said police constables would receive facilities and allowances on par with those in Punjab. Police personnel performing duties alongside important individuals would be eligible for travel and dearness allowance.
He also announced a remission of 60 days from the sentences of prisoners in all AJK jails — except those convicted under qisas, diyat, espionage, anti-state activities or terrorism, where the remission would not apply.
At the conclusion of his speech, the prime minister reaffirmed AJK’s “unwavering support for the people of occupied Kashmir”.
Earlier, when the speaker announced the results of voting and asked Rathore to take the seat reserved for the leader of the house, the prime minister-elect — dressed in qameez shalwar and a black coat — shook hands with or embraced lawmakers in the front row, including the two lone PTI legislators.
Before Rathore’s address, PPP regional president Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, PML-N regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir, his predecessor Raja Farooq Haider, PTI regional president Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi and several others also spoke.
Earlier still, the outgoing prime minister had delivered a speech shortly after the session began. He said he was leaving “in a dignified manner with a contented heart” and held no grievance against any of the pro-no-trust lawmakers, most of whom were still members of his cabinet.
“I came to thank you for relieving me of this responsibility on the one hand and to set the record straight on the other,” he said.
While asserting his “commitment to the ideology of the state’s accession to Pakistan, the armed forces and the Kashmir freedom movement”, he said those who had drafted the no-trust resolution should have consulted him first.
“My best wishes are with the new government. We will play a constructive role in the opposition. If the government performs well, we will support it shoulder to shoulder. But if there is any attempt to crush the aspirations of the people of AJK, we will resort to such a severe protest that no one has ever seen before.”
However, PTI’s Niazi mocked the outgoing premier’s claim, saying his tenure had witnessed “the worst-ever disgrace of the system and state institutions, including the Legislative Assembly”.
Niazi also strongly criticised the votes cast in favour of the no-trust motion by PTI renegades, calling it an insult to the public mandate.
“This whole process is unlawful. We will take legal action against those who returned to the Assembly on PTI tickets and then crossed the floor,” he warned.
No-confidence motion
The no-trust motion was tabled by PPP lawmaker Qasim Majeed in the assembly today, after a resolution for a no-confidence vote against outgoing PM Haq was submitted to the Assembly Secretariat on Friday afternoon. The resolution was signed by 25 lawmakers, 23 from the PPP and two from the PML-N.
Shortly after today’s session began, Haq also arrived in the house. He went up to Rathore and exchanged greetings with him. Haq left after delivering a speech.

Big screens were installed outside the assembly’s building, where people viewed the proceedings live.
Haq’s loss seemed certain even before the no-confidence motion was tabled against him today as the PPP had the guaranteed support of at least 29 lawmakers — two more than the requisite number needed for the motion to succeed.
In October, the PPP’s ranks in the AJK Legislative Assembly had swelled to 27 after 10 lawmakers from the PTI forward bloc joined the party.
On Sunday, two more PTI lawmakers, said to be from the party’s forward bloc — Minister for Elementary Education Deewan Ali Chughtai and Minister for Small Industries Corporation Taqdees Kausar Gillani — announced their decision to join the PPP after meeting Faryal Talpur.
With almost six months remaining in the assembly’s term, Rathore is the fourth prime minister elected in AJK in four years.
In August 2021, the PTI picked Niazi as the premier after he was named for the slot by then-PM Imran Khan. Niazi had secured 35 votes against the joint opposition candidate Latif Akbar, who bagged only 15 votes, in the 53-seat house.
After nine months, Niazi resigned from the position and was replaced by PTI regional president Sardar Tanveer Ilyas.
In April 2023, Tanveer was disqualified by the full court bench of the AJK High Court from being a member of the legislative assembly for contempt. He was then replaced by Haq.</p><small>2025-11-17 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17131147764cd81.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627/bangladeshs-ousted-pm-hasina-sentenced-to-death-for-crackdown-on-students' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s ousted PM Hasina sentenced to death for crackdown on students</strong></a><br><p>A Bangladesh court sentenced ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death on Monday, concluding a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year.
The ruling comes months ahead of parliamentary elections expected to be held in early February.
Hasina’s Awami League party has been barred from contesting and it is feared that Monday’s verdict could stoke fresh unrest ahead of the vote.
The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court located in the capital Dhaka, delivered the guilty verdict amid tight security and in Hasina’s absence after she fled to India in August 2024.

Hasina, 78, defied court orders that she return from India to attend her trial about whether she ordered a deadly crackdown against the student-led uprising that ousted her.
She called the guilty verdict and death sentence in her crimes against humanity trial “biased and politically motivated”.
“The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,” Hasina said in a statement issued from hiding in India. “They are biased and politically motivated. “
The verdict can be appealed in the Supreme Court.
But Hasina’s son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed, told Reuters on the eve of the verdict that they would not appeal unless a democratically elected government took office with the Awami League’s participation.

After the verdict, Bangladesh urged India to extradite Hasina and former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal. Dhaka said New Delhi was obliged to do so under an extradition treaty.
India’s foreign ministry said that it had “noted” the verdict, adding it was “committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh”.
It did not comment immediately on Bangladesh’s extradition request.
Worst violence since 1971
During the trial, prosecutors told the court that they had uncovered evidence of her direct command to use lethal force to suppress a student-led uprising in July and August 2024.
According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most of them by gunfire from security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence.
Hasina was represented by a state-appointed defence counsel who told the court that the charges against her were baseless and pleaded for her acquittal.
Ahead of the verdict, Hasina dismissed the accusations and the fairness of the Tribunal proceedings, asserting a guilty verdict was “a foregone conclusion”.
Bangladesh has been tense ahead of the verdict, with at least 30 crude bomb explosions and 26 vehicles torched across the country over the past few days. There have been no casualties, however.</p><small>2025-11-17 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17180710a2dd96b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955649/another-victim-in-hyderabad-fireworks-explosion-succumbs-to-wounds-taking-death-toll-to-10' target='_blank'><strong>Another victim in Hyderabad fireworks explosion succumbs to wounds, taking death toll to 10</strong></a><br><p>Another victim from the fireworks factory explosion in Hyderabad earlier this week succumbed to his wounds at Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) on Monday, taking the toll to 10, officials said.
At least six people were killed and seven were injured after a powerful explosion ripped through a fireworks factory in Hyderabad on Saturday. Police registered a case against multiple suspects, including the owner of an allegedly illegal firecracker factory. Nine people were reported to have died till yesterday.
LUH’s Additional Medical Superintendent (MS) Dr Mujeeb Kalwar told Dawn, “[The victim] was admitted with around 100 per cent burn wounds.”
In view of his critical condition, MS Kalwar added, the victim was taken to the surgical ward’s intensive care unit, where he breathed his last today.
Separately, Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police Adeel Chandio said three unidentified bodies, which were lying in LUH, also included the fireworks factory’s owner.
He told Dawn that these findings were confirmed based on DNA testing of the bodies.
According to a statement from the Rescue 1122 spokesperson on Saturday, the explosion was reported in a firecracker factory on the banks of the Laghari Goth river, Latifabad Police Station B Section limits.
Latifabad Assistant Commissioner Saud Lund said the fireworks were being illegally manufactured in a house without a licence.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also took strict notice of the incident and summoned a detailed report.
“The legal status of the factory should be immediately investigated. Whether the legal license and safety principles required for making fireworks were being followed or not. Playing with lives cannot be allowed, and such incidents are unacceptable in the eyes of law enforcement agencies,” he was quoted as saying in a statement on Monday.
 






The first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered on the complaint of B-Section Station House Officer Niaz Panhwar.
It invoked Sections 322 (punishment for intentional murder), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 286 (negligent conduct with respect explosive substance), 336 (punishment for mutilation or dismemberment of a limb), 336-B (punishment for hurt by corrosive substance), 337-H (punishment for hurt by a rash or negligent act) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
Factory owner Asad Yousafzai and his alleged accomplices, Rashid Khan, Dilshad Khan, Arshad and Shakeel Punjabi, were nominated as suspects in the FIR.</p><small>2025-11-17 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/172015046edcc8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955660/pti-slams-political-victimisation-inhumane-treatment-of-sic-chief-hamid-raza' target='_blank'><strong>PTI slams political victimisation, ‘inhumane’ treatment of SIC chief Hamid Raza</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Monday condemned the alleged political victimisation and “inhumane” jail conditions faced by incarcerated former MNA and Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza.
The party claimed that essential medical care and basic rights were not being provided to the incarcerated leader, which was a grave erosion of justice, due process and constitutional protections.
The Islamabad police arrested Raza and presented him before a Faisalabad anti-terrorism court, which sent him to jail to serve his 10-year jail term in the May 9 case. The SIC chief was convicted in the case along with several PTI leaders on July 31.
In a statement issued by the PTI Central Media Department, the party vehemently condemned Raza’s treatment during his detention.
“His arrest — carried out while he was on his way to voluntarily surrender before the court — and the subsequent denial of his basic rights in jail reflect a disturbing pattern of political persecution and a blatant disregard for human dignity,” it stated.
 






The PTI strongly demanded that Raza be immediately provided access to necessary medical care and legal facilities in jail.
“His family and legal counsel must be allowed to meet him in a proper and unhindered environment. PTI also calls for the prompt and impartial hearing of his appeals to ensure that justice is delivered without delay,” it stated.
The statement further asserted that his sentence reflected a broader political vendetta, while the conditions he was enduring in jail were “utterly intolerable”. The PTI expressed serious concern for his health and fundamental rights.
“He is being denied essential medication, while his family members and lawyers are forced to meet him through bars in inappropriate and restrictive conditions — an outright violation of constitutional guarantees,” the statement claimed.
It stated that equally troubling was the fact that a Lahore High Court (LHC) judge recused himself from hearing the petitions of Raza and others on November 14, resulting in unnecessary delays in the judicial process and undermining their right to timely justice.
Furthermore, the party noted that the failure to stay the by-election in constituency NA-104 had paved the way for an imbalanced and one-sided electoral process.</p><small>2025-11-17 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17210505829acb0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955609/fm-dar-arrives-in-moscow-for-shanghai-cooperation-organisation-summit' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar arrives in Moscow for Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar arrived in Russian capital Moscow on Monday to attend the Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
FM Dar was received by the Russian Deputy FM Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Director of State Protocol Aleksander Prusov, Deputy Director of Second Asia Department of Russian Foreign Ministry Alexei Surovtsev and Pakistan Embassy officers.
 






The Foreign Office (FO) said he would lead the Pakistani delegation at the summit, being held on November 17-18, at the invitation of Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Vladmirovich Mishustin.
“The CHG will be attended by the heads of government of Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the vice president of Iran, and the foreign ministers of Pakistan and India,” the statement said.
 






Further, in addition to SCO member states, the heads of the governments of Mongolia, Bahrain, Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait and Turkmenistan will also be attending the meeting alongside those of regional/international organisations, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, Euro Asian Economic Union, Collective Security Treaty Organisation and Democratic Socialists of America.
“In his address to the SCO CHG, the deputy prime minister will share Pakistan’s perspective on important regional and global issues as well as ways to strengthen the organisation for the benefit of the SCO region,” the statement added.
Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with the leaders of other SCO countries on the sidelines of the summit, the FO added.
The CHG is the second-highest decision-making institution in the SCO and provides guidance in the areas of economy, finance, trade, connectivity, commerce and socio-economic cooperation, including the organisation’s budgetary matters, according to the FO. The SCO CHG adopts joint communiqué, statements and important decisions.
The SCO held a summit in Tianjin, China, from August 31 to September 1 earlier this year. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also announced in September announced that Pakistan would be hosting the next SCO summit, but did not provide a date.</p><small>2025-11-17 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17202238af57134.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955662/pia-bangladeshs-biman-airlines-ink-landmark-cargo-deal' target='_blank'><strong>PIA, Bangladesh’s Biman Airlines ink ‘landmark’ cargo deal</strong></a><br><p>National carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and Bangladeshi carrier Biman Airlines on Monday signed a “landmark” deal to streamline the movement of air cargo between the two countries.

“​This partnership will establish a strategic corridor for regional trade,” the statement read. “The agreement will reduce the logistical complexities in the transportation of valuable commodities such as textiles, pharmaceuticals and agricultural products.
“​Through the extensive networks of the national airlines of both countries, quality and cost-effective cargo solutions will be provided,” the statement added.
On October 4, PIA announced that it would resume flights to the United Kingdom from October 25, with nonstop flights from Manchester to Islamabad.
The day prior, the Pakistan High Commission in London announced that the national carrier would resume flight operations to the UK as PIA received its Foreign Aircraft Operating Permit from the UK Civil Aviation Authority and Third Country Operator approval.</p><small>2025-11-17 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/172050168dd24ea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955665/air-india-to-resume-flights-to-china-after-nearly-6-years' target='_blank'><strong>Air India to resume flights to China after nearly 6 years</strong></a><br><p>Air India said on Monday it will resume New Delhi-China flights beginning from February 2026, nearly six years after suspension, as recent diplomatic steps are seen as cautiously reopening bilateral links.

“The reinstatement of Air India’s services to Shanghai follows recent India-China diplomatic agreements that restored the air links paused in early 2020,” Air India said in a statement.
 
 

China’s Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport last month announced flights between the two nations were set to resume.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China earlier this year, for the first time in seven years, to attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation regional security bloc.
Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed that India and China were development partners, not rivals, and discussed ways to strengthen trade ties amid global tariff uncertainty.

The opener at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium — which will host the entirety of the tournament — will be played between the hosts and Zimbabwe, and Pakistan will look up to their all-rounders to make a difference again.
The strategy, which has emerged as a blueprint of Pakistan’s white-ball head coach Mike Hesson since was appointed in May this year, has come under heavy criticism due to its nature of ignoring the importance of specialist batters and bowlers.
But for Pakistan T20 captain Salman Ali Agha, it is the go-to approach given what he believes is a “luxury” to have good enough all-rounders to deliver with both bat and ball.
“As you may have seen, we try to go for all-rounders mostly, and thankfully we have some who bowl and bat equally well,” he said in the pre-series press conference at the venue on Monday.  “So we’ll try to carry on the same combination for the tri series.
“All of the all-rounders we have can bowl all four overs, and they bat really well too. So why would we not try to utilise them?
“Mohammad Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf are full bowlers and full batters. All top teams are doing that [relying on all-rounders]. We take [having that option] it as an opportunity.”
Samad likely to return
Pakistan had named the squad for the tri-series, earlier this month and will carry on with the same players, barring batter Hasan Nawaz, who was dropped and asked to play first-class cricket following a series of poor performances.
While there was no replacement announced, Abdul Samad, another batter known for his power-hitting, is being seen as Pakistan’s choice for the lower middle-order finishing position.
“In the middle-order, you can say we are not performing the way we would like to,” Salman admitted. “Yes, Hasan Nawaz isn’t there — I hope he makes a comeback soon — but we have Abdul Samad, so we may give him a go. He bats at number six and  can play the finisher’s role.”
Pakistan are unlikely to experiment further as they look to fine tune their combination with the T20 World Cup set to be held in February-March.
“We’ll try to give opportunities to all of the 15 players in the squad, but the priority is to win matches,” Salman noted. “In T20 cricket you can’t take any team lightly.
“Whichever series we play in the near future, it is for the preparation for the World Cup.”
Salman’s own form was poor during the Asia Cup, of which Pakistan lost the final against India in September. The Pakistan skipper accumulated a paltry 72 runs across seven matches.
The right-hander, however, bounced back with a century against Sri Lanka in the first match of the ODI series, which concluded with Pakistan completing a 3-0 sweep on Sunday. Salman had earlier also scored a half-century against South Africa.
“I wasn’t in the best form during the Asia Cup, neither in a good frame of mind, perhaps,” said the 31-year-old. “Failures do really affect you in international cricket. But I’ve done well in the ODIs and will try to carry that confidence into the T20s as well.”
Sri Lanka duo sent back home
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka suffered a setback ahead of the tri-series as captain Charith Asalanka and fast bowler Asitha Fernando were ruled out due to illness and sent home as a precaution.
Sri Lanka Cricket said both players needed rest and proper medical care to ensure full recovery before future assignments.
Asalanka’s absence has led to an immediate change in leadership, with experienced all-rounder Dasun Shanaka appointed captain for the tournament.
Sri Lanka have also added young batter Pavan Rathnayake to their squad as a replacement.
The tri-series format will see each team play four league fixtures before the top two sides qualify for the November 29 final.
All matches are scheduled for a 6:00pm start, with the toss taking place at 5:30pm.

It will be the first trip by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the US since the 2018 killing of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul, which caused a global uproar. US intelligence concluded that MBS approved the capture or killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic.
The crown prince, widely known by his initials MBS, denied ordering the operation but acknowledged responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto ruler.
More than seven years later, the world’s largest economy and the world’s top oil producer want to move forward.
 
 

Trump is seeking to cash in on a $600 billion Saudi investment pledge made during Trump’s visit to the kingdom in May. He steered clear of mentioning human rights concerns during that trip and is expected to do so again.
The Saudi leader is seeking security guarantees amid regional turmoil and wants access to artificial intelligence technology and progress toward a deal on a civilian nuclear programme.
“There is a page that has been turned” on Khashoggi’s killing, said Aziz Alghashian, Saudi-based lecturer of international relations at Naif Arab University for Security Sciences.
Focus on defence deal
The US and Saudi Arabia have long had an arrangement for the kingdom to sell oil at favourable prices and for the superpower to provide security in exchange.
That equation was shaken by Washington’s failure to act when Iran struck oil installations in the kingdom in 2019. Concerns resurfaced in September, when Israel struck Doha, Qatar, in an attack it said targeted members of Palestinian group Hamas.
In the aftermath, Trump signed a defence pact with Qatar via executive order. Many analysts, diplomats and regional officials believe the Saudis will get something similar.
Saudi Arabia has sought a defence pact ratified by the US Congress in recent negotiations. But Washington has made that contingent on the kingdom normalising ties with Israel.
Riyadh has, in turn, linked that to a commitment from Israel’s government, the most right-wing in its history, to Palestinian statehood. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who agreed to a Trump-brokered ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza last month after two years of fighting, on Sunday reaffirmed his staunch opposition to Palestinian independence.
A Trump executive order on defence similar to the pact with Qatar would fall short of the defence agreement the Saudis have sought. But Alghashian said it would “be a step on the way, part of the process, not the end of the process”.
A Western diplomat based in the Gulf summed up the dynamic: “Trump wants normalisation and Saudi wants a full defence pact, but the circumstances don’t allow. In the end, both sides will likely get less than they want. That’s diplomacy.”
Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he expects an executive order that would call for the US and the Saudis “to immediately consult on what to do in response to the threat” while not committing Washington to actively come to the defence of Riyadh.
“That could run the gamut of providing a range of different assistance, replacing arms, deploying defensive missile batteries like THAAD or Patriot, deploying naval forces with a Marine unit to actively taking part in the combat in an offensive, not only defensive manner,” he said.
Deals key amid regional rivalry
Riyadh has also been pressing for deals in nuclear energy and artificial intelligence under its ambitious Vision 2030 plan to diversify its economy and strengthen its position relative to regional rivals.
Securing approval to acquire advanced computer chips would be critical to the kingdom’s plans to become a central node in global AI and to compete with the United Arab Emirates, which in June signed a US multibillion-dollar data centre deal that gave it access to high-end chips.
MBS also wants to strike an agreement with Washington on developing a Saudi civilian nuclear programme, part of his effort to diversify from oil.
Such a deal would unlock access to US nuclear technology and security guarantees and help Saudi Arabia level up with the UAE, which has its own programme, and Iran.
But progress on a US deal has been difficult because the Saudis did not want to agree to a US stipulation that would rule out enriching uranium or reprocessing spent fuel — both potential paths to a bomb.
Ross said he expected an announcement of an agreement on nuclear energy, or at least a statement on progress towards one.</p><small>2025-11-17 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17170942b3cc5cc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955646/fully-prepared-indian-army-chief-says-may-conflict-was-a-trailer-in-new-warning-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘Fully prepared’: Indian Army chief says May conflict was ‘a trailer’ in new warning to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Indian army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Monday issued a pointed warning to Pakistan, comparing the brief May conflict to a “trailer” rather than a full-length film.
The Indian army chief’s remarks come a week after an explosion near the Red Fort in New Delhi on November 10, leaving 12 people dead in the first such explosion in the Indian capital since 2011.
Delivering a speech at a defence conference in New Delhi, Gen Dwivedi said, “I’d like to say that the movie hasn’t even started — only a trailer was shown, and, after the trailer, it was over within 88 hours.“
“So, we’re fully prepared for the future, and if Pakistan gives us such an opportunity, we’d like to provide them with a thorough education on how a responsible nation should behave with its neighbours.“
The conflict between the two countries in May was sparked by an attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Delhi blast suspect presented in court
Indian anti-terrorism investigators presented a suspect linked to the bombing in court, one of two men accused of involvement in the suicide attack. Officials have not disclosed any details on the motives or organisational backing of the alleged attackers, both of whom they claim came from India-occupied Kashmir.
India’s National Investiagtion Agency (NIA) alleged that Amir Rashid Ali “conspired with the alleged suicide bomber, Umarun Nabi, to unleash the terror attack” last Monday.
It remains unclear whether Nabi is included in the tally.

An AFP photographer saw Ali being taken under heavy guard from a police truck to a New Delhi court to face charges. Indian media reported that the court had ordered that he be held in custody for 10 days by the NIA.
Nabi was a medical professor at a university in Haryana state, just outside the capital, while Ali had allegedly travelled to Delhi to “facilitate the purchase of the car which was eventually used as a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED)”, according to the NIA.
India has provided no further information on the alleged motives or network behind the two suspects.
Another suspect apprehended: NIA
Later on Monday, the NIA said in a statement that it “arrested another key associate of the terrorist involved in the blast” in Delhi.
According to the statement, the suspect was arrested from Srinagar in India-occupied Kashmir by an NIA team, with the agency stating that he “allegedly provided technical support for carrying out terror attacks by modifying drones and attempting to make rockets ahead of the deadly car bomb blast which killed 10 persons and left 32 persons injured”.
“The accused, a resident of Qazigund in Anantnag district of [India-occupied Kashmir], was an active co-conspirator behind the attack and had worked closely with the terrorist, Umarun Nabi, to plan the terror carnage,” the statement read.
“NIA continues to explore various angles to unravel the conspiracy behind the bombing,” it added. “Several teams of the anti-terror agency are pursuing multiple leads and are conducting searches across states to identify every person involved in the terror attack.”
The Indian government has since branded the Delhi car blast a terrorist attack, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowing not to spare anyone involved in the “conspiracy” the day after the blast. Yesterday, the NIA said the blast was a “suicide bombing”.</p><small>2025-11-17 14:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1716323097d3af5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955645/one-dead-another-injured-in-car-accident-on-karachis-super-highway' target='_blank'><strong>One dead, another injured in car accident on Karachi’s Super Highway</strong></a><br><p>One woman was killed and another was injured in a road accident on Karachi’s Super Highway on Monday, according to a statement from the Edhi Foundation.
The statement read that a 22-year-old woman was killed in the accident on the Damba Goth bridge, while the injured 37-year-old was moved to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for treatment.
Gadap City Station House Officer (SHO) Sarfraz Jatoi told Dawn that the victims were riding a scooter when a speeding car hit them.
“They sustained critical injuries and were transported to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors pronounced Sumaira Hakim, 32, as dead on arrival, while Rabia Naz Shahid Ali, 37, was admitted for treatment,” the SHO said.
He added that both victims were schoolteachers on their way to work when the incident occurred at around 9am.
The SHO further said that the suspected driver had been apprehended and his vehicle was impounded by police.
Traffic accidents are very common in Karachi.
In the early hours of Saturday, a trailer hit an unidentified pedestrian, aged 35, as he was crossing the road near Brooks Chowrangi, the police said. The victim sustained critical injuries and was rushed to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.
The driver abandoned the vehicle and fled the scene, with police impounding the vehicle. They attributed reckless and negligent driving as the main cause of the accident.
Last Thursday, a man was killed and another injured when a minibus collided with a motorcycle in the Korangi area, police and rescue services officials said. The incident angered local residents, who set the bus on fire.
Korangi Industrial Area Station House Officer Mohammed Ali Niazi told Dawn that two men were riding the motorcycle near Vita Chowrangi when the minibus hit them. They were transported to JPMC, where doctors pronounced the 40-year-old motorcyclist dead.
SHO Niazi said the bus driver fled the scene after abandoning the vehicle, which was torched by the angry mob.</p><small>2025-11-17 14:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17180710f4283e2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955652/pakistan-has-become-extremely-relevant-tarar-says-of-foreign-policy-on-global-stage-after-may-skirmish' target='_blank'><strong>‘Pakistan has become extremely relevant,’ Tarar says of foreign policy on global stage after May skirmish</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Monday said that Pakistan had become “extremely relevant” on the global stage after its performance during the military conflict against India in May.
The conflict between the two countries in May this year was sparked by an attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Both governments launched diplomatic blitzes after the conflict to take their stance on the ordeal to other countries.
Elaborating on Pakistan’s image and standing in the world in the conflict’s aftermath while speaking at a function, the information minister said, “In a very short span of time, we have become extremely relevant in our foreign policy. We have seen in the past two years, and especially after the May war, I think that has redefined who we are.”
He said the “turning point” after the Pahalgam incident was Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s open offer for an impartial and fair investigation because “we were often blamed for terror acts that were not our fault, and in fact, being the biggest victims of terrorism, there was a propaganda against Pakistan, blaming us for terrorism.”
The information minister said that “you can’t be a victim and an aggressor at the same time — it’s an oxymoron, an inherent contradiction, it’s just not possible.”
 


He said no other country could lay claim to the loss of 90,000 lives in the war against terrorism or billions in economic losses. “We are also a shield and a wall between the terrorists and the rest of the world,” Tarar added, saying that the sacrifice of any Pakistani was also for the sake of making the world a better place.
The minister said the above sacrifices could not go in vain.
“So, I think the time was right that the world heard our story and heard it right. By authoring this investigation just before the war, I think we had a point to prove that our hands were clean, and that point was well taken.
“That turning point strengthened our fence, our alliances and countries that were on the fence; it made them realise what Pakistan stands for, and by authoring this investigation, Pakistan made a good diplomatic move which was well received the world over. I think after that, there was immense diplomatic engagement … and that constant engagement really helped us prove our point to the world.
“So when I say the world was changing, Pakistan also changed; we saw an aggressive diplomatic change. Our diplomacy worked very well because we were taking it and relations with all countries very seriously. There was no laxity, and there was no room for any complacency, and we were right on the job,” the information minister said.
He added that Pakistan did all it could on international media outlets. “We had the strength of the truth, so when we told the story and told it right, the world heard it, and it had an impact. So the right kind of aggressive diplomacy with the right kind of marketing campaign with the right kind of information to counter misinformation and disinformation — so we were everywhere all across,” he further said.
National synergy and Gen Z
Tarar also said he appreciated the “synergy” with the military’s spokesperson in putting out information, saying it would not have been possible otherwise.
“So we were winning on the narrative front and the diplomatic front. When it actually came down to the brass tacks, we had already shot down seven planes and when we were confronted with brute force, we gave them a bloody noise and that befitting response proved our military might so … when it came down to the actual war, Pakistan passed with flying colours and, you know, within hours, actually within four hours, India was compelled to request for a ceasefire.
“So, when I say Pakistan is changing, Pakistan actually changed. And I must acknowledge the kind of unity that we displayed as a nation. The resilience of our people, the people of Pakistan, came together, forgot our differences. I remember speaking on the floor of the house and saying that, you know, today, there is no critical point scoring, we are all on the same page, and we will fight the enemy together as a unified force, and that’s exactly what we did.”
The information minister, in particular, singled out Gen Z and the use of social media and memes during the conflict.
“When I say Pakistan has changed, you know, when it came down to the meme war and the enemy was stunned that our youngsters on social media had actually come up with memes in a very serious situation. And the enemy was wondering what is going on. War is a very serious matter, and they were making memes and they were ridiculing the enemy in their own particular way.
“So, even our Gen Z, our younger generation, they played a role with regard to social media. And they took it upon themselves to fight for Pakistan on that platform, on that battlefield, because I often say that, you know, the digital world is divided into two kinds of people. You have digital natives and digital immigrants.
“And sometimes the immigrants, you know, they take time to comprehend the ground realities of digital media. But people who are born into the digital age and they are digital natives, they understand that world much better than most of us do. So, I think the digital natives had their own war strategy and had their own way of winning that war.”
Relevancy in global events
Returning to his main point about Pakistan’s increased global relevance after the conflict, the minister pointed to the country’s involvement in the Gaza peace process.
 
 

“If you see the way forward, Pakistan has become extremely relevant. When it comes to the situation in Gaza, when it comes to the ceasefire, we are included in the list of Arab Islamic countries that brokered that peace and were part of the negotiations which led to an eventual ceasefire.
“And I think that’s a big win for Pakistan where the countries of the world have taken us extremely seriously and believe that the things that we have to say, the advice that we have to give is extremely relevant and very very important. And you have seen that we have had a lot of visits this year and people often talk about foreign visits and the dignitaries coming to Pakistan.”
Referring to diplomatic engagements in the past year, he said they had been at their “peak”, saying that Pakistan hosted a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit.
“After 14 years, we had 12 prime ministers coming to Pakistan, coming to Islamabad and talking about strategic ties, talking about regional cooperation, talking about counter-terrorism, talking about regional connectivity.
“So, we had all these things going on in succession. And even now, the way the world has engaged Pakistan, we are going to host the SCO Heads of State Summit in 2027, which is going to be a big event. And with regard to improvement of ties with other partners in the region, we saw the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement taking place with Saudi Arabia, which was, I think, one of the best things to happen to Pakistan in recent history.”
Elaborating on the Saudi defence deal, he said people had taken great pride in that agreement and the people of the kingdom also celebrated the union.
Tarar also mentioned the launching of the Economic Cooperation Framework, saying it had “really cemented” ties with Saudi Arabia.
Acknowledgement of economic stability
He said Pakistan’s economic turnaround was also acknowledged by the world.
“I think that is something phenomenal because our ratings have improved, our macroeconomic indicators have improved. There is stability which the world has acknowledged. The financial institutions, the world over, are praising Pakistan’s performance in terms of the economic turnaround. So, you know, right from default to development and as I said before, from isolation to relevance.
“So, these two slogans really mean a lot when it comes to the government’s performance. That we have taken the economy from default towards development and we have taken our foreign relations from isolation to relevance. And that is how I will define this journey.
“And I think the future is very bright.”
Situation with Afghanistan and ‘playing cards’ right
The information minister also touched on the tense relations with Afghanistan after recent skirmishes and the breakdown of talks in Istanbul, saying that “there is a situation with Afghanistan where we now believe that we have an additional forum where we can present evidence of their involvement in acts of terrorism. And we have been constantly saying that we have irrefutable evidence that their land is used for acts of terrorism.
“And whenever an incident takes place and when you backtrack and go into the investigations, you will find somewhere or the other an Afghan citizen involved somewhere. So, this is something which we are dealing with and we have given a very loud and clear message in that regard.
“So, I think Pakistan’s situation right now in terms of its economy, foreign direct investment, strategic ties, including trade and commerce in the region, outside the region, it’s been very, very optimistic, and we have had great results so far.”
Tarar also pointed to growing ties with Malaysia in terms of trade and investment.
“So, I think overall in these changing circumstances, Pakistan has played its cards right, and as you saw right after the attack on Doha, the Pakistan delegation was one of the first delegations to reach Doha and express our solidarity with the Qatari leadership.
“So, I think Pakistan has not only played its cards right, but Pakistan has formulated a policy where we have had a lot of successes diplomatically. And this could not have been possible without the civil and military leadership being on the same page and without that cohesion and that ideal working relationship that exists between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“So, I think it’s also a result, a fruit of that cohesion and synergy that exists between institutions and it’s the stability at home which has enabled us to advocate our case very, very effectively abroad and we see that a lot of other countries are desirous of improving their relations with Pakistan.”
US and China
 
 

The information minister touched upon the burgeoning relations between Pakistan and the United States as well, with President Donald Trump’s frequent praise of PM Shehbaz and the army chief.
“I think the way President Donald Trump has more than once praised Pakistan and praised the prime minister and the field marshal and mentioned those seven planes time and time again. So, you know, that’s a point to ponder upon. And we have had a great visit to the US.
“Relations have improved immensely. And the recent visit to China. So, I think Pakistan’s relationship with each country has a unique nature.
So, one relationship cannot be at the cost of another relationship. And I think that’s where the success of our foreign policy lies. And that’s how we plan to go into the future with a very, very robust, with a very effective and practical foreign policy which will not only give respect to Pakistan but which will also help us to take our economy to new heights so the life of an average Pakistani can also improve.“</p><small>2025-11-17 14:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1719073829b89fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955647/pm-inaugurates-upgraded-shalimar-express-and-facilities-at-karachis-cantt-station' target='_blank'><strong>PM inaugurates upgraded Shalimar Express and facilities at Karachi’s Cantt Station</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Monday that the digitisation of Pakistan Railways and the provision of modern facilities would play a key role in strengthening the national economy.
He added that the federal government, in collaboration with the Sindh government, would modernise the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) and upgrade all railway stations across the province and the country.
The premier expressed these views while addressing the inauguration ceremony of the new Shalimar Express and the newly upgraded waiting areas and lounges at Karachi Cantt Railway Station during his visit to Karachi.
The prime minister visited the upgraded waiting area, CIP lounge, dining hall and computerised ticketing system, accompanied by federal ministers, senior railway officials and the railways police chief.
 






The ceremony was also attended by foreign diplomats and Parliament members, senior officers from the federal as well as provincial governments. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.
PM Shehbaz said that soon after assuming office, Abbasi had worked diligently to modernise the railway system and after revamping Lahore Railway Station, Karachi Cantt Station was now also upgraded with contemporary facilities.
 


He added that all railway stations in the province would be modernised with support from the Sindh government to ensure better travel facilities for the passengers.
PM Shehbaz said the Shalimar Express running between Karachi and Lahore has been converted into a new, upgraded train. He described Karachi as not only the economic hub but also “the heart of Pakistan”.
 






He reiterated that cooperation with the provincial governments of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan would continue to ensure modernisation across the railway network and help stabilise the economy.
 
 

The premier praised Abbasi’s leadership, calling him the “hero of today’s ceremony” and congratulating him for transforming the outdated railway system. He said the federal government would work with all provinces to extend the railway network to Central Asia, specifically highlighting the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan railway line project. He also emphasised reviving the Islamabad–Istanbul rail route.
He noted that Abbasi had initiated discussions with the Asian Development Bank for a $2 billion loan to further upgrade Pakistan Railways. Responding to CM Shah’s request to include the KCR project in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project, the prime minister assured him of his full cooperation on the matter, calling it a vital initiative.
PM Shehbaz said that 154 railway stations had already been modernised, adding that he would recommend a presidential award for Abbasi once all stations, big or small, were upgraded.
Earlier, Abbasi said significant improvements were achieved in just eight months, including the modernisation of Karachi Cantt Station and the renewal of the Shalimar Express under PM Shehbaz’s guidance.
He added that Rs1bn was being spent on upgrading Rohri Station, while work was also underway at Karachi City Station. Abbasi said that 14 trains were being outsourced under government policy and railway hospitals and schools were also being given to private administration, while ensuring full protection for railway employees.
“Work on the ML-1 project is also progressing,” he added.
CM Shah earlier welcomed the prime minister to Karachi and reaffirmed full cooperation from the provincial government.

Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar announced PPP’s Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore as the new AJK premier.
Rathore is the 16th prime minister elected in AJK since 1975, when the parliamentary form of government was introduced in the region.
Rathore is currently the PPP AJK chapter’s general secretary and is considered a trusted confidant of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
A senior figure in PPP’s AJK chapter, Rathore has long been associated with the region’s politics.
Born on April 11, 1978, in Rawalpindi, he is the son of the late Raja Mumtaz Hussain Rathore, a former AJK prime minister who also served as senior minister, leader of the opposition and speaker of the Legislative Assembly at various stages of his political career.
His mother, Begum Farhat Rathore, belonged to a migrant family from Indian-occupied Kashmir; she was a member of the state legislature and headed the PPP Women’s Wing.
The Rathore family, based in AJK’s remote Haveli district, is regarded among the founding political families of the PPP in Azad Kashmir.
Rathore completed his early education in Rawalpindi and graduated from the University of the Punjab. After the death of his father, his elder brother Masood Mumtaz Rathore was elected to the AJK Legislative Assembly in 1999 for the remainder of the term.
He first entered electoral politics in 2006 from LA-17 Haveli Kahuta. He won his first assembly seat in the 2011 general elections on a PPP ticket and later served in the cabinet of then-prime minister Chaudhry Abdul Majeed as minister for AJK Logging and Sawmills Corporation and minister for electricity.
In 2016, he was arrested in what was widely viewed as a politically motivated case but was subsequently exonerated.
The politician was appointed secretary general of the PPP AJK chapter on March 23, 2017, a position he continues to hold.
In the 2021 elections, he returned to the assembly and remained an active voice on the opposition benches.
In 2023, Rathore joined the coalition government led by Haq as minister for Local Government and Rural Development and was also tasked with heading the government’s negotiation committee with the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee.
Known for his soft-spoken, conciliatory and non-controversial disposition, he is seen as a figure who maintains working relationships across political and administrative circles. He has also worked in national media, hosting a regular programme on a private TV channel.
Within the PPP, he is considered a trusted confidant of Faryal Talpur and is viewed as a representative of the party’s ideological and middle-class cadre.</p><small>2025-11-17 13:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634065-hyderabad-firecracker-factory-blast-death-toll-climbs-to-10' target='_blank'><strong>Hyderabad firecracker factory blast death toll climbs to 10</strong></a><br><p>

“The tragic bus accident involving Indian pilgrims in Saudi Arabia is deeply distressing,” VC Sajjanar, police commissioner for the city of Hyderabad, where many of the Indian citizens were reported to have come from, told reporters.
“According to preliminary information, 46 people were travelling in the bus at the time of the incident, and heartbreakingly, only one person survived,” he said.
Saudi officials have not provided a toll for the crash.
Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences in a post on social media, saying the Indian embassy was working with Saudi officials on the ground.
“Deeply saddened by the accident in Medina involving Indian nationals. My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones,” the prime minister wrote on X.
 






“I pray for the swift recovery of all those injured. Our Embassy in Riyadh and consulate in Jeddah are providing all possible assistance,” he added.
Road crashes were one of the greatest causes of injuries and fatalities in Saudi Arabia, according to a 2023 UN statement, which also said the kingdom had retained a high road fatality rate compared to other high-income countries.
Transporting worshippers around Saudi Arabia’s holy sites has frequently proven dangerous, particularly during the Haj, when roads can be chaotic with buses creating interminable traffic jams.
Millions also visit Saudi Arabia for the Umrah pilgrimage, which happens outside of the Haj period.
In March 2023, a bus ferrying pilgrims to the holy city of Mecca burst into flames after a collision on a bridge, killing 20 people and injuring more than two dozen others.
And in October 2019, some 35 foreigners were killed and four others injured when a bus collided with another heavy vehicle near Madina.
Pilgrimages are an essential component of Saudi Arabia’s burgeoning tourism sector that officials hope will help diversify the kingdom’s economy away from fossil fuels.
The Gulf kingdom is also home to more than two million Indian nationals who have long played a pivotal role in its labour market, helping construct many of the country’s mega-projects while sending billions of dollars in remittances back home each year.
Saudi Arabia and India have fostered a close relationship for decades.
India’s rapidly developing economy relies heavily on petroleum imports, with Saudi Arabia ranked as its third-largest supplier, according to the Indian foreign ministry.</p><small>2025-11-17 12:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/171129287448de1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955611/rising-stars-asia-cup-shaheen-hails-pakistans-victory-against-neighbours-after-sri-lanka-series-sweep' target='_blank'><strong>Rising Stars Asia Cup: Shaheen hails Pakistan’s victory against ‘neighbours’ after Sri Lanka series sweep</strong></a><br><p>A smile lit up Shaheen Shah Afridi’s face as he mentioned Pakistan’s victory against India at the Rising Stars Asia Cup.
Addressing the post-match ceremony after his side completed a series sweep against Sri Lanka on Sunday, Pakistan’s One-day International captain hailed a good day for cricket in the country.
“We’ve now won two consecutive [ODI] series,” said Shaheen, referring to the team’s victory against South Africa a week earlier, after Pakistan eased to a six-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the third and final ODI in Rawalpindi.
“Today Pakistan Shaheen also won, and more importantly they against our neighbours … it makes you happy that all the youngsters performed,” he added when asked to comment on Pakistan Shaheens’ eight-wicket thrashing of India ‘A’ in Qatar.
“Here [in Pindi] as well, everyone chipped in across the three matches, everyone played their best cricket which is why we won.”
Pakistan’s bowlers set up the victory for the hosts after they shot down Sri Lanka for 211 before Mohammad Rizwan struck a second half-century on the trot settled the chase.
“[Having in-form] senior players at the crease gives an altogether different outlook,” Shaheen said. “Rizwan and Babar [Azam] have always been the backbone of the team and have always performed. Rizwan finished both matches, living up to his role as a senior player.”
The second ODI had seen Babar end an 83-inning century drought across all formats and Shaheen was happy that the batting mainstay was back among the runs.
“It wasn’t the first time he’s made a hundred,” said Shaheen. “But it’s important for Pakistan cricket when your main batter gets big runs. He was working on it throughout, he’s been fighting, he kept his focus and reaped the rewards.”
Shaheen said Pakistan will look to keep up the momentum as they head into the tri-nation T20 series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe that starts from Tuesday.
“We will give our best,” Shaheen said. “The team is performing well and all the players are doing well, which is good for Pakistan cricket. As a team we’re ready for the challenge.”
More than a series win
Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson, meanwhile, believed the national ODI outfit was nicely growing into a strong unit.
In a post on social media platform X on Monday, Hesson pointed out a number of positives from the series sweep of Sri Lanka, suggesting the future was bright as Pakistan prepare for the 2027 World Cup.
“A 3-0 win against a dangerous Sri Lankan side is a proud achievement for the whole team!,” the New Zealander wrote. “But it was a series filled with so many more highlights and achievements than just the wins.
“Stand out performances from our youngest squad members, a bowling group that fought back in every match, two centuries from key players, a new captain quickly growing into the role, a corner stone player achieving 100 caps for Pakistan and the whole squad contributed throughout the series which continues to grows our depth for future series.
“These are only some of the achievements that add up to wins and what drives me in my coaching.”</p><small>2025-11-17 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634054-govt-refutes-zalmay-khalilzads-claim-of-daesh-ks-presence-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>Govt refutes Zalmay Khalilzad's claim of Daesh-K's presence in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>

Thrust into prominence with the assassination of her father, independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and much of her family in a military coup, Hasina early on fought for democracy, but her long reign as prime minister became marked by arrests of opposition leaders, crackdowns on free speech and suppression of dissent.
She was found guilty of ordering lethal force by a tribunal in the capital Dhaka 15 months after resigning and fleeing to India in the face of a student-led uprising that killed hundreds or more.

Joined rival to seek democracy before feud
Despite criticism of her years in power, Hasina, 78, was credited with turning around the economy and the massive garments industry of the Muslim-majority nation of 170 million, while winning international praise for sheltering Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.
But her downfall — she was ousted less than seven months after winning a fifth term as leader — was the protests that began over job quotas and swelled into a movement demanding her removal.
Hasina, from her exile in India, has denied the allegations against her, saying the verdict was “biased and politically motivated”.
“I am not afraid to face my accusers in a proper tribunal where evidence can be weighed and tested fairly,” Hasina said in a statement after the verdict.
Her state-appointed defence counsel told the court the charges were baseless.
A UN report in February said up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests, most from gunfire by security forces, and cited evidence that it was official policy to attack and violently repress anti-government protesters and sympathisers.
The verdict by the International Crimes Tribunal — a court Hasina set up to try war crimes from Bangladesh’s 1971 war for independence from Pakistan — marks a dramatic turn for a political career that began when she avoided death during the 1975 coup because she happened to be in Europe.
Born in 1947 in the southwest of the country, which was then East Pakistan, Hasina was the eldest of five children.
After getting a degree in Bengali literature from Dhaka University in 1973, she gained political experience as a go-between for her father and his student followers.
Exiled to India after the coup, she returned in 1981 and was elected head of the Awami League, Bangladesh’s oldest political party and a force in the struggle for independence.
Hasina joined political foe Khaleda Zia, chief of the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990.
But the alliance did not last. The bitter rivalry between the two — called the “battling begums”, using an Urdu honorific for prominent women — went on to dominate Bangladeshi politics for decades.
Hasina first led the Awami League to victory in 1996, serving a five-year term, then regained power in 2009, never to lose it again.

Claims of abuses, downfall, exile
As time went on, critics said, she became increasingly autocratic and her rule was marked by mass arrests of political opponents and activists, forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.
Rights groups warned of a virtual one-party rule by the Awami League. Hasina defended her tenure as a period of stability and development, arguing that strong, uninterrupted leadership was needed to keep Bangladesh on track.
Khaleda — herself a former prime minister and the widow of an assassinated former president — was jailed in 2018 on graft charges that her party said had been trumped up. She was freed after Hasina’s ouster.
Hasina and Khaleda accused each other of trying to create chaos and violence to jeopardise a democracy that had yet to take firm root in Bangladesh.
The once-racing economy has slowed sharply since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine pushed up prices of imported fuel and food, forcing Bangladesh to turn last year to the International Monetary Fund for a $4.7 billion bailout.
After Hasina fled the uprising in August last year with her sister on a military helicopter, jubilant crowds stormed unopposed into the opulent presidential residence, carrying out looted furniture and televisions.
Since then, Bangladesh has been governed by an interim administration headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus — a figure Hasina had attacked for years, who was convicted of graft under her government.
Her Awami League is barred from contesting parliamentary elections to be held in early February.

On Sunday night, Khalilzad said on social media platform X, “Good news from #Pakistan: Reportedly a senior ISIS-K commander Burhan, also known as Zaid, was killed in Patak part of Akhtarabad city in Punjab.”
 






In response to the post, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s official fact-checking account said the incident in question took place in Habibabad in Kasur district on March 5 and not in Akhtarabad as claimed.
 






“The victim, Burhan, was killed by a dacoity/robbery-related incident or a case of personal enmity, not a counter-terror operation,” the ministry said, adding that a first information report (FIR) of the incident was also registered on March 6 at the Saddar Pattoki police station.
It said that Burhan was living with his father-in-law, Shah Muhammad, near a fruit market in Habibabad.
“There is no presence of ISIS/Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) elements in Punjab, Pakistan, according to credible security assessments,” the ministry said.
“There is no evidence linking Burhan to ISKP nor was he a commander,” the ministry said, adding that Khalilzad’s post twisted a “purely criminal or personal dispute into a terrorism-linked killing, creating a false impression of ISKP activity in Punjab”.
“The case remains a criminal matter, not related to militancy or organised terror groups,” it added.</p><small>2025-11-17 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17112307a4423e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955615/2-more-judges-of-federal-constitutional-court-sworn-in' target='_blank'><strong>2 more judges of Federal Constitutional Court sworn in</strong></a><br><p>Two more judges of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) were sworn in on Monday.
FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan administered the oath to Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Arshad Hussain Shah at a ceremony held in Islamabad. In their oath, both judges vowed to uphold the Constitution.
“I do solemnly swear, I will bear true faith and allegiance to Pakistan, that as a judge of the FCC of Pakistan, I will discharge my duties and perform my functions honestly to the best of my abilities and faithfully in accordance with the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the law,” the judges said in their oath.

Other members of the FCC,  Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamer Farooq, Ali Baqar Najafi and KK Agha, were sworn in over the weekend.
A source had previously told Dawn that Justice Shah was appointed after it emerged that Supreme Court’s Justice Musarrat Hilali was not willing to join the FCC.
President Asif Ali Zardari had appointed Justice Aminuddin as the chief justice of the FCC last week, after giving his assent to the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The initial strength of the FCC was determined through a presidential order, while any fu­­ture increase in the number of judges will require parliamentary approval through an act of Parliament.
According to government officials, the FCC’s creation aims to reduce the SC’s workload, ensure timely adjudication of constitutional cases and strengthen judicial independence and credibility.
The FCC formally commenced on Friday after its chief justice and four judges took the oath. The newly formed apex constitutional forum begun work under makeshift arrangements, as its permanent premises have yet to be finalised.
The oath-taking was overshadowed by a boycott from five senior judges Islamabad High Court, as questions were raised over what principle, if any, guided appointments to the FCC.
Critics pointed out that if seniority was the yardstick, none of the appointees — except Justice Aminuddin — were senior to members of the now-defunct Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court, several of whom were ignored.
Plea against FCC filed in SHC
Meanwhile, a petition against the formation of the FCC was filed in the Sindh High Court by Barrister Ali Tahir. The Federation of Pakistan through the Ministry of Law and Justice was named as a respondent in the plea.
“All judges (so called) of the FCC (under challenge as unconstitutional in this instant petition)”, including FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, were also named as respondents.
“The petitioner seeks to challenge attempts to do away with the constitutional jurisdiction of the superior judiciary” through the 27th Amendment, the petition said.
It said that the FCC, “if permitted to proceed, would fundamentally alter the constitutional framework, destroy the independence of the judiciary, violate the doctrine of separation of powers, and extinguish the citizens’ right of access to justice and judicial review guaranteed by the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973”.
“It is obvious that the executive wanted to build a tailor-made court for himself,” the petition said.
The petitioner requested that the 27th Amendment be struck down and set aside in its entirety, and direct that no part, provision, rule or notification made under the amendment shall have no legal effect.
The petitioner also urged the court to issue a writ of quo warranto against the respondents, and demanded that the impugned provisions of the amendment relating to the creation of the FCC or any appointments or tenures that curtailed “ordinary judicial assignment and independence” be declared unconstitutional and void.
The petitioner directed that the plea be placed for hearing before a regular full bench of the SHC constituted of judges that were not appointed or otherwise beneficiaries of the 27th Amendment, and that no bench or tribunal created under this amendment should decide on its constitutionality.</p><small>2025-11-17 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17112339e7c14c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955613/info-minister-takes-notice-of-fake-video-of-journalist-benazir-shah-terms-it-highly-condemnable' target='_blank'><strong>Info minister takes notice of ‘fake’ video of journalist Benazir Shah, terms it ‘highly condemnable’</strong></a><br><p>Information Attaullah Tarar took notice after journalist Benazir Shah said that an account he followed on the social media platform X had made an AI-generated video of her. He asserted that nobody had the right to make “fake videos” or try to harass journalists by defaming them.
Shah posted on Sunday on X that an account on the social media platform followed by Tarar had “made an AI video of me”.
“But as we’ve said before, we’ll say it again: #AttacksWontSilenceUS,” she added. Her post was in response to the video in question, shared by an account called PakVocals. The description with the clip claimed that it was a “leaked video” of Shah “dancing in a club in London”.
Subsequently, Tarar responded to Shah on Sunday night, saying, “Totally unacceptable and highly condemnable. Notice taken, please.
“Nobody has the right to make fake videos and then disseminate them or try to harass any journalist by defaming them. I follow more than 1,900 accounts. I do not condone the behaviour of this account and also assure you that action will be taken,” the minister said.
 






Later, Shah said she appreciated the minister taking the matter seriously. However, she said that she did not want to pursue a case under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) through the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) as “doing so would lend legitimacy to a law and an institution that have been used to harass journalists, silence private citizens, and suppress dissent”.
“If the minister and his government are serious about ensuring safety for journalists and citizens, they should scrap Peca and the NCCIA and begin a genuine consultation process to draft legislation that truly addresses journalists’ concerns,” she said.
 






Journalists also rallied behind Shah as the matter garnered attention on social media.
“Deep fake, condemnable, culpable crime, should be investigated and the one who doctored the video must be brought to the court of law. My sincere support to fellow brilliant journalist Benazir Shah who always stands by facts, neutrality and truth. More power to you. Stand firm, please,” posted journalist Zahid Gishkori on X.
Journalist Asad Ali Toor said he was sure that the person in the video was not Shah. He said he was also certain that the account that shared the video was a “pro PML-N account followed by pro PML-N journalists and the minister”.
“This is [a] shameful and disgusting campaign, and I strongly condemn it. At the same time, I want to say all political parties have their own pool of dirt which they time to time launch against their critics. Shameful,” he commented.
Journalist Meher Bokhari, referring to the video in question and the accosting of Geo News anchor Shahzeb Khanzada in a separate incident, called for more respect.
“This is not who we were meant to become. Whether it’s PTI supporters harassing Shazeb Khanzada or or PML-N supporters circulating fake AI videos of Benazir Shah, none of it reflects who we are.
“Both are hardworking journalists, people who have dedicated their lives to informing the public despite constant pressure. Sure, nothing makes sense here anymore, but the least we can do is hold on to our values and our respect for one another. Character is what you choose to keep intact when everything around you falls apart,” she said.

Kamal made the remarks while addressing a press conference in Karachi, less than a week after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was enacted into law amid protests by the opposition and other quarters.
When the 27th Amendment was tabled in the National Assembly on Nov 11, Kamal had referred to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which relates to local governments, and said his party’s proposed amendments “are not dead yet” and would be discussed as part of the 28th Amendment.
Speaking to the media today, he said that changes were initially pitched to be included in the 26th Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year.
Kamal then thanked other parties, including the ruling PML-N, and “individual friends from the PPP” and “many friends from the PTI” for “vocally backing” the MQM-P’s changes related to local governments.
He said the proposed changes were extensively discussed for over six hours in the parliamentary standing committee meeting called to deliberate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
“We had enough numbers […] We had won our case in the standing committee. We had the numbers. We had the support of the PML-N and others,” he maintained. “But the PPP was not ready to support the [inclusion of] our bill [on local governments] in the 27th Amendment, which resulted in a deadlock,” he added, clarifying that he was not making any allegations in saying so.
Kamal said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the ruling PML-N then requested the MQM-P to postpone its proposed changes once again as the 27th Amendment included crucial provisions pertaining to the Pakistan Army and the judiciary.
“We were assured that they all supported the bill. They asked for one more chance, assuring that this would be included in the next amendment,” he added.
Subsequently, the MQM-P decided to accept the request in the “larger interest of the country,” he said.
Stressing the importance of changes pertaining to local government, Kamal further stated: “In Pakistan, […] in the coming months, this constitutional amendment will be introduced in the assembly and get approved, and the people will get resources at their doorstep.”
Kamal also referred to the Punjab As­­sembly unanimously passing a resolution last month, calling for an amendment to Article 140-A of the Constitution to ensu­­re empowerment and protection of local bodies, along with mandatory and timely elections for effective governance. He deemed the development a success of the MQM-P.
Kamal’s remarks come a day after Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said the ruling coalition could introduce another constitutional amendment if the need was felt to “maintain stability” in the country.</p><small>2025-11-17 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634009-dpm-dar-to-lead-pakistani-delegation-at-sco-summit-in-moscow-from-nov-17-18' target='_blank'><strong>DPM Dar lands in Moscow to attend SCO summit from Nov 17-18</strong></a><br><p>

The video, which has been circulating on social media since Sunday night, shows a man following Khanzada in what appeared to be a clothing store. In the video, the man told the journalist he should be “ashamed” of “what he has done against Imran” and his wife. For his part, Khanzada — who appeared to be present with his family — did not engage with the man and walked away.
 
 

While the man did not provide an explanation for the allegations he was levelling against the journalist, PTI’s Shahbaz Gill shared an old clip of Khanzada talking about the Iddat case, filed against Bushra Bibi and Imran by her former husband Khawar Maneka, on his show. The case pertains to Imran and Bushra Bibi’s marriage during the latter’s Iddat period.
“This is the filth Shahzeb did,” he said. He added that if the condemnation had come from the media fraternity, then the situation would not have reached this point, an apparent reference to the harassment of the journalist.
 






The incident comes two days after The Economist published an article covering Imran’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as premier, which the party has termed recycled propaganda masquerading as foreign commentary.
Many on social media came to Khanzada’s defence, terming the incident “condemnable”.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the incident was “yet another filthy reminder of the mob mentality Imran Khan has carefully bred within PTI”.
“This crowd does not [have] manners, they were never taught dignity, decency or basic humanity. Their entire existence feeds on confrontation, chaos, and bullying. This is not politics, it is brute thuggery masquerading as activism. They know that they can only survive when society is torn down,” said the minister.
 






PPP leader and Sindh Minister for Local Government Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said he strongly condemned the incident.
“You can certainly disagree, but do so within the bounds of decency and respect. Your actions have not affected Shahzeb Khanzada’s honour, but rather [of] those who taught you this behaviour,” he said.
 






Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Senator Faisal Subzwari said the incident was “another glimpse into the filth that had taken root in politics over the past decade”.
“When national leaders praise the abuse brigade and give bad names to everyone except their own kind, then these lamentable traditions take root,” he said.
 






Journalist Waseem Abbasi called the incident harassment, adding that this was “no crusade”.
 






“This is disgusting and utterly condemnable,” said Ziauddin Yousafzai, the father of Nobel Laureate Malala Yousufzai.
“Khanzada is an honourable man and an outstanding journalist. This incident exposes the ugly face and behaviour of an intolerant cult,” he said.
 






Journalist Asad Ali Toor termed the incident a “shameful campaign” against Khanzada.
“I still maintain that Shahzeb in that interview completely exposed Khawar Maneka that his ‘Iddat’ case is a politically motivated case and he is just a disgusting proxy,” he said, adding that the PTI should be thanking him, rather than harassing him.
 






Journalist Matiullah Jan said that Imran’s supporters should learn that harassing a journalist in this manner in the presence of his family members was condemnable.
“There are a hundred civilised ways of protesting. Shahzeb Khanzada has left the government and its ministers speechless on many occasions,” he said.
 






Journalist Zahid Gishkori, who has previously worked with Khanzada, said it was “extremely painful to see a strange man” harassing the latter and his family, adding that he stood with the journalist during this difficult time.
 






“This is unacceptable and outright shameful. Harassing someone in a public place is not freedom of expression, it’s intimidation and thuggery,” said sports journalist Faizan Lakhani.
“Shahzeb Khanzada is a respected, credible journalist, and this behaviour towards him is shameful. This incident exposes the true face of an intolerant society,” he said.
 






“I strongly condemn the worst kind of fascism and the targeted harassment being inflicted on Shahzeb Khanzada by zombies of a political party,” said journalist Asma Shirazi.
 






The Pakistan Daily founder Hamza Azhar Salam said the PTI had not taken Khanzada to court for defamation because “it knows they will be taken to the cleaners”.
“Instead, PTI workers unleashed to harass Pakistan’s most credible journalist in front of his family. We stand by Khanzada and condemn this campaign of harassment,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, Khanzada responded to PTI leader Gill on X, accusing him of lying.
“This is classic Shahbaz Gill. When he was a minister, he was caught lying several times and here again he is lying,” he said, adding that he was responsible for reporting court proceedings.
“These trolls actually don’t care about facts even if they go in favour of Imran Khan,” he said.
 






“We didn’t just expose the Iddat case but also spoke for Shahbaz Gill, condemned his torture under custody and the use of the outdated treason law against him even when his own party and leaders were refusing to speak for him,” he said.
 






The PTI founder and his wife — who are both currently under arrest — were convicted by an Islamabad court in the Iddat case and sentenced to seven years in jail each on Feb 3, 2024, five days before the general elections.
In July the same year, they were acquitted in the case but then arrested on charges related to the sale of state gifts.</p><small>2025-11-17 05:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633980-rathore-poised-to-become-new-ajk-pm-as-no-confidence-vote-against-haq-takes-place-today' target='_blank'><strong>Raja Faisal Rathore becomes new AJK PM as assembly ousts Chaudhry Anwarul Haq</strong></a><br><p>
