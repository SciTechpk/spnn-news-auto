Had the South Asian neighbours been more agreeably engaged than pursuing a destructive campaign against each other, the thought is too enticing to ignore that Indian and Pakistani troops would perhaps be marching in lockstep with Chinese, Russian, Uzbek, Egyptian and other comrades to pursue a new world order for equitable peace and sustainable prosperity. There are powerful antibodies stalking the possibility, however.
Mercifully, the fires have been doused in South Asia at least for now even though they were doused by the world’s most incendiary nation that ever wielded the firehose. For all their macho victory cries over claims of damage they inflicted on each other amid a display of grief and valour, India and Pakistan found themselves leaning on foreign shoulders yet again to resolve an essentially bilateral issue, illustrating not for the first time that they have not quite attained adulthood to shepherd the destiny of over a billion souls. The brokered peace, nevertheless, links the tragedy in Pahalgam with a world of power politics.
Be sanguine that the pointless flare-up wasn’t triggered by some four mysterious hate-mongers who showed up to kill innocent men in Pahalgam only to disappear without trace (as yet) in one of the world’s most militarised and policed places. That the foursome called out their victims’ religion turned into a tool to profit from with the time-tested game of identity politics. Remember that in the 2002 communal carnage in Gujarat, after a train fire tragedy in Godhra, it was Pakistan that was first named as the accused; only later mobs were unleashed on unsuspecting Muslims.
Religious politics in South Asia of the Hindu-Muslim variety was nurtured into deep fault lines by colonialism as a protection against another 1857 uprising. ‘Divide et impera’ they called it. Saadat Hasan Manto captured religious frenzy in several short stories that accompanied the violent creation of India and Pakistan. ‘Mistake’ was a story about the murder of a wrong man, the error discovered when his dead body was stripped and revealed he belonged to the killer’s community. The popular Indian leader who plies identity politics to fetch electoral windfalls was not around at the time. But he has spoken of a simpler way whereby one could identify Muslims by their attire. (And thereby also figure out the non-Muslims.) The monsters of Pahalgam missed the trick or perhaps needed an audio track for their crime.

Moscow and Beijing have found growing numbers of applicants from across the world keen to join the coalition against Western hegemony.

Step back from Pahalgam, and you might find a clearer action-reaction pattern. Pahalgam spawned a third military stand-off to involve a BRICS member. It couldn’t be a coincidence that Iran and Russia, key pillars of the coming multipolar world, are in the crosshairs of the West. Unlike the military crisis facing Iran, which has risen as a powerful symbol for the Global South, or Russia, a founding leader of BRICS, which sees itself as a pivot to a multipolar future and therefore is sought to be ‘weakened’ by the West through a grinding proxy war, the South Asian conflict disrupts BRICS more diabolically. India, a founder member of BRICS, balks at the idea of its South Asian rival joining the immensely powerful group. India is a leading member of BRICS but is increasingly perceived as its weak link. Pakistan, on the other hand, being an ardent supporter of BRICS, can become a full member only if India doesn’t obstruct the path. The Pahalgam terror attack of April 22 therefore can be explored as a trigger to sow seeds of discord in the ranks of the Global South and thereby of BRICS.
The mesmeric Victory Day celebrations at Moscow’s Red Square marked a crucial moment for BRICS, the group that terrifies Donald Trump and which Russia and China are feverishly pressing on with. Moscow and Beijing have found unexpectedly large and growing numbers of applicants from across the world keen to join the coalition against Western hegemony controlling their political and economic lives. In attendance at the Red Square to cheer the spectacular pageantry were heavyweights from the rising Global South. Xi Jinping, of course, but not to be ignored were his comrades from Cuba, Venezuela, Brazil, Egypt, Belarus, practically the entire Central Asian lot, but also notably, Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam from the Southeast Asian flank. The heads of Serbia and Slovakia, which is a Nato member, broke ranks with their Western minders to attend.
African leaders rejoiced and cheered on as Vladimir Putin put on a memorable display of music and colour that gave a new cadence to the great coming together. Stanley Kubrick’s awe-inspiring military columns in the cinematic version of Howard Fast’s Spartacus come to mind. The movie was scripted by the former head of the US communist party as an ode to the uprising of slaves against the mighty Roman Empire. The similarity with Friday’s turnout was that these soldiers, too, were celebrating the defeat of a racist regime. Not to miss the smiling face of Vladimir Lenin printed on red flags in the march past. After a long time, the communist emblem of hammer and sickle shone through the marching columns.
Missing, not unpredictably, from the celebrations was Narendra Modi. He had made up his mind to forgo the event months before the shooting war with Pakistan would happen. With the rise of Donald Trump, India has been perceived as tardy in cementing BRICS as a challenge to the West. For this alone, Modi was the winner last week, even if Pakistan claims to have fought a better war.

And while the ending came in a familiar way, with the intervention of the US, the sense in both countries is that the crisis may not necessarily be over. Of course, much depends on the talks of the DGMOs (which had yet to take place as this piece was being written) and the outcome. Indeed, even after the talks and subsequent announcements, this will be what in journalistic lingo is a ‘developing situation’ where facts and analyses remain incomplete. This piece falls in the same category. Still, here is an effort to put some issues in context.
There are signs that the ceasefire, in whatever shape, will not be easy to sustain. The lack of trust between the two sides is a reason, and along with it a sense of grievance.
The mood next door is another factor. The criticism of the Indian government over what is being seen by some as an incomplete mission is also leading to misgivings that there may be more to follow. It appears that New Delhi is finding it harder to sell this ceasefire as a success, compared to, say, Pulwama. The White House, which unlike the past, is claiming and celebrating its own role is adding to the criticism. How the BJP government deals with this will be critical in the days to come.
In Pakistan, however, the mood is celebratory and rightly so. But there is reason to be temperate, in fact many reasons, the most obvious being that a war should never be celebrated, for even victory comes at the cost of lives lost, and families left bereft. There is nothing glorious about wars.

Pakistan should be prepared for regular episodes of aggression and near-war with India.

But temperance should also be in place because of the rickety ceasefire in place. In addition to the mood across the border, the new normal that this conflict has created has led to a sobering realisation: future tensions between India and Pakistan will not simply mean clashes at the LoC but more. Strikes, drones and more are now possible, it seems. As are cyberattacks. All these, along with covert operations will simply lead to multiple challenges in India-Pakistan relations and the main victim will be ordinary people.
Pakistan should now also be prepared for regular episodes of aggression and near-war with India. The latter has followed an escalatory pattern from 2016 to the present — nine years ago, New Delhi carried out a strike against the LoC; in fact, many argued that such strikes were normal though it was unusual of India to claim one publicly rather than deny it.
Three years later, during Pulwama/ Balakot, a strike was carried out inside Pakistan rather than just across the LoC. As a result, Pakistan was compelled to respond with an airstrike. Six years later, Indian strikes have targeted city centres, civilians and military targets. This now appears to be established behaviour by India.
 
 

And while it is hard to see if there will be pressure on New Delhi to ‘improve’ upon 2025, strikes across the LoC and the border will be now seen to be kosher as a reaction to any terrorism in Indian-held Kashmir. In other words, there should be no complacency at the Pakistani end that deterrence has been established, as is being assumed. Instead, what the two countries might just have established is that this level of conflict, under the nuclear threshold, can be carried out, despite its risks.
The second factor which needs to be studied and understood, rather than simply celebrated, is Pakistan’s communication internally and internationally during this conflict. Despite some bloopers — guess which ones — Pakistan’s communication in the shape of press conferences, which could have been fewer, and interviews internationally were effective, especially as India stuck to the bare minimum. But the efficacy was directly linked to the facts — which allowed Islamabad to tell its story. India was the aggressor, Pakistan would defend itself and go no further. And then Pakistan’s air force chalked up a spectacular victory by downing Indian aircraft, which New Delhi wouldn’t even confirm; this lent further credence to Islamabad.
At the risk of offending some at home, it would help to remember Kargil; some facts are so indigestible that the best cannot spin them favourably. One can only hope that this success doesn’t encourage our side to think that it can sell everything to the world. It is essential to retain the policy of ‘restraint’, which has now started getting some bad press within.
And ‘restraint’ is also a word one can use to suggest that this ‘success’ should not allow the government to think that it’s time for the ‘hard state’ to turn harder within. After all, it appears our neighbour also acted on the assumption that Pakistan’s internal problems and divisions would prevent it from giving a ‘befitting response’, which proved incorrect. However, it is still necessary to understand that with the possibility of further clashes, it is all the more important to address some of the fault lines within. This is true of the political situation but particularly of Balochistan. It is the weakest fault line that can and is being exploited. If it has to be secured, a political solution has to be found. And along with this comes the economy, which also needs serious work.
For regardless of how 2019 and 2025 ended, the fiscal space that the government next door has will make it trigger-happy with such limited confrontation. And in order to confront this, it would be better if Pakistan also focused on making its economy stronger, more stable and less dependent on lending.
Last but not least, this confrontation has been more about Chinese weaponry versus Western, than about India and Pakistan. While the PAF’s success will strengthen Pakistan-Chinese ties, it will take time to assess what this means internationally and regionally. Only can only hope that it does not lead to the kind of scrutiny of defence cooperation, as there was of CPEC in recent years.

Such meet-ups are important for regional integration and security, and send the message that states in the region should cooperate and solve their problems themselves. Islamabad and Beijing’s envoys met the Afghan Taliban’s interior, foreign and commerce ministers, with regard to the main issues that concern all three states: security and trade. Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani called for “mutual respect and constructive engagement”, while Pakistan’s envoy Ambassador Mohammad Sadiq said “good neighbourly relations [and] regional stability” were emphasised.
 
 

While no foreign state — including Pakistan and China — has recognised the Afghan Taliban regime, many states, especially in the wider region, have maintained diplomatic engagement with Kabul’s rulers, simply because there is no other legitimate entity to talk to in Afghanistan.
As Sunday’s meetings indicated, both Pakistan and China want to carry forward their engagement with the Afghan government. During the fifth round of the Trilateral Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue, which was held in Islamabad in 2023, the need to check the activities of the banned TTP and ETIM was reiterated. Both groups, believed to be active in Afghanistan, threaten Pakistan and China’s security, respectively. Therefore, it is welcome that Islamabad and Beijing jointly conveyed their concerns to Kabul.
On their part, the Afghan Taliban want to engage with China and Pakistan to enhance trade links, and help them break out of their diplomatic isolation. These objectives — security guarantees and increased trade — are interlinked, as commercial activities can only pick up when the region is safe from terrorism.
 
 

The sixth round of the Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue is due in Kabul. To make this meeting successful, the Taliban authorities should take concrete steps to address Pakistan and China’s security concerns. If terrorist groups continue to find sanctuary in Afghanistan, regional integration and increased trade will be difficult to achieve. Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar was in Kabul last month, and there were indications that the Taliban would respond to Islamabad’s concerns. Pakistan should also address Kabul’s legitimate concerns to benefit all.
The Taliban have a clear choice to make: if they want regional integration and economic revival, they must take verifiable action against malign actors sheltering on their soil and threatening the region. Afghanistan’s integration into the greater Central Asia/ South Asia region would benefit its people through a revived economy. But that can only happen if Kabul enhances trust by putting militant groups out of business.

Autonomous and artificial intelligence-assisted weapons systems are already playing a greater role in conflicts from Ukraine to Gaza. And rising defence spending worldwide promises to provide a further boost for burgeoning AI-assisted military technology.
Progress towards establishing global rules governing their development and use, however, has not kept pace. And internationally binding standards remain virtually non-existent.
Since 2014, countries that are part of the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) have been meeting in Geneva to discuss a potential ban fully autonomous systems that operate without meaningful human control and regulate others.

Autonomous and AI-assisted weapons systems are playing a bigger role in conflicts

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has set a 2026 deadline for states to establish clear rules on AI weapon use. But human rights groups warn that consensus among governments is lacking.
Alexander Kmentt, head of arms control at Austria’s foreign ministry, said that must quickly change.
“Time is really running out to put in some guardrails so that the nightmare scenarios that some of the most noted experts are warning of don’t come to pass,” he said.
 
 

Monday’s gathering of the UN General Assembly in New York will be the body’s first meeting de­­dicated to autonomous weapons.
Though not legally binding, diplomatic officials want the consultations to ramp up pressure on military powers that are resisting regulation due to concerns the rules could dull the technology’s battlefield advantages.
Campaign groups hope the meeting, which will also address critical issues not covered by the CCW, including ethical and human rights concerns and the use of autonomous weapons by non-state actors, will push states to agree on a legal instrument.
They view it as a crucial litmus test on whether countries are able to bridge divisions ahead of the next round of CCW talks in September.
“This issue needs clarification through a legally binding treaty. The technology is moving so fast,” said Patrick Wilcken, Amnesty International’s Researcher on Military, Security and Policing.
“The idea that you wouldn’t want to rule out the delegation of life or death decisions … to a machine seems extraordinary.”
Arms race
The New York talks come after 164 states supported a 2023 UN General Assembly resolution calling for the international community to urgently address the risks posed by autonomous weapons.
While many countries back a binding global framework, the United States, Russia, China and India prefer national guidelines or existing international laws, according to Amnesty.
“We have not been convinced that existing law is insufficient,” a US Pentagon spokesperson said, adding that autonomous weapons might actually pose less risk to ci­­v­­­ilians than conventional weapons.
The governments of India, Russia, and China did not respond to requests for comment.
In the absence of regulation, autonomous systems are proliferating.
Weapons experts at the Future of Life Institute think tank have tracked the deployment of roughly 200 autonomous weapon systems across Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa.
Russian forces, for example, have deployed some 3,000 Veter kamikaze drones — capable of autonomously detecting and engaging targets — to Ukraine, according to its data.
Ukraine has, meanwhile, used semi-autonomous drones in the conflict. The Ukrainian government declined to comment.
Israel has used AI-systems to identify targets in Gaza. Its mission in Geneva said it supported multilateral discussions and uses data technologies in full accordance with international law.
Human Rights Watch, however, said crucial questions of accountability under international law remain unresolved and warned in a report last month that unregulated autonomous weapons present a range of threats to human rights and could provoke an arms race if unchecked.
And campaigners like Laura Nolan of Stop Killer Robots worry there is currently little to ensure defence firms will develop AI-driven weapons responsibly.
“We do not generally trust industries to self-regulate … There is no reason why defence or technology companies should be more worthy of trust,” she said.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report cited a significant deterioration since October. It forecast that 2.1 million people across Gaza — roughly the entire population — will likely experience high levels of acute food insecurity, with 469,500 projected at  “catastrophic” levels — the most severe stage. The previous IPC analysis in October found 133,000 people in that category.
Israel sealed off Gaza in early March when it resumed military action against Hamas after a ceasefire collapsed.
Israeli  government spokesperson David Mencer said the IPC had  “constantly talked about famine; famine has never happened because of  Israel’s efforts to get more aid in.” He blamed Hamas for causing hunger by allegedly stealing aid. Hamas denies this, accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon.

Warns half a million people face starvation

The IPC report stated that Israeli military plans and aid agencies’  “persistent inability” to deliver essential goods mean a “high risk” of famine during the May 11 to Sept 30 projection period.
“Immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, starvation and acute malnutrition, and a descent into famine,” the report urged. Famine declaration requires at least  20 per cent of people facing extreme food shortages, high child malnutrition,  and elevated death rates from starvation or related diseases.
The report projected that nearly 71,000 cases of acute malnutrition, including 14,100 severe cases, among children, aged 6 to 59 months, were expected to occur between April 2025 and March 2026.
The report “really demonstrates that the situation in Gaza has deteriorated quite dramatically in recent months,” said Beth Bechdol,  deputy director of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. She noted  the blockade since early March “has really prevented the delivery of  essential humanitarian and even commercial supplies.”
While noting that the two-month-long ceasefire had allowed for a temporary alleviation of acute food shortages and ma­­lnutrition, the IPC report said the on­­g­oing blockade had reversed the situation. The key findings showed that 1.95 mill­i­­on people, or 93pc of the population in the coastal enclave, are living through high levels of acute food insecurity, including 244,000 experiencing the most severe, or  “catastrophic”, levels.

• Educational institutions to reopen today
• AJK premier hails army’s response as president wants immediate relief for affected families
MUZAFFARABAD: Indian troops violated the ceasefire agreement late Sunday night by resorting to ‘unprovoked’ shelling across the Line of Control (LoC), resulting in the death of a young man in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), officials said on Monday.
According to Sardar Waheed Khan, Director General of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), Indian forces targeted several villages in the Nakyal sector of southern Kotli district shortly after 11pm, using both small and heavy arms during a 40-minute barrage.
In Bari Dhara Mathrani, one of the affected villages, 32-year-old Muhammad Shahid, son of Muhammad Taj, sustained critical abdominal injuries when shrapnel from a mortar shell struck him.
He was initially treated at the THQ Hospital in Nakyal and later referred to the DHQ Hospital in Kotli, where he succumbed to his wounds at around 1am.
 
 

A brief episode of shelling was also reported from the Haveli district, the SDMA chief added.
Shahid’s death raised the toll from the recent wave of cross-LoC shelling, including missile attacks in Muzaffarabad and Kotli districts, to 32. They included 12 in Kotli, six each in Bhimber and Poonch, three in Muzaffarabad, two each in Neelum and Haveli, and one in Bagh. Another 123 people were injured in the hostilities.
School, colleges reopen today
The AJK government annou­nced the reopening of all educational institutions from today (Tuesday), following a temporary closure amid the escalation.
However, a revised schedule for the postponed examination papers will be issued separately by the AJK Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) in Mirpur, Mr Khan said.
Earlier on Monday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq visited forward posts in the Barnala sector of Bhimber district to express solidarity with the armed forces for their robust response to Indian aggression and to console families affected by the shelling.
Addressing the troops, Mr Haq lauded the army’s professionalism and high morale, stating that ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ had forced the Indian forces to back down.
“The Pakistan Army has made the country’s defence invincible,” he remarked, also praising the Pakistan Air Force for showcasing its capabilities with international recognition.
He condemned India’s targeting of civilian populations and infrastructure, and applauded the resilience and bravery of the AJK people.
He said compensation had been provided to the families of martyrs and injured persons within 24 hours, and that relevant departments remained fully alert and operational round-the-clock.
The prime minister pledged to personally visit all LoC-affected areas to assess damages and ensure timely relief and rehabilitation.
During his visit, Mr Haq met with the families of those martyred in Saturday’s shelling, offering condolences and handing over compensation cheques. As his convoy passed through the area, large crowds chanted slogans in support of Pakistan, the armed forces, and the AJK leadership.
President for immediate relief to affected families
Separately, AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood strongly condemned India for deliberately targeting innocent and unarmed civilians along the LoC, calling it a blatant display of frustration.
Expressing heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and wishing a swift recovery to the injured, he directed the government and relevant authorities to urgently assess the damages and ensure immediate relief for the affected population, including uninterrupted medical care for the wounded.

His colleagues from various pro-Modi TV channels were reporting about a “regime change” in Pak­istan when not mentioning the firing of Russian-made Bra­hmos missiles into densely populated parts of Karachi.
Their audiences were beg­inning to doubt the rav­ings but had nowhere to verify the facts. Prac­tically every foreign channel or newspaper was made inaccessible in India by overt or covert means.
“Who authorised Presi­dent Trump to interv­ene?” Goswami was frothing at the mouth.
In his dream world, there couldn’t be Pakis­tani pilots outfoxing their Ind­ian counterparts, or Pakis­tan having better planes.
The political leadership has usually been defended by its TV channels. That nexus could be coming to a head.
The brunt of the attack, however, was borne not by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who would have been the obvious interlocutor with President Trump.
Mr Modi’s loyalists turned their ire on Foreign Secre­tary Vikram Misri, the man who had been carrying out the arduous task of briefing the nation on the post-Pahalgam tensions and the eventual shootouts with Pakistan.
 
 

As per reports, the official was subjected to vicious trolling for announcing on the government’s behalf the cessation of military operations.
In the face of trolls, Mr Misri’s colleagues rose in support of the beleaguered diplomat.
A post on the X account of Indian Administrative Service Association expressed solidarity with Mr Misri and his family.
“Unwarranted personal attacks on civil servants performing their duties with integrity are deeply regrettable. We reaffirm our commitment to uphold the dignity of public service,” the association of India’s bureaucrats said.
The Indian Police Service (IPS) Association also condemned the personal attacks on Mr Misri.
“Unequivocally condemn the deplorable personal attacks against Foreign Secretary Misri and his family. Such unwarranted assaults on civil servants committed to their duties are intolerable,” said the representative body of police officers.
After Mr Misri’s personal account on X was subjected to vulgar comments, most targeting his daughter, he locked his public account, according to The Hindu.
Asaduddin Owaisi, the member of parliament from Hyderabad, put the issue in context.
“Our civil servants work under the Executive. This must be remembered & they shouldn’t be blamed for the decisions taken by The Executive /or any Political leadership running Watan E Aziz (the beloved nation),” he wrote on X.
Congress leader Sachin Pilot also condemned the abuse directed at Mr Misri’s family.
“It’s unacceptable to target our professional diplomats and civil servants — those who work dedicatedly to serve the nation,” Mr Pilot said on X.
Congress deputy leader in Lok Sabha, Gaurav Gogoi, also supported Mr Misri.
“Mr Misri did his duty impeccably. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to feel malice towards him. He has only conveyed the message that the political leadership of India has taken.”
As the story shifted to self-recrimination, greater trouble loomed for India.
President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are striking fresh trade deals.
A US-China rapprochement against the backdrop of the India-Pakistan flare-up can’t be good news for New Delhi.
Away from the political volatility in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah was urging his people to return to their homes near the Line of Control that has gone silent as seldom before.

• Modi warns New Delhi will not tolerate ‘nuclear blackmail’
• Khawaja Asif says future talks to focus on Kashmir, terrorism and water
• Asserts any attempt to deprive Pakistan of its water rights will never be allowed
WASHINGTON: Amid easing tensions following a ceasefire bet­ween India and Pakistan, Presi­dent Donald Trump has claimed that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between the two nations, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a televised address to the nation asserted that New Delhi would not tolerate “nuclear blackmail” in the event of further conflict with Islamabad.
Trump’s comments, made during a press interaction at the White House, signal a rare moment of US diplomatic mediation bet­ween the two South Asian nuclear powers and suggest a broader Ameri­can strategy that ties peace to economic engagement.
“We stopped a nuclear conflict. I think it could have been a bad nuclear war. Millions of people could have been killed,” Trump said while talking to reporters.
This is perhaps one of the starkest warnings yet from the US leader, who has rarely minced words in highlighting global security threats. His remarks reflect Washing­ton’s growing concern about the fragile peace between India and Pakistan, both of whom possess significant nuclear arsenals and a long history of military confrontations.
In a tone that combined both reassurance and transactional diplomacy, Trump added that the United States is prepared to enhance trade with both countries — if they continue to engage in dialogue. “We’re going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan. We’re going to do a lot of trade with India. We’re negotiating with India right now. We’re going to be soon negotiating with Pakistan,” he said, linking the prospect of economic cooperation to continued regional stability.
 


Trump, who appeared eager to underscore his adm­inistration’s peacemaking role, said: “On Sat­u­rday, my administration helped broker an immediate ceasefire, I think a maybe permanent one bet­ween India and Pakistan — the countries having a lot of nuclear weapons.”
His assertion, while dramatic, underscores the high stakes involved in this latest confrontation and his belief that trade can be a powerful tool of diplomacy.
He also praised the leadership of both countries for their roles in defusing the situation. “I’m very proud to let you know that the leadership of India and Pakistan was unwavering and powerful, but unwavering in both cases — they really were from the standpoint of having the strength and the wisdom and fortitude to fully know and to understand the gravity of the situation,” he said.
Trump also offered a unique insight into how he leveraged economic incentives to push both sides toward de-escalation.
 
 

“We helped a lot, and we also helped with trade. I said ‘Come on, we’re going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let’s stop it, let’s stop it. If you stop it, we’re doing trade’,” he said. He then added: “If you don’t stop it, we’re not going to do any trade. People have never really used trade the way I used it. By that, I can tell you, and all of a sudden they said. I think we’re gonna stop, and they have.”
In concluding his remarks, the president emphasised once again the magnitude of what he believed had been averted. “We stopped a nuclear conflict,” he declared, before offering thanks to members of his administration. “I also want to thank VP JD Vance and Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, for their work,” he said, crediting them for helping facilitate the peace process.
While the claims made by President Trump will be scrutinised in Washington and South Asia, they do indicate a willingness on the part of the US to reassert its role as a mediator in global conflicts. Whether these efforts translate into a lasting peace between India and Pak­i­stan, however, remains to be seen.
‘Nuclear blackmail’
Indian PM Modi vowed on Monday to respond strongly to any future “terrorist attack”, and cautioned that India would not succumb to ‘nuclear blackmail’ in the face of future provocations.
A weekend ceasefire which Trump said he brokered appeared to be holding on Monday after four days of intense jet fighter, missile, drone and artillery attacks — the worst violence between the two nuclear-armed neighbours since 1999.
The conflict followed an April 22 attack on tourists in Pahalgam, in India-held Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians.
Modi, in a televised address to the nation — his first since hostilities began last Wednesday — said Pakistan has chosen to attack rather than help it fight “terrorism”. “If another terrorist attack against India is carried out, a strong response will be given.”
“India’s stand is very clear. Terror and talks cannot go together… Terror and trade cannot go together… Water and blood cannot flow together.”
Pakistan had strongly denied having any role in the attack on tourists in India-held Kashmir, and has repeatedly asked New Delhi for sharing any evidence.
Proclaiming victory in the short and bitter standoff in which foreign media reported the downing of several Indian warplanes, including the highly rated French-made Rafale jets, and Indian military claiming hitting what it called terrorist targets in Pakistan, Modi said it would be the new normal against terrorism.
India launched a missile barrage against Pakistan on May 7, but remained silent about the downing of its estimated five warplanes in response.
The Indian PM underplayed the role of foreign interlocutors in brokering the ceasefire. “And I am repeating again, we have just postponed our retaliatory action on Pakistan’s terrorist and military bases. In the coming days, we will measure every step of Pakistan on the basis of what attitude it adopts.”
Three key issues
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that any future talks with India would focus on three key issues — Kashmir, terrorism and water.
In an exclusive talk with a private news channel, he said India’s arrogance is the main reason why these matters remain unresolved. Kashmir can be resolved under UN resolutions, but India’s stubbornness is the hurdle, he added.
The minister stated that terrorism has affected Pakistan for decades, and there is solid evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring terror activities inside the country. India had violated the Indus Water Treaty, he said, adding that an attempt to deprive Pakistan of its water rights will never be allowed.
Mr Asif emphasised the world has recognised Pakistan’s military readiness and its responsible approach in times of conflict.

• Organisers plan remaining eight matches from May 17 to 25
LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is aiming to hold the remaining eight matches of the Pakistan Super League — postponed due to the conflict with India — from May 17 provided foreign players return to the country.
The six franchises have reached out to players, who were flown from the country on a charter flight over the weekend as the cross-border skirmishes with India intensified last week, to return after a ceasefire agreement was reached.
“The franchises are in negotiations with their foreign players regarding the tentative dates of May 17 to 25 with Raw­a­lpindi proposed to be the ve­nue for the remaining matc­hes,” sour­ces told Dawn on Monday.
The PSL was first moved to the UAE and subsequently postponed after an Indian drone crashed close to the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium last week.
“As soon as the franchises confirm the availability of the foreign players, the PCB will announce the schedule of the remaining matches after getting the approval from chairman Mohsin Naqvi,” sources added.
On Monday morning, the PCB chief had told reporters that “a decision regarding the PSL would be taken by the evening”.
Sources added there will be “more clarity by Wednesday morning as the PCB is awaiting replies from the six franchises to confirm if their foreign players are available or not”.
“Only the availability of the players is a hurdle and there is no issue with the broadcasters as they could make arrangements in a few days.”
With no international cricket during the proposed window, the PCB remains hopeful that the foreign players will return.
However, reports suggest Australian players might not be open to the idea of returning to Pakistan or India, which also saw its T20 tournament — the Indian Premier League — suspended due to the escalating hostilities.
While most Australian players in both countries left for home, former Australia batter Ricky Ponting — now coach of IPL side Punjab Kings — deboarded his flight home following the ceasefire agreement.
The Board of Control for Cricket (BCCI) in India anno­unced on Monday that the IPL will resume from May 17.
“After extensive consultations with government and security agencies, and with all the key stakeholders, the Board has decided to proceed with the remainder of the season,” the BCCI said in a statement.
The tentative window for the resumption of the PSL sees an overlap with Bangla­desh’s upcoming tour to Pak­is­tan, with the two teams slated to meet in the first Twenty20 International on May 25.
The Bangladesh Cricket Board said on Sunday that it would make a decision regarding the tour after “careful consideration of the current situation in Pakistan”.
On Monday, Bangladesh’s T20 skipper Litton Das told reporters that the fate of the tour will be decided between the PCB and the BCB.
Bangladesh spinner Rishad Hossain and pacer Nahid Rana were involved in the PSL before they returned to Dhaka on Saturday.
On Sunday, Rishad issued a public apology after his comments about fellow Lahore Qalandars teammates Daryl Mitchell and Tom Curran sparked confusion and controversy.
Hossain had given a brief interview at Dubai airport where he had claimed that several overseas players, including Mitchell and Curran, were visibly frightened.
He quoted New Zealand’s Mitchell as saying he wouldn’t return to Pakistan, and described Englishman Curran as “crying like a child” during tense moments following nearby explosions in Rawalpindi.
The remarks quickly circulated online, prompting criticism and concern.
“I’m aware that a recent comment I made has caused confusion and has unfortunately been misrepresented in the media creating a false perception,” he said on social media.
“The comment was made during a brief interview with Bangladeshi journalists while I was in transit at Dubai airport. It lacked full context and unintentionally overstated the emotions involved.
“I sincerely regret any misunderstanding it may have caused. I’ve offered an unconditional apology to Daryl Mitchell and Tom Curran. I hold deep respect for my fellow teammates and truly value the Qalandars brotherhood — where we always stand by one another, no matter what.
“I look forward to rejoining my team when the Pakistan Super League resumes.”
Mitchell, who has also featured in the IPL, had earlier refuted Hossain’s claims.
“Both the PSL and IPL have played major roles in my career, and I’ve always cherished my time in both tournaments,” he said. “I hope peace prevails and we can get back to playing the game we love and continue giving back to the amazing people who support us.”

• Dar says second round to follow within two days
• COAS calls conflict ‘defining chapter in the country’s military history’ as ISPR rejects reports of ceasefire breach
ISLAMABAD: Pakistani and Indian senior military officials on Monday agreed to uphold the ceasefire reached last week and reduce troop deployments along the international border, following days of hostilities between the two countries that had raised fears of a wider conflict.
The directors general of military operations (DGMOs) from both countries held a scheduled conversation at 4:30pm that lasted about 45 minutes. The discussion was originally scheduled for noon, but was postponed till afternoon — the delay was attributed by some sources to a difference over the agenda of the meeting.
The two officers — Pakis­tan’s Maj Gen Kashif Abdul­lah and India’s Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai — discussed measures to reinforce their mutual co­mmitment not to fire or eng­age in any aggressive or in­imical actions, according to Indian authorities. There was no official statement r­eleased by the Pakistan Army regarding the meeting.
In addition to reaffirming the ceasefire, the two sides reportedly agreed to pursue immediate steps to reduce troop presence along the borders and forward areas, which is seen as a significant move amid fragile calm after a four-day flare-up from May 7 to May 10.
Pakistani officials described the conversation as the initial round of talks after the ceasefire took effect. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that the DGMOs are expected to have another round of talks within 48 hours for further discussions.
In peacetime, Pakistan and India typically station border security forces — the Pakistan Rangers and India’s Border Security Force, respectively — along the international border, while regular army troops remain in nearby cantonments for rapid deployment if needed. Under the existing terms of engagement, helicopters are restricted from flying within 1 kilometre of the border, and combat jets must remain at least 10 kilometres away.
During heightened tensions, both countries activate wartime formations, repositioning offensive and defensive units closer to the border. After escalation, defensive formations occupy positions on border, whereas offensive forces get into ‘concentration areas’ — usually behind the front lines, where units gather, assemble, and prepare before launching an attack or advancing, according to deployment contingencies. The same happened during this crisis. This understanding reached at the DGMOs interaction implies that some of the troops would move back to their peacetime locations. Pakistan’s defensive units are assigned specific sectors, while its offensive formations operate flexibly, without a pre-designated area of responsibility.
The latest contact between DGMOs comes after both countries agreed on May 10 to a “full and immediate ceasefire” following a sharp escalation that included drone and missile attacks, artillery fire, and airbase strikes. The violence was triggered by India’s May 7 aggression against Pakistan on the pretext of April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian-Occupied Kashmir. Pakistani armed military responded with ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’.
Though the ceasefire was brokered through high-level US mediation, violations were reported just hours after the agreement took effect. Both sides blamed each other for the breaches and Monday’s meeting aimed to reinforce the fragile truce.
On Monday night, the army’s media wing responded to reports in the Indian media, saying that Pakistani forces were fully abiding by the ceasefire. It rejected Indian allegations regarding the violation of the ceasefire.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a televised speech, said India had “suspended retaliatory action” but warned that future conduct would be judged by Pakistan’s posture. “We will measure every step of Pakistan on the criterion that what sort of attitude Pakistan will adopt ahead,” he said.
In a detailed statement, Pakistan’s military described Operation Bunyan un Marsoos as a “textbook demonstration” of tri-services integration across land, air, sea, and cyber domains, delivering precision strikes against Indian military targets.
The operation employed long-range missiles, drones, and cyber warfare to hit 26 key installations in Indian-occupied Kashmir and mainland India, including air force bases, logistics hubs, command centres, and missile storage facilities, the Inter-Services Public Relations said in its statement. “Pakistan Armed Forces possess an ‘adequate’ suite of very sophisticated ‘niche military technologies’, and only a limited number and type were used with restraint in this conflict,” it maintained.
The ISPR emphasised that the operation was “precise, proportionate, and remarkably restrained,” targeting only those directly involved in attacks on Pakistani civilians.
“No hostile design can erode the determination of the Armed Forces of Pakistan,” army chief Gen Asim Munir said during a visit to injured personnel at CMH Rawalpindi.
“The resolute and unified response exhibited during Marka-i-Haq /Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, in concert with the steadfast support of the Pakistani people, constitutes a defining chapter in the country’s military history.”

Trade talks with the United States — which had played a key role mediating a ceasefire between the two countries — would likely have progressed in “short order” and that Pakistan could import more high-quality cotton, more soy beans and was also exploring other asset classes, including hydrocarbons, Aurangzeb said in the online interview.
Regarding the conflict, Aurangzeb described it as a “short duration escalation” with minimal fiscal impact, stating it can be “accommodated within the fiscal space which is available to the government of Pakistan”.
When questioned about potential increased military spending in the upcoming budget, Aurangzeb deferred comment, saying it was premature to discuss specific plans. However, he said: “Whatever we need to do in terms of ensuring that our defence requirements are met will be met.”
Aurangzeb said he expects the Indus Water Treaty, which India unilaterally suspended, to be reinstated and rolled back to where it was.
He said there is not going to be any immediate impact from India’s suspension and Pakistan does not “even want to consider any scenario which does not take into account the reinstatement of this treaty”.
Earlier today, President Donald Trump said the US was ready to help India and Pakistan after a ceasefire agreement, claiming trade was a big reason they “stopped fighting”.
Pakistan faces a 29 per cent tariff on exports to the US due to an approximate $3 billion trade surplus, but this is currently under a 90-day pause announced in April.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday approved a $1bn loan disbursement to Pakistan as part of a larger $7bn bailout agreement.
“Islamabad will receive the tranche disbursement on Tuesday,” Aurangzeb said.
The IMF executive board also approved a fresh $1.4bn loan to Pakistan under its climate resilience facility.
The federal budget for the next fiscal year, starting July, will be finalised within the next three to four weeks, with scheduled budget talks with the IMF to take place from May 14-23, he said.
Tensions between India and Pakistan began mounting after the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, sparking the worst clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours in more than two decades.
On Saturday, a ceasefire in the region was announced by Trump, following four days of fighting and diplomacy and pressure from Washington.</p><small>2025-05-12 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604235-pakistan-indian-dgmos-discuss-ceasefire-to-consider-troops-reduction-from-borders' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India DGMOs discuss ceasefire, to ‘consider troops reduction' from borders</strong></a><br><p>

Saturday’s ceasefire, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed four days of intense exchanges of fire as the nuclear-armed neighbours targeted each other’s military installations with missiles and drones, killing dozens of civilians.
Confirming the talks to Dawn.com, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said the next round would take place in the next 48 hours. A ceasefire till then, he said, was “quite standard”.
State media outlets Radio Pakistan and PTV News confirmed the talks as well.
 






Reuters also reported that the Indian army confirmed that the DGMOs spoke by phone today.
“Issues related to continuing the commitment that both sides must not fire a single shot or initiate any aggressive and inimical action against each other were discussed,” the Indian army said.
“It was also agreed that both sides consider immediate measures to ensure troop reduction from the borders and forward areas,” it added.
 






The escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours began following the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers.
Pakistan firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe. Following the allegations, India launched a series of strikes on Pakistan on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in civilian casualties.
Hotline message
India’s military sent a “hotline” message to Pakistan on Sunday about alleged ceasefire violations the previous day, flagging New Delhi’s intent to respond to further such incidents, Reuters reported, citing a top Indian army officer.
However, the Foreign Office and the Pakistan military’s spokesperson rubbished the allegations.
“In spite of some minor damage, all our military bases and systems continue to remain fully operational,” India’s director general of air operations, Air Marshal AK Bharti, claimed in a media briefing today.
India also reopened 32 airports it had shut during the clashes, with the Airports Authority of India saying in a statement they were available for civil operations. Some schools remained closed.
Pakistan had reopened its airspace on Saturday.
Visitors were kept out of an airport in the border city of Amritsar shortly after the announcement, a Reuters witness said.</p><small>2025-05-12 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12221031058614a.jpg?r=221111' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910584/prosecutor-says-sean-diddy-combs-forced-women-to-participate-in-sex-parties-blackmailed-them-with-videos' target='_blank'><strong>Prosecutor says Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs forced women to participate in sex parties, blackmailed them with videos</strong></a><br><p>Hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs went on trial on sex trafficking charges on Monday, with prosecutors saying the Bad Boy Records founder lured women into romantic relationships, forced them to take part in days of drug-fuelled sex parties and then blackmailed them with videos he recorded of the encounters.
Combs “viciously attacked” women when they resisted taking part in the parties, known as ‘freak offs’ or otherwise upset him, prosecutor Emily Johnson said during her opening statement in Manhattan federal court.
She told jurors they would hear testimony from victims who said Combs, 55, routinely beat them and exploded with rage at the smallest slights. The case has drawn intense media coverage because of Combs’ fame.
“They will tell you about some of the most painful experiences of their lives. The days they spent in hotel rooms, high on drugs, dressed in costumes to perform the defendant’s sexual fantasies,” Johnson said.
Defence lawyer Teny Geragos countered that prosecutors were trying to twist Combs’ romantic relationships into a racketeering and sex trafficking case.
“Sean Combs is a complicated man, but this is not a complicated case. This case is about voluntary choices made by capable adults in consensual relationships,” Geragos said in her opening statement.
Combs has pleaded not guilty to five felony counts of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on all counts, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and could face life in prison.

Combs’ mother, Janice Combs, sat in the front row of the courtroom along with six of her son’s children. Combs wore a beige sweater over a white collared shirt and khakis. He smiled at his family and blew them a kiss before taking his seat with his lawyers.
Prosecutors have accused Combs of using his fame and fortune to abuse women. The defence is expected to counter that the activity described by prosecutors was consensual, and say there was nothing illegal about a “swingers” lifestyle in which Combs and his girlfriends occasionally brought a third person into their relationships.
Over the course of a two-month trial, jurors are expected to hear testimony from three and possibly four of the rapper’s female accusers, as well as his former employees who prosecutors say helped arrange and cover up his actions.
Latest entertainer to face #MeToo charges
Allegations of sexual abuse in the criminal charges brought against Combs by the Manhattan US Attorney’s office last year made him the latest powerful man in the entertainment industry to be accused of sexual misconduct in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to speak up about abuse.
Combs is known for turning rap and rhythm and blues artists like Notorious BIG. and Mary J Blige into stars, and in the process elevating the mainstream appeal of hip-hop in American culture in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Born in Manhattan’s Harlem neighbourhood and raised by a single mother, Combs went on to live in mansions in Miami and Los Angeles and host lavish parties for the cultural elite in destinations like the Hamptons and Saint-Tropez.

Prosecutors say his success concealed a dark side. Over two decades, Combs used violence and threats to force women to take part in the ‘freak offs’, according to the indictment.
Combs would often watch the performances, masturbate and film them, sometimes using the recordings as blackmail to ensure his alleged victims did not report his abuse, prosecutors say.
In one 2016 incident that was captured on hotel surveillance footage that prosecutors plan to show the jury, Combs was seen kicking and dragging a woman as she was trying to leave a ‘freak off’, prosecutors say.
CNN last year broadcast footage that appeared to show Combs attacking his former girlfriend, the rhythm and blues singer Casandra Ventura, in 2016 in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Combs apologised after the video aired.
Cassie among first witnesses
Ventura, known professionally as Cassie, is among the first witnesses expected to testify against Combs.
Combs’ defence strategy at trial will hinge on undermining the credibility of the women who testify against Combs, including by arguing they were motivated by money to accuse him of wrongdoing and have unreliable memories.
Marc Agnifilo, Combs’ lead lawyer, has said the 2016 hotel incident depicted the aftermath of a dispute over infidelity and was not evidence of sex trafficking. In a court hearing on Friday, Agnifilo said Ventura had a history of domestic violence, undercutting prosecutors’ argument that she was a victim.
Ventura’s lawyer declined to comment.</p><small>2025-05-12 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604216-pakistan-army-issues-details-of-anti-india-operation-names-days-long-conflict-marka-e-haq' target='_blank'><strong>Army issues details of anti-India operation, names days-long conflict 'Marka-e-Haq'</strong></a><br><p>

In recent months, Karachi witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Surjani Town Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammed Ali Shah told Dawn.com that three persons were traveling in a car when a “speeding” dumper struck them on the Northern Bypass near Hamdard University.
“The police rushed to the scene after receiving information of the accident. Police found the car crushed beneath the dumper while the three occupants were found dead on the spot,” he added.
He continued that the driver managed to escape from the scene before police reached there.
“However, the suspect Gul Baig was subsequently arrested.”
The deceased were identified as Suleman, 60, his son Usama, 35, and Faraz Sikander, 40. The bodies were shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
In recent months, Karachi has witnessed widespread protests by residents, political parties and civil rights campaigners over the alarming increase in fatal incidents involving heavy vehicles mainly dumper trucks.
The provincial government has made efforts to control the menace of accidents in Karachi, including a ban on daytime movement of heavy vehicles, and imposing fines on reckless driving.
On April 18, the city administration extended the complete ban imposed on heavy vehicles in the city during daytime for another two months.
The ban on the movement of heavy vehicles was initially imposed for two months on Feb 14 in the wake of traffic accidents. While allowing heavy vehicles to operate in the city from 10pm to 6am, the city administration authorised the district and traffic police to register cases against the violators of the ban.
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi said that vehicles carrying essential commodities such as water, cooking oil, medicine, oxygen cylinders for medical facilities, meat and other items were exempted from the ban.
3 murdered over family dispute
Three people were shot dead while two others injured when relatives fought against each other off National Highway, according to a police officer.
“A quarrel erupted between relatives over some personal enmity at Razzaqabad during which firearms were used, resulting in the death of three persons and injuries to two others,” Shah Latif Town SHO Mohammed Ameen Khoso told Dawn.com.
The three persons gunned down in the incident were identified as Usman Munsif, 20, Touqeer Siddiq, 25, and Touseef Bashir, 30. The injured include Noman Bashir, 20, and Munsif Latif, 45.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that two persons with gunshot injuries were brought dead at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) while the third one succumbed during treatment.
The SHO said the police arrested one suspect from the scene and a pistol was recovered from his possession. “The police are further investigating the triple murder and efforts are under way to arrest the remaining suspects,” he added.</p><small>2025-05-12 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1217330355f12d5.jpg?r=174859' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910555/as-trump-heads-to-the-gulf-israel-asks-where-the-us-stands' target='_blank'><strong>As Trump heads to the Gulf, Israel asks where the US stands</strong></a><br><p>Israeli officials have put a brave face on President Donald Trump bypassing them on a Middle East trip this week, but his decision to do so is the latest to sow doubt in Israel about where the United States stands in Washington’s priorities.
On Sunday, a few days after announcing plans for an expanded military operation in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it had been informed by the US of an agreement to release American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, after talks between Washington and Hamas that did not include Israel.
Trump, who will be visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, also caused consternation in Israel last week by abruptly announcing the US would stop bombing Houthis in Yemen, days after a Houthi missile hit near Israel’s main airport.
“The message to the region was clear: Israel is no longer a top US priority,” wrote Itamar Eichner, diplomatic correspondent for Israeli news outlets Ynet, echoing media commentators across the political spectrum.
One Israeli official said Trump’s announcement on the Houthis was “kind of an embarrassment” and that the president acts “for good and for bad”.
Israel has been talking to the US about the post-conflict future of Gaza, and officials say relations at the official level remain strong, but some officials acknowledge being blindsided by Trump’s decision-making.
One senior official in Netanyahu’s circle, who declined to be identified by name, said there was “chaos” in the Trump administration, with everything dependent on what the president decided at any given moment.
Sometimes that helped Israel, and sometimes it did not, the official said.
The decision on the Houthis, which was not discussed with Israel beforehand, compounded Israeli unease at US talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear programme, which could blunt any Israeli threat of military action against its arch-enemy.
Israel faced further alarm after Reuters reported that the US was no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalise ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks.
“We coordinate. It doesn’t mean you must fully agree 100 per cent on every issue,” Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Sunday.
“The US is a sovereign state. Israel is a sovereign state. But I believe we have a very, very big common ground of positions with this administration, more than in the past.”
In March, Trump’s hostage negotiator, Adam Boehler, held what Hamas described as “very helpful” meetings with the Palestinian fighter group that bypassed Israel and focused on releasing Alexander.
Last week, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee denied that Trump was distancing himself from Israel. He said the relationship was often described as ironclad and “that word is still operative”.
“The president has been consistent in his support and his partnership, and I have no reason to believe that that won’t continue,” he said.
‘Chaos’
Netanyahu and his government faced criticism today even as Israelis looked forward to Alexander’s release, with a growing perception in the public that the two allies had differing priorities.
“There’s just no leadership now,” said Tel Aviv pensioner Jack Gottlieb.
There was “no question” the deal happened behind Netanyahu’s back or that the US and Israeli agendas currently differed, he said.
“Right now, it’s every man for himself,” Gottlieb said.
Netanyahu had little choice but to accept the decision on the Houthis, who signalled they would not stop trying to hit Israel by firing another missile a few days later.
Israel has relied on US military and diplomatic support since its creation as an independent state in 1948. Any weakening of US interest, as Israel faces international pressure over the Gaza bombardment, would be a severe blow.
The decision to drop the demand for a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, to get past Riyadh’s insistence that Israel agree to moves towards a settlement with the Palestinians, underlined how damaging the issue has been for Israel internationally.
Adding Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which both normalised relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords signed during Trump’s first term, has been a major goal for Netanyahu but is now seemingly delayed indefinitely.
Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, faced bitter criticism from Israeli hardliners after stopping exports of some heavy munitions used in Gaza and imposing sanctions on violent Israeli West Bank settlers.
By contrast, Trump, in his first term, defied world opinion by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its capital, and recognised Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, which it seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
Israeli officials have said previously that they were aware there were risks for Israel in a president as unpredictable as Trump and one who has shown no compunction in turning on historic US allies.
“But we don’t have a choice,” said one.</p><small>2025-05-12 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1217324638ab41c.jpg?r=173307' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910551/uk-govt-toughens-immigration-plans-as-hard-right-gains' target='_blank'><strong>UK govt toughens immigration plans as hard right gains</strong></a><br><p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed on Monday to “finally take back control” of Britain’s borders as his government unveiled policies designed to reduce legal immigration and fend off rising support for the hard right.
Labour leader Starmer announced he was ending an “experiment in open borders” that saw net migration rise to nearly one million people under the previous Conservative government, which lost last year’s general election.
The government’s Immigration White Paper policy document includes plans to cut overseas [care workers][2] and increase from five to 10 years the length of time people will have to live in UK before qualifying for settlement and citizenship.
English language rules will also be strengthened, with all adult dependents required to demonstrate a basic understanding, while the length of time students can stay in the UK after completing their studies will be reduced.
Starmer said the policies would “finally take back control of our borders”, recalling the pro-Brexit slogan used at the height of the campaign to leave the European Union in 2016.
 
 

Labour vowed in its general election manifesto last year to significantly reduce net migration, which stood at 728,000 in the 12 months to last June.
It had peaked at 906,000 in 2023 after averaging 200,000 for most of the 2010s.
 
 

Starmer, a former human rights lawyer who voted for the UK to remain part of the EU, is under renewed pressure to tackle immigration following the anti-immigration Reform party’s gains in recent local elections.
Arch-Eurosceptic Nigel Farage’s party won more than 670 local council seats as well as its first two mayoral posts. It is also riding high in national polls, while Labour is struggling.
However, Starmer’s tack to the right on immigration risks alienating Labour’s large base of liberal supporters, with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens picking up votes on the left.
The premier said that migrants “make a massive contribution” to Britain but alleged the country risks becoming an “island of strangers” without more controls.
He added that he wanted net migration to have fallen “significantly” by the next election, likely in 2029, but refused say by how much.
“Every area of the immigration system, including work, family and study, will be tightened up so we have more control,” he told reporters at a Downing Street press conference.
‘Higher standards’
The white paper also includes new powers to deport foreigners who commit offences in the country.
Currently, the government is only informed of foreign nationals who receive prison sentences.
Under the new arrangements all foreign nationals convicted of offences will be flagged to the government.
“The system for returning foreign criminals has been far too weak for too long,” interior minister Yvette Cooper said on Sunday.
“We need much higher standards.” The paper also includes new visa controls requiring foreign skilled workers to have a university degree to secure a job in the UK.
And to reduce lower skilled migration Cooper has said she aims to cut 50,000 lower-skilled worker visas this year.
On the plans to double the length of time before migrants can make settlement or citizenship requests, high-skilled individuals “who play by the rules and contribute to the economy” could be fast-tracked, according to Downing Street.
Starmer said Britain has “had a system that encourages businesses to bring in lower-paid workers, rather than invest in our young people”.
Care England, a charity representing the adult care sector, said the decision to close social care visas to new applications from abroad was a “crushing blow to an already fragile sector”.
“International recruitment wasn’t a silver bullet but it was a lifeline.
Taking it away now, with no warning, no funding and no alternative is not just short-sighted — it’s cruel,“ said chief executive Martin Green.
Starmer is also under pressure to stop the flow of migrants crossing the Channel from France to England on flimsy rubber dinghies.
More than 36,800 made the journey last year, according to British government figures, with several dozen dying.
Separate legislation to tackle irregular immigration, called the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, is currently going through parliament.</p><small>2025-05-12 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12171629e90fd29.jpg?r=171721' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910552/bangladesh-investigators-say-ousted-pm-hasina-behind-deadly-crackdown' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh investigators say ousted PM Hasina behind deadly crackdown</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh’s former prime minister Sheikh Hasina masterminded a deadly crackdown on mass protests that prompted her ouster last year, prosecutors at a domestic war crimes tribunal said on Monday.
Up to 1,400 people died in July 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the opposition, according to the United Nations.
Hasina lives in self-imposed exile in India, where she fled by helicopter, and has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.
“The investigation team has found Sheikh Hasina culpable in at least five charges,” Mohammad Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor at Bangladesh’s domestic International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), told reporters.
“They have brought charges of abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy, and failure to prevent mass murder during the July uprising.”
Tajul Islam said the prosecution had submitted its first report to be presented at the court set to try Hasina and two of her aides — former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and ex-police chief Abdullah Al Mamun.
“Sheikh Hasina directly ordered law enforcement agencies and auxiliary forces aligned with her party to kill and maim, and to burn corpses and even people who were still alive at certain points,” he added.
The ICT was set up in 2009 by Hasina to investigate crimes committed during the country’s independence war against Pakistan.
Investigators have collected video footage, audio clips, Hasina’s phone conversations, records of helicopter and drone movements as well as statements from victims of the crackdown as part of their probe.
Bangladesh’s interim government on Saturday banned Hasina’s party, the Awami League, pending the outcome of the trial.
The decision was taken to ensure the country’s “sovereignty and security” as well as the safety of the protesters, plaintiffs and witnesses of the tribunal, Asif Nazrul, a government advisor on law and justice, told reporters.

“The 12th PKK Congress has decided to dissolve the PKK’s organisational structure and end its method of armed struggle,” the group announced in a statement after holding its congress last week.
The PKK’s announcement to dissolve itself heeds a call by its founder Abdullah Ocalan, jailed on an island off Istanbul since 1999, who urged his fighters in February to disarm and disband.
In a letter, Ocalan urged the PKK to hold a congress to formalise the decision.
Days later, the PKK’s leadership accepted Ocalan’s call, declaring a ceasefire.
In a speech on Saturday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted that news about a dissolution could come at any moment, adding that his government was determined to “save our country from the scourge of terrorism”.
“We are advancing with firm steps on the path to the goal of a terror-free Turkiye,” he said.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the dissolution, calling it a significant step toward lasting peace and a terror-free Turkiye.
 






“This historic development reflects the unflinching resolve of the Turkish leadership, under my dear brother President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Turkish nation, to continue their march forward towards reconciliation, unity and stability,” the premier said in a post on X.
“Together, Pakistan and Turkiye remain committed to root out terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” he added.
 
 

The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkiye, the United States and the European Union, has waged an insurgency since 1984.
Its original aim was to carve out a homeland for Kurds, who make up about 20 per cent of Turkiye’s 85 million people.
Since Ocalan was jailed, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed, which has cost more than 40,000 lives.</p><small>2025-05-12 12:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12153512d902e2f.jpg?r=153539' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910505/psx-jacks-up-record-9pc-as-ceasefire-with-india-calms-investors' target='_blank'><strong>PSX jacks up record 9pc as ceasefire with India calms investors</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) gained a record nine per cent on Monday — the restored calm in the market mirroring that in the region after the recent Pakistan-India ceasefire that boosted investor mood.
Saturday’s ceasefire, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed four days of tit-for-tat strikes between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as well as diplomacy and pressure from Washington.
The KSE-100 index opened with a gain of 9,929.48 points, or 9.26pc, to stand at 117,104.11 points from the previous close of 107,174.63 at 9:30am. Due to the massive gains, the PSX was suspended for an hour after opening to control excessive volatility.
Later in the day, the benchmark index reached as many as 117,327.78 points — 10,153.15 points (9.47pc) higher than yesterday’s close, at 3:15pm. This marked the highest intraday gain (points-wise) — more than double the 4,700 points surge in November 2024.
Finally, the KSE-100 closed at 117,297.73 points, with a gain of 10,123.10 points (9.45pc) compared to the previous close.

“The market has reacted jubilantly to the ceasefire announcement after Pakistan established effective deterrence against India,” noted Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.
“The PSX has saluted the Pakistan Air Force this morning with a surge of over 9pc in the KSE-100 Index,” he remarked, in reference to the PAF’s actions in response to India’s strikes.
Additionally, Farooq noted that the recent interest rate cut and the approval of $1 billion tranche by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) “further fueled investor enthusiasm”.
Commenting on the future investor mood, Farooq said market participants were now expected to shift their focus towards the upcoming federal budget for the next fiscal year, which is expected on June 2.
 
 

Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, listed three main reasons for the robust market activity.
Other than the ceasefire and the IMF’s green light to the disbursement, Tariq mentioned US President Donald Trump’s recent statement on increasing trade with Pakistan.
After mediating the halt of hostilities between the South Asian arch-rivals, Trump not only offered his help in resolving the Kashmir dispute but also announced he would “increase trade substantially” with both Pakistan and India.
Pakistan’s international bonds also recorded strong gains today, adding as much as 5.7 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed.
On May 8, when tensions deepened as Pakistan took down 25 drones sent by India into the country, the KSE-100 suffered the largest-ever plunge of nearly 6,500 points in absolute terms. The intraday low of 8,410 points was the second-largest single-day drop (points-wise).
Prominent industrialist Arif Habib, told Geo News at the PSX in Karachi, “We have already achieved macroeconomic stability, which has made Pakistan’s economic story presentable and better.”
He also highlighted the interest rate cut and the IMF’s approval as contributors to the positive market activity.
 


On the ongoing political situation, Habib said it was a good opportunity for “these political matters” to be discussed and settled in the parliament. “There will be no more obstacles for Pakistan’s progress then,” he stressed.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, pointed out the heightened possibility of further improving ties with Gulf countries due to Pakistan’s enhanced geopolitical position.
“This brief conflict has also demonstrated our military and technological superiority over India, strengthening our geopolitical position. As a result, it is likely to enhance ties with Gulf countries amid regional tensions and support growth in our defence and technology exports,” Ashraf told Dawn.com.
 
 

While noting the investor zest in light of the Pak-India “conflict ending with dominance”, he said the attention was now expected to shift towards improving macroeconomic indicators, including historically low inflation and a record-high current account surplus.
Pakistan’s consumer inflation rate plunged to an all-time low of 0.3pc year-on-year in April, while the $1.195bn current account surplus in March was the highest-ever monthly surplus.
Indian benchmarks eye best day in nearly a year
Meanwhile, Indian shares also rallied today.
India’s benchmarks jumped over 3pc and were on track to log their best session in almost a year after the country reached and held a ceasefire with Pakistan.
The Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex gained about 3.25pc each to 24,787.8 and 81,958.04, respectively, as of 1:12pm IST (12:42pm PKT), on track to recover the 1.5pc they lost since India’s strikes on Pakistan on May 7.
 
 

If gains hold, the benchmarks will log their best single-day jump since June 5, 2024, when markets surged after the ruling National Democratic Alliance’s victory in the national elections.
“Assuming the ceasefire is adhered to by both countries, we keep all our macro forecasts unchanged,” Barclays said in a note.
“We see India grow at a solid 6.5pc year-on-year in FY25-26, benefitting from relative insulation to global trade uncertainty and strong progress in ‘trade talks’ with the US administration,” it added.
All 13 major sectors logged gains today. The broader small- and mid-caps rallied 4pc and 3.6pc, respectively.</p><small>2025-05-12 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12144433859552f.jpg?r=144535' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910531/bjp-workers-vandalise-karachi-bakery-in-indias-hyderabad' target='_blank'><strong>BJP workers vandalise Karachi Bakery in India’s Hyderabad</strong></a><br><p>The workers of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vandalised Karachi Bakery in India’s Hyderabad over its name on Saturday, prior to the ceasefire announcement between the two neighbouring countries amid heightened tensions, Indian media outlet The Wire reported.
The vandals wore saffron shawls, stepped on Pakistani flags and chanted anti-Pakistan slogans, The Wire said, adding that there was footage of them striking the bakery’s sign with sticks, to target the word ‘Karachi’.
The escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours began following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe. Following the allegations, India launched a series of drone strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties.
Both sides then launched missiles at each other, which stretched over the week before US President Trump announced that a “full and immediate ceasefire” was reached between the two countries.
A police official K Balaraju was quoted by The Wire as saying: “A couple of BJP workers showed up outside the Shamshabad Karachi Bakery within the RGI Airport Police Station limits at about 3 pm. They raised slogans and took issue with the bakery’s name. They tried to damage the signboard.”
He added that the suspects were detained but were later released as the owner did not want to press charges.

The bakery has been a renowned establishment in Hyderabad since 1953 and its name refers to the founder’s hometown prior to partition, according to The Wire. The outlet said that the bakery has continued to operate across India under this name despite various similar incidents during times of Pakistan-India tensions.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Balaraju was quoted as saying: “No employees at the bakery were harmed. No serious damage was done.”
Another branch of the Karachi Bakery was also targeted earlier, where the “protesters were seen planting tricolour flags”, the outlet added.
A manager of the bakery told The Indian Express, “We are an Indian establishment. We cannot be branded Pakistani.”</p><small>2025-05-12 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12135652eed78c5.jpg?r=140102' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910528/us-china-agree-to-slash-tariffs-in-trade-war-de-escalation' target='_blank'><strong>US, China agree to slash tariffs in trade war de-escalation</strong></a><br><p>The United States and China announced on Monday an agreement to drastically reduce tit-for-tat tariffs for 90 days, de-escalating a trade war that has roiled financial markets and raised fears of a global economic downturn.
After their first talks since US President Donald Trump launched his trade war, the world’s two biggest economies agreed in a joint statement to bring their triple-digit tariffs down to two figures and continue negotiations.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the weekend talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and international trade representative Li Chenggang as “productive” and “robust”.
“Both sides showed a great respect,” Bessent told reporters.
US President Donald Trump had imposed duties of 145 per cent on imports for China last month — compared to 10pc for other countries in the global tariff blitz he launched last month.
Beijing hit back with duties of 125pc on US goods.
Bessent said the two sides agreed to reduce those tariffs by 115pc, taking US tariffs to 30pc and those by China to 10pc.
In their statement, the two sides agreed to “establish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations”.
China hailed the “substantial progress” made at the talks.
“This move… is in the interest of the two countries and the common interest of the world,” the Chinese commerce ministry said, adding that it hoped Washington would keep working with China “to correct the wrong practice of unilateral tariff rises”.
 


The dollar, which tumbled after Trump launched his tariff blitz in April, rallied on the news while US stock futures soared. European and Asian markets also rallied.
The trade dispute between Washington and Beijing has rocked financial markets, raising fears the tariffs would rekindle inflation and cause a global economic downturn.
‘Bodes well for the future’
The head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, praised the talks on Sunday as a “significant step forward” that “bode well for the future”.
“Amid current global tensions, this progress is important not only for the US and China but also for the rest of the world, including the most vulnerable economies,” she added.
Ahead of the meeting at the discreet villa residence of Switzerland’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Trump had signalled he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an “80% Tariff on China seems right!”
However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally, saying China would also need to make concessions.
The Geneva meeting came days after Trump unveiled a trade agreement with Britain, the first with any country since he unleashed his blitz of global tariffs.
The five-page, nonbinding deal confirmed to nervous investors that Washington was willing to negotiate sector-specific relief from recent duties.
But Trump maintained a 10pc levy on most British goods, and threatened to keep it in place as a baseline rate for most other countries.</p><small>2025-05-12 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604172-india-resumes-operations-at-32-airports-after-ceasefire-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan asks Junaid Akbar to 'step down' as PAC chairman</strong></a><br><p>

Kohli, who made his debut in 2011 and scored 30 centuries and 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85 over 123 tests, is expected to remain available for one-day internationals.
The 36-year-old quit Twenty20 Internationals immediately after India won their second 20-overs World Cup trophy in the West Indies last year.
“It’s been 14 years since I first wore the baggy blue in Test cricket. Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on,” Kohli posted on Instagram.
“It’s tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I’ll carry for life.”
“There’s something deeply personal about playing in whites. The quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no one sees but that stay with you forever.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

In a post on X, the Indian Cricket Board, BCCI, announced the farewell of the former captain, saying that “His contributions to #TeamIndia will forever be cherished!”
 






While Kohli’s final Test wrapped up a 3-1 Test series defeat by Australia in January that saw India relinquish the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in a decade, he will be remembered most for his spell as captain between 2014-2022.
Kohli won 40 of his 68 tests in charge of India to become the country’s most successful skipper in the format and sits fourth in the list of captains with the most Test victories.
Only Graeme Smith (53), Ricky Ponting (48) and Steve Waugh (41) won more tests as captains.
India suffered only 17 defeats with Kohli at the helm as he guided the side to the final of the inaugural World Test Championship in 2021, where they lost to New Zealand.
He was also part of the team that lost the second World Test Championship final to Australia in 2023.
“I’m walking away with a heart full of gratitude — for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,” he added.
“I’ll always look back at my Test career with a smile.”
