The defence forces’ chief made this statement at the National Ulema Conference held in Islamabad on December 10. However, details of the Field Marshal’s address at the conference were scant thus far and clips of his speech from the event were broadcast on television today.







“No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said during the conference.
The Field Marshal also stated that there were 57 Islamic countries in the world, and among them, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain (a reference to Makkah and Madina)”.
He also drew parallels between Pakistan and the Islamic State established in Saudi Arabia 1,400 years ago. “Both are founded for the same reason […], were founded in same month, the Ramazan, and their establishment involved the element of migration.”
Speaking about the four-day May conflict with India, he said Pakistan retaliatory operation during the confrontation, Bunyanum Marsoos, the armed forces’ received “divine help”.
“We felt it,” he commented.
India launched a series of strikes in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, an act which led to the worst between the old foes in decades. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire.
The confrontation followed an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22, which resulted in the death of 26 people. While New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence, Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry questioning the credibility of India’s account of the events and saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
During his address at the National Ulema Conference, Field Marshal Munir also spoke about Afghanistan and cross-border terrorism in Pakistan.
Islamabad has repeatedly urged Kabul to put an end to the use of Afghan soil by terrorists for carrying out attacks in Pakistan. Kabul, however, denies the allegation.
Turning his attention to the matter at the conference, CDF Munir questioned: “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?”
The defence forces’ chief further said that formations of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) infiltrating Pakistan had 70 per cent Afghans.
He recalled that the Afghan Taliban had been told to choose between Pakistan and the TTP.
The Field Marshal also cited multiple verses from the Quran during his address.

Sameer’s commanding 113-ball knock, studded with 17 fours and nine sixes, laid the foundation for Pakistan’s imposing total in the title clash.
Dominating the Indian attack from the outset, the right-hander ensured Pakistan made a strong recovery from their group-stage defeat to the same opponents and set up a daunting target in the high-pressure final.







After India captain Ayush Mhatre won the toss and chose to field, Pakistan suffered an early setback when Hamza Zahoor was caught at mid-off for 18 off Henil Patel.
Sameer, however, steadied the innings alongside Usman Khan, with the pair adding 92 for the second wicket. Usman made a composed 35 before being dismissed by Khilan Patel.
Unperturbed, Sameer shifted gears effortlessly. He raced to his half-century off just 29 balls and brought up his century in 71 deliveries, punishing anything loose with authority.







A crucial 137-run stand for the third wicket with Ahmed Hussain, who scored a patient 56 off 72 balls, propelled Pakistan past the 250-run mark and firmly into control.
Ahmed’s dismissal — caught in the deep off Khilan Patel — briefly slowed the momentum, but Sameer continued his onslaught, crossing 150 with ease.
His remarkable innings came to an end in the 43rd over when he miscued a slower delivery from Deepesh Devendran and was caught at long-on, departing with Pakistan well placed at 302 for four.
Pakistan then endured a late stumble, losing five wickets for 45 runs in the final seven overs.
Captain Farhan Yousaf (19), Huzaifa Ahsan (0), Mohammad Shayan (7) and Abdul Subhan (2) fell in quick succession.
Devendran finished with three wickets, while Henil Patel claimed two. Khilan Patel was the most economical of the Indian bowlers, returning figures of two for 44 from his 10 overs.
Late contributions from Niqab Shafiq (12 not out) and Mohammad Sayyam (13 not out), the latter striking a six to close the innings, helped Pakistan push their total further.
India’s fielding proved costly, with several dropped chances allowing Minhas and others to capitalise.
Devendran ended with figures of three for 83 as the rest of the attack struggled on a surface that offered little assistance.
Pakistan’s 347 is the highest total in a U-19 Asia Cup final, eclipsing previous records, and leaves India with a stiff challenge in the chase.
Sameer’s record-breaking effort put Pakistan firmly on top at the halfway stage.</p><small>2025-12-21 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640662-pakistan-navy-commissions-turkiye-made-pns-khaibar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Navy commissions Turkiye-made PNS Khaibar</strong></a><br><p>

The warship is the second of four Milgem class corvettes, the contract for which was signed with ASFAT Inc, a Turkish state-owned defence contractor firm in 2018.
Under this contract, two ships were to be constructed in Turkiye and the remaining two ships in Pakistan.







“The commissioning of PNS Khaibar marks the completion of the construction of both ships in Turkiye,” the military’s media affairs wing said in a statement on Sunday.
President Erdogan was the chief guest on the occasion while Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf also attended the ceremony, it added.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement, Erdogan “termed the brotherly relations between Pakistan and Turkiye as exemplary” while addressing the ceremony.
“The president further emphasised the need for enhanced mutual collaboration in the field of defence production in the future as well,” the statement read.
It added that Admiral Ashraf also addressed the ceremony, acknowledging “the commitment of M/s ASFAT, Istanbul Naval Shipyard and the OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer) involved in the planning, design and construction of PN Milgem ships”.
He also appreciated the deepening defence partnership between Pakistan and Turkiye and highlighted that bilateral engagements between the Pakistan Navy and Turkish Naval Forces (TNF) “not only contribute immensely towards strengthening Pakistan-Turkiye defence collaboration but also reflect our enduring and deepening partnership”.
Following the ceremony, the ISPR statement said, Erdogan visited the ship, where he was presented with a guard of honour. He also interacted with the ship’s crew.
The ISPR further stated that Admiral Ashraf exchanged views on maritime security in the region and discussed avenues for future PN-TNF joint initiatives.
“Pakistan Navy Milgem ships are the most technologically advanced surface platforms. These vessels are equipped with latest command and control Systems integrated with modern weapons and advanced sensors,” it added.</p><small>2025-12-21 08:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640668-after-moonis-elahi-interpol-drops-zulfi-bukhari-extradition-case' target='_blank'><strong>After Moonis Elahi, Interpol drops Zulfi Bukhari extradition case</strong></a><br><p>

The incident occurred just before 1am local time (4am PKT) at a licensed tavern in Johannesburg’s Bekkersdal township, the police said in a statement.
About 12 unknown suspects in a white minibus and a silver sedan opened fire at the tavern patrons and continued shooting randomly as they fled the scene, the police said, adding the motive for the shooting would be determined by investigation.
The injured have been taken to medical facilities for treatment, police added.
Bekkersdal is part of the Rand West City local municipality, whose website describes the township as being an area characterised by high levels of unemployment and poverty due to a decline in gold mining.

Low visibility due to fog was reported from Super Highway, Surjani Town, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, I.I. Chundrigarh Road, Clifton and Defence.
Updates on the Karachi airport’s website showed that multiple flights were cancelled or delayed in the morning.
Pakistan Airports Authority spokesperson Saifullah Khan confirmed in a statement that six international flights scheduled to land in Karachi had to be diverted due to fog.
The statement said that the diversion was a usual safety measure taken due to reduced visibility. It added that Pegasus Airlines, Eitehad Airways, Flyadeal and Gulf Air flights had been diverted to Muscat. Moreover, a Pakistan International Airlines flight that had departed from Madina, too, had to be divered to Muscat.
Similarly, Fly Jinnah flight arriving from Jeddah was diverted to Islamabad.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), shallow fog also engulfed the Rahim Yar Khan-Karachi Highway and Karachi-Lasbella Highway between 8am and 11am.
Air quality
Updates on air quality monitoring platform IQAir around 11:30am showed that the air quality was “very unhealthy” in the city, with an AQI reading of 282.



The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). Any IQAir AQI ranking above 150 is considered “unhealthy” and above 200 is considered “very unhealthy”.
Road accident
Police, meanwhile, reported the death of a motorcyclist in an accident, attributing it to hazy weather conditions, among other factors.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Asad Raza told Dawn that the incident occurred on Clifton Bridge due to “smog, slippery roads and speeding”.
As his motorcycle slipped, he died on the spot, the DIG said, adding that his body was first taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and later handed over to his heirs.</p><small>2025-12-21 06:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/69474b84df5bb.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962160/smokers-corner-out-of-context-orwell' target='_blank'><strong>SMOKERS’ CORNER: OUT OF CONTEXT ORWELL</strong></a><br><p>

George Orwell’s classic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, published in 1949, explores a fictional totalitarian regime that maintains absolute power by dismantling individual thought, memory and personal connection.
Orwell wrote the novel after witnessing the rise of fascism in Germany and, especially, the Stalinist system in the Soviet Union. A self-described socialist, Orwell fought against fascists in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). But he critically differentiated between ‘democratic-socialism’ and the communism practised in the Soviet Union.
By the time Nineteen Eighty-Four was published, totalitarianism in Germany had fallen, but Stalinism persisted. Orwell was particularly disturbed by the Soviet Union’s trajectory, having already satirised it in his 1945 allegory Animal Farm.
In Nineteen Eighty-Four, he presented a warning about communism’s potential to create a terrifying dystopia. The term ‘Orwellian’ quickly entered political discourse as a universal descriptor for state overreach, the manipulation of truth and society’s tendency toward mass surveillance and the erosion of individual privacy.

From e-challans to clamping down on fake news, almost everything is lazily labelled as ‘Orwellian’ these days by people who do not understand exactly what George Orwell’s writing was critiquing

However, since the conclusion of the Cold War in 1991, one can argue that the term ‘Orwellian’ has been stripped of its original meaning, often serving as a catch-all phrase for any unpopular policy. Recently, a friend described the e-challan traffic cameras installed in Karachi as “Orwellian”. He was serious.
In a 2021 essay, American novelist Rachel Klein observed that Orwell’s novel and the term ‘Orwellian’ have become political shorthand for censorship and authoritarianism, often used by those who wish to decry state power but without truly understanding Orwell’s specific critiques. Individuals frequently cite the novel and the term due to personal grievances, such as facing social media bans, increased taxation or ‘unpopular’ judicial decisions, regardless of the novel’s actual context.
This linguistic drift mirrors the devaluation of the word ‘fascism’. Orwell himself noted in 1944 that the word ‘fascism’ had lost its weight, becoming a mere synonym for the word ‘bully’. Historically, fascism was a systematic, amoral ideology that sparked genocides and a global war while attempting the total psychological subjugation of society. As a word, it just cannot be used nonchalantly or in a matter-of-fact manner.
The term ‘Orwellian’ has also become trivialised. Many scholars posit that the manner in which the term is applied to modern inconveniences qualifies it to become obsolete. To understand why this is so, one must look at how modern society differs from the one in Orwell’s novel.



The nature of social control in reality is dramatically different from the dystopian world envisioned in Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. American-Canadian cultural theorist Henry A. Giroux observes that while, in the novel, the state enforced surveillance through omnipresent/unavoidable telescreens, today, surveillance is largely voluntary. People willingly exchange their biometrics, habits and movements via the convenience of smartphones, social media and smart home devices.
Furthermore, according to Indian assistant professor Anuradha, instead of the monolithic state serving as the primary overseer in Orwell’s narrative, in today’s reality, the main overseers in this regard are private corporate entities.
This paradigm is often termed “surveillance capitalism”, where corporations harvest massive amounts of personal data, converting the human experience into data and selling it for profit, making the corporate entity, rather than the state, the primary overseer of the 21st century. This has actually weakened the role of the state. In fact, the state is also struggling to come to terms with this reality.
In Nineteen Eighty-Four, the state physically deleted or rewrote history, but modern day control is often achieved through information saturation and/or through an overwhelming abundance of content, misinformation and algorithmic echo chambers that intentionally obscure the distinction between truth and fiction. These are often the doings of new tech corporations and citizens, and not so much of the state. In other words, these conditions are largely being produced by non-state actors.

 

In another stark contrast, Nineteen Eighty-Four depicted a world defined by constant war and extreme scarcity, enforced rationing and austerity. Many modern societies, however, are driven by hectic consumption, fuelled by advertising and rapacity.
Adding to this conceptual dilution is the trivialised way Orwell’s novel and the term ‘Orwellian’ are currently used by the political left and right. They accuse each other of being ‘Orwellian’, much like they use the term ‘fascist’/‘fascism’. Both sides have drained these words of their actual meaning, using them instead as clichés for anything they disagree with. Both have hollowed out the actual meaning of these terms, employing them as facile labels for disagreement.
A lot of people, both on the right and the left, frequently apply the term ‘Orwellian’ when private companies such as X and Facebook ban accounts. Yet, ‘Orwellian’ strictly describes state-sponsored control of thought and language. Nothing’s private in his novel.
The term is also misapplied to government policies such as pandemic lockdowns or public health mandates, despite Orwell’s support for state intervention during crises.
The pushback against clamping down on fake news is also termed as ‘Orwellian’ by many ‘free speech’ advocates. The irony is that it is the pushback that is actually ‘Orwellian’, because the creation of an alternative reality through fake news and claims using political jargon is arguably the very essence of the distortion that Orwell warned against.
Orwell’s true target was totalitarianism in all its forms, encompassing both the right and the left. In 2021, the American writer Benjamin Newcomb wrote that the term ‘Orwellian’ has become too vague, too cliché and too pretentious to be of use anymore. It is invoked to describe any number of events that its user finds distasteful.
The issue is not that ‘Orwellian’ is an ill-conceived word, but that it is a word whose meaning has frayed. Sales of Nineteen Eighty-Four have once again spiked in recent years. Indeed, Orwell is back in vogue, but still quite out of context.
Published in Dawn, EOS, December 21st, 2025</p><small>2025-12-21 06:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/21103831a56cb1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962295/tehreek-i-insaf-leaders-shouldnt-use-protective-bails-to-join-protests-phc' target='_blank'><strong>Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders shouldn’t use protective bails to join protests: PHC</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has declared that the protective bails, granted to scores of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s lawmakers and leaders, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, were meant to facilitate their appearance before the relevant courts, so the relief shouldn’t be used for participating in protests or anti-state activities.
“This interim relief shall not, under any circumstances, be construed, interpreted, invoked or relied upon by the petitioner(s) as a shield, protection, justification, or safeguard for any purpose other than facilitating their appearance before the competent court. For abundant caution, it is further clarified that this order shall not be used, directly or indirectly, to enable, justify or facilitate the petitioner(s) participation in any protest, demonstration, anti-state activity, or any event of a similar nature,” reads a ruling by a bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Mohammad Faheem Wali in multiple cases.
It declared that any misuse, abuse or attempt to extend the scope of that order beyond the limited purpose for which it had been granted would expose the petitioner(s) to appropriate legal consequences, including, but not limited to, proceedings in accordance with the law.
The court issued these directives in a four-page detailed decision on the petition of former National Assembly speaker and current MNA Asad Qaiser and other PTI leaders.

Bench declares that relief granted only for approaching relevant courts

Qaiser had sought details of the cases registered against him by law-enforcement agencies and the grant of protective bail in those cases.
The other petitions were filed by MPAs Sohail Afridi and former chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur, MNAs Sheikh Waqas Akram, Naseem Shah, Faisal Amin Khan, Shandana Gulzar, Noorul Haq Qadri and Yousaf Ali, Senator Khurram Zeeshan and several other PTI leaders.
On the plea of Islamabad’s chief commissioner, the bench had referred all these connected petitions to the chief justice on Dec 9for constituting a larger bench for hearing.
The bench ruled that since certain crucial issues, as identified by the federal prosecutor general as well as other counsel, were involved in this matter, the office was directed to place the matter before the chief justice of this court for the formation of a larger bench.
In the detailed order, the bench directed the Islamabad chief commissioner to act as focal person between the petitioners and the law-enforcement agencies at federal level as well as within Islamabad.
It declared: “The petitioner(s) in the present case, as well as in the connected cases, shall approach the said office through an application, either directly or through an advocate, seeking information regarding their involvement in criminal cases within three days of the receipt of this order.”
“Upon receipt of such application, the worthy Chief Commissioner, Islamabad, shall procure the record of all criminal cases in which the arrest of the petitioner(s) is required from the law enforcing agencies at the federal level and within the Capital Territory of Islamabad. The said record shall be provided to the petitioner(s) at the earliest, but not later than seven days from the date of the application,” it declared.
The court added that once the records were provided to the petitioner(s), he should approach or surrender within three days before the appropriate court for bail or any other legal remedy, if available.
The high court later clubbed petitions of several other lawmakers with those of Senator Mashal Azam and MNAs Atif Khan and Shahid Khattak.
In these cases, federal prosecutor general Ghulam Sarwar Nehung had represented the chief commissioner and contended that the petitioner (Asad Qaiser) had filed repeated petitions for the same relief without disclosing the fate of the earlier adjudications.
His main concern was that the present petitioner as well as those in connected matters, obtained protective orders from the court (high court) but, pursuant to such orders, failed to approach or surrender before the appropriate forum. Consequently, he claimed, they remained on bail before arrest for a considerable period of time without joining the investigation agencies in other provinces.
He submitted that there was no uniform policy of this court regarding the grant of omnibus bail (bail in all cases orders or protective bail, and petitions filed by the same petitioner for bail before arrest or omnibus bail were placed before different benches, therefore such practice was contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in one of its cases (PLD 1986 SC 173).
Contrary to his claims, the lawyers representing the petitioners had insisted that despite directions of the court, the respondents had failed to provide details of all required FIRs.
They added that the conduct of the respondents had caused the matter to be delayed.

Sharif Osman Hadi was a key figure in last year’s uprising — which sent Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s regime packing — a spokesman for the Inqilab Morcho political platform, and a candidate for next year’s elections scheduled for February.
After news of his death spread on Thursday, protests in various parts of Bangladesh spiralled out of control, as rampaging mobs resorted to rioting and arson. Among the institutions attacked were two of the country’s leading newspapers, Prothom Alo and The Daily Star. Staffers of the latter publication survived a terrifying ordeal when a mob torched their building, and they had to be rescued by security personnel.
As per local media, Hadi’s funeral on Saturday drew hundreds of thousands of mourners, including Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus. Inqilab Morchohas termed the murdered leader a “martyr … against Indian hegemony”, while the suspected killer has reportedly escaped to India.

 

With elections only a few months away, it is essential that the interim authorities in Bangladesh prevent the country from sliding into anarchy. There can be no room for political violence and mob rule.
Hadi’s killers must be traced and punished, while all political groups must adhere to democratic norms even as they stage protests. In particular, media outlets and civil society groups must be protected from vigilantes, and those involved in stoking violence need to be punished.
Sheikh Hasina’s rule was among the darker chapters of Bangladesh’s turbulent history. Her transformation from an elected leader to a ruthless autocrat was stark, and last year’s uprising was a reaction to her brutal rule.
Bangladesh needs to chart a new course, and for this a peaceful transition to full democratic rule is vital, or else the sacrifices of the people may go to waste.

He was received by Iraq’s Culture Minister Ahmed Fakkak Al-Badrani upon his arrival in Baghdad, the post said, adding that during his trip, the president would hold meetings with senior Iraqi leadership.
The meetings were expected to advance cooperation further strengthen Pakistan-Iraq ties, the post added.







Separately, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran Muhammad Mudassir Tipu posted on X that while en route from Islamabad to Baghdad, Zardari “conveyed a goodwill message to the Iranian leadership“ as his aircraft entered Iranian airspace.
“It reaffirmed solidarity with Iran, emphasising mutual respect and stronger relations between the two historic neighbors,” Tipu said.
He added: “ The president’s message coincides with the Iranian nation celebrating Yalda Night tomorrow — a civilisational tradition that brings hope, joy, and compassion amongst people and families. The spirit of Yalda Night defines our bilateral, social, and cultural affinities as well.”
Previously, the Foreign Office had said in a statement that President Zardari would undertake an official visit to Iraq from December 20-24.
According to the statement,  he was invited for the visit by his Iraqi counterpart, Abdul Latif Jamal Rashid.
It said that during his meetings with the Iraqi leadership, President Zardari would review bilateral relations between the two countries and explore ways to further strengthen cooperation across key areas of mutual interest, including trade and investment, energy, reconstruction, manpower, technology, education and people-to-people exchanges.
The discussions would also cover regional and international developments, as well as cooperation at multilateral forums.
“The visit is expected to reinforce the traditionally warm and cordial ties between the two countries, identify new avenues of partnership, and enhance people-to-people linkages, particularly in the context of religious tourism and economic collaboration,“ it said.</p><small>2025-12-21 05:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/21102217ee840d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962338/youtuber-granted-interim-bail-in-hurting-religious-sentiments-case' target='_blank'><strong>YouTuber granted interim bail in ‘hurting religious sentiments’ case</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A sessions court on Friday granted interim bail to YouTuber Rajab Butt, who was booked in a case pertaining to allegedly “hurting religious” sentiments.
Lawyer Riaz Ali Solangi had lodged a complaint against the YouTuber in January at the Hyderi Market police station, under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, the complainant claimed that in December 2024 he watched a viral video of the YouTuber in which he was allegedly “disrespecting” prayer (Namaz) that hurt sentiments of Muslims.
He added that in the “controversial” video, Mr Butt was performing prayer while music was playing in the background, which left him feeling grieved and angered.
It is pertinent to mention that the FIR was registered after a sessions court allowed the complainant’s application filed under Section 22-A, seeking directives for the Hyderi Market SHO to lodge a case against the YouTuber.
Months after lodging the case, on Friday the YouTuber appeared before the additional district and sessions judge (Central) and sought pre-arrest bail.
After preliminary hearing, the sessions judge granted Mr Butt interim bail against a surety bond of Rs100,000 and adjourned the hearing for Dec 29 for confirmation or otherwise.
In a media talk, the counsel for Mr Butt said that no individual could initiate a case on such a sensitive issue in that manner.
He argued that the case had been lodged under Section 295(a) of the PPC and as per Section 196 of the CrPC, such matters come under the domain of the provincial or federal governments.
As the video went viral on social media, Mr Butt posted videos on his official Facebook page in the month of Jan in which he was seen sitting with scholars from different schools of thought.
In the three-part video, he had issued an apology, stating that if anyone’s feelings were hurt by his unintentional actions, he deeply regretted it.

On Dec 20, a two-judge IHC bench headed by Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar had ordered the removal of Justice Jahangiri after allowing a petition challenging the validity of his law degree. Subsequently, the president had also approved the de-notification of Justice Jahangiri on the advice of the prime minister on the same night.
In a statement, the KBA said only the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) is the constitutional forum to remove judges of the high courts and Supreme Court and any “executive or administrative process” is unconstitutional.
Bar President Amir Nawaz Warraich and General Secretary Ghulam Rehman Korai stated that the de-notification had been effected with extraordinary haste and in a manner manifestly inconsistent with the constitutional guarantees of judicial independence, due process and institutional propriety.
“Such action directly impinges upon the doctrine of separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution and poses a serious threat to the independence of the superior judiciary,” it added.
The KBA also stated that the removal of a sitting judge of IHC has been undertaken despite existence of disputed questions of facts, pending judicial proceedings, subsisting stay orders and complaints on the subject matter already seized by the SJC.
Under Article 209, the SJC is the sole and exclusive constitutional forum competent to inquiry into the conduct, capacity or removal of judges of superior judiciary and any parallel, executive or administrative process is ultra vires the Constitution, void ab initio and no legal affect, it maintained.
The KBA emphasised that the security of the tenure of judges was not a personal privilege but a constitutional safeguard designed to ensure fearless and independent adjudication.
“Any action that weakens this protection risks establishing a dangerous precedent, challenging judicial independence and exposing judges to external influence, contrary to settled constitutional jurisprudence and internationally recognised standards, including the UN Basic principles on the independence of the judiciary,” it added.
The KBA also reiterated that judicial accountability must be pursued strictly in accordance with the Constitution and law through transparent, fair and independent mechanism.

But after two National Guard soldiers were shot — one of them fatally — in Washington last month, allegedly by an Afghan national, their fates have been put on hold, and many are now terrified about what the future might bring.
“Everybody is scared,” a 31-year-old Afghan green card holder said.
“We are scared that we will be judged by people for the crimes committed by one individual from Afghanistan.” West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her wounds after what officials described as an “ambush-style” attack that also left fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, fighting for his life.
The following day President Donald Trump announced he was halting all migration from what he called “third world countries”, including Afghanistan, as his administration announced a review of all residency grants for people from 19 countries — around 1.6 million people, according to a tally. Now Afghans fear they might be sent back to a nation run by the Islamist extremists who they once worked to defeat.
“I made my home in America, now this is my home. If I leave here where I have to go then?” sobbed Maryam. Like all Afghan nationals this news agency spoke to for this story, Maryam did not want to be identified for fear of angering US immigration authorities.
“When I sleep my chest feels very painful, empty,” she said. “I feel like I belong to nowhere.”
The 27-year-old worked on projects for the US embassy in Kabul, where she helped produce education materials that she says cast the Taliban in a bad light.
When the American-led international force was there, her country began to modernise, giving rights to women that their mothers did not have.
“I did education, I had a big dreams for my country, for myself,” she said from her home outside Los Angeles. But in August 2021, the last US troops hurriedly withdrew from Afghanistan as the Taliban ran riot, taking over the institutions that American taxpayers had spent billions of dollars to prop up.
Hundreds of thousands of Afghans scrambled to leave the country, terrified that the Islamists would exact revenge on anyone who had helped the West. “It was so difficult to get into the airport,” said Khan, who describes printing out dozens of documents, including proof that his wife was a US citizen living in California.
“There was no water, no food, nothing. And we spent four days in there,” he said. “It was too cold during the night.” Khan, who worked in a university and at a government bank, finally got a plane to Qatar, then on to Germany before being flown to New Jersey, where he underwent two months of background checks and processing.
“We truly thank United States. They helped us a lot to come… and rebuild our life here.”

The country stood up to an aggressor much larger in size and resources, instilling renewed confidence and self-esteem in the Pakistani nation. It also discredited Indian narratives linking terrorism with Pakistan.
It all started with a terrorist incident in the Pahalgam area of Indian-occupied Kashmir last April. As usual, India’s knee-jerk reaction was to blame Pakistan.
However, this time around, the world refused to endorse India’s falsehood. Pakistan proposed impartial investigations, but India declined, and instead, carried out military strikes against nine targets in Pakistan on May 7. The latter responded robustly through a multi-domain, integrated and hybrid warfare. With seven of its planes down, including French Rafale, India sought help from the US for a ceasefire, but bizarrely, refused to acknowledge America’s role.

 

Ever since, India’s global profile has continued to fall in the eyes of the West, which was disappointed that the country that was being prepared as a counter-balance to China could not even handle Pakistan. A panicked Indian leadership decided to tilt towards Russia and China, which had their own questions about New Delhi’s viability as a strategic partner. India’s self-proclaimed strategic autonomy has become a difficult balancing act vis-à-vis major powers.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia entered into a strategic mutual defence agreement with Pakistan with a clause that aggression against one would be considered aggression against the other. This has added another layer to Pakistan’s deterrence regime against potential aggressors.
The US also broke its decade-long stalemate with Pakistan and began to explore investments in the latter’s mineral, oil and gas sectors. Pakistan was also invited to the high table to negotiate an end to the genocidal war Israel had waged against Palestinians living in Gaza.
For its part, China was pleased that some of its defence technology shared with Pakistan had been tested in a combat environment with favourable results. CPEC’s second phase has also been launched. Regional states, particularly Iran, Bangladesh and the Central Asian Republics, have further warmed up to Pakistan.

 

Going into the next year, worsening ties with the Afghan Taliban is a major concern for Pakistan. India, which had little feeling for the Taliban previously, has now embraced them to create a two-front situation for Pakistan.
India has kept open the option of resuming conflict with Pakistan through its Operation Sindoor, which is presently on pause. Given an unfavourable international environment and the embarrassing defeat in May, it is unlikely to resume kinetic aggression against Pakistan soon. However, most observers believe that India will increase its covert war against Pakistan through proxies such as the TTP and BLA. So, Pakistan will need to keep itself prepared to counter any potential Indian misadventure.

The world refused to endorse India’s falsehood.

Pakistan’s domestic scene has also seen progress. With inflation falling, fiscal deficits reducing, and reserves rising, the country continues on the path of economic stabilisation. The economy is increasingly being digitised, and efforts are underway to broaden the tax net.
However, we continue to live beyond our means. Floods have played havoc with those associated with agriculture. Unemployment, particularly among the youth, is another test for policymakers. Devolution of power and resources for local governments are largely missing, defeating the spirit of the 18th Amendment.
The security situation remains precarious, particularly in view of terrorist attacks by the TTP and BLA. One positive is the firm action taken against the TLP, sending a str­­­ong signal to radical groups that there would be zero tolerance for violent extremism.
At a time when the world order is under severe strain and international law is being violated with impunity, most countries are reflecting on their priorities, either leaning towards their own regions, or making alignments with like-minded countries, or opting for self-reliance. Since South Asia remains the least integrated region, due mainly to India’s hegemonic designs, Pakistan and other South Asian countries have few options but to fend for themselves.
In this turbulent era, Pakistan must seek ways to attain political stability and foster its economic resilience against shocks brought about by a chaotic world order. The leadership must undertake structural reforms for the economy and lessen the bureaucratic red tape that is strangulating potential investments. With dozens of reports containing doable recommendations already on the table, the question is not what should be done. The real test for policymakers is to muster the political will to do what must be done.

But any such move will not have a prayer unless both the hybrid set-up and the opposition step back from their confrontation.
After US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s statement at a briefing in Washington, expressing gratitude to Pakistan for “their offer to be part of it, or at least their offer to consider being part of it [the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for Gaza]”, what was clear was that issues remain to be addressed before any move forward on the matter.
Contacts have been going on since the ceasefire in Gaza in October this year. More recently, whe­ther it has been US-led activity in Doha or Florida or visits to Pakistan by the Jordanian monarch, the Indonesian president or the Egyptian defence minister, they all appear to be links in the same chain.
Around the time the October ceasefire was announced by US President Donald Trump, the perceptive king of Jordan made the observation, which is at the heart of the matter — that his country and other Muslim nations would have a ‘peacekeeping’ but not a ‘peace enforcement’ role.

 

This observation is what has triggered the contacts and conversations around the region and the world because regardless of what the US and Israel want, at least the prospective Muslim part of the ISF is reluctant, in fact adamant, not to play any role in ‘disarming’ Hamas.
For its part, Hamas has linked the laying down of its weapons to a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, which is nowhere on the cards, and said it would surrender weapons to a Palestinian state authority only after a complete cessation of the Israeli military operation and the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital. None of these conditions are likely to be met in the foreseeable future.

The state of the economy, the rise in foreign-inspired terrorism and domestic political instability are all areas of concern.

There are indications that the Hamas stance is to take a tough negotiating position but it is also clear that if Israel, the apartheid state, also adopts a similar posture the whole process will begin to unravel or worse, stay locked in a state of suspended animation, with no end in sight for the sufferings of the Palestinians in Gaza in particular.
The last thing any Muslim contingent of the ISF would want is to be seen to be doing the genocidal Zionist state’s bidding. This will neither be acceptable to the leaders of any participating countries nor to their people who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.
Honestly speaking, even if the entire ISF were made up of contingents from non-OIC member states, even then any sane leaders/ commanders would be reluctant to take on Hamas in Gaza as it would be a pointless, long and bloody fight and one they would not win where the Israeli Occupation Forces failed.
There can be no doubt that Donald Trump has staked his personal credibility on the Gaza ceasefire and his own 20-point peace plan. Therefore, the efforts of the US administration members and officials seem aimed at delivering the plan.
Given what is in the public domain so far, it isn’t easy to assess how far the US can bend Israel to force the latter to enable conditions for a long-term peace to become a reality. Even then, it’s easy to say at this point that the doubters seem more credible than those who are optimistic.

 

With Trump now unleashing his fury on Europe, because he feels that it is less Russian President Vladimir Putin and more the leaders of the European Union and the UK who have not done enough to end the Ukraine war, God knows who will have to bear his wrath if his Gaza plan is slow to gain traction or if it fails.
For countries like Pakistan, there are two avenues of safety. One is safety in numbers. Its leadership should ensure, whatever the negotiations and the final position taken, that all OIC member states who have been asked to consider joining the ISF say exactly the same thing. They should evolve a consensus view and collectively own it.
For the resource-rich Gulf states and Indonesia, the fallout from a possible (and for the sake of the Gaza Palestinians one hopes that it never happens) collapse of the Trump plan will be minimal. I wish I could say the same for our IMF-dependent economy. We need to have all our ducks in a row. It is critical to make an effort at national reconciliation too.
There are many advocates of the so-called hard state in the media these days, with the voices calling for the opposite being far and few. But that does not mean the point they make is without merit. From the various courts sentencing the opposition leaders — from the top and middle tiers — to long jail terms, it is clear that protagonists of the hard state have the upper hand.
The state of the economy, which is the result of forever delaying structural reform, the rise in foreign-inspired terrorism and domestic political instability are all areas of concern. For any attempt at starting a national dialogue, temperatures will have to be lowered. As a first step, the rhetoric should be toned down. Personal attacks should be put on hold.
The hybrid set-up has seen through some serious challenges to its existence and now seems co­­m­­fortably ensconced in power. It should use its po­­­sition of strength to lay out reasonable terms for a dialogue. No matter how principled their position may be, it is time equally for the opposition leaders to practise politics as the art of the possible.
Confrontation has delivered nothing to them and kept the country on tenterhooks. People’s issu­­es are multiplying. The country won the war aga­inst the arch-enemy earlier this year. It is to time to bring the war within to a successful conclusion.

LAHORE: Despite being among the world’s largest producers of citrua, Pakistan is set to export only 400,000-450,000 tonnes of kinno during the 2025-26 season, well below its estimated potential of 700,000-800,000 tonnes, as growers and exporters struggle with high freight costs, border restrictions and the absence of effective government facilitation.
During the 2024-25 season, kinno exports stood at around 350,000-400,000 tonnes, with Russia, Indonesia, the UAE, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and Central Asian states as major destinations. For the current season, a slight improvement is expected due to better fruit size and quality in Sargodha and adjoining areas, but structural issues continue to cap growth.
Former MPA and large kinno orchard owner Faisal Cheema said the crisis has deepened despite an excellent crop. “By the grace of God, this year’s kinno crop is outstanding in both quantity and quality, but it has become a pattern that whenever the crop is good, it goes to waste. The Afghan border issue has been hurting us for the last couple of years, while the recent goods transporters’ strike caused further damages as we failed to meet some export orders due to unavailability of reefer containers,” he said.
Market prices have collapsed sharply during the season and orchard owners, out of panic, are selling their produce at whatever price is being offered. At the start of packing for Dubai exports, large size kinno fetched Rs120-125 per kg and smaller fruit Rs90-95 per kg, rates that held until Nov 30. By Dec 10, prices fell to Rs100 per kg for large fruit and Rs70 per kg for small. Between Dec 10 and 15, factories sold large fruit at Rs85-90 per kg and small at Rs55-60 per kg. After Dec 15, the situation became alarming, with factories offering barely Rs75 per kg for large fruit and Rs35-40 per kg for small — despite near-total buyer apathy.

Kabul border dispute and unstable markets put citrus sector at risk

According to industry estimates, traders are selling kinno to factories at Rs1,400-1,500 per maund, while factories have cut packing speeds drastically, daily operations halved from ten to five pickings causing repeated topping of orchards and severe damage to trees.
Sajid Tarar, a former president of the Sargodha Chamber of Commerce and Industry, warned that border closures have brought the export chain to a standstill. “Over 100 factories did not open at all due to the Afghan border issue. Of the remaining units, most were already operating at around half capacity, and now closures are accelerating. Nearly 50 units are shut, with many more on the brink,” he said, cautioning that up to 800,000 workers could face unemployment if the crisis persists.
In a hint to the disturbing Afghan market, he said that some fruit had been going to Afghanistan through Iran, but the tensions on borders created a hostile atmosphere in Afghanistan against Pakistani products and a consignment of bananas was damaged by some people in the markets there.
Cold storages across Sargodha are reported to be 80-90 per cent full, putting kinnow worth millions of dollars at risk of spoilage. Growers fear losses of Rs8-10 billion, with ripple effects likely to hit future crops, including wheat and sugarcane, due to shrinking farm resources.
Stakeholders have urged the government to take immediate action by finding alternative international markets and routes for fruits, subsidising logistics, resolving border issue, and supporting exporters. “Saving kinno exports means saving farmers — and strengthening the national economy,” Faisal Cheema emphasised.

Visits to multiple exchange outlets across different parts of the metropolis revealed that currency dealers are facing a dearth of greenbacks in their accounts. Some have stopped selling dollars altogether, while others are rationing their supply, only allowing customers to purchase up to $100 at a time.
In addition, a small number of exchanges only have old-design dollar notes in stock. These are not of much use to travellers who wish to exchange greenbacks for the local currency of their destination.
As a result, a number of passengers have been forced to purchase exotic foreign currencies in Pakistan, leading to them getting a ‘bad deal’ in terms of the exchange rate.
One such passenger, who was travelling to Malaysia at the end of November, told Dawn that they were unable to buy dollars at the airport, which they hoped to exchange for ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Just hours before their flight, they settled for an exorbitant exchange rate in the open market: Rs74.5 for a ringgit.

Strict regulatory measures compound the situation; exchanges are only selling what they buy

According to them, they were worse off as the exchange rate should have been less than Rs70. Mid-market exchange rate (MMER) data available on Wise confirms this speculation for the given period, as it lists the MMER for a ringgit at roughly Rs68.
But the buck doesn’t stop at travellers. In fact, another group of non-speculative buyers has been hit hard by the shortage: students. Dawn spoke to a Lahore resident who was unable to buy dollars even after visiting 11 different exchange companies to support their siblings’ education expenses.

 

This shortage, some argue, can also be attributed to recent changes to SOPs surrounding the exchange of currencies. Biometric verification and the requirement of an original CNIC were among the changes previously made. But recent changes include an SBP circular dated November 14, mandating exchange companies to issue cheques to customers wishing to buy dollars for deposit into their foreign currency accounts. A more recent circular adds another layer of verification that is not easily accessible for women who wear veil: facial recognition.
Even with these new SOPs, one exchange we spoke to was willing to accept a digital CNIC, after initially hesitating to sell even a single greenback. While three other exchanges that initially hesitated became willing to sell up to $100, provided an original CNIC was available.
In contrast, only five exchanges visited by Dawn, were willing to sell dollars without hesitation, whereas seven exchanges outright refused to sell dollars. An employee highlighted the shortage and the lack of customers willing to supply greenbacks to the open market.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan Chairman Malik Bostan acknowledged the difference in demand and supply, said when a currency was not available, the exchanges were supposed to “note down customer information” and arrange it for them.
Impact of digital currencies
Despite shortage at the exchanges, dollars are still becoming more accessible than ever, through digital currencies pegged to the dollar, a type of transaction that is currently against SBP instructions for banks.
Pakistan Banks Association Secretary Mir Nejib Rahman said that “no bank can operationally engage with stablecoins or crypto rails” until SBP issues the relevant regulations and supervisory framework, which can only happen once Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) published its detailed guidelines.
Mr Bostan also noted his concerns related to illegal activity moving towards unregulated crypto rails, and cited the PVARA chairman’s references to 40 million crypto users who may have lost money as a result of the recent drop in Bitcoin’s value. Experts previously warned that this shortage indicates illegal operators entering the market, and “while smuggling has been largely controlled, hoarding is becoming increasingly likely”.
Dawn reached out to SBP for comment, but no response was received.

This is particularly pertinent in the myriad cases against the PTI’s senior leadership.
In most of these cases, justice has hardly been seen to be done because trials have been conducted with minimal transparency, with most proceedings held without neutral observers present to document arguments between the prosecutors and the accused.
Access to these proceedings for independent media has been poor and the public has not been able to meaningfully scrutinise the reasoning, evidence and legal thresholds applied in the cases against prominent public leaders. Instead, these cases have been tried in parallel in the national media, where government spokespersons have presented one version of events, and the defendants’ lawyers, a completely different one.
With trust in the judiciary wearing thin, it has been very difficult to weigh the merits of the various judgements passed against PTI leaders.
Another batch of such judgements landed this Friday and Saturday, in which almost the entirety of the party’s senior leadership was once again handed convictions, in separate cases, on charges ranging from terrorism to bribery and corruption.
PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid and former senator Ejaz Chaudhry each received 10-year sentences in two separate May 9 cases, one decided on Friday and the other on Saturday.
Also on Saturday, party chief Imran Khan and his spouse, Bushra Bibi, were handed sentences of 17 years each for paying too little to keep a jewellery set gifted by an Arab royal.
All of these individuals now have a considerable record, yet the public has little insight into the reasoning by which their guilt was established.
Indeed, the way another PTI leader continues to be treated despite being exonerated in multiple cases raises further questions about what the convictions represent.
The counsel representing Shah Mahmood Qureshi have wondered when he will be granted bail, even though he has not been convicted in any case so far. Officially, he remains incarcerated pending court decisions on bail appeals in at least three other cases; however, given the consistent lack of evidence against him so far, it seems as if the reason for keeping him jailed has less to do with his alleged misdemeanours and more to do with his political affiliation.
This weakens the government’s narrative that it is merely bringing wrongdoers to book, and paints it, instead, as a hostile party that is punishing the political opposition, even when there are apparently few legal grounds to do so. It also undermines the judgements that continue to be handed down.

According to Met Office, landslides and snowfall may cause road closures/slippery conditions in Naran, Kaghan, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Gilgit, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galliyat, Neelum valley, Bagh, Poonch and Haveli on December 21.
It stated that a westerly wave was affecting western and upper parts of the country. Rain (snowfall over mountains) is expected in north/west Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir, Islamabad and Potohar region. Cold and partly cloudy weather is likely in other parts of the country. Fog/smog is likely to persist over districts of eastern Punjab and upper Sindh.
Talking to Dawn, Murree Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Shirazi said the administration was on its toes to deal with any situation after the prediction of snowfall in the hill station. He said all hurdles had been removed from main roads for the smooth flow of traffic and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority was in contact and had provided the required machinery to remove snow from the roads.

All hurdles removed from roads, machinery provided by PDMA to remove snow from highways, says DC

He said the Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC) had been asked to clean roads and its shoulders to avoid water accumulation and open drains before the snowfall. He said traffic police will ensure smooth flow of traffic.
“We allow more than 5000 vehicles to enter the city; however, the number will increase if traffic smoothly runs on the roads.” He said the health authority had already stocked life-saving medicine in the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital as well as dispensaries in all the union councils.
He said Rescue 1122 will remain on alert till the end of the winter season. Moreover, Civil Defence Department officials will also be deployed in different parts of the hill station.
To a question, the DC said road construction was being carried out at a few points but it would not affect the traffic flow towards the hill station. He said the district administration was monitoring the traffic situation through Safe City CCTV cameras.
Meanwhile, on the special instructions of Secretary Emergency Services Punjab Dr Rizwan Naseer and the Murree deputy commissioner, Rescue 1122 has finalised its preparations under an emergency cover plan.
Under the supervision of District Emergency Officer Murree Engineer Kamran Rashid, the officers and personnel will provide timely, effective and uninterrupted rescue facilities to citizens and tourists.
Rescue 1122 has issued an alert and imposed ‘Code Red’ in Murree district, the main objective of which is to immediately control any possible emergency situation, ensure the safety of human lives and make traffic and public movement safe.
In this regard, trained personnel are performing duties 24 hours a day at all permanent rescue stations, sensitive highways and important tourist destinations.
These locations include Bypass Road Pindi Point, Chara Pani Road, Satra Meel Expressway, New Murree, GPO Chowk, The Mall, Upper Jhikagali Road, Kali Mati Barian Road, Upper Deol Road, Ghora Gali, Chhatar GT Road, Bhurban Rawat and Srinagar Road Aliyot.
The DC said a total of 16 emergency ambulances, seven firefighting vehicles, two rescue vehicles and a mobile response force consisting of 25 rescue bikes had been deployed to provide immediate medical assistance, firefighting and rescue services to citizens and tourists.

However, the rains also disrupted normal life, suspending power supply and mobile networks, flooding roads and houses, and triggering road accidents that left two women dead and several others injured.
Clouds had been hovering over Quetta and adjoining areas for the past two days, though weather experts initially ruled out significant rainfall, describing the system over Balochistan as weak and unlikely to cause torrential rain. Contrary to these forecasts, rain began around noon in parts of the Quetta valley and soon intensified, spreading across the provincial capital.
As the rainfall strengthened, roads in urban areas were inundated with rainwater, leading to widespread traffic congestion. Power supply to Quetta was suspended shortly after the rain began, plunging large parts of the city into darkness. Mobile phone services and communication networks were also badly affected, causing inconvenience to residents. Severe traffic jams were reported on major roads, while public transport services were disrupted.
Low-lying and downstream areas of Quetta were among the worst affected, as rainwater entered houses, particularly damaging mud-built structures. The rainfall continued intermittently until late at night, and many residents hoped for snowfall due to the prevailing weather conditions. However, temperatures did not drop sufficiently to indicate snowfall.
Heavy rain was also reported in many other parts of northern, central and eastern Balochistan, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Chaman, Qila Abdullah, Harnai, Qila Saifullah, Zhob, Loralai, Mastung, Noshki, Sibi and Bolan. In these areas, normal life was disrupted, power supply was suspended, and several localities remained without electricity until late night.
In a rain-related accident in the Noshki district, two women were killed and five others injured when a passenger wagon travelling from Quetta to Chagai skidded on a rain-slick highway near the Sher Jan Agha area and collided with a truck coming from the opposite direction. The injured were taken to a nearby hospital, with two later shifted to Quetta in critical condition. Hospital officials said at least eight people injured in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.

ISLAMABAD: As a court sentenced him to jail in the Toshakhana-II case, former prime minister Imran Khan on Saturday issued a call for a nationwide protest besides announcing his intention to challenge the verdict in the Islamabad High Court.
The PTI chief does not have access to his social media handles in jail.
“I have sent a message to [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister] Sohail Afridi to prepare for the street movement. The entire nation will have to rise for its rights,” he said as per the account of the conversation between the PTI leader and his lawyer posted on X.
He said his sentence in this case did not come as a surprise, but he had asked his legal team to move the high court against the decision. “Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the last three years, the Toshakhana-II decision is also nothing new to me. This decision was given in haste by the judge without any evidence and without fulfilling the legal requirements,” he said, adding that his legal team was “not even heard”.
The PTI chief said it was inevitable for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and the legal community to “come to the front foot” for the supremacy of law and the restoration of the Constitution. He said that without justice, economic development was not possible.
‘Political revenge’
The PTI, in a statement, called the sentence “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation”.
The PTI leaders alleged that the conviction was merely an attempt to extend the incarceration of Imran Khan and provide temporary relief to a “petrified ruling clique”. They stated that the rule of law had been buried in Pakistan, with political revenge being systematically carried out through a “subservient” judiciary.

 

Addressing a press conference alongside PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja stated that the PTI founder had a meeting with his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and conveyed a message to the nation. He made his position absolutely clear, stating, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”
Salman Raja alleged that the case was based solely on promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.
Mr Raja described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was exerted on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case.
Mr Qaiser stated that the current circumstances leave no option other than resistance. He emphasised that the resistance would be peaceful, democratic, and grounded in constitutional principles. He further asserted that PTI was seeking justice for its founder and would continue its struggle until it was served.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram stated that even Imran Khan’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo” court announced the verdict. The sentence was the second for the same charge, which was a clear violation of the Constitution, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy, he said.
‘Pre-written script’
Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against him were being delivered under a “pre-written script”.
Ms Khan claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts.
“Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision. “What difference does it make whether you sentence them to 10 years or 14 years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said.
“Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned.
According to Ms Khan, the PTI founder’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in “illegal solitary confinement”.
Separately, PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgement. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former premier and his wife were those of a “kangaroo court”.
“There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Mr Ayub added.

The hearing was conducted by Additional District and Sessions Judge Yalmaz Ghani, and the witness, Adnan Raza, appeared before the court.
The witness recorded his statement, saying that he and his family were politically affiliated with the PML-N.
Mr Raza stated that on April 8, 2017, the PTI founder made false allegations against PM Shehbaz, claiming that someone from the prime minister’s family had offered him Rs10 billion to remain silent over the Panama Papers case.
The witness added that Mr Khan repeatedly made these allegations.
He further testified that on May 9, 2017, he read in a newspaper that PM Shehbaz had sent a legal notice to Mr Khan regarding the allegations.
Mr Raza said the false claims damaged PM Shehbaz’s reputation and created public unrest against him, noting that the impact of these allegations was reflected in the PML-N’s defeat in his constituency.
The defendant’s counsel, Muhammad Hussain Chotia, cross-examined the witness.
In response to his queries, Mr Raza clarified that he did not claim all incidents occurred in Punjab. He added that he had watched the relevant statements of Mr Khan on television.
The witness stated it was incorrect to suggest that PM Shehbaz came to power through rigging with the help of the Election Commission of Pakistan by preparing Form-47.
He also said that PML-N President Nawaz Sharif was not disqualified due to the Panama Papers case but for not drawing a salary from his son’s company.
When asked if corruption led to PML-N’s defeat in his constituency, the witness replied that it was incorrect and attributed the loss to the ‘false allegations’ made by the PTI leader.
After the cross-examination was completed, the judge summoned additional witnesses for Jan 24.
Previously, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Ahmad Khan had also recorded statements as witnesses for the prime minister.
PM Shehbaz filed the suit in 2017, stating that the PTI founder had made baseless allegations against him.
He is seeking Rs10 billion in compensation and damages for the publication of defamatory content.

LAHORE: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday stressed the need to fully utilise modern technology to upgrade the country’s immigration system while chairing a review meeting on the eradication of human trafficking and measures against illegal travel abroad.
Referring to recent reports and complaints regarding the offloading of passengers travelling abroad, he commended Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi for personally visiting airports to review the situation.
He directed that while taking action against individuals travelling abroad illegally or holding dubious travel documents, special care must be taken to ensure that passengers with valid travel documents were not inconvenienced.
The prime minister also instructed that the performance of the Protectorate of Emigrants be further improved and coordination with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and other relevant institutions be strengthened to facilitate those travelling abroad legally for employment.
During the meeting, it was informed that the FIA had arrested 451 individuals involved in human trafficking and illegal travel this year.
Due to these efforts, the number of Pakistanis travelling illegally to Europe had declined by 47 per cent, while reductions had also been recorded in cases of travel on illegal documents to the UK and Gulf countries.
The participants were further told that illegal migration, misuse of work, visit and tourist visas, off-loading, and deportation remained major challenges in European countries.
Most deportations involved passengers returning from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Malaysia and Oman.
The meeting was further informed that a risk assessment unit was operational within the FIA, enabling targeted screening of passengers and systematic recording of data related to deported and illegal travellers.
It was also highlighted that 196 FIA officers and personnel had been dismissed after corruption was proven against them.
The participants were informed that work was underway to activate the e-gate system at airports. Access to API-PNR data will be enabled to help identify potentially illegal travel documents in advance.
In addition, a mobile phone application is being developed for passenger data, the FIA’s IBMS and IT sections are being restructured, and artificial intelligence is being utilised to prevent illegal travel.
‘Increase in exports essential’
Separately, while chairing another review meeting on domestic exports, PM Shehbaz said a sustained increase in exports was essential for the country’s economic development and long-term stability.
PM Shehbaz directed the federal ministers for commerce, industry and production and national food security to personally visit exporters in various industrial and commercial cities to understand their issues and ensure timely resolution.
The prime minister also underlined the need to further strengthen coordination with the provinces to promote cold chain systems and other sectors linked to industry and trade.
During the meeting, the premier was briefed on exports and imports for the ongoing fiscal year so far, along with measures being taken to improve export performance.

Police officials said the operation was launched after security agencies received information abo­ut militants hiding in the area. Acting on the tip-off, security forces cordoned off the locality and eng­aged the suspects, resulting in the killing of five militants.
The officials said the group was involved in sabotage activities and had been using the area as a base to plan attacks.
Following the encounter, security forces carried out a search and clearance operation in the surrounding areas to trace any possible accomplices. Law enf­orcement agencies were placed on high alert, while security checkpoints in and around Bannu were strengthened as a precautionary measure.
Police sources said security operati­ons had been intensified across the district in view of recent security threats. They said coordination among police, security forces and intelligence agencies remained strong to counter terrorism.

Amid opposition from the Ministry of Parl­ia­mentary Affairs, the Senate Standing Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges has approved an amendment to Rule 166(5) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate. Backers say the change will leave no legal room for the judiciary to interfere in parliamentary matters by relying on the rule in its present form.
The proposed amendment, spearheaded by former deputy chairman Saleem Mandviwalla and signed by around three dozen lawmakers, expands the definition of public petitions that can be taken up by Senate committees.
It states that a public petition, submitted by a citizen or a group of citizens in the prescribed form under Rule 277, may be presented on “any matter of public importance”, including grievances arising from disputes where circumstances disclose an element of public interest, systemic concern, regulatory oversight and/or the protection of rights.

Proposed rule change seeks to shield upper house committees from stay orders

It further provides that, after consideration, the committee may issue: (a) observations or recommendations for systemic or regulatory improvements; and (b) facilitative guidance for resolution of the grievance and take necessary steps for disposal of the matter in accordance with relevant law.
A proviso proposed to be added to the rule gives the Senate chairman broad discretion over whether a petition proceeds. It reads: “Provided that, notwithstanding anything contained in this rule, the Chairman Senate may, at his sole discretion, review, admit, pend, dispense with or decline to proceed with any petition, if in his opinion such action is necessary in the interest of propriety, parliamentary discipline, or to prevent frivolous, vexatious or otherwise inappropriate proceedings.”
Rule 166(5) in its current form states: “Public petitions may be presented on any matter connected with the business pending before the House or a Committee, or any matter of general public interest which is primarily the concern of the Government, provided that it is not one which falls within the cognisance of a court of law or tribunal, and it shall not directly relate to a matter pending before any court or other authority performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions.”
The ministry proposed retaining the latter portion of the original rule as a second proviso, but the committee rejected the suggestion.
During the meeting, held with Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi in the chair, Mr Mandviwalla raised concerns over what he described as judicial interference in committee proceedings. He emphasised courts had no authority to interfere in parliamentary affairs and noted that the Supreme Court had repeatedly directed that parliamentary proceedings should not be obstructed.
He recommended that the Senate should not compromise the authority of its committees and, while exercising the powers of the House as representatives of the public and as oversight bodies, must remain fully empowered to take up matters of public importance.
Mr Mehdi reiterated that parliament was the supreme institution and said its organs must be empowered to address issues affecting individuals and groups of citizens. However, he cautioned that committees must strictly refrain from taking up or discussing sub judice matters.
Senator Saadia Abbasi opposed the proposed amendment, saying every institution should operate within its constitutional domain and avoid interfering in the functions of others.
The meeting was attended by Senators Saadia Abbasi, Dost Ali Jeesar, Asad Qasim, Jan Muhammad and Palwasha Khan. Senators Mandviwalla, Shahadat Awan and Syed Masroor Ahsan also attended as movers, while Senator Bilal Khan Mandokhail attended as a special invitee.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Mandviwalla said he was confident the amendment would be passed by the House and would “put a full stop” to judicial interference in parliamentary affairs. “And if it does not stop even then, we will move the appropriate forum for action against those found responsible,” he said.
The move follows a dispute this year over stay orders issued by the Islamabad High Court and Lahore High Court against proceedings of Senate standing committees. On July 25, the Senate summoned the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle raised concerns about alleged judicial interference in parliamentary matters.
The issue was raised by Mr Mandviwalla during a sitting presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan. Mr Mandviwalla described the stay orders as “alarming” and regretted that they had been issued despite the absence of any pending court cases. “This is direct interference in the functioning and proceedings of parliamentary committees,” he said.
Legislators from both treasury and opposition benches, including PTI and JUI-F, endorsed the concerns. On Aug 18, AGP Mansoor Usman Awan made a rare appearance before the Senate and backed the judiciary, calling for keeping the door open for judicial intervention in parliamentary proceedings.
The AGP referred to Article 69 of the Constitution, under which the validity of proceedings in parliament cannot be called into question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure, but insisted that the bar was not absolute.

Journalist Wusatullah Khan moderated the session titled Saang siyasat ja  (Deceptive moves of politics). “Our country is run like a laboratory,”  he remarked, observing that powerful elites have captured it. “We will  see progress [of the country] only when we are able to rid the country of these  people,” he believed.  
In the past, ‘One Unit’ was introduced by doing away with  provinces’ status. It was claimed that this would offer a solution to  all ills. Now, once again, there is talk of new provinces, he wondered. 
Munizae Jahangir pointed out that no dictator could be a  ‘progressive’ individual; people have fought a long flight here for  democratic values. She said that her mother, Asma Jahangir, led this  fight as well. Unfortunately, politicians, as well as the  judiciary and other institutions, did not deliver to the masses despite  this long battle. 
She said that the politicians who challenged the establishment did it for their own survival, and not for the masses.  
Javed Qazi, a columnist, said that while a hybrid system exists  in the country, real power lies with the mighty ones who run this state.  “Independent judiciary does not exist anymore,” he said, and added that  PPP had become a party of elites under Asif Ali Zardari because it has a  lesser pro-poor outlook. Similarly, he said, Sharif’s slogan of ‘Vote ko izzat do has vanished.  
“Now we have controlled politics, controlled democracy and controlled journalism,” he observed. 
An Urdu literary figure, Farnood Alam, said that no popular  movement is seen in the country unlike the past. He said that past  movements used to give a feel that Pakistan would become a secular state  within the next 15 years. “Democracy and politics finished after 2018,”  he remarked. 
Senior journalist Ghazi Salahuddin, at a separate session: Insani haqqan jo tabdeel theendar manzar namo  (changing landscape of human rights) moderated by Zakia Ejaz, observed  that educational institutions lack a democratic environment. “Democracy  is being stifled through [constitutional] tweaks,” he said. 
He recalled that journalism in the past used to enlighten people, but now it is weakening with print media facing demise.  
“Artificial Intelligence is killing creativity,” he said, and  observed that press freedom used to be the masses’ freedom which has  been snatched now.  
Sessions on launching of books by Ashfaq Leghari (Nafrat ki daryaft), Asif Qazi (Sindh: ten years before Pakistan), and Akhtar Hafeez (Walaar) were also held.

According to a statement from the Karachi Traffic Police, a trailer driver was involved in “negligent and careless driving” when he hit a motorcycle on Mauripur Road, injuring its two passengers.
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson said they were taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, where one of them died.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that, according to the initial probe, the fatal accident was caused by over-speeding, which led the motorcycle to slip and the trailer’s rear wheels to crush the teenage rider.
He said the driver was arrested and the trailer seized by Mauripur police.
In another incident, a motorcyclist was killed when a trailer hit him on the main Super Highway near the Toll Plaza, according to a statement from an Edhi Foundation spokesperson.
Gadap City Station House Officer Sarfraz Jatoi confirmed the incident, adding that the injured motorcyclist was taken to a private hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said 17-year-old victim sustained crush injuries to his skull and face during the Mauripur accident.
She added that the body of the Super Highway accident victim was brought to a hospital in the evening for legal formalities.
In a third incident, DIG Raza said the front left-side tyre of a water tanker burst around 8:15pm near Habib Chowrangi on Star Mill Road in the Site Area. As a result, a motorcyclist, an unidentified man aged around 25 to 30, came under the vehicle’s wheels and was killed on the spot.
The DIG said the body was taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for completion of legal formalities, and further legal proceedings were under way in accordance with the law.
The latest deaths come against the backdrop of a worrying increase in fatal road accidents involving heavy vehicles, particularly water tankers and dumpers, across Karachi.
Last week, a young motorcyclist was killed and his pillion rider injured by a trailer truck driver near Bara Board, PAF Gate, in Mauripur.
The week before that, a first-year college student and a 12-year-old boy lost their lives in separate incidents after being hit by water tankers in different parts of the city, triggering renewed concerns over reckless driving, poor enforcement of traffic laws and the unchecked movement of heavy vehicles in densely populated areas.
Last month, angered citizens also set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it met with an accident, resulting in the death of a man. His wife was injured in the incident.

The case pertains to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price. During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m.
The verdict was delivered by Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated.
Imran was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison; he was awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 (common intention) and 409 (criminal breach of trust) of the Pakistan Penal Code, and seven years under Section 5(2) (criminal misconduct by public servants) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Bushra Bibi was also sentenced to a total of 17 years’ imprisonment under the same provisions.
Both of them were also fined Rs16.4 million. As per the law, a failure to pay the fines will result in additional jail time.

Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Imran’s jail term in the case would begin after his sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended.
The court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said, “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment.”
It added that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was “hereby given to the convicts”.
Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year in October, the two had denied all allegations in case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.
PTI slams verdict
The PTI, in a post on X, said that Imran’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo court announced the verdict of the Toshakhana 2 case”.
“A closed-door jail trial is neither free nor fair; it is in fact a military trial,” the party said. It also shared a video of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan inside a car asking why she was not being allowed to proceed further.
“They can’t stop us. The jail trial is today,” she said in the video, adding that it was “illegal” that the family was being stopped.







Later, Aleema, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against Imran were being delivered under a pre-written script.
“Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision.
Aleema claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts.
“What difference does it make whether you sentence them to ten years or fourteen years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said.
“Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned.

Separately, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja stated that the case was being conducted on the basis of promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.
He described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was put on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case.
PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgment. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former prime minister and his wife were those of a “Kangaroo court”.
“There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Ayub added.







A detailed statement released by the PTI’s Central Media Department rejected the sentence against the former prime minister and his wife, terming it “unconstitutional, illegal, ill-intended” and the “worst form of political revenge”.
The party alleged that Imran and Bushra Bibi’s lawyers were not present at the time of the verdict was announced. “Neither were their families allowed to come to court, nor were basic judicial requirements fulfilled,” PTI said.
“This is open contempt of court, contempt of law and contempt of justice,” the party said.
The party further stated that the sentence was the “second for the same charge, which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy”.
The party alleged that the courts had become an “instrument of political engineering, rather than being an independent forum”.
It said that the “sole” purpose of this court was to “prolong the illegal imprisonment of Imran and provide temporary support to the rulers who are afraid of the mandate of the people”.







PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja slammed the sentence for how its proceedings were conducted in “undue haste” with the couple and their lead counsel not present when the judgement was announced.







Minister says sentence to run consecutively
Separately, Information Minister Tarar said the punishment was a “consecutive sentence”, adding that it would begin after the sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended.
Speaking to Geo News, the minister welcomed the judgment, asserting that the former prime minister and his wife had “committed fraud” by getting the gifts undervalued and retaining them for personal use.
He said that PTI founder and his wife’s actions were a “breach of public trust”.

“During the trial, when these gifts were properly assessed, it emerged that[..] the actual price was quite high,“ he said. He further stated that the two had “committed fraud” by undervaluing the gifts and retaining them for personal use.
“They had no right to harm the exchequer and retain gifts,” he stressed. He said the judgment was “completely fair and grounded in the principles of justice”.
“The misuse of office, dishonesty with the government’s property, and criminal breach of trust, all of it has been proven,” he said.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, while speaking with Geo News, remarked that the judgment was “in line with the Constitution and the law”.
He stressed that “there was no political side to this, if you violate the law, it is clear that a punishment is expected”.
“The trial that went on for 15-16 months, it was proven that PTI founder and his wife caused the national exchequer significant harm as the set’s valuation was under-reported,” Malik said.
“The gift was not even submitted,” he added.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the judgment came after lengthy legal proceedings. Speaking to Geo News, he noted that the case followed a similar pattern to that of the Toshakhana-I reference.
“The state was given a gift that was not deposited, which they were legally bound to do according to the procedure for acceptance and gifts in Toshakhana,“ he said.
“Unfortunately, Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan attempted to buy the set at throwaway rates,“ he said. He asserted that all the facts had “now been established in light of today’s judgement”.
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah also addressed the sentence while speaking to the media in Chiniot, saying that state gifts did not belong to an individual but to the state.
He said the entire case against Imran was documented.</p><small>2025-12-20 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2020392152f3f2e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962272/yasmin-rashid-ejaz-chaudhry-other-pti-leaders-sentenced-to-10-years-by-lahore-atc-in-additional-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, other PTI leaders sentenced to 10 years by Lahore ATC in additional May 9 cases</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Saturday sentenced PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed to 10 years in prison terms in two more May 9 cases.
The latest court verdict comes a day after a Lahore ATC acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while sentencing four other leaders, including Dr. Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, and Ejaz Chaudhry, to 10 years in prison in another case related to the May 9 riots.
Rana Mudassar, the counsel for the PTI leaders, confirmed the development to Dawn, saying the cases are related to the burning of police vehicles in Lahore’s Gulberg and the burning of a container near Kalma Chowk during the nationwide riots on May 9, 2023 following the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan.
On that day, supporters and workers of the party, reacting to founder Imran Khan’s arrest, vandalised and torched military installations and government properties. The state subsequently launched a crackdown against Imran and his party, booking the party founder and its leadership in multiple cases.
ATC-III Judge Arshad Javed presided over the hearings for both cases today in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. A total of 22 accused were sentenced to 10 years in prison, while five were acquitted in the Kalma Chowk case. In the Gulberg case, the judge handed down sentences to five, including the PTI leaders, while acquitting 22 others.
The judge noted that former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had not yet been indicted in either case and his trial would proceed separately once a supplementary challan was submitted by the prosecution.
According to the prosecution, a total of 78 witnesses were presented in both cases. In the Gulberg case, a challan was filed against 33 individuals, while four others were declared proclaimed offenders during the trial.
In the Kalma Chowk case, the prosecution filed a challan against 36 people, while 12 others, including Hammad Azhar, Murad Saeed, Zubair Niazi, and Mian Aslam Iqbal, were declared absconders.
The prosecutor argued that PTI leaders had instigated party workers to revolt and create public disorder.
Talking to the media later, PTI’s counsel said the cases were scheduled for routine proceedings, but “sentences have been handed down once again in the darkness of night”.
He added that the defence was not given the chance to fully present its case.
“The morale of the prisoners in Kot Lakhpat Jail is high. So far, the leaders have been sentenced to a total of more than 200 years,” the counsel said, adding that the sentences would be challenged in the high court.
With these verdicts, decisions have now been announced in seven of the 14 cases related to the May 9 riots registered in Lahore. Verdicts had previously been announced in trials concerning an attack on Shadman Police Station, violence at Sherpao Bridge, the burning of police vehicles near Rahat Bakery, the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squad vehicle near Jinnah House, and an attack on the entrance gate of the GOR-I Club Chowk.</p><small>2025-12-20 17:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2019390113cf4af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962271/elders-of-kps-tirah-agree-to-vacate-homes-ahead-of-military-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Elders of KP’s Tirah agree to vacate homes ahead of military operation</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: After weeks of protracted deliberations with security and administration officials, tribal elders from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s restive Tirah valley finally agreed to start vacating their homes from January 10, ahead of an operation against militants, after reaching a written agreement with the district administration.
The deadlock had persisted between the valley’s tribal elders and government officials over the launch of a military operation in the valley as well as the relocation of families to prevent collateral damage.
Sources among the 24-member jirga, who negotiated the written agreement on the displacement process with the district administration, said that the entire Tirah valley would be vacated by January 25, 2026, thus paving the way for the long-anticipated military operation against all proscribed militant groups currently holed up in the valley.
Spelling out the terms and conditions of the written agreement, the jirga said that the district administration agreed to pay Rs3 million to those whose houses were completely damaged and Rs1 million to those whose houses were partially damaged, respectively, during the military operation, which will be launched once the evacuation is completed.
They said that the jirga was also assured that every family would receive Rs250,000 through JazzCash or Easypaisa upon biometric verification at the time of registration at the Bagh Markaz and Paindi Cheena registration centers.
Each family would further be provided with a monthly stipend of Rs50,000 until April 5, 2026, when the return process would begin following the completion of the military operation, the sources added.
The district administration also agreed to arrange free transportation for the departing families, along with the provision of free health services during their journey to their next destination.
It was further decided during the deliberations held at Khyber House that families who had already left their homes would be included in the survey of newly displaced families, with the head of each family required to report to either the Bagh Markaz or Paindi Cheena registration center for biometric verification before January 25, 2026.
A representative jirga of Tirah elders had earlier presented a list of demands to security and administrative officials, which included Rs8 million and Rs4 million as compensation for fully and partially damaged houses, respectively, along with Rs500,000 for every departing family.
The demands were, however, toned down to a limit mutually agreed upon by the security and administrative officials and the jirga members, with the Tirah elders left with no option but to accept a written agreement as time was running out for the launch of a decisive military operation.
Sources among the jirga members insisted that collateral damage from indiscriminate artillery shelling of suspected militants’ hideouts and quadcopter attacks was a major concern for most residents of the Tirah valley, while security officials argued that the presence of militants in congested residential areas was a major obstacle to executing intelligence-based military operations (IBOs).
They said that the forceful occupation of private houses by militant groups and their frequent changes of location were also a source of continuous trouble and inconvenience, with security officials constantly insisting on the complete relocation of Tirah residents to pave the way for a decisive push against all outlawed militant groups.
Security officials, in consultation with local elders, had earlier agreed on limited internal displacement during the IBOs, with families from a suspected locality relocated to a nearby safer area for a limited period and returning home upon the completion of the IBOs.
However, this failed to alleviate the suffering of local residents, while security forces were forced to launch frequent IBOs whenever militant groups re-entered areas previously declared safe.
“It’s imperative that we leave the entire valley at the disposal of the security forces after our complete relocation to safer locations, far from the heat of the military operations in Tirah,” a jirga member told Dawn.
The jirga member, however, firmly insisted on the demand that there be no further displacement once the anticipated military operation is completed, with a strong assurance of no future IBOs in areas cleared after the major operation.
Dawn has also learned that MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani, along with members of the Bara Siyasi Ittehad, who had vehemently opposed forced displacement and the subsequent military operations in Tirah, were left out of the intense deliberations between the 24-member Tirah jirga and district administration officials.
Later, responding to a Dawn query about his absence from the Friday jirga, MNA Iqbal Afridi insisted that military operations in the merged districts had never achieved the desired results and had instead proved to be a source of destruction and prolonged displacement of innocent tribesmen.
He regretted being declared a proclaimed offender following the registration of numerous allegedly false First Information Reports (FIRs) against him, as he had consistently raised his voice against the military operations and forced displacements, which he said were actually aimed at gaining unlawful control over the natural resources of the newly merged districts.
Last month at least five terrorists affiliated with the proscribed Tekreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed in an IBO in Tirah valley.
In September, at least two dozen residents of Tirah, including women and children, lost their lives in blasts, which officials claim were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses.</p><small>2025-12-20 15:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640582-yasmin-rashid-ijaz-chaudhry-other-pti-leaders-sentenced-to-10-years-in-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, other PTI leaders sentenced to 10 years in May 9 cases</strong></a><br><p>

Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, a key figure in last year’s student-led uprising that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka last week while launching his campaign for an election due in February. He died on Thursday in Singapore after six days on life support.
His death has prompted a wave of unrest in the South Asian nation that included coordinated mob attacks on major newspapers and cultural institutions.

 

Police and paramilitary forces were deployed across the capital for Saturday’s funeral, but there were no reports of any renewed violence.

Interim government leader Muhammad Yunus said Hadi’s legacy would endure, describing the funeral as a collective pledge to uphold the ideals he had championed.
“Today, we have come to promise you (Hadi) that we will fulfil what you stood for,” Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, told the mourners, who included Bangladesh’s army chief and representatives from across the political spectrum.
In a rare and symbolic honour, Hadi was laid to rest on the Dhaka University campus beside the grave of national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam.

Bangladeshis hope election will end years of instability
Bangladesh is to elect a new parliament on February 12 — a transition many hope will help the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million people recover from nearly two years of instability and reclaim its position as a regional success story.
But frequent bouts of violent protests and political wrangling among disparate groups, including Islamist hardliners, have punctured the national sense of euphoria that arose after Hasina was ousted in August 2024.
It has also exposed the limitations of Yunus’ interim government, analysts say, raising questions over his grip on governance in the world’s largest apparel producer after China.
The government has declared Saturday a day of state mourning for Hadi and has urged citizens to resist “mob violence by fringe elements”, warning that turmoil threatens Bangladesh’s fragile democratic transition.
Human Rights Watch called Hadi’s killing a “terrible act” and urged the government to act urgently to halt the violence that has gripped the country since Hasina’s ouster.
The rights group also condemned the attacks on the media as an assault on free expression.
Bangladesh ranks 149th of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index. Rights groups say continued attacks on journalists and activists could further shrink civic space ahead of the election.
Amnesty International urged prompt, independent investigations into Hadi’s killing and the subsequent violence, including the burning of newspaper offices and harassment of journalists.
Demonstrations continued on Friday in the Shahbagh area of the capital, where crowds demanded justice for Hadi and accountability for the attacks. A mob stormed the Dhaka office of Udichi Shilpigosthi, Bangladesh’s premier progressive cultural organisation.
The violence has spread beyond the capital. In Chittagong, protesters attacked the Indian Assistant High Commission, reflecting growing anti-India sentiment since Hasina fled to New Delhi after her ouster.
Her party, the Awami League, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could derail the vote.</p><small>2025-12-20 11:23</small></div><hr>
