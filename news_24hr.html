The Green Shirts will face India next on Sunday — the arch-rivals will clash in a geopolitically-charged contest in Dubai. It will be the first cricket match between the sides since four days of military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Player of the match Mohammad Haris top-scored with 66 of 43 deliveries after being sent at his preferred position of one down for a change after a string of failures down the order in the tri-series.
Oman restricted the Pakistani batters to 160-7 after the Green Shirts were 85-1 at the halfway mark of the first innings.
However, their batting reply fell apart against the quality of the Pakistani bowling attack — getting bowled out for a paltry 67 on a typical Dubai wicket.
Speaking after the match, skipper Salman Ali Agha said: “With the bat we still need to work [to improve], but the bowling was outstanding — I’m very happy with them as a bowling unit.”
Talking about the next match against India, Salman said that his side has playing good cricket and if they execute their plans they can beat any team.
 






Speaking at the post-match presser, Haris said the pitch played better than the Sharjah pitch as the ball spun less.
“I worked with the batting coach on my game, and am continuing to work on my calmness while batting and how to tackle spin,” he said.
Saim Ayub was the first to fall for the Green Team in the first innings when pacer Shah Faisal trapped him lbw on the third ball of the innings — the opening pair failing to get a good start again.
Opener Sahibzada Farhan was given a reprieve in the very next over when he was dropped at point off the bowling of left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed.
Haris went after spinner Aamir Kaleem in his very first over — taking 16 off the 6th over with two boundaries and a six as Pakistan ended the powerplay at 47-1.
Haris’s 50 came up with a huge six over the midwicket boundary off the bowling of Sufyan Mehmood — taking 32 deliveries to reach his second 50-plus score in T20Is.
Pakistan were 85-1 at the halfway mark of the innings, with both Haris and Farhan set at the crease on a pitch that did not spin prodigiously across both innings.
 






However, Kaleem got a chance at redemption when he caught Farhan in the very next over off his bowling — after dropping him earlier in the innings when he had scored only 2.
The left-arm spinner continued on his redemption arc as he got the well-set Haris and skipper Salman off consecutive deliveries in the 13th over.
Haris got bowled while attempting a switch hit off Kaleem, while Salman hit a full toss straight to deep mid-wicket — the Pakistani skipper getting out for a golden duck.
Kaleem ended with figures of 3-31 and was ably supported by his fellow left-arm spinner Ahmed — who conceded just 17 runs of his quota of 4 overs.
The duo kept the Pakistani batters in check through the middle overs after the loss of Salman’s wicket.
Hassan Nawaz was the next man to fall for the Green Shirts as he got caught at the cover boundary off a slower ball by the Dir-born Faisal.
Player of the match in their win against Afghanistan — Mohammad Nawaz brought the momentum back to the Green Shirts’ innings — hitting 3 boundaries in the first five balls that he faced.
However, Oman’s bowlers did not let the match get away from their hands — keeping Pakistan from getting a huge total in the first innings.
Oman’s chase unravels
Oman lost their first wicket courtesy a carrom ball by Saim after he bowled the opposition captain Jatinder Singh in the second over of the innings.
After scoring multiple boundaries off Shaheen Afridi’s second over — first innings hero Kaleem got out lbw trying to sweep Saim in the 4th over.
Oman managed to reach 40-2 at the end of the powerplay, but after losing Mohammad Nadeem to what was essentially a bouncer by left-arm leg-spinner Sufyan Moqeem — their innings unravelled — getting bowled for 67 in 16.4 overs.
The Pakistan bowlers shared the wickets with Sufyan, Saim and Faheem picking up two wickets each.
 


Captain Salman, speaking at the toss, had said: “The team has been playing good cricket for the last two to three months and we will look to continue that form.”
There were no changes in the playing eleven from the team that won against Afghanistan.
The Green Shirts were clear favourites going into this encounter against Oman, who are ranked 20th in the International Cricket Council T20I rankings and last played competitive T20I matches more than six months ago in February — when they lost thrice in a row to the USA.
White-ball head coach Mike Hesson dismissed concerns about the national squad’s batting performance on Thursday ahead of the upcoming clash with India.
Questioned during a pre-match press conference in Dubai about the team’s batting performance and judgement, Hesson said he was “not quite sure” where the concerns were arising from, saying the team had played against the “best wrist spin attack” in the world and won by over 70 runs against Afghanistan in the tri-series final.
The eight-nation T20 tournament began on Tuesday with Afghanistan beating Hong Kong by 94 runs. India crushed the hosts, the UAE, by nine wickets on Wednesday.
Pakistan, India, Oman and UAE are in Group A, while Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Bangladesh form Group B.
The top two teams from each Group will qualify for the Super Four stage.
The top two teams will then play the September 28 final in Dubai.

So, Pakistan fans, don’t get too excited. I hope most of you won’t, since, traditionally, this team keeps finding new ways to disappoint us.
With the emotions now set aside, let’s “objectively” look into what Pakistan came up with in their Asia Cup opener at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday.
The boys in green, as expected from them, swept aside the Omanis with utter disdain, continuing the pattern of big sides staying unchallenged by the minnows in the tournament.
Like the good old days, the Pakistan bowlers starred. It was a display of what turned out to be unplayable spin bowling for Oman on a slow, sluggish, sticky surface — on which Pakistan failed to consistently put bat on ball as well, but more on that later.
Spin-stars
Pakistan are ripe with spin resources. They may not be the best in the Asia Cup with Afghanistan and India boasting the services of some proven pros, but they showed they are getting there with a top show against Oman.
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha put so-called part-timer Saim Ayub into the attack right away, and his sly “mystery” spin stuck into the surface, deviated and left the Oman top-order bamboozled, adding weight to Saim’s claim into Pakistan’s XI despite his inconsistency with that bat.
 






With Oman openers Aamir Kaleem and Jatinder Singh trapped lbw and cleaned up respectively by Saim, Salman had three more proper spin options.
He called in Sufyan Moqeem — the left-arm wrist-spinner, having consolidated his place in the side at least for the matches taking place on slow surfaces.
 
 

But Sufyan didn’t rely on a typical slow delivery to get his first wicket, bouncing out Mohammad Nadeem with a surprise short-ball, reminding us all of former Pakistan star Shahid Afridi.
Sufyan’s second hunt was purely Salman’s brilliance at slip; the skipper chewing a chewing gum, composed as ever, acting as if nothing happened after having dived to his left to take a blinder to dismiss a well-set Hammad Mirza.
In between both dismissals, Pakistan’s “best spinner in the world” according to head coach Mike Hesson, Mohammad Nawaz continued his top form after making his comeback in the side, chipping in with Sufiyan Mehmood’s wicket.
On a wicket like this, the fast bowlers had to go untested, but the pace pairing of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Faheem Ashraf accounted for three wickets.
Haris fireworks
While Pakistan were destructive with the ball, they were far from impressive with the bat. It can be argued that the pitch didn’t support batters as much. But again, it was just Oman.
Their start was horrendous; Saim falling on the first ball, going across the line of the ball for an audacious attempt to hit it out of the park. Backed for his potential impact, the left-hander — no matter how highly-rated — is struggling with the consistency part of his game. Saim averages less than 25 in the last 15 outings, since Hesson took charge of the team.
What Saim lacked, however, was somehow made up by another batter under the press; Mohammad Haris. The flamboyant right-hander from Peshawar has been a subject of debate since he first showed up in the Pakistan colours for his perceived “irresponsible” approach. He was pushed down to number six in the recent tri-series, which Salman said was a “sacrifice”.
Batting struggles
But Haris, in his preferred number three position, bounced back with a blistering half-century and a man-of-the-match award. He did not smash every ball for his 43-ball 66.
The 24-year-old’s seven fours were mainly about manoeuvring the gaps with brilliance, while his strong slog-sweep was incredibly effective for his three sixes.
At one point, it looked like the batters on the other end — Sahibzada Farhan and Fakhar Zaman — were doing their best to help Haris post a big score, but that seemed to slow Pakistan down, and the pressure that heaped upon the batters came into play later on.
After Haris played Aamir Kaleem onto his stumps attempting a rash reverse-sweep, Salman fell on a dolly before Fakhar and the incoming Hasan Nawaz added to Pakistan’s dot-balls, more than 30 of them.
The pair failed to go hard against the Oman bowlers, raising concerns over Pakistan’s prospects against a stronger attack of archrivals India, whom they face on Sunday. Fakhar being asked to bat at number four was also an interesting decision by the Pakistan management after the experienced pro was brought back to the opening spot in the recent series.
Nawaz’s form with the bat was evident down the order, the left-hander putting the pitch out of the question and finding gaps brilliantly for his 19 off 10.
On to India
While Pakistan crushed Oman by a huge 93-run margin, they would still need to up their game for the India clash.
To be played in Dubai again, India will arrive for the high-octane clash with the likes of spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakarvarty, the kind of quality Pakistan would require a special show against.
The bowlers, too, would have to prove that they can be as good against the T20 World Champions as they were against Oman.</p><small>2025-09-12 19:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12234508fdc9d7b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941489/imran-bushras-legal-team-approaches-un-special-rapporteur-on-torture-for-help-in-halting-ill-treatment' target='_blank'><strong>Imran, Bushra’s legal team approaches UN special rapporteur on torture for help in halting ‘ill treatment’</strong></a><br><p>The legal team of PTI founder Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi has approached United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Dr Alice J Edwards to urge the Pakistani government to cease the alleged mistreatment of the couple.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady.
Earlier this week, the party announced moving a petition before the Supreme Court regarding her health. In a statement, PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram claimed that prison authorities were obstructing Bushra Bibi’s treatment despite her deteriorating health in defiance of court orders.
Last month, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking Imran’s monthly medical examinations from Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital. It cited concerns over possible health complications for the 72-year-old founder of the party, who has reportedly lost weight during his detention.
In a post on X today, PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari said two formal urgent appeals were submitted to the UN special rapporteur on torture on Imran’s behalf by his sons — Sulaiman Khan and Kasim Khan — and on Bushra Bibi’s behalf by her sister.
 






A press release by international law firm Perseus Strategies said: “The filings request her to investigate their cases and press the Pakistani government to cease any further torture or ill-treatment of Mr and Mrs Khan immediately.”
 
 

It said the couple’s international legal team had previously secured a judgment from the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UWGAD), finding Imran’s detention arbitrary, in violation of international law, politically motivated and calling for his immediate release.
“Both appeals detail a pattern of severe abuses in detention, including prolonged solitary confinement, physical abuse, denial of medical care, contaminated food and the persistent denial of access to legal counsel and family that together amount to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
“The filings emphasise that these acts violate Pakistan’s obligations under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and they urge the special rapporteur to act swiftly to protect the physical and mental integrity of Mr and Mrs Khan,” the press release said.
It pointed out that Imran now faced a “cumulative 14-year prison sentence on fabricated charges”.
It added that despite the UNWGAD’s finding that his detention was arbitrary and intended to bar him from political life, Imran remained imprisoned under “inhuman conditions”.
 
 

“Mr Khan is currently confined at Adiala Jail in a tiny isolation cell with no natural light, an open toilet under 24-hour CCTV surveillance, and has endured severe sleep deprivation, extreme heat due to power cuts, grossly inadequate food and water, and other harsh conditions. He is also held at times in solitary confinement for 22 hours or more a day with no access to exercise or meaningful human contact.
“Mrs Khan, the former first lady of Pakistan, has likewise been targeted with politically motivated charges and sentenced to seven years in prison. Since her detention in 2024, she has been subjected to conditions of detention that amount to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, including being served food contaminated with hydrochloric acid, confinement in unsanitary and insect-infested cells, denial of medical care and long periods of isolation. Her imprisonment is part of a campaign to break both her and her husband, and to apply psychological pressure on Imran Khan by targeting his wife.”
The press release quoted Jared Genser, international counsel to the couple, as saying that neither of them should be in prison in the first place, “let alone be subjected to torture and ill treatment”.
He further said: “This combination of illegal detention and horrific mistreatment is intolerable under international law, and the United Nations and governments worldwide must act now to protect their rights and secure their release.”
 
 

The law firm said that Imran had received “international recognition for the abuses he is facing while imprisoned”, saying that Amnesty International had warned of health risks given his age and conditions, and the US State Department had publicly stressed the importance of ensuring his safety in custody.
The firm said the UN special rapporteur on torture reported to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and had the authority to intervene when credible allegations of torture were presented, adding that the mandate included communicating with governments to demand they respect the right to physical and mental integrity of detainees, conducting fact-finding visits and submitting reports to both the UNHRC and the UN General Assembly.
“The United Nations has already found Imran Khan’s detention to be arbitrary and Mrs Khan’s imprisonment rests on equally spurious charges.
“Their continued solitary confinement, denial of adequate medical care and exposure to contaminated food all violate Pakistan’s binding obligations under international law. The government of Pakistan should take immediate steps to release Mr and Mrs Khan and improve the conditions of detention for all those still detained,” the press release quoted Jacob Bogart, international counsel to the couple, as saying.
The law firm said that the continued “arbitrary detention” of Imran and Bushra Bibi “threatens to deepen social and political divisions at a time when Pakistan faces a myriad internal and external challenges”. It argued that their release was “imperative not only because of the grave injustices they face, but for the sake of Pakistan’s stability and democratic progress”.
The firm pleaded that the UN should not turn away from the case and “should instead stand with Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi and democracy in Pakistan”.
The press release also quoted Bukhari as saying that in the filing the urgent appeals, “we are making clear that Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are not forgotten.
“They are enduring unlawful imprisonment and degrading treatment, but they remain symbols of courage and peaceful resistance. The world must not look away — silence only emboldens those who seek to crush democracy in Pakistan.”
Separately, Kasim said his father was in prison because “he stood up for democracy”.
Reiterating his previous concerns about his father’s state, he said Imran was “held in solitary confinement, denied access to his doctors and restricted from meeting his lawyers and family.
“At the same time, members of his family and thousands of his supporters have been abducted or dragged before military courts. This is not justice — it is political revenge.
“Pakistan’s democracy is at stake, and I call on all who believe in human rights and democracy to stand with us so that the people’s voice is heard and the rule of law is restored.”

The text was adopted by 142 votes in favour, 10 against — including Israel and key ally the United States — and 12 abstentions. It rebukes Hamas and demands that it surrender its weapons.
 






Although Israel has criticised UN bodies for nearly two years over their failure to rebuke Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023, the declaration, presented by France and Saudi Arabia, leaves no ambiguity.
Formally called the New York Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution, the text states that “Hamas must free all hostages” and that the UN General Assembly (UNGA) condemns “the attacks committed by Hamas against civilians on October 7”.
It also calls for “collective action to end the war in Gaza, to achieve a just, peaceful and lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the effective implementation of the two-state solution”.
The declaration, which was already endorsed by the Arab League and co-signed in July by 17 UN member states, including several Arab countries, also goes further than rebuking Hamas, seeking to fully excise it from a role in Gaza.
“In the context of ending the war in Gaza, Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with international engagement and support, in line with the objective of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State,” the declaration states.
 
 

The vote precedes an upcoming UN summit co-chaired by Riyadh and Paris on September 22 in New York, in which French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to formally recognise the Palestinian state.
‘Shield’ against criticism
“The fact that the General Assembly is finally backing a text that condemns Hamas directly is significant” even if “Israelis will say it is far too little, far too late”, Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group, told AFP.
“Now at least states supporting the Palestinians can rebuff Israeli accusations that they implicitly condone Hamas,” he said, adding that it “offers a shield against Israeli criticism”.
In addition to Macron, several other leaders have announced their intent to formally recognise the Palestinian state during the UN summit.
The gestures are seen as a means of increasing pressure on Israel to end the fighting in Gaza.
The New York Declaration includes discussion of a “deployment of a temporary international stabilisation mission” to the battered region under the mandate of the UN Security Council, aiming to support the Palestinian civilian population and facilitate security responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority.
Around three-quarters of the 193 UN member states recognise the Palestinian state proclaimed in 1988 by the exiled Palestinian leadership.
However, after two years of fighting have ravaged the Gaza Strip, in addition to expanded Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the stated desire by Israeli officials to annex the territory, fears have been growing that the existence of an independent Palestinian state will soon become impossible.
Israel’s devastating retaliatory offensive has killed at least 64,656 Palestinians, most of them civilians. Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by its offensive with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.
“We are going to fulfil our promise that there will be no Palestinian state,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Thursday.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, meanwhile, may be prevented from visiting New York for the UN summit after US authorities said they would deny him a visa.</p><small>2025-09-12 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12220519afa0ff9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941449/nepal-ex-chief-justice-sushila-karki-becomes-pm-after-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Nepal ex-chief justice Sushila Karki becomes PM after protests</strong></a><br><p>Nepal’s former chief justice Sushila Karki was sworn in on Friday to lead the transition as the country’s next prime minister after deadly anti-corruption protests ousted the government.
The 73-year-old Karki, Nepal’s first woman chief justice, was sworn into office by President Ram Chandra Paudel, after the previous prime minister quit on Tuesday as parliament was set ablaze.
“Congratulations! We wish you success, wish the country success,” Paudel said to Karki after the small ceremony in the presidential palace, attended by diplomats and some former leaders.
The Himalayan nation of 30 million people was plunged into chaos this week after security forces tried to crush rallies by young anti-corruption protesters.
At least 51 people were killed in the worst violence since the end of a civil war and the abolition of the monarchy in 2008.
The military took back control of the streets on Wednesday, enforcing a curfew.
The appointment of the judge, known for her independence, comes after two days of intense negotiations by army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel and Paudel, including with representatives from “Gen Z”, the loose umbrella title of the youth protest movement.
Thousands of young activists had used the online app Discord to debate the next steps — and name Karki as their choice of next leader.
Karki, dressed in a red sari dress, took the oath but did not make a further speech. She smiled and bowed with her hands pressed together repeatedly in traditional greetings.
“It is a moment of victory … finally, the power vacuum has ended,” said Amrita Ban, a Gen Z protester.
“We did it,” key youth protest group Hami Nepal posted on Instagram, calling for unity.
“Honour the lives of those who sacrificed themselves for this moment”.

Presidential press adviser Kiran Pokharel told AFP that “a council of ministers will be formed after, and other processes will be taken from there”.
Known for her insistence on integrity, the 73-year-old has often spoken about the need for transparency and independence in a judiciary frequently under intense political pressure.
Karki emerged as the leading candidate by many “Gen Z” representatives — the loose umbrella title of the protest movement.
She told Nepali media that the Gen Z protesters had told her that “they believe in me” to lead for “a short time for the purpose of doing elections”.
“She is a credible choice to lead the interim government,” Anil Kumar Sinha, a former justice of the supreme court who worked with Karki, told AFP.
“Her integrity has never been in doubt, and she is not someone who can be intimidated or easily influenced. She is courageous and not swayed by pressure.”
‘In favour of youth’
In a speech broadcast on Nepali media earlier this year, she spoke of ingrained corruption.
“We see it everywhere but we don’t speak — now we need the youth to speak up, take the lead and stand in elections,” she said.
“What I have seen in the last 35 years does not work, I am 100 per cent in favour of youth coming forward.”
Her tenure as chief justice, from 2016 to 2017, was brief but significant — challenging gender stereotypes and facing down politicians over corruption.
Karki came of age in a society where women rarely entered the legal profession.
Born in 1952 in Biratnagar, an industrial town in eastern Nepal, she earned degrees in political science in India and in law in Kathmandu.
She began her career as a lawyer in 1979, and quickly gained a reputation as a fearless advocate, often taking up cases others avoided.
Defiant
In 2012, Karki was one of two presiding Supreme Court judges who jailed a serving government minister for corruption — a first at the time for Nepal in its battle against a culture of graft.
In 2017, the government tried to impeach her as chief justice after she overturned its choice for chief of police.
The United Nations called the impeachment “politically motivated” and the move was blocked. She stepped down from the post at her retirement.
Nepal emerged from a brutal decade-long Maoist insurgency in 2006, and in 2008, the end of the country’s 240-year-old Hindu monarchy.
The transformation to a federal state was marred by political infighting and successive governments have dragged their feet on bringing perpetrators of abuses committed during the civil war to justice.
But it was under Karki’s watch as chief justice that a court in 2017 sentenced three soldiers to 20 years in jail for the murder of a teenage girl, at the time only the second conviction for crimes committed during the war.
She will be Nepal’s first woman prime minister, but not its first woman leader — Bidya Devi Bhandari held the largely ceremonial role of president for two terms from 2015 to 2023.
‘Make a better Nepal’
The army patrolled the largely quiet streets of the capital, Kathmandu, for a third day today after the protests and nationwide chaos that included a mass breakout of prisoners.
“I was very afraid and stayed locked inside my home with family and didn’t leave,” said Naveen Kumar Das, a painter-decorator in his mid-40s. He was among many ordinary residents of Kathmandu who took advantage of a brief lifting of the curfew in the morning to stock up on supplies.
Food stores, tea stalls and pharmacies bustled with customers after people spent days inside.
“It was a really tense time and we just stayed indoors,” said Laxmi Thapa, 32, on a motorbike as her husband filled its fuel tank. “We came out as things have improved.”
At least 21 protesters were among those killed, mainly on Monday during a police crackdown on demonstrations against corruption and poor governance that was sparked by a ban on social media.
Protesters set the parliament, major government buildings and a Hilton Hotel on fire on Tuesday. KP Sharma Oli, 73, resigned as prime minister, and the army then took charge of the streets.
Nepal’s army said today that it had recovered more than 100 guns looted in the uprising, during which protesters were seen brandishing automatic rifles.
More than 12,500 prisoners who escaped from jails across the country during the chaos “are still at large”, police spokesman Binod Ghimire told AFP.

Protests fed into longstanding economic woes in Nepal, where more than two-fifths of people are aged between 16 and 40. A fifth of people aged 15-24 are unemployed, according to the World Bank, with GDP per capita just $1,447.
Discussions are still heated among Gen Z ranks as they seek a radical political transition. James Karki, 24, who was among the protesters, said he was hopeful for change.
“We started this movement so we could make a better Nepal,” he said. “And I am positive that the army will listen.“</p><small>2025-09-12 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12215000c9807f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941482/brazils-bolsonaro-sentenced-to-27-years-after-landmark-coup-plot-conviction' target='_blank'><strong>Brazil’s Bolsonaro sentenced to 27 years after landmark coup plot conviction</strong></a><br><p>Former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced on Thursday to 27 years and three months in prison, hours after being convicted of plotting a coup to remain in power after losing the 2022 election, dealing a powerful rebuke to one of the world’s most prominent far-right populist leaders.
The conviction ruling by a panel of five justices on Brazil’s supreme court, who also agreed on the sentence, made the 70-year-old Bolsonaro the first former president in the country’s history to be convicted for attacking democracy, and drew disapproval from the Trump administration.
“This criminal case is almost a meeting between Brazil and its past, its present and its future,” Justice Carmen Lucia said before her vote to convict Bolsonaro, referring to a history checkered with military coups and attempts to overthrow democracy.
There was ample evidence that Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, acted “with the purpose of eroding democracy and institutions”, she added.
Four of the five judges voted to convict the former president of five crimes: taking part in an armed criminal organisation, attempting to violently abolish democracy, organising a coup and damaging government property and protected cultural assets.
The conviction of Bolsonaro, a former army captain who never hid his admiration for the military dictatorship that killed hundreds of Brazilians between 1964 and 1985, follows legal condemnations for other far-right leaders this year, including France’s Marine Le Pen and the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte.
It may further enrage Bolsonaro’s close ally, United States President Donald Trump, who had called the case a “witch hunt” and, in retaliation, hit Brazil with tariff hikes, sanctions against the presiding judge, and the revocation of visas for most of the high court justices.
Asked about the conviction on Thursday, Trump again praised Bolsonaro, calling the verdict “a terrible thing”. “I think it’s very bad for Brazil,” he added.
As he watched his father’s conviction from the US, Brazilian Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro told Reuters he expected Trump to consider imposing further sanctions on Brazil and its high court justices.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X that the court had “unjustly ruled”, adding, “The United States will respond accordingly to this witch hunt.”
 






Brazil’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling Rubio’s comment a threat that “attacks Brazilian authority and ignores the facts and the compelling evidence in the records”. The ministry said that Brazilian democracy would not be intimidated by the US.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also said he does not fear new sanctions from the US in an interview to local TV channel Band, hours before Bolsonaro’s conviction was confirmed.
The verdict was not unanimous, with Justice Luiz Fux on Wednesday breaking with his peers by acquitting the former president of all charges and questioning the court’s jurisdiction.
That single vote could open a path to challenges to the ruling, which could push the trial’s conclusion closer to the October 2026 presidential election. Bolsonaro has repeatedly said he will be a candidate in that election despite being barred from running for office.
Bolsonaro’s lawyers said in a statement that the sentencing was absurdly excessive and that they would file the appropriate appeals.
From the back benches to the presidency
The conviction of Bolsonaro marks the nadir in his trajectory from the back benches of Congress to his forging of a powerful conservative coalition that tested the limits of the country’s young democratic institutions.
His political journey began in the 1980s on the Rio de Janeiro city council after a brief career as an army paratrooper. He went on to serve nearly three decades as a congressman in Brasilia, where he quickly became known for his defence of authoritarian-era policies.
In one interview, he argued that Brazil would only change “on the day that we break out in civil war here and do the job that the military regime didn’t do: killing 30,000”.
Long dismissed as a fringe player, he later refined his message to play up anti-corruption and pro-family values themes.
He found fertile ground as mass protests erupted across Brazil in 2014 and 2015 amid the sprawling “Car Wash” graft scandal that implicated hundreds of politicians, including President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose own conviction was later annulled.
Anti-establishment anger opened the path for his successful 2018 presidential run, with dozens of far-right and conservative lawmakers elected on his coattails. They have reshaped Congress into an enduring obstacle to Lula’s progressive agenda.
Bolsonaro’s presidency was marked by intense scepticism of vaccines during the pandemic and an embrace of illegal mining and cattle ranching in the Amazon rainforest, where deforestation climbed.
As he faced a tough reelection campaign against Lula in 2022 — which Lula went on to win — Bolsonaro’s comments took on an increasingly messianic quality, raising concerns about his willingness to accept the results.
“I have three alternatives for my future: being arrested, killed or victory,” he said, in remarks to a meeting of evangelical leaders in 2021. “No man on Earth will threaten me.”
In 2023, Brazil’s electoral court barred him from public office until 2030 for venting unfounded claims about Brazil’s electronic voting system.
Lula’s Institutional Relations Minister Gleisi Hoffmann said that Bolsonaro’s conviction “ensures that no one dares again to attack the rule of law or the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box”.
Protecting democracy
Bolsonaro’s conviction and its durability will be a powerful test for the strategy that Brazil’s highest-ranking judges have adopted to protect the country’s democracy against what they describe as dangerous attacks by the far-right.
Their targets have included social media platforms they accused of spreading disinformation about the electoral system, as well as politicians and activists who have attacked the court. Sending the former president and his allies to jail for planning a coup reflects a culmination of that polarising strategy.
The cases have largely been led by the commanding figure of Justice Alexandre de Moraes, appointed to the court by a conservative president in 2017, whose hardball approach to Bolsonaro and his allies has been celebrated by the left and denounced by the right as political persecution.
“They want to get me out of the political game next year,” Bolsonaro told Reuters in a recent interview, referring to the 2026 election in which Lula is likely to seek a fourth term. “Without me in the race, Lula could beat anyone.”
The historic significance of the case goes beyond the former president and his movement, said Carlos Fico, a historian who studies Brazil’s military at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
The supreme court also ruled to convict seven of Bolsonaro’s allies, including five military officers.
The verdict marks the first time since Brazil became a republic almost 140 years ago that military officials have been punished for attempting to overthrow democracy.
“The trial is a wake-up call for the armed forces,” Fico said. “They must be realising that something has changed, given that there was never any punishment before, and now there is.”</p><small>2025-09-12 17:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623387-karachi-needs-at-least-15000-buses-to-meet-daily-demand' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi needs 'at least 15,000 buses' to meet daily demand</strong></a><br><p>

“We got him,” Cox told reporters.
The suspect, identified as Tyler Robinson, had confessed to a family friend or “implied that he had committed the murder” to that friend and that person in turn had contacted the Washington County sheriff’s office on Thursday.
A family member interviewed by investigators said Robinson had become more political recently and spoke in a disparaging manner about Kirk, Cox told reporters. Robinson was taken into custody on Thursday night, about 33 hours after Kirk’s murder, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel said at the press conference.
Kirk, a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was killed by a single bullet as he spoke onstage at an outdoor amphitheatre at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.
Previously, US investigators said they had found the bolt-action rifle believed to have been used to kill Kirk and released images of a person of interest.
Investigators spoke to Robinson’s roommate, who showed them comments Robinson had made on Discord, a chat and streaming platform popular with gamers, discussing retrieving a rifle from a drop point and then leaving the rifle in a bush wrapped in a towel. This matched the description of the gun that authorities recovered after the shooting in a wooded area near campus.
Ammunition found at the scene had been inscribed, Cox said.

The messages on the casing included: “What’s this”; “Oh, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Ciao”; “If you read this, you are gay, LMAO” and “Hey fascist, catch!” Cox told reporters.
Trump earlier said that authorities had captured the suspect.
“I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody,” Trump said on Fox News programme ‘Fox and Friends’. “Everybody did a great job; we worked with the local police, the governor.”
The president claimed that the suspect was turned in “by somebody very close to him”, noting that the authorities had “very good pictures but not great, not perfect”.
“Somebody very close to him said, ‘Oh, it’s him’,” Trump said. “Essentially, they went to a US marshal, and the person involved was involved with law enforcement and a person of faith. The father convinced the son, ‘This is it’.”
 






Additionally, Trump backed a call by Cox to give the suspect the death penalty if the suspect is found guilty.
“This trial will start in two, three, [or] four years. In certain places that do it differently, they have what’s called ‘quick trial’. You have a fast trial and fast verdict,” the president said.
  @dawn.today A suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk at a Utah university has been taken into custody, US President Donald Trump said on Friday, ending an intense manhunt that followed what Trump described as a "heinous assassination." Kirk's killer had eluded police and federal agents for more than 24 hours after Wednesday's shooting, in which a sniper fired a single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, during an appearance at Utah Valley University in Orem. "I think we have him," Trump told the "Fox and Friends" show in an interview, adding that a person who knows the suspect had turned him in. "I think with a high degree of certainty we have him in custody." Via Reuters #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com  
“If he’s guilty, we’ll need to keep him, feed him, take care of him … like for 50 years,” Trump added. “In Utah you have the death penalty. The governor … is very intent on the death penalty in this case, and he should be.”
The father-of-two used his audiences on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube to build support for anti-immigration policies, outspoken Christianity and gun ownership, and to spread carefully edited clips of his interactions during debates at his many college events, according to AFP.
Kirk, a well-connected activist, author and podcast host, helped build support for Trump and the Republican Party among younger voters.
Kirk was the co-founder and president of the conservative student group Turning Point USA and appeared at Utah Valley on Wednesday as part of a planned 15-event “American Comeback Tour” of US college campuses. His killing stirred outrage and denunciations of political violence from Democrats, Republicans and foreign governments.
Kirk had 5.2 million followers on X and hosted a popular podcast and radio programme, ‘The Charlie Kirk Show’.
Additionally, US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau warned on Thursday that Washington may take action against foreigners “praising, rationalising, or making light” of Kirk’s killing, adding he had directed consular officials to take appropriate action.
“In light of yesterday’s horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Landau said in a post on social media platform X.
“I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalising, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.”

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the IBO was carried out on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Fitna al Hindustan.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” said the ISPR.
The statement added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the dead terrorists, who remained actively involved in terrorist activities in the area.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the ISPR said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi commended the security forces for the successful operation.
“Pakistan’s security forces thwarted the nefarious designs of Indian-backed terrorists,” he wrote on X. “I pay tribute to the security forces for their successful operation against Indian-sponsored terrorists.”
 






A day prior, security forces killed 19 terrorists in three separate operations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to an ISPR statement.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.</p><small>2025-09-12 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623374-four-terrorists-belonging-to-indian-proxy-neutralised-in-mastung' target='_blank'><strong>Four terrorists belonging to Indian proxy neutralised in Mastung</strong></a><br><p>

On Thursday, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”.
Today, he provided a clarification regarding the matter, saying that his words were presented “out of context”.
During the hearing of a case on a plea filed by a citizen named Abdul Jabbar — who sought the removal of his name from the Exit Control List — Justice Dogar addressed the matter, saying that Mazari was “just like a daughter” to him, and he was only explaining things to her yesterday.
“Being the chief justice and an elder, I was trying to make her understand.”
He went on to say that his remarks were presented out of context and “a storm brewed up”.
The IHC CJ maintained that during his exchange with Mazari, he had told her that she could disagree with his decisions, but she should have avoided making her criticism personal.
At one point, he reiterated: “I was explaining to her just as (I would) to a child, but she was not understanding. She was repeatedly mentioning fundamental rights. Does this court not have any fundamental rights?”
Moreover, it has been reported that during yesterday’s exchange, Justice Dogar also addressed Mazari’s husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying: “Hadi sahib, make her understand; if I get hold of her someday …”
However, he clarified today that he did not say anything along the lines of “getting hold of” Mazari.
“I did not say that I will get hold of her, [but] this [reported remark] is being circulated since yesterday. Hadi sahib was standing [there], so I asked him to take her away or I would initiate contempt of court proceedings.”
Later, Chattha maintained in a post on X that the judge had in fact made the reported remarks.
 






He accused the judge of lying and misconduct before referring to Justice’s Dogar remarks from today’s hearing.
The IHC CJ said during today’s hearing that in case of contempt of court proceedings, Mazari’s career would suffer.
Reacting to that, Chattha said Justice Dogar was “not eligible to hold judicial office” and that he had held “the entire high court hostage”.
Mazari’s response
Mazari, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, posted on X after yesterday’s hearing that “it is important for CJ IHC to understand that I am not activist Imaan Mazari in his court, I am a lawyer holding a brief for my client and conduct myself according to professional etiquette (and a court should do the same).”
She added that her client’s case “should not suffer because of any grievances a judge may have with her lawyer over the right to freedom of expression in a personal capacity”.
Following Justice Dogar’s clarification today, she again criticised him on X for making “sexist” remarks and accused him of harassing her.
“First, the chief justice misbehaved, harassed me at my workplace and threatened me openly in the court … Today again, he is passing sexist remarks.”
She asserted that she was neither his daughter nor a child. “I am a professional lawyer”.
 






Lawyers condemn
Multiple lawyers’ bodies also issued condemnatory statements today, with the  Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) demanding the removal of Justice Dogar from his post.
In a press release — which Mazari shared on X, thanking the association — the LHCBA said the body’s president, vice president and secretary “strongly condemn” Justice Dogar’s exchange with Mazari.
 






The statement said that lawyers were “officer[s] of the court” and their respect and dignity was to be prioritised just as those of respected judges who were working within the bounds of law and the Constitution.
It added that Justice Dogar’s “dictatorial behaviour is a gross violation of the judge’s code of conduct and it is immensely important to keep any such judge away from court proceedings”.
The LHCBA urged the Supreme Judicial Council — the highest forum responsible for disciplinary proceedings against judges of the superior judiciary — to remove Justice Dogar from his post.
The Karachi Bar Association (KBA) also issued a statement saying that it “strongly condemns the highly inappropriate conduct” of Justice Dogar.
“The association notes with deep concern that instead of maintaining judicial dignity and impartiality, the chief justice resorted to derogatory remarks and threats of contempt proceedings against the counsel. Such behaviour undermines the sanctity of judicial forums, intimidates members of the bar and is contrary to principles of justice,” the statement read.
It emphasised that lawyers had the right to represent their clients “without fear or harassment, and any attempt to suppress this right cannot be tolerated”.
Expressing solidarity with Mazari, the KBA urged the Judicial Commission of Pakistan, Supreme Court and Pakistan Bar Council to take notice of the incident.
“The judiciary must remain above personal remarks and coercive conduct; respect between bar and bench must always be mutual to protect the integrity of our justice system,” the KBA stressed.
 






The Balochistan Bar Council also issued a similar statement as the KBA, calling on the SJC to dismiss Justice Dogar from his post.
 






Separately, a group of female lawyers also became signatories to a condemnation of Justice Dogar’s remarks, terming them “sexist, threatening and unbecoming of a judge”.
The condemnatory statement said Justice Dogar’s remarks “reflect a deeply patriarchal attitude, and the threats are a source of concern. The purpose of contempt laws is to uphold the administration of justice, not for judges to hold a sword over the head of lawyers”.

A statement issued today from the President’s Secretariat said that he was received by Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong and Sichaun Vice Governor Huang Ruixue on arrival at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to China Khalil Hashmi and Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong were also present to welcome President Zardari.
“During the visit, the president will hold meetings with the Chinese leadership and senior officials to further strengthen Pakistan-China relations, enhance cooperation in diverse fields and advance shared objectives under the All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership,” the statement said.
 






The Foreign Office (FO) had earlier said the president would visit Chengdu, Shanghai and Xinjiang to hold meetings with the provincial leadership.
It said the discussions would encompass bilateral relations, with a particular focus on economic and trade cooperation, CPEC and future connectivity initiatives. The two sides would also exchange views on bilateral cooperation at multilateral fora.
The FO said the visit underscored the tradition of high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China, reflecting the deep commitment of the two countries to strengthen their relations.</p><small>2025-09-12 12:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12154649f8d61fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941458/pakistan-to-host-next-sco-summit-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to host next SCO summit: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday announced that Pakistan will host the next Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, stating that authorities need to start preparing.
This development comes less than a fortnight after the SCO Summit in Tianjin, China, where Pakistan raised the issue of the Indus Waters Treaty and a joint declaration was issued condemning the attacks on the Jaffar Express, Khuzdar and Pahalgam.
Addressing a ceremony in Islamabad, the PM made the announcement and stated that authorities had to start preparing for the incoming dignitaries.
He did not give a date for the summit.
“We have to start preparing now,” the PM said.“ We need to build accommodation and beautify Islamabad. Tajikistan gave us saplings as a gift. Chairman CDA (Capital Development Authority) and his team are working day and night [to plant them].“
 


Pakistan last hosted the SCO in 2024 for the Council of Heads of Government Summit, where PM Shehbaz called for investing in the region’s collective capacity for connectivity.
A three-day holiday was declared for the summit, which was held amid tight security. Many businesses and routes in the federal capital and its twin city, Rawalpindi were closed due to safety concerns.
Foundation stone for T-Chowk flyover laid
The ceremony was held to mark the laying of the foundation stone of the T-Chowk flyover, which aims to provide relief to the citizens of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and the surrounding area.
“We have laid the foundation stone of this project, which will be a milestone for traffic,” the PM said. “This one-kilometre flyover will give the residents of Islamabad and Rawalpindi relief.”
Lauding the efforts of the interior minister and CDA, who conceived the project, the PM congratulated them on the occasion.
“This will serve the public interest greatly,” he said. “We need to set new benchmarks for work, quality and adherence to timelines. There must be no compromise on quality.”
PM Shehbaz added that the railways and interior ministries are working on a rail project which will connect Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
“I was informed by Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi that there will be another form of transport to serve the public interest in the form of a rail car which connects Islamabad and Rawalpindi,” he stated.
“We already have the metro, and we started a bus service. The CDA introduced EVs,” the PM added. “Once we get the railcar going and set up a track, this project can greatly benefit the citizens of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, as well as commuters from surrounding areas.”
The prime minister urged the relevant authorities to start work on the rail project as soon as possible and said that he would sit down and discuss the project with them.
“Whatever you need from the federal government, will will try to accommodate you.”</p><small>2025-09-12 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12163125718ad73.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941262/fact-check-viral-image-of-flood-victims-is-not-from-2025-punjab-floods' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral image of flood victims is not from 2025 Punjab floods</strong></a><br><p>Multiple users on X, including PTI supporters, shared on Thursday a photo of children lying on top of wooden sticks surrounded by water, claiming that they were flood victims in Punjab. However, the image is at least five years old.
Pakistan was hit by massive floods in August this year, which have claimed over 842 lives, displaced 1.2 million people, affected more than 4m, mainly in Punjab, and threatened economic losses between $6–10 billion thus far.
Currently, South Punjab is in the throes of the devastating flood crisis, with districts such as Multan, Bahawalpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan inundated, leaving millions of residents affected and 1,400 villages submerged under 5–10 feet of water.
On Thursday, a photo showing two children lying on a pile of sticks and debris surrounded by what looked like floodwater was shared by a verified X account, which seemed to be of a PPP supporter from previous posts.
The caption of the post said: “You should have seen us during our prosperous times. We had our own homes and loved ones.” It was coupled with the hashtags ‘Saraiki Lives Matter’, ‘Saraiki Waseb Flood’ and ‘Save Saraiki Waseb’.
Saraiki is the language mainly spoken in South Punjab.
While the post gathered 1,313 views, the photo quickly began circulating on social media.
Youtuber and former anchorperson Imran Riaz Khan also shared it with a broken heart emoji. His post amassed about 66,000 views and was reshared over 2,000 times.
The photo was also shared by other social media users, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here and here, racking up more than 17,000 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the floods and their damage.
A reverse image search yielded the image used in a Daily Jang report dated Sept 7, 2020, with the following headline: “Rain and flood disasters: 667,000 people homeless, 14 dead, 4,800 villages submerged in Umarkot”.
Umarkot is a city in Sindh, and the story detailed the destruction that was wrought there in the catastrophic floods of 2020.
The image was also found used in an August 26, 2022, news story by state broadcaster Radio Pakistan, titled: “Federal cabinet members, Pak Army Officers donate one month’s salary to flood relief fund”.
However, neither of the news reports shared a caption with the photo describing where it was from or provided any other detail, such as the source or the photographer who took it.
The image was also reshared on social media platforms X, Instagram, TikTok and Facebook during the 2020 and 2022 floods, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here and here.
It was also shared last month, when floods wreaked havoc in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit Baltistan, with social media users claiming that the visuals showed scenes from the regions as can be seen here, here and here.
The actual location and occurrence of the image thus could not be conclusively determined, while users in the comments variably claimed it was from Sindh, Punjab and Afghanistan.
However, the fact that a media outlet shared the image in 2020 conclusively shows that it is not from the 2025 floods.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral image shows victims in Punjab from the recent floods is false. The photo has been shared multiple times over the years pertaining to the various floods in Pakistan and is at least as old as 2020, when it was shared by a media outlet in relation to Sindh.

The FIA is a border control agency which plays an important role in preventing illegal immigration and human trafficking. Its crackdown on human smugglers intensified following the capsizing of a boat carrying illegal immigrants near Greece in December last year.
During a visit to the FIA Headquarters in Islamabad, the delegation was welcomed by FIA Additional Director General Jan Muhammad and received a “comprehensive” briefing on Pakistan’s border management practices.
The head of the Iraqi delegation “reaffirmed Iraq’s commitment to further strengthening cooperation between the border management agencies of both countries,” the press release noted.
 






The briefing included an overview of FIA’s mandate and the work of FIA’s specialised units. “At the Risk Analysis Unit (RAU), the director [of] immigration explained how intelligence-led risk management is being applied to identify and mitigate threats at Pakistan’s borders,” it read.
The delegation visited the forensic laboratory, where the “lab’s crucial role in verifying travel documents, detecting forgery, and supporting litigation in travel-related offences” was highlighted. It also visited the Islamabad International Airport to “witness first-hand the enhancements made under FIA’s next-generation border control systems”.
The delegation was given a detailed briefing on the role of FIA Academy in the capacity building of its personnel and on the operations of the Second Line Border Control in detecting fraudulent travel documents and supporting front-line officers.
The visit was facilitated by the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) under the framework of a Danish-funded Rights-Based Border Management project, the press release said.
Earlier this week, the FIA arrested 14 suspects, inc­luding four Iranian nationals, in Balochistan during separate operations targeting human smuggling networks.
In January, 65 FIA officials were blacklisted for posting at any immigration checkpost and anti-human trafficking circles in the country after an inquiry into the Greece boat tragedy.</p><small>2025-09-12 11:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12150104ef4f372.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941453/mdcat-postponed-amid-floods-in-punjab-revised-date-issued' target='_blank'><strong>MDCAT postponed amid floods in Punjab, revised date issued</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) has postponed the upcoming Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT) due to the ongoing floods in the country, the Ministry of Health said on Friday.
The decision comes as the country is facing catastrophic floods, which have inundated thousands of villages and displaced millions in Punjab, with flood water now expected to move downstream towards Sindh.
According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Health, “After holding discussions with relevant representatives from all four provinces, AJK (Azad Jammu and Kashmir) and Gilgit-Baltistan, on the instructions of Health Minister Mustafa Kamal, the PMDC has revised the exam date to October 26 (Sunday).”
The PMDC is the national statutory organisation responsible for regulating the standards of medical and dental education throughout the country.
The decision was taken in light of the “difficulties faced by students in the affected areas,“ the statement read.
The exam was previously scheduled to be held on October 5.
The “decision is in the larger interest of the students,” the statement quoted Health Minister Mustafa Kamal as saying.
“The government is committed to providing equal educational opportunities to every student in the country,” he added.
The exam, which in previous years has been marred by delays, is the entry requirement for admission to medical and dental colleges across Pakistan.
Each year, approximately 200,000 candidates take the MDCAT.
This year, the exam will conducted in the following universities across the country: University of Health Sciences, Lahore in Punjab; Sukkur IBA University, Sukkur for Sindh; Khyber Medical University, Peshawar for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; Bolan University of Medical and Health Sciences, Quetta for Balochistan; and Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University, Islamabad for Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan as well as PMDC’s international venue in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-09-12 10:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623328-why-us-should-shift-focus-from-india-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Why US should shift focus from India to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

The sharp exchange took place at an emergency UNSC meeting convened under the agenda item ‘Situation in the Middle East’. The session had been requested by Algeria, Pakistan, and Somalia and was supported by France and the United Kingdom.
Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, opened his address at the UNSC with a strong condemnation of Israel’s strike, calling it a “brazen and illegal assault” and a violation of Qatar’s sovereignty.
“The brazen and illegal assault is not an isolated incident, rather it is part of a broader and consistent pattern of aggression and violation of international law by Israel that undermines regional peace and stability.”
Ahmad further highlighted that the “Israeli strikes targeted a residential neighbourhood, deliberately endangering civilians, and thus, also constitute a grave breach of the International Humanitarian Law.”
He described the attack as a direct challenge to diplomacy, as it targeted Qatar at a time when delicate negotiations on a Gaza peace deal were reportedly progressing toward a possible breakthrough.
“Striking the territory of a principal mediator and those directly involved in negotiations is a deliberate attempt to sabotage diplomacy, derail peace efforts, and prolong the suffering of civilians,” he said.
Ahmad reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with Qatar, highlighting the recent visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to Doha as a demonstration of Islamabad’s support for the security and sovereignty of the Gulf nation.
“The visit underscores Pakistan’s unwavering support for the security and sovereignty of Qatar and its commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East,” he said.
He condemned Israel’s attack as a flagrant violation of the UN Charter, particularly Article 2(4), which prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.
 


Ahmad warned that the attack was consistent with Israel’s long record of cross-border military actions in Gaza, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, and Yemen, describing it as “yet another manifestation of [Israel’s] systematic disregard for international law, and its brazen policy of destabilising the region.”
Reading from the Security Council statement adopted earlier in the day, Ahmad highlighted the unanimous condemnation of the strikes in Doha, noting that members had expressed deep regret at the loss of civilian life, underscored the importance of de-escalation, and affirmed support for Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The statement also stressed the vital role Qatar continues to play in mediation efforts alongside Egypt and the United States for a ceasefire in Gaza, and called for the release of hostages and the end of the conflict in Gaza.
For his part, Israel’s ambassador initially addressed the UNSC by invoking the US raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan to justify the strike in Doha.
“When bin Laden was eliminated in Pakistan, the question asked was not why target a terrorist on foreign soil. The question was why was a terrorist given shelter at all. The same question must be asked today. There’s no immunity for bin Laden and there can be no immunity for Hamas,” he said.
At that, Pakistan immediately exercised its right of reply with Ambassador Ahmad rejecting the analogy as “unacceptable, indeed ludicrous” and accusing Israel of attempting to deflect attention from its own “illegal actions and violations of international law“.
“It [Israel] is an occupier, a serial violator of the UN Charter and international law, that threatens the international community, humanitarian organisations, and even the United Nations itself — and does so with impunity,” Ahmad said. “Despite being the aggressor, it pretends to be the victim. But today, it stands fully exposed.”
Ahmad also emphasised Pakistan’s frontline role in counterterrorism.
“The international community is well aware of Pakistan’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. Al Qaeda was largely decimated due to Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts, and we remain committed to this collective endeavor,” he said, reinforcing that Islamabad’s position was based on facts and international law.
Following Pakistan’s response, the Israeli ambassador returned to the floor, accusing Pakistan and others of applying double standards.
“Maybe he was offended by my words and I apologise for that, but I make sure my speeches stick to facts. And the fact is Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan, and no one condemned the US for that. When other countries attack terrorists, no one condemns them either,” he said.
He added: “You cannot change the fact that 9/11 happened, and you cannot change the fact that Osama bin Laden was in Pakistan and was killed on your territory. When you criticise us — and I’m sure you will continue — think about the standards you apply to your country and the standards you apply to Israel.”
‘We will not be deterred by those who call for war’
Assistant Secretary General for the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific, Mohamed Khaled Khiari, also briefed the Council while Qatar’s prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, participated under Rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
In his address under Rule 37, Qatar’s prime minister strongly denounced the Israeli attack in Doha. He said the attack targeted a residential compound allocated for negotiating teams, housing Hamas representatives and their families, and terrorised residents.

“It is a violation of the UN Member State’s sovereignty,” he said. “Israel – led by bloodthirsty extremists – has gone beyond any borders, any limitation when it comes to behaviour among states and individuals. Have you heard of any state that is attacking the mediator this way? A state that is attacking the negotiating teams that are hosted by Qatar?”
Al-Thani criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s justification of the attack, contrasting it against the Taliban’s political bureau in Doha, which facilitated the US-Taliban talks that ended the war in Afghanistan.
“The United States has never targeted the negotiators.”
He warned that Israel’s actions were destabilising the region and undermining prospects for peace.
“We call for peace, not war, and we will not be deterred by those who call for war and destruction,” he concluded.
The Security Council also heard from Rosemary DiCarlo, the under secretary general for political and peace building affairs at the UN, who described the strike in Doha as an “alarming escalation” that violated Qatar’s sovereignty and endangered the ongoing ceasefire and hostage negotiations with respect to the Gaza invasion.
 
 

She detailed that the airstrike targeted a residential area housing Hamas’ political leadership, killing several affiliates along with a Qatari security officer.
“The sovereignty and territorial integrity of any country, including Qatar — a valued partner in advancing peacemaking and conflict resolution — must be respected,” DiCarlo told the ambassadors. Israel, she noted, claimed responsibility, with PM Netanyahu describing it as “a wholly independent operation” following a deadly attack on civilians in Jerusalem on Monday, which Hamas said it carried out.
She also noted that Qatar, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the League of Arab States, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had all condemned the action and expressed concern over further escalation, underlining the widespread international alarm over the strike.
China’s representative also highlighted the Israeli attack’s impact on ongoing diplomacy, recalling that the US had proposed a ceasefire on September 7, which Israel reportedly agreed to. Just two days later, a Hamas delegation discussing the proposal was struck by Israel. “Such an act of bad faith, irresponsibility and a deliberate sabotage of negotiations is indeed despicable,” he said, expressing concern that the attack could escalate tensions further in the region.
Other major powers also weighed in.
The US underscored that unilateral bombing inside Qatar did not serve the interests of Israel or Washington, while reaffirming support for ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and hostage negotiations. France condemned Israel’s strikes as a violation of the international law and stressed the need for a political solution based on a two-State framework. The UK described the attacks as counterproductive to peace and Israel’s long-term security. Algeria and Somalia criticised Israel’s aggression and urged the Security Council to take action to prevent further destabilisation.
An illustration of deep divisions
The debate illustrated deep divisions within the Security Council over the Doha strike, with Pakistan leading the charge in condemning Israel and defending the principles of international law. Ahmad repeatedly underscored the link between Israel’s ongoing occupation of Palestinian territories and recurring crises in the region, stating that durable peace could only be achieved through a comprehensive political settlement, including an end to the occupation.
Observers noted that Pakistan’s approach combined strong condemnation with legal and diplomatic reasoning, highlighting both the humanitarian consequences of the strikes and the broader threat to regional stability. Ahmad also emphasised that attacks on Qatar, a principal mediator in Gaza negotiations, constituted not just a violation of sovereignty but an attack on diplomacy itself.
By the end of the session, the UNSC collectively reaffirmed the importance of mediation, the release of hostages, and the need for a political solution to the Gaza conflict. However, the exchanges between Pakistan and Israel, coupled with Qatar and China’s condemnations, highlighted persistent tensions over accountability, the interpretation of international law, and perceived double standards in responses to acts of state violence.
The Doha strike and the ensuing Security Council debate have raised critical questions about the effectiveness of international mechanisms in restraining unilateral military actions, protecting mediators, and ensuring civilian safety in conflict zones.
For Pakistan, the session provided a platform to assert its principled stance on international law, uphold Qatar’s mediation role, and highlight the importance of accountability for actions that threaten regional peace and security.
As the Council moves forward, the debate over Israel’s actions in Doha is likely to influence broader Middle East diplomacy, the role of mediators, and the balance between counter-terrorism operations and international legal norms.
Pakistan’s leadership in condemning the strike, combined with interventions from other Council members, demonstrates the continuing relevance of multilateral forums in addressing complex conflicts, even amid disagreement among major powers.</p><small>2025-09-12 08:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623308-cjp-bars-justice-mansoor-from-yale-conference-trip' target='_blank'><strong>CJP Afridi bars Justice Mansoor from Yale conference trip</strong></a><br><p>

The country was placed on Wada’s watchlist in September 2024 over outstanding non-conformities to the agency’s updated anti-doping code.
According to the spokesperson, WADA confirmed that the compliance procedure against Pakistan’s Anti-Doping Organisation (Adop) was closed after all pending corrective actions were completed.
“A follow-up confirmation from Wada in September reiterated that Pakistan was no longer under enhanced monitoring, ending speculation over possible sanctions,” the statement said.
PSB Deputy Director General (DG) Shahid Islam was informed of the decision by Wada via email, the PSB spokesperson told Dawn.com.
The statement also said that corrective measures were put under PSB DG Yasir Pirzada’s leadership, including policy alignment and procedural reforms, ensuring that Pakistan met the stringent global standards in time.
“This is not just a bureaucratic victory; it is a lifeline for Pakistani athletes and sports federations,” Pirzada was quoted as saying.
“For a country preparing to showcase itself on major sporting platforms, this clearance from Wada marks a vital step forward,” the statement added.
It also highlighted that the failure to meet critical anti-doping requirements by January would trigger automatic non-compliance, which “could have barred Pakistani athletes from competing under the national flag and risked international isolation in sport”.
Last year, Wada placed seven national anti-doping organisations on a watchlist, giving them four more months “to correct outstanding non-conformities” to a new anti-doping code. The countries included Namibia, Pakistan, Panama, Samoa, Senegal, Uganda and Uruguay.
In May, the body’s president Witold Banka pushed back against what he called the growing politicisation of efforts to stem the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. “The politicisation of anti-doping is something which is very concerning,” he said.
“We see more and more attempts to politicise the anti-doping environment. There is no place for politics or turf wars in the fight for clean sport,” he added.</p><small>2025-09-12 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12124422662bbf0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941436/france-deploys-three-rafale-fighter-jets-to-help-protect-polish-airspace-macron-says' target='_blank'><strong>France deploys three Rafale fighter jets to help protect Polish airspace, Macron says</strong></a><br><p>France will deploy three Rafale fighter jets to help Poland protect its airspace after this week’s drone incursions into its airspace, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday on X.
“The security of the European continent is our top priority. We will not give in to Russia’s increasing intimidation,” he said.
 






A French military official said the warplanes had already been deployed to Poland prior to Tuesday’s incursions.
On Tuesday, Poland said it had scrambled aircraft alongside allies to shoot down “hostile objects” violating its airspace during a Russian attack on neighbouring Ukraine, a first for a NATO country during the war.
The incursion came as Russia unleashed a barrage of strikes across Ukraine, including in the western city of Lviv, around 50 miles (80 kilometres) from the Polish border.
Responding to the accusation, Russia’s foreign ministry claimed that its drones had carried out a major attack on military facilities in western Ukraine but stressed that there were no plans to hit any targets in Poland.
Subsequently, Poland — a NATO member, invoked the Western defence alliance’s Article 4 for urgent talks in reaction to the violation.
Under Article 4, any member can call urgent talks when it feels its “territorial integrity, political independence or security” are at risk.
Poland’s European partners in NATO have backed the country, with the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Sweden each summoning their Russian ambassadors on Thursday to protest.
Germany announced it would expand its role in a Nato mission to defend Polish airspace.
Meanwhile, the UN Security Council has called an emergency meeting today to discuss violations of Poland’s airspace.
Stray Russian drones and missiles have entered the airspace of Nato members, including Poland, several times since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Last month, Warsaw said a Russian military drone flew into its airspace and exploded in farmland in eastern Poland, calling the incident a “provocation”.
Poland in 2023 said a Russian missile had crossed into its airspace to strike Ukraine. And in November 2022, two civilians were killed when a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile fell on a village near the border.</p><small>2025-09-12 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623295-pakistan-will-have-to-adapt-to-floods-as-the-new-normal' target='_blank'><strong>'Pakistan will have to adapt to floods as the new normal'</strong></a><br><p>

“In light of yesterday’s horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Landau said in a post on social media platform X.
“I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalising, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.”
 






Landau did not elaborate on what such action would mean.
Some users replied to Landau’s post with screenshots of accounts and posts, though it was unclear if the accounts they flagged were US visa holders.
The State Department’s number two then replied to some of those comments, saying he would direct consular officials to monitor the comments on the post, which as of Thursday afternoon had over 2,000 replies.
A State Department spokesperson, asked about Landau’s post, said: “This Administration does not believe that the United States should grant visas to persons whose presence in our country does not align with US national security interests.”
But the spokesperson did not address questions on whether anybody had been identified to have their visa revoked or how consular officials would evaluate those flagged in response to Landau’s post.
Kirk, a 31-year-old author, podcast host and close ally of US President Donald Trump, helped build the Republican Party’s support among younger voters.
He was killed on Wednesday by a single gunshot as he gave a talk at a university in Utah in what President Donald Trump called a “heinous assassination.”
The Trump administration has pursued a sweeping crackdown on immigration, including increasing social media vetting and revoking thousands of student visas and aiming to tighten the duration of others.</p><small>2025-09-12 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623288-at-unsc-pakistan-condemns-israels-reckless-attack-on-qatar' target='_blank'><strong>'Broader, consistent pattern of aggression': Pakistan assails Israel on Qatar strikes at UN</strong></a><br><p>

One suspect is currently in custody, while another of his alleged accomplices have been identified and efforts are underway to arrest him, DIG South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.
The suspect, a fruit vendor, was apprehended by Defence police from Qayyumabad with the help of locals, the officer said.
Investigations are underway, and police are said to have obtained video evidence of multiple incidents of sexual assault against minor boys and girls. Although it is too early to say just how many victims the suspects have assaulted, investigators think they could number over a hundred.
“Police have recovered a mobile phone from his custody containing hundreds of videos filmed in his room that show graphic scenes involving children,” DIG Raza said, adding that he was being interrogated further.

DIG South says efforts underway to track down his accomplices; scores of videos unearthed from phone, USB drive suggest suspect had been preying on children for years

According to police, the suspect came to Qayyumabad in 2016 and started luring and trapping children around 2019. He first opened a grocery shop, and then a juice cart.
When asked how he managed to keep his activities clandestine for such a long period of time, DIG Raza also expressed surprise, saying that the matter came to the authorities’ attention after one of his alleged victims managed to obtain a USB drive from the suspect.
The victim then took the USB to a video shop for the purpose of downloading music onto it, but the shop owner detected the presence of explicit content on the drive and informed area residents, who apprehended the suspect and beat him up before handing him over to the police.
“A USB and the mobile phone are in police custody which contain many such videos,” said the DIG.
Police then approached the parents of the victims, who came to the police station and lodged three FIRs against the suspect. A special team — led by DSP Defence Dr Saifullah — has been set up to investigate the case. The committee also includes the Defence SHO, SIO Defence, and the SIO Women Police Station.
“The team shall make hectic efforts into the cases by utilising all available resources and shall submit reports on a daily basis,” according to a police order.
The FIRs, registered on the complaint of the father of a couple of victims, states that the two girls, aged 10 and 12, had been upset for some days and complained about pain in their body. When quizzed by their mother, they revealed that the suspect had sexually assaulted them.
Another complainant, a labourer, has filed a case on behalf of his 10-year-old sister, who also complained of pain after the suspect took her to his residence on Sept 4, and assaulted her. The act was also filmed, according to the FIR.
A third complainant said that his seven-year old daughter had been silent for one week and also complained of pain.

LOWER DIR / PESH­AWAR: At least seven Frontier Corps (FC) personnel were martyred and 13 others injured during a search and strike operation against militants in the Sar Banda area of Maidan in Lower Dir on Thursday.
According to official sources, one FC soldier was also reported missing after a fierce gun battle with militants in the mountainous terrain within the jurisdiction of Lal Qila police station. The militants had taken positions and opened fire on a security convoy.
The wounded were shifted to Lal Qila Hospital, and later referred to District Headquarters Hospital Timergara.
Police officials said a heavy contingent of pol­ice, Elite Force and Dir Scouts remained in the area as the operation continued.
Security forces also claimed to have inflicted “significant losses” on the militants, though no details were immediately provided.
Lal Qila was once a stronghold of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Nifaz-i-Shariat-i-Muhammadi (TNSM), led by Maulana Sufi Muhammad.
His son-in-law, Mullah Fazlullah, became the head of the banned Teh­reek-i-Taliban Pakis­tan (TTP) and fled to Afghanistan during the 2009 military offensive in Malakand. He was later killed in an air strike in Afghanistan.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for the successful operations. In their statements, both leaders lauded the bravery and professionalism of the troops in eliminating 19 militants, APP reported.
“Pakistan is determined to eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorism,” President Zardari said, reaffirming the nation’s resolve to completely eradicate terrorism and praying for the safety and success of the security forces. PM Shehbaz also commended the security forces for successful operations in Mohmand, North Waziristan and Bannu, reiterating that the war against terrorism would continue until its complete elimination from the country.
Police post
Separately, militants launched a late-night assault on the Lajbook police post. Police sources said personnel deployed there repelled the attack after several hours of firing, forcing the militants to retreat. No casualties were reported.
In another development, the Lower Dir district administration imposed Section 144 on Thursday, banning the flying of drones, quadcopters and balloons across the district. Deputy Comm­issioner Mohammad Arif Khan directed assistant commissioners and police officials to ensure strict enforcement, warning that violators would face legal action.
19 militants killed
At least 19 militants were killed in three separate encounters with security forces across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.
“On 9-10 Sept, nineteen Khawarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khawarij were sent to hell in three separate engagements in KP” the ISPR said in a statement.
According to the statement, 14 militants were killed after troops engaged their hideout in an intense exchange of fire in the Guluno area of Mohmand district.
Another operation in Datta Khel, North Waziristan, left four more militants dead, while a separate encounter in Bannu resulted in the killing of one militant.
Weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain fighters, who, the ISPR said, had been involved in numerous attacks in the region. Troops were carrying out sanitisation operations to clear the area of remaining militants.
The ISPR reiterated that security forces were committed to wiping out “the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism” from the country.
Meanwhile, tribal elders of the Toji Khel tribe in South Waziristan resolved in a meeting on Sept 9 not to allow militants to operate from their soil. They warned militants to leave the area or face exile.
The elders also announced strict penalties, including demolition of houses and a fine of Rs2 million, against anyone found facilitating militants with food, shelter or other assistance.

• Panjnad crosses 668,000 cusecs; mass evacuations underway in Alipur
• Guddu, Sukkur barrages record over 400,000 cusecs, remain in ‘medium flood’

LAHORE: Punjab is facing a relentless flood emergency as the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers continue to swell, inundating thousands of villages and displacing millions across the province.
The situation intensified after Indian authorities issued alerts regarding rising water levels at Ganda Singh Wala and Ferozepur two days ago, prompting renewed evacuations along the Sutlej River.
Despite some areas witnessing a slight recession in water levels, the overall flood threat remains severe, with rescue and relief operations stretched across multiple districts.
At Panjnad Headworks on the Chenab River, water discharge surged to an exceptionally high level, crossing 668,000 cusecs. Between Wednesday morning and early Thursday, the flow increased by 100,000 cusecs, triggering mass evacuations in Alipur tehsil.
 
 

In a late night development, a protective dyke near the city of Shujabad collapsed for a second time, inundating communities along the river bank.
The downstream pressure has also impacted Sindh’s Guddu and Sukkur barrages, which continue to record medium flood levels with flows exceeding 400,000 cusecs.
In Rahim Yar Khan, authorities reported 660,000 cusecs passing through Chachran Sharif, though no immediate threat to localities was identified.
According to the Flood Fore­casting Division (FFD) data, Pan­jnad witnessed outflows of over 668,000 cusecs, with a steady trend, while Guddu and Sukkur barrages had a flow of over 400,000 cusecs.
On the other hand, flood levels in Punjab rivers receded further, with Ganda Singh Wala on the Sutlej River near the Indian border in a “medium” flood.
PDMA River Flows report relea­sed at 6:30pm revealed that on the Chenab River, Marala Headworks was steady at 68,986 cusecs, Khanki Headworks was rising at 82,411 cusecs, and Qadirabad Headworks was steady at 84,440 cusecs.
At Chiniot Bridge, the flow was rising at 57,463 cusecs, while the Rivaz Bridge gauge level was steady at 518 feet.
At Trimmu Headworks, the flow was steady at 140,007 cusecs. The Head Muhammad Wala gauge was falling at 412.38 feet, the Sher Shah Bridge level was steady at 393.20 feet and Panjnad Headworks was flowing extremely heavy at 658,845 cusecs.
On the Ravi River, conditions were steady at all locations: Jassar was reporting 19,500 cusecs, Ravi Syphon 32,120 cusecs, Shahdara 31,682 cusecs, Balloki Headworks 59,580 cusecs, and Sidhnai Headworks 75,549 cusecs.
On the Sutlej River, flows were predominantly steady: Ganda Singh Wala was at 98,165 cusecs, and Sulemanki Headworks was at 121,459 cusecs. An exception was Islam Headworks, where the flow was falling at 113,956 cusecs, while the Mailsi Syphon was steady at 120,150 cusecs.
For the Indus River upstream of Guddu, the Chachran Bridge gauge was steady at 298.25 feet, and the Guddu Barrage flow was steady at 506,433 cusecs.
Tragedies, displacement
In Bahawalnagar, two people drowned after a Rescue 1122 boat carrying 23 evacuees capsized. In Jalalpur Pirwala, another rescue bo­­­­at carrying 25 people overturned, leaving five, including children, missing. In Muzaf­fargarh, three teenagers fell into floodwaters near Basti Jarah; one died and two were rescued.
Authorities reported thousands fleeing their homes in Seetpur, Khairpur and Bait Nabi Shah in Muzaffargarh, as well as in Jalalpur Pirwala, where 706,000 people across 148 mou­­zas have been affected. In Khanewal, 159,029 people were evacuated from riverbeds, while 128,658 acres of crops were submerged.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said more than 4,500 villages and 4.287 million people have been affected by floods across the province, with 2.262m relocated.
He said 396 relief camps, 490 medical camps and 412 veterinary camps have been set up, while 1.696m animals have been shifted to safer areas. A total of 79 people have lost their lives in the floods, he added.
Rescue, relief efforts
Punjab Emergency Service Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer said over 13,600 people were rescued in the past three days in Multan alone, with more than 25,000 relocated. Across the province, more than 362,000 people have been evacuated using 139 rescue boats.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said four helicopters and 2,000 tents have been deployed to Jalalpur Pirwala, where reli­­ef distribution continues with army support.
Rahim Yar Khan Deputy Commissioner Khurrum Parvaiz told Dawn that water levels were rising downstream of Panjnad, prompting evacuation operations in the riverbed areas of Khanpur and Liaquatpur. He said around 12,000 people had been evacuated, six relief camps established and 1,800 tents distributed among flood-affected families.
The deputy commissioner added that all dy­­k­­es in the district were intact, with 660,000 cu­­secs passing through Chachran Sharif, and as­sured there was no threat to nearby localities.
 
 

Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had ord­ered the removal of the Assistant Commis­sioner of Jalalpur Pirwala over negligence after a rescue boat capsized. She added that water levels at Muhammad Wala and Sher Shah bridges had fallen below critical levels, ruling out immediate breaching of dykes.
Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman visited Panjnad Headworks, where he was briefed on inflows and discharges. Officials confirmed that evacuation of low-lying areas was ongoing, with all embankments under constant monitoring.
Meanwhile, officials said Mangla Dam is 90 per cent full, Tarbela 100pc, India’s Bhakra 90pc, Pong 99pc and Thein 97pc, increasing downstream pressure.
Balochistan rains
NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik said on Thursday that Pakistan was facing the final monsoon spell of this season, adding that during the past two days, the floodwater heading south was “losing steam”, Dawn.com reported.
“The water in our rivers came in two layers,” he explained. “The first is hitting Guddu Barrage, the other is at Panjnad. Based on this information, we expect that it will stabilise in the next two to three days.”
Several areas of Balochistan have been lashed by torrential monsoon rains over the past two days, triggering flash floods and prompting the PDMA to issue an alert on Thursday. District administrations have been directed to take urgent measures to protect residents from possible devastation.
Officials said seasonal rivers and streams were already carrying heavy rainwater, with the risk of severe flooding if showers continued in the catchment areas.
At Hub Dam, water levels rose rapidly to 338 feet, just one foot short of its full capacity of 339 feet. A senior Irrigation Department official said the spillways could be opened at any time, and people living along the Hub Riv­er had been warned to move to safer locations.
Meanwhile, the Balochistan government has completed arrangements along the left bank of the Indus River in anticipation of floodwaters expected to arrive from Punjab’s Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers within the next few days.
Rescue teams, boats and heavy machinery have been deployed in the border areas of Nasirabad division, including Nasirabad, Usta Muhammad, Sohbatpur and Jaffarabad.
“For the past week, rescue staff and equipment have been positioned along the Sindh-Balochistan border,” an official said.
Balochistan Irrigation Minister Sadiq Um­­rani told the provincial assembly that preparations were in place to shift people from vulnerable areas to safety. He added that an understanding had been reached with the Sindh government that no embankments would be deliberately breached if water reached dangerous levels. “If over 1.1 million cusecs flow through the Indus, the chief ministers of both provinces will decide further action,” he said.
Balochistan PDMA Director General Jahanzeb Khan said 16 flood control centres had been set up across four districts of Nasirabad division, operating round the clock. Rescue and relief arrangements, including provision of essential goods, had been finalised to assist displaced families.

“It flows unconditionally from the solemnisation of a valid marriage and constitutes a binding legal duty,” observed Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in his decision on an appeal by Ambreen Akram. She had challenged the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) verdict of April 28, 2015, which turned down her plea for maintenance because the marriage was not consummated.
“In essence, the only legitimate ground for suspending this obligation (maintenance) arises where the husband discharges a high burden of proof to establish that his wife has wholly and without justification withdrawn from marital relationship, not merely as physical access but encompassing the full spectrum of emotional, residential and relational life,” Justice Shah explained in his 15-page judgement.

Justice Shah says claim to maintenance takes effect with solemnisation of marriage; criticises LHC observations as ‘deeply patriarchal’

“Absent such proof, the obligation to provide maintenance persists,” Justice Shah emphasised.
Two fundamental questions
The judgement observed that the case raises two fundamental questions at the intersection of Islamic law, constitutional rights and social realities: When does a Muslim woman become entitled to maintenance within a marriage?
And, under what circumstances, may a man be excused from his marital obligation to pay maintenance to his wife?
 
 

At stake is not merely the contemporary interpretation of Islamic law but the very meaning of marriage (Nikah) and marital relationship, the scope of financial independence of a woman within marriage and the Constitution’s promise to uphold the dignity, privacy and equality of an individual, the protection of the family and participation of women in all spheres of life, the judgement explained.
The case pertains to Ambreen Akram’s marriage to  Asadullah Khan in Nov 2012. Despite a valid Nikahnama, Asad­ullah delayed Rukhsati for over a year.
So Ambreen Akram filed for maintenance in Oct 2013.
Claim upheld
A family court in Faisalabad upheld her claim, awarding an amount of Rs3000 per month as maintenance with effect from the date of marriage. The amount was later raised by Faisalabad’s District Court to Rs5000.
Asadullah Khan divorced his wife on May 2, 2014. But the LHC reversed the decision, citing lack of consummation.
The Supreme Court observed in its judgement that Asadullah Khan had failed to provide a marital abode, made no arrangements for rukhsati and did not fulfil his basic obligations under the marital contract.
There is no factual or legal basis to invoke an exception to the husband’s obligation of maintenance, Justice Shah observed.
 
 

“No credible evidence has led to suggest that the petitioner wilfully withdrew from the marital relationship or refused cohabitation without valid cause,” the apex court judge said.
The wife’s inability to cohabit due to husband’s own failure to facilitate Rukhsati does not defeat her claim to maintenance, the judgement explained.
Hence Ambreen Akram cannot be penalised for non-consummation as it resulted from her husband’s own inaction, Justice Shah said.
“To suggest otherwise would allow men to weaponise the absence of consummation, often caused by their own neglect, as a means to escape financial responsibility, thereby trapping women in marriages devoid of rights and dignity,” the judgement cautioned.
The Supreme Court held that the petitioner’s right to maintenance took effect with the solemnisation of marriage and continued as long as the bond lasted.
Considering that the divorce took place during the pendency of the litigation, the maintenance period will continue till the period of Iddat, the judgement added.
“The denial of maintenance in the light of husband’s default and in the absence of any fault on part of the wife, was contrary to law and accordingly set aside,” Justice Shah observed.
In his judgement, Justice Shah went on to say that a reading of Islamic jurisprudence, statutory enactments, constitutional protections and judicial precedents affirm that a woman’s right to maintenance was neither contingent upon consummation or rukhsati, nor subject to discretion of her husband.
This understanding not only gives effect to the egalitarian spirit of Islamic law but also reinforces constitutional commitment to dignity (Article 14), equality (Article 25), and protection of the family unit (Article 35).
“In a patriarchal society where economic dependence often fuels systemic injustice, the right to maintenance must be safeguarded as an essential constitutional, legal and ethical entitlement.
“Any attempt to curtail it must therefore be subjected to strictest constitutional and jurisprudential scrutiny, the judgement emphasised.
The Supreme Court set aside the LHC judgement by holding that Ambreen Akram’s entitlement to maintenance of Rs5000 per month began on the date the marriage was solemnised. It will include maintenance for the period of Iddat.
Concern over LHC verdict  In his concluding remarks, Justice Man­soor Ali Shah noted with concern the language used in the LHC judgement.
The High Court verdict stated: “Maintenance allowance is the right of wife after consummation of marriage and after crossing the barrier, it becomes the responsibility of the husband to maintain his wife.”
Justice Shah criticised the observations as “deeply patriarchal”.
These expressions cast women as passive recipients in marriage rather than equal partners, undermining their legal and constitutional status, the judge said.

A series of posts shared on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account on Thursday, which were supposedly based on his conversation with his sisters in Adiala Jail, recalled that the former ruling ANP had become unpopular in the province due to its support for such military action.
Although Mr Khan does not have access to his X account while in prison, it is not clear who operates it in his stead.
“Killing one’s own always leads to an increase in terrorism,” the post on the ex-PM’s official account said.
The message instructed all members of provincial and national assemblies and the Senate who are from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa “to come together and resist these  operations and drone strikes against our own people, and to work for  peace so that issues can be resolved through dialogue”.
Continuing his mantra of favouring negotiations over kinetic action, he also regretted the forcible expulsion of Afghans from the country. “These measures must stop immediately, otherwise the situation will deteriorate further.”
 






Mr Khan also expressed indignation over the attacks on his wife and sisters, saying that they had no role in politics.
“Aleema Khan only conveys my message, while the campaign against her reflects the regime’s fear. Bushra Begum has never interfered in political decisions and is suffering solitary confinement only because she is my wife.”
 






The PTI founder also criticised the “sham trials” that, in his words, are being used to snatch parliamentary seats. He pointed out that senior leader Ejaz Chaudhry’s seat was “unlawfully” awarded to Rana Sanaullah.
On the occasion of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s death anniversary, Mr Khan also paid tribute to Pakistan’s founding father, reaffirming his party’s resolve to continue its struggle for democratic rights.
