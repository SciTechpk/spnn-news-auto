Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the PICSS.
Pakistan also ranked second in March in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
According to a press release issued by PICSS today, the number of militant attacks fell by 22 per cent — from 105 in March to 82 in April — while fatalities and injuries declined by 63pc and 49pc, respectively.
It said that security forces intensified counterterrorism actions, killing at least 203 militants in various operations, making the majority (73pc) of the total fatalities in April.
“Only two civilians and two security personnel were killed in these operations,” the press release said.
“A total of 287 people were killed in April due to militant violence and security operations, down from 335 in March,” it said, adding that injuries dropped from 271 to 139.
Notably, the share of militant deaths rose, accounting for 203 out of 287 total fatalities — over 70pc, it said, adding that civilian and security force casualties remained minimal, with 30 and 32 fatalities, respectively.
It said that April marked the lowest monthly death toll among security forces since June 2024, while civilian deaths also dropped significantly, underscoring improved operational precision and threat containment.
According to the press release, PICSS attributed these improvements to proactive intelligence-led operations and enhanced border vigilance.
It said that the most consequential development of the month was a two-phase military operation near the Pak-Afghan border that targeted a large group of infiltrating militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
At least 71 militants were killed, making it the biggest loss suffered by the group in a single operation to date, it said.
Intelligence assessments suggest that the TTP attempted mass infiltration, miscalculating that Pakistani forces might be distracted by heightened tensions along the eastern border with India, it added.
 
 

It said that a disturbing trend identified by PICSS in April was the targeted killing of 13 members of local peace committees (razakars) — a community-based defence initiative that has historically resisted militant infiltration.
The resurgence of attacks on these volunteers, particularly in the tribal districts, suggests that groups like the TTP are attempting to reassert dominance by silencing local resistance structures, the press release said.
Breakdown by region
Mainland KP recorded 37 militant attacks in April — marginally down from 42 in March, it said.
However, fatalities from militant attacks and security forces’ actions combined declined from 124 in March to 65 in April — a 48pc reduction, it added.
The press release said that civilian deaths fell from 32 to 10, while security forces’ fatalities dropped from 30 to eight. Injuries also decreased from 65 to 45 — a 31pc decrease.
In the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), 17 attacks in were recorded April, slightly down from 18 in March.
It said that total fatalities from militant attacks and security forces’ actions increased significantly from 82 to 136 — a 66pc increase — driven by a sharp rise in militant deaths from 61 to 116.
It said that security forces’ deaths declined from 19 to seven, adding that injuries rose slightly from 50 to 55.
“The killing of 12 razakars, up from none in March, indicates a shift in militant targeting patterns,” it said.
“Balochistan witnessed 21 militant attacks in April, compared to 35 in March—a 40pc decline,” it added.
The press release said that combined fatalities from militant attacks and security forces’ actions dropped from 122 to 59 — a 52pc reduction.
It said that civilian deaths declined from 45 to 29, while security forces’ deaths fell from 37 to 16. Injuries also decreased from 148 to 32 — a 78pc drop.
“No suicide attacks were reported in April, in contrast to three in March, reflecting improved preventive measures,” it said.
For Punjab, the data said three attacks were recorded in April, down from seven in March — a 57pc decrease.
However, total deaths increased from six to 12, all of whom were militants, it said, adding that injuries rose from one to seven.
“TTP’s efforts to expand its footprint continued in Dera Ghazi Khan and Taunsa Sharif, where the group reportedly directed local farmers to pay ushr (Islamic tax on crops) to its representatives,” it said.
The press release said that Sindh experienced four attacks in April — up from three in March — but the overall impact remained limited.
“Fatalities rose slightly from one to four, all low-scale incidents. Injuries dropped from seven to none,” it said.
“No major claims were made by the Islamic State or Baloch groups during April, marking a quieter month in urban Sindh,” it said, adding that security forces arrested four suspected militants in the province.
“The federal capital remained peaceful in April, with no militant attacks reported for the second consecutive month,” it said; however, one preemptive counterterror operation led to the arrest of a suspected militant.</p><small>2025-05-01 19:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602736-pahalgam-attack-us-urges-pakistan-india-to-work-towards-responsible-resolution' target='_blank'><strong>Pahalgam attack: US urges Pakistan, India to work towards responsible resolution</strong></a><br><p>

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it expected an incursion from India within the next 24-36 hours, diplomatic channels from other countries have been engaged to prevent a possible military confrontation.
A press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said COAS Munir visited the  Tilla Field Firing Ranges in Jhelum to witness “Exercise Hammer Strike”, a high-intensity, field training exercise conducted by the military’s Mangla Strike Corps.
Addressing the troops amid the exercise, the ISPR said the army chief reaffirmed the military’s “unyielding resolve” to defend the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.
“Let there be no ambiguity: any military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response. While Pakistan remains committed to regional peace, our preparedness and resolve to safeguard national interests is absolute,” he was quoted as saying by the ISPR.
It said the COAS lauded the “high morale, combat proficiency, and warfighting spirit” of the officers and troops, terming them the “embodiment of Pakistan Army’s operational excellence”. Senior military leadership, formation commanders and dignitaries from various services also witnessed the exercise.
“Exercise Hammer Strike stands as a testament to Pakistan Army’s pursuit of continuous transformation through rigorous training, doctrinal innovation, and technological modernisation,” the ISPR said.
It added that the exercise was meticulously designed to validate combat readiness, battlefield synergy and the operational integration of cutting-edge weapon systems under near-battlefield conditions. A diverse array of advanced capabilities, including multirole fighter aircraft, combat aviation assets, long-range precision artillery, and next-generation field engineering techniques, were employed to simulate conventional battlefield scenarios.
The ISPR said troops from all arms and services demonstrated “exceptional tactical cohesion, agility, and lethality during synchronised offensive manoeuvres — reflecting an extraordinary level of training and professionalism.
“Notably, the exercise showcased Pakistan Army’s increasing absorption of niche and emerging technologies to augment its kinetic and non-kinetic operational capabilities.”
 


A day ago, Pakistani officials had said the country would exercise restraint in the face of heightened tensions with India but warned it would respond “strongly” and “decisively” if attacked, invoking its right to self-defence under international law.
“Pakistan will not be the first one to resort to any escalatory move; however, in case of any escalatory move by the Indian side, we will respond very strongly,” Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had said during a joint media briefing with military and Foreign Office spokespersons.
Dar said a similar message had been communicated to the international partners. “Any misadventure will be responded to in a befitting and decisive manner at the time and place of our choosing.”
“Our response would be befitting, decisive and assured,” ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said. “We are ready for all eventualities. If they choose military confrontation, that would be their choice, but we would then determine its (conflict’s) future direction.”
Gen Chaudhry emphasised that Pakistan’s armed forces were fully capable and prepared to defend the country across all domains. “We are vigilant and our response and counter-measures would be appropriate and decisive,” he said.
President, PM discuss security situation
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday called on President Asif Ali Zardari to discuss the current security situation.
A statement from the President House said the two leaders expressed deep concern over India’s “belligerent attitude and provocative statements, which posed a threat to regional peace and stability”. They reaffirmed that Pakistan would never compromise on the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and would respond to any act of aggression in a “befitting manner”.
They stated that the Pakistani nation was united and stood behind its military which was capable of responding to any threat or aggression. They also reviewed Pakistan’s response to India’s “belligerent posture and any possible acts of aggression”.
The two also expressed regret over the Indian leadership’s accusations regarding the Pahalgam attack, noting that they were made without any investigation. It was highlighted in their talks that Pakistan had been a victim of terrorism, suffering immense human and economic losses for over two decades.
They said that the international community should take note of India’s involvement in funding, training and sending militants into Pakistan to carry out terrorist activities.
The statement said President Zardari commended the government’s response to Indian baseless accusations and handling of the situation in a responsible manner. He reaffirmed that Pakistan would take all necessary steps to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and vital national interests at all costs.
The two also highlighted the urgency of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions to grant the Kashmiri people their right to self-determination, noting it would help bring lasting peace and stability to the region.
PM Shehbaz also enquired after the president’s health after his recovery from Covid-19.
FM Dar and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar were also present during the meeting.
Pakistan Army continues exercises as troops trade fire
Meanwhile, state-run Radio Pakistan shared a video, dated April 30 and dubbed with a patriotic song, showing the Pakistan Army conducting several exercises.
“Pakistan Army is continuing war exercises with full vigour,” the report said. It quoted security sources as saying the exercises included a “practical demonstration of modern weaponry in view of war strategy”.

According to security sources, the exercises included “practical demonstrations of modern weaponry in view of war strategy”. The sources said the primary objective of the war exercises was to deliver a strong and decisive response to any aggression from the enemy.
They emphasised that the Pakistan Army remained fully prepared at all times to give a crushing reply to any hostile action.
“Officers and soldiers are actively showcasing their professional capabilities during the drills,” Radio Pakistan stated.
Similarly, Radio Pakistan also shared a video showcasing the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) military prowess and capabilities, including the JF-17 Block III that other countries have also bought from Pakistan.
“PAF remains steadfast to defend [the] aerial frontiers of Pakistan,” the video captions said.
Radio Pakistan reported that the PAF “fully prepared and determined to deliver a crushing response to any aggression”.
Noting that the PAF was equipped with the latest fighter jets, the report said the air force had “always fulfilled its professional responsibilities with utmost efficiency and dedication for the integrity of Pakistan”.
“The PAF is renowned worldwide for its technical expertise and courageous reputation,” it added.
The Pakistan Navy has also released a video, titled ‘Ready at all times’, featuring Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.
“You must be battle-ready. The time has come to utilise our capabilities effectively,” Admiral Ashraf tells his troops in the video, which shows clips of various naval exercises.
“You get few opportunities to prove yourself. Our nation has a lot of expectations of us. We have to deliver, and deliver to the best possible efficiency before the enemy,” the naval chief says.
 


India’s navy today issued warnings for several firing drills in the Arabian Sea off the coasts of Maharashtra and Gujarat states. Gujarat shares a border with Pakistan.
The navy did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the warnings.
As tensions remain high, both countries’ troops reportedly exchanged small arms fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in AJK for the seventh night since April 25, Reuters said.
While there was no comment from Pakistan today, state media yesterday reported that the Pakistan Army responded to overnight unprovoked Indian firing on the LoC. No casualties have been reported so far.
‘They want to rob our water’: PPP’s Bilawal
Addressing a rally in Mirphurkhas on Thursday, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari accused the Indian PM of targeting the Indus, warning him that the people of Sindh would respond to any moves to strangle the river.
“Someone is robbing the [water of the] Indus once again — his name is Modi, the butcher of Gujarat,” Bilawal said, calling on PPP supporters to raise their voices to protect the Indus River on the international stage.
“We will raise our voices and protect our river from Modi,” he added.

Recounting his time as foreign minister, the Bhutto scion said that he raised the issue of India trying to reject the Indus Water Treaty on the international stage in the past.
“I protected the Indus as foreign minister,” he said. “After the attack in [occupied] Kashmir, they announced that they reject the Indus Waters Treaty. We reject their decision.
 


“We told them in Sukkur that they should understand that Pakistan is a peaceful country and Islam is a peaceful religion, we don’t want war,” he added.
However, Bilawal warned that if anyone attacks “our Indus River”, then it would be treated as an act of war.
“The Indus is more than just a river; it is our history and our culture,” he stated, adding that the river birthed the Indus Valley Civilisation 3,000 years ago.
“India’s culture is also linked with the river; they love the Indus for this reason,” he added. “We will not give their PM the opportunity to choke the Indus and we do not want war, but we are ready to fight until the end.
“If he targets our water, he will see whether the Indus flows with water or blood,” Bilawal warned.

“US sanctions on Iran during the nuclear talks are not helping the sides to resolve the nuclear dispute through diplomacy,” the official told Reuters.
“Depending on the US approach, the date of the next round of talks will be announced.”
Oman, which mediated earlier sessions of the US-Iran talks, said on Thursday the next round of nuclear discussions provisionally planned for May 3 would be rescheduled for “logistical reasons”.
However, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the US had never confirmed its participation in the fourth round of talks in Rome.
The source said the timing and venue of the next round of talks have yet to be confirmed but are expected in the near future.
Earlier on Thursday, Iran accused the US of “contradictory behaviour and provocative statements” after Washington warned Tehran of consequences for backing Yemen’s Houthis and imposed new oil-related sanctions on it in the midst of nuclear talks.
Separately, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Tehran would continue to engage “seriously and resolutely” in result-oriented negotiations with the US, state media reported.
US President Donald Trump, who has threatened to attack Iran if diplomacy fails, has signalled confidence in clinching a new pact with the Islamic Republic that would block Tehran’s path to a nuclear bomb.
Trump, who has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran since February, ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six world powers in 2018 during his first term and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.
Iran has far exceeded the 2015 agreement’s curbs on its uranium enrichment since the US exited the pact, and European countries share Washington’s concern that Tehran could seek an atomic bomb. Iran says its programme is peaceful.
Iran and three European powers — Britain, France and Germany — were scheduled to meet in Rome on Friday to improve strained ties over Tehran’s disputed nuclear programme during this time of high-stakes talks between Tehran and Washington, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Wednesday.
However, the senior Iranian official who spoke to Reuters said on Thursday that it was now “not certain” whether Friday’s meeting would go ahead.
On Wednesday, Washington imposed sanctions on entities it accused of involvement in the illicit trade of Iranian oil and petrochemicals.
Separately, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth warned Iran that it would face consequences for supporting the Houthis, who control northern Yemen and have attacked ships in the Red Sea in what the group says is solidarity with the Palestinians.
Washington has been bombing the Houthis intensively since mid-March, hitting more than 1,000 targets. Tehran says the Houthis act independently.
China’s top diplomat backs Iran’s nuclear diplomacy
Yesterday, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a senior Iranian national security official that Beijing appreciated Tehran making diplomatic efforts regarding its nuclear programme.
“China values Iran’s commitment not to develop nuclear weapons” and “appreciates Iran’s diplomatic efforts”, Wang told Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran, according to a readout of a meeting in Brazil and released by his ministry today.
“[China] is pleased to see ongoing dialogue between Iran and other parties and supports Iran’s necessary cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency,” Wang was quoted as saying.
China’s top diplomat worked with Shamkhani on the surprise 2023 deal restoring ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which analysts said signalled Beijing’s desire to be a diplomatic heavyweight in the Middle East.
But the crisis in Israel and Gaza, as well as Houthi rebels attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea, has sternly tested Beijing’s ability to continue to play a constructive role in handling global “hotspot issues”.</p><small>2025-05-01 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0121593008b72c3.jpg?r=220020' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907797/trump-cannot-use-alien-enemies-act-to-deport-venezuelans-judge-rules' target='_blank'><strong>Trump cannot use Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, judge rules</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s administration exceeded the scope of an 18th-century wartime law in using it to deport some Venezuelan migrants, a federal judge in Texas said on Thursday in barring the administration from using it to speed up deportations.
In a 36-page opinion, US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez ruled that the Trump administration could not rely on the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua because the gang’s presence in the United States was not an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” as contemplated by the law.
“The historical record renders clear that the President’s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute’s terms,” wrote Rodriguez, who Trump appointed during his first term.
Neither the Justice Department nor the White House immediately responded to requests for comment.
Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to speed up the deportations of alleged Tren de Aragua members in mid-March, part of the Republican president’s push to crack down on immigration. The law is best known for being used to intern and deport people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during World War Two.
At least 137 Venezuelans were deported from the El Valle Detention Centre in Raymondville, Texas, under the law on March 15. Relatives of many of the men and their lawyers deny they were Tren de Aragua members, and say the deportees were not given the chance to contest the administration’s allegations.
The US Supreme Court on April 7 ruled that the Trump administration must give migrants the chance to contest any future Alien Enemies Act deportations in court.
Judges across the country have since issued temporary orders blocking such deportations in their districts.
Thursday’s preliminary injunction issued by Brownsville, Texas-based Rodriguez, whose district includes El Valle, is longer-lasting than the two-week temporary restraining orders that he and other judges in Colorado, Manhattan, and Pennsylvania had previously imposed.
White House national security adviser being forced out: reports
Meanwhile, Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz is being forced out of his job, four people briefed on the matter said on Thursday, in the first major shakeup of Trump’s inner circle since he took office in January.
Waltz’s deputy, Alex Wong, an Asia expert who was a State Department official focused on North Korea in Trump’s first term, is also leaving his post, two people told Reuters.
Waltz, a 51-year-old former Republican lawmaker from Florida, faced criticism inside the White House when he was caught up in a March scandal involving a Signal chat among top Trump national security aides.
It was not immediately clear who would take over from Waltz, but one option included US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been involved in both Russia-Ukraine diplomacy as well as the Middle East, one of the sources said.
Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau was also considered a possible option, the same person said.
The National Security Council did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><small>2025-05-01 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/012029288a1c4e7.jpg?r=203010' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907788/8-family-members-killed-as-car-plunges-into-ravine-in-kps-lower-kohistan' target='_blank'><strong>8 family members killed as car plunges into ravine in KP’s Lower Kohistan</strong></a><br><p>Eight members of a family died when a Rawalpindi-bound Suzuki car plunged into a deep ravine in the Matta Banda area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lower Kohistan district on Thursday afternoon, police said.
Station House Officer (SHO) Buland Iqbal told Dawn.com: “A family was returning from Gilgit Baltistan … and experienced the accident in the Matta Banda area. Four children, their father, mother, and two female [relatives] died.”
The SHO said the car fell from a height, killing all passengers on the spot.
The bodies were retrieved by the local people and Rescue 1122 and moved to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Pattan, he added.
Rescue 1122 district emergency officer Haroon Rasheed identified the adults as Asif Iqbal, Maimuna Iqbal, Ayesha Siddique and Bushra Iqbal.
He said the deceased were residents of Rawalpindi.
“Arrangements are being made to dispatch the bodies to Rawalpindi,” he told Dawn.com.
Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure.
At least 10 people died and nine others were injured on April 15 when a speeding trailer ran over a Peshawar-bound van on the Indus highway in KP’s Karak district.

The April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it expected an incursion from India within the next 24-36 hours, diplomatic channels from other countries have been engaged to prevent a possible military confrontation.
Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong called on Shehbaz at the PM House in Islamabad today, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
The premier thanked China for “endorsing his sincere offer to conduct a credible, neutral and transparent international investigation into the Pahalgam incident”.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

He also conveyed that India’s “belligerent actions could distract Pakistan from its ongoing counterterrorism efforts” against the militant Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-K), Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), who were “operating from inside Afghanistan”.
The past few years have witnessed a rise in the frequency of attacks targeting Chinese nationals working in Pakistan, with 20 Chinese citizens killed and 34 injured in terrorist attacks across the country since 2021.
On Tuesday, the military accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan. The military spokesperson specifically cited the recent killing of 54 TTP militants during an infiltration attempt, saying it was “sponsored, facilita­ted, and abetted by India”.
 
 

In his meeting with the Chinese envoy, PM Shehbaz asserted that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. He highlighted that as a “frontline state” in the war against terrorism, Pakistan had sacrificed over 90,000 lives and suffered over $152 billion in economic losses.
Ambassador Zaidong thanked the prime minister for sharing Pakistan’s perspective on the “emerging situation due to Indian baseless propaganda and unilateral action”, APP quoted a press release from the PMO as saying.
He also affirmed that China would always support Pakistan to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.
PM Shehbaz conveyed his warm wishes to President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang, expressing sincere thanks to China for its strong and steadfast support to Pakistan amid the prevailing situation in the region.
Recalling a telephonic conversation between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and FM Ishaq Dar on April 27, the premier thanked China for understanding Pakistan’s principled position vis-à-vis India’s actions since April 22.
 
 

Speaking about India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), PM Shehbaz said its “decision to weaponise water was extremely regrettable”, stressing that there was no provision for either party to walk away unilaterally from its commitments under the pact.
The premier underscored that the peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was the only way to ensure lasting peace in South Asia.
Spree of diplomatic contacts continues
Continuing his diplomatic engagements with various countries, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar spoke on the phone with the foreign ministers of South Korea, Somalia and Slovenia today to brief them on the evolving regional situation, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
The foreign ministers underscored the importance of resolving issues through diplomacy to maintain regional peace and security.
As non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, Dar and the ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation. The countries also agreed to further strengthen bilateral ties with Pakistan.

In his telephonic conversation with South Korea’s FM Cho Tae-yul, Dar apprised him of the escalating regional situation arising from India’s “baseless propaganda and unilateral actions”.
FM Cho appreciated the successful co-hosting of the Third UN Peacekeeping Ministerial Preparatory Meeting in Islamabad last month.
Slovenia’s FM Tanja Fajon welcomed Pakistan’s offer for an independent and transparent investigation into the Pahalgam attack, the FO said on X.
FM Abdisalam Abdi Ali of Somalia expressed concern over the situation, FO said.
Pakistan’s envoy calls on Trump to ease tensions with India: report
Separately, Pakistan’s envoy to the United States has asked President Donald Trump to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India, according to a report by Newsweek.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh told Newsweek yesterday that for a president “standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration” — referring to Trump — there was no “higher or flashier flashpoint” than the Kashmir issue.
 
 

“If we have a president who is standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration, to establish a legacy as a peacemaker — or as someone who finished wars, defied wars and played a role in de-confliction, resolving the disputes — I don’t think there is any higher or flashier flash point, particularly in nuclear terms, as Kashmir,” Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh told Newsweek.
“We are not talking about one or two countries in that neighbourhood who [sic] are nuclear-capable. So, that is how grave it is,” he said in an interview with the US magazine.
In his inaugural speech as the US president, Trump had said: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.” A ceasefire, which has now been violated, was secured between Israel and Hamas following Trump’s election, and he has also been engaging with Ukraine and Russia to halt their war.
According to Newsweek, Sheikh contended that the Trump administration would need to pursue a more comprehensive and sustained initiative than in past US attempts to defuse crises that have erupted between Pakistan and India.
“I think with this threat that we are facing, there is a latent opportunity to address the situation by not just [focusing] on an immediate de-escalatory measure, or a de-escalatory approach,” the envoy said.
He called for a more durable and lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute, “rather than allowing the situation to stay precarious and pop up again and again at the next drop of a hat on this side or that side”.
 
 

During his interview, Sheikh emphasised that the Kashmir issue was the root cause of all troubles between India and Pakistan.
“Until and unless that final settlement is made and the resolutions dictate the prescribed solution is allowed to play out, we will all keep having these problems,” Sheikh said. “That’s why we insist on the United States and others playing a role in this situation and getting the de-confliction part activated,” he added.
If the long-standing dispute was resolved, the ambassador said, the population of South Asia could live in peace. “All the other issues between Pakistan and India are not major issues,” he noted.
“We do not want to fight, particularly with a bigger country,” Sheikh said. “We want peace. It suits our economic agenda; it suits our nationhood. It suits every objective that we have currently. But we want peace with dignity.
“We would not want to do it, but if it is imposed, then we would rather die with dignity than survive with indignity,” Sheikh asserted.
The call for Trump to play a role in reducing the tensions came the same day as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to top Pakistani and Indian leaders.
 
 

In his phone call with Rubio yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged the US to press India to “dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly”.
In a readout of the call with PM Shehbaz, issued by the US State Department, Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “Both leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence.”
“The secretary (Rubio) urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack. He also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace and security in South Asia,” the statement said.
Meanwhile conversation with India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Rubio “encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia”.
Foreign policy ‘pivoting from geopolitics to geoeconomics’
Sheikh, reiterating Pakistan’s stance, rejected any involvement of his country in the Pahalgam attack, arguing that the fallout of such an operation could only serve to harm rather than benefit Pakistan’s interests.
“Pakistan is focusing on a matter of a deliberate, considered, pronounced shift of our foreign policy, a pivot from geopolitics to geoeconomics,” the envoy told Newsweek.
 
 

“We are focused on the geoeconomics side of our geography and our foreign policy. We are currently economically ascendant,” the official said, stressing that Pakistan only needed a “peaceful neighbourhood” in terms of the broader region.
Terming it “so outlandish, so far-fetched, to blame Pakistan” for the Pahalgam attack, Sheikh said Islamabad was awaiting evidence from New Delhi to prove a link between the incident and Pakistan.
Moreover, the envoy said the attack could be a “false flag operation” conducted to intentionally lay the blame on Pakistan. He acknowledged he could not yet back up the claim, but there was “enough circumstantial evidence, history, […] immediate backdrop and setting […] to entertain that possibility.
Speaking about India’s unilateral suspension last week of the IWT, Sheikh warned that if there was “even an attempt or a semblance of an attempt” to stop or hold water, then it would be a declaration of war.
 
 

While contending that it was “physically impossible” to hold water, the envoy said “all bets are off if it’s about food security of 250 million people”.
“If you threaten me with this kind of a situation, which is existential, what is your expectation of response?” he asked.
On the other hand, the Indian Embassy in Washington told Newsweek in a statement: “The terrorists behind the attack will be brought to justice.” It termed Sheikh’s remarks a “crude attempt to rewrite history and gloss over facts”.
More than 1,000 seminaries close in AJK
As tensions rise, more than 1,000 religious schools in Azad Jammu and Kashmir have been closed for 10 days as tensions rose between India and Pakistan, a local official told AFP today.
“We have announced a 10-day break for all madressahs in Kashmir,” said Hafiz Nazeer Ahmed, the head of Kashmir’s Department of Religious Affairs.
Ahmad told Reuters that security officials feared Indian forces may target seminaries and label them as militant training centres. The notification seen by Reuters, dated April 30, only cited a heatwave as the reason for the closure.
“Right now, we are facing two kinds of heat — one from the weather and the other from [Indian Prime Minister] Modi,” Ahmad said of the notification, saying they did not mention the risk of attacks in a bid to avoid panic.
 
 

Neelum Valley, a popular tourist destination northeast of Muz­affarabad, has seen investment of millions of rupees in tourism and hospitality after the 2003 ceasefire between India and Pakistan.
“Until Tuesday, tourist arrivals hadn’t slowed,” said Deputy Commissioner Nadeem Ahmed Janjua.
“But after the federal minister’s late-night warning, about 70 per cent have left. The rest are still here,” he said, referring to Information Minister Attaullah Tarar’s statement that Pakistan expected a military action by India.
Indian forces kill 9 in occupied Kashmir in April: report
In India-occupied Kashmir, troops killed nine Kashmiris in April, Kashmir Media Service reported, citing data released by its research section.
 
 

Three of the victims were killed in fake encounters and custody of Indian forces, KMS added.
It added that the Indian Army and various police forces arrested at least 2480 civilians, mostly political activists, youth, traders, and students.
Indian forces destroyed or damaged 36 residential houses in the occupied territory. It conducted a total of 322 cordon-and-search operations and house raids, the report said.
Tensions deepen
In a series of escalatory developments, Indian fighter jets patrolling above occupied Kashmir overnight on Tuesday were forced to retreat after the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) scrambled its jets.
On Tuesday, the Pakistan Army had shot down two Indian quadcopters after they violated the country’s airspace along the LoC in two separate areas of AJK, official sources said.
 
 

The same day, Modi told his armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”.
As ties between the arch-rival South Asian nations plummeted to new lows, raising security concerns, Pakistan briefly closed the airspace over Gilgit-Baltistan yesterday, with an official noting that the air routes pass “near Indian territories”.
In a tit-for-tat retaliation to Pakistan shutting its airspace for Indian-operated airlines, Indian also closed its airspace for all Pakistani planes until May 23.
Friendly countries and global powers have urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, advising them to solve the matter through diplomatic engagement.
The United Nations chief, according to his spokesperson, has offered “his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”.

According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Pakistan has yet to ratify 55  of its conventions and protocols. While labour laws exist in the country, enforcement is weak, and despite government promises to create millions of jobs, issues like low pay, lack of social protection, and poor representation remain unresolved.
Rallying outside HPC today, civil society called for education, social protection and empowerment for the labour community.
People performed theatre and dances to celebrate the day. Here are a few pictures.

Tensions between the two countries have spiked following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan vehemently rejected the allegation and called for a neutral probe.
“The emergency sirens are to be installed in high-risk areas to maximise coverage. The move aims to provide real-time alerts and warn the citizens beforehand in the case of an aerial threat,” the report said.
As per a notification issued by the Directorate of Civil Defence KP, citizens are advised to “immediately seek shelter if they hear a siren”. They have also been instructed to avoid going outside and prioritise the safety of children, women, and the elderly in the event of a siren alert.
The concerned district administrations have been directed to ensure the timely installation of the sirens and their maintenance.
The districts include Peshawar, Abbottabad, Mardan, Kohat, Swat, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Malakand, Lower Dir, Lower Chitral, Kurram, Charsadda, Nowshera, Swabi, Bajaur, Haripur, Mansehra, Upper Dir, Shangla, Buner, Lakki Marwat, Khyber, North Waziristan, South Waziristan, Battagram, Tank, and Orakzai.
“The general public has been strictly discouraged from engaging in spreading rumours and mocking or misusing the sirens. The measure intends to safeguard the lives and property of the citizens in times of potential conflict,” said the report.
On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that Pakistan will not initiate any escalation against India but warned of a strong response if provoked.
Other friendly countries and global powers have sought de-escalation of tensions between Pakistan and India — including the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Turkiye, and Qatar.</p><small>2025-05-01 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/01153803891ccb2.jpg?r=165532' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907774/govt-allows-150-stranded-afghan-trucks-to-cross-wagah-border-for-goods-delivery' target='_blank'><strong>Govt allows 150 stranded Afghan trucks to cross Wagah Border for goods delivery</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Thursday allowed 150 stranded Afghan trucks carrying goods for India to cross the Wagah Border, easing a weeks-long bottleneck, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
The moves came nearly a week after Pakistan shut off its borders for any trade with India, including to or from a third country, in response to New Delhi’s measures following a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir. India, without proof, implied cross-border links, which Pakistan denied and instead sought a neutral probe.
A document shared by the foreign ministry today, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, acknowledged a request made by the Afghan embassy in Islamabad on April 28 regarding containers stranded at different transit points in Pakistan.
“The ministry has the honour to inform that in view of the brotherly relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the government of Pakistan has decided to permit stranded Afghan trucks, carrying goods in transit to India, which entered Pakistan before April 25, 2025, to cross Wagah Border for delivering the goods.
“The list of 150 trucks provided by the esteemed embassy has been transmitted to the concerned authorities,” the foreign ministry said.
Details of other stranded trucks, if any, may also be tared at the earliest, it added.
Islamabad decided to halt trade with New Delhi — including to and from any third country via Pakistan — during the National Security Committee meeting on April 24.
 
 

Trade between the two countries had already been suspended since February 2019, when New Delhi imposed steep duties on Pakistani imports after the Pulwama attack, which killed 40 Indian soldiers in Indian-occupied Kashmir.
That August, after New Delhi stripped occupied Kashmir of its special status by revoking Article 370, Pakistan formally downgraded trade ties with India to the level of Israel, with which it has no commercial relations.</p><small>2025-05-01 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/6812ab686cf59.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907637/life-at-karachi-university-campus-paralysed-after-pipeline-burst' target='_blank'><strong>Life at Karachi University campus paralysed after pipeline burst</strong></a><br><p>• Academic, administrative activities disrupted
• Several faculty buildings, roads remain inundated
• Teachers residing on campus say water spoiled their household items
KARACHI: Several roads, faculty buildings and houses on Karachi University (KU) campus remained inundated for the second consecutive day on Wednesday following a major leak in a pipeline, causing disruption in academic and administrative activities.
Talking to Dawn, teachers residing on the campus shared that they had never such devastation before and that many of their colleagues had suffered huge losses on account of inundation that damaged furniture and electricity appliances in their houses and even contaminated underground tanks.
“Water is still standing in our homes. Many of us have rented suction pumps today and are taking out water on a self-help basis,” a teacher said, regretting that there was no immediate response from the administration.
Sources said the situation was dire yesterday when electricity supplies were suspended soon after inundation. Darkness and flooded homes forced many to move either to their relatives living in other cities or KU’s staff guest house.
“While suspending electricity supplies was a preventive step, people were too scared to stay at home. One of our colleagues showed pictures of small snakes that he spotted at his place,” said another teacher.
Sources said the university’s transport services were suspended on Wednesday as water leaking from the main located at Sufi’s hotel had made its way into the bus depot after flooding dozens of residences and academic facilities including a science laboratory, departments of physics, chemistry, applied chemistry, applied physics, biochemistry, Institute of Halophyte, botany, pharmacy, mathematics, petroleum and mass communication.
Sources also said that the situation was aggravated by the fact that the city’s prime public sector university had no proper drainage and sewerage system. The network of storm water drains had been blocked either by construction or solid waste over the years.
“One case in point is the chemistry department where the water also entered its basement, damaging the store where research facilities were kept. The department has become very vulnerable to flooding after the construction of a new Prof Farooqi block, which has completely blocked drainage,” a teacher complained.
Highlighting employees’ woes, Dr Mohsin Ali heading the Karachi University Teachers’ Society condemned the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) for its failure in taking prompt notice of the leakage that caused extensive damage to KU facilities, including labs, which caused a loss of millions of rupees.
“The delayed action is evident by the fact that water started leaking from one end of the university, i.e, the Sheikh Zayed institute and reached the campus’ other end at the Kaneez Fatima gate without any obstruction,” he said.
On behalf of KU staffers, he demanded immediate action to rectify the situation and stop further damage. “We also demand full compensation for the damage caused to the university property, infrastructure and staff’s residences,” he added.
Work underway to drain out water: KU official
Responding to concerns, KU’s Chief Engineer M. Sohail Siddiqui said  the staff immediately moved into action as soon as the main dried and  that the total assessment of damages would take time.
“This  happened in the morning today. Before that, there was no use in  utilizing resources for draining out water since there was continued  water flow,” he explained, adding that the university administration was  in contact with KWSC that had started repairs.
According to him, work is in progress to drain out water from the affected houses, around 70 to 80 in numbers.
“We  are utilising dewatering pumps as well as KWSB’s efficient water  extraction equipment for this purpose. Electricity has been restored to  the affected area,” Mr Siddiqui said, hoping that the residential area  would be cleared of water today.

“With India threatening us, there’s a possibility of war, so we’ll all have to support each other,” she told AFP.
The federal government has warned that it has “credible intelligence” that India was planning an imminent military strike.
Already frosty relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours have plummeted since a deadly assault on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-held Kashmir last week.
India blames Pakistan for the gun attack that killed 26 people on April 22, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi giving his military “complete operational freedom”, although Islamabad has denied any involvement.
There are more than 6,000 schools, colleges and universities on the Pakistan side of the border — including 1,195 along the Line of Control (LoC), the heavily militarised de facto border separating the disputed territory.
Local authorities launched first aid training this week, teaching students how to jump out of a window, use an inflatable evacuation slide, or carry an injured person.
‘Come straight home’
Pakistan and India have exchanged fire at the border for several nights in a row, breaking a ceasefire agreement.
In Muzaffarabad, the largest city in Kashmir, training sessions have already taken place in 13 schools, according to emergency workers.
“In an emergency, schools are the first to be affected, which is why we are starting evacuation training with schoolchildren,” Abdul Basit Moughal, a trainer from Pakistan’s Civil Defence directorate, told AFP.
The agency will deploy its rescue workers to schools bordering the LoC in the coming days.
“We’re learning to help our friends and provide first aid in case India attacks us,” said 12-year-old Faizan Ahmed as students watched an instructor handle a fire extinguisher.
Eleven-year-old Ali Raza added: “We have learned how to dress a wounded person, how to carry someone on a stretcher and how to put out a fire.”
About 1.5 million people live near the Line of Control on the Pakistani side, where residents were preparing for violence by readying simple, mud-walled underground bunkers reinforced with concrete if they could afford it.
In Chakothi village, about three kilometres (two miles) from the Line of Control, there are around 30 bunkers for a community of 60 families overlooked by Indian army check posts atop the surrounding green mountains.
“For a week we are living under constant fear,” said Iftikhar Ahmad Mir, a 44-year-old shopkeeper in Chakothi.
“We are extremely worried about their safety on the way to school because the area was targeted by the Indian army in the past,” he said of the village’s children.
“We make sure they don’t roam around after finishing their school and come straight home. “</p><small>2025-05-01 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0115541393a6505.jpg?r=155425' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907766/justice-mandokhail-calls-for-formal-recognition-of-mining-as-an-industry' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Mandokhail calls for formal recognition of mining as an industry</strong></a><br><p>Supreme Court judge, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, on Thursday urged the government to recognise mining as a formal industry, highlighting the harsh and often deplorable conditions faced by miners, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
The mineral sector currently contributes only about 3.2 per cent to Pakistan’s GDP. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has repeatedly highlighted the mining potential across the country, even going as far as to say that if the country managed to harvest its mineral reserves that valued “trillions of dollars”, it could allow the country to say farewell to global financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Addressing a high-level national conference under the theme ‘Workers and Employers in 2025: Navigating Change with Harmony’, Justice Mandokhail said, “In the eyes of the law and Islam, employers and workers are equal, and the Supreme Court stands as the ultimate guardian of their rights.”
He expressed deep concern over the absence of institutional safeguards for mine workers and called for legal and administrative reforms to ensure their protection and welfare.
“A judge must follow the law, but justice is not limited to the courts. Every individual is responsible for ensuring justice in their actions,” he said.
Quoting Article 17 of the Constitution, he noted that the right to association is a fundamental right, adding that labour unions must work to protect legal rights while promoting harmony.
“Cordial relations and mutual consultation between employees and employers can help reduce the growing backlog of labour-related cases in courts,” he observed.
The event was organised by the National Industrial Relations Commission (NIRC) in collaboration with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Pakistan, marking International Labour Day.
Meanwhile, Justice Jawad Hassan of the Lahore High Court praised Pakistan’s legislative framework for labour rights, saying the country has a long-standing tradition of progressive labour laws, starting with the Industrial Relations Ordinance of 1969.
“Pakistan has signed nearly all 48 international treaties relating to labour rights,” he added.
In his remarks, Justice (Retd) Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, Chairman of NIRC, said the commission’s core mandate was “to keep the national industry moving forward while safeguarding workers’ interests”.
Meanwhile, renowned jurist Barrister Dr Zafarullah Khan cited the Holy Quran in stating that the mission of the prophets was to establish justice.
He added, “According to Islamic teachings, lawful and hard-earned income is not just permissible—it is an act of worship. Islam replaced slavery-based labour systems with principles of liberty, equity, and dignity.”
Despite the importance of the sector, miners in the region contend with treacherous working conditions — labouring in poorly ventilated shafts, risking cave-ins, and facing chronic health issues.</p><small>2025-05-01 10:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602674-judges-rule-on-documents-justice-lies-with-god-justice-mandokhail' target='_blank'><strong>Judges rule on documents, justice lies with God: Justice Mandokhail</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement issued from the office of Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan today, the gun battle took place in the Spin Tangi area of Chashmi, Bannu.
Bannu CTD personnel Assistant Sub-Inspector Benyamin Khan, Constable Inam Khan and Constable Musawar were martyred. Two constables, Wafid Khan and Imran, were wounded.
He said two khawarij — a term the state uses to refer to terrorists — were killed and another two injured in police firing, and their accomplices took bodies and injured with them.
“Weapons, ammunition, IEDs (improvised explosive device) and hand grenades were recovered from the terrorists, which were seized by the police,” the spokesman said.
As soon as the incident was reported, RPO Khan, Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kalachi, and CTD Superintendent of Police reached the CTD hospital where they visited the injured personnel and inquired after their well-being.
They also issued instructions to the hospital staff for the best treatment of those injured.
RPO Khan said that all available resources will be utilised for the best treatment of the injured personnel.
“We will soon avenge our martyred brothers and engage the terrorists with an iron hand till the very end,” he said.
A large contingent of Bannu police and CTD police have cordoned off the area and are engaged in search operations. Raids are being conducted on the hideouts of the terrorists, the spokesman said.
Later in the day, funeral prayers for the martyred were offered with official honours at Bannu Police Lines.
The funeral was attended by CTD Assistant Inspector General (AIG) Shaukat Abbas, RPO Khan, DPO Kalachi, Bannu Commissioner, senior military officials and families of the martyrs.
“Terrorists cannot demoralise us with their evil intentions. We will fight them bravely and destroy their evil intentions,” AIG Abbas said.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to the families of the martyred.

According to a statement issued by his office, KP Governor House, Kundi paid tribute to the personnel for bravely confronting the terrorists.
“The sacrifices of the police and security forces against the terrorists will not go in vain,” he said.
In March, two officials of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s CTD were martyred at Tanda Dam in Kohat district in a gun attack carried out by unidentified assailants.
In January, an official of the police’s CTD was martyred when unidentified persons opened fire at him in Mirali Bazaar.</p><small>2025-05-01 09:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602668-no-hearing-likely-in-2025-on-imran-khans-appeal-in-190m-case-ihc-registrar' target='_blank'><strong>No hearing likely in 2025 on Imran Khan's appeal in £190m case: IHC registrar</strong></a><br><p>

Climate change is a pressing reality for Pakistan, directly impacting millions of lives. Heatwaves, intensified by climate change, are becoming more frequent, prolonged and severe, disproportionately affecting communities with limited resources to adapt.
“The prevailing heatwave condition over most parts of the province is expected to subside from tomorrow,” the PMD said in its advisory issued today.
“A westerly wave continues to grip the upper parts of the country,” it added.
According to the advisory, thunderstorms and light rain were expected in Jamshoro, Hyderabad, Mitiari, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur, Badin, Tharparker, and Umerkot with occasional gaps from May 2 to 5.
“Strong windy conditions are likely in most parts of the province during [the] next two days,” the advisory said.
The forecast also said that Karachi was likely to experience hot and humid weather with occasional winds till May 3, adding that the maximum temperatures would be between 35°C and 37°C and the wind direction would be west and southwesterly.
PMD urged the public to take precautionary measures, avoid exposure to direct sunlight during the daytime and remain hydrated.
The advisory cautioned that “wind-thunderstorm/hailstorm and lightning may damage loose structures like electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels etc.”
“Farmers are advised to manage their crop activities keeping in view the weather conditions and take care of their livestock as well,” it added.
A day earlier, the PMD had predicted wind and thunderstorm along with rain and isolated hailstorm in upper and central parts of the country from May 1 to 4, saying that the current heatwave conditions are likely to subside.</p><small>2025-05-01 09:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/01113256d07c0d4.jpg?r=134638' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907749/as-india-pakistan-tensions-heat-up-gilgit-baltistan-tour-operators-see-their-earnings-evaporate' target='_blank'><strong>As India-Pakistan tensions heat up, Gilgit-Baltistan tour operators see their earnings evaporate</strong></a><br><p>A large number of foreign tourists have cancelled their trips to Gilgit-Baltistan due to heightened tensions between Pakistan and India, depriving local tour operators of much-needed earnings, a trade body official said on Thursday.
The April 22 attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. New Delhi has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi granting “operational freedom” to his military. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said yesterday morning that there was credible evidence of an Indian attack within 36 hours, while Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said that Pakistan wouldn’t strike first, but would respond decisively and strongly in the face of aggression.
With tensions running high, Pakistan briefly closed the airspace over Gilgit-Baltistan, while India shut its airspace for all Pakistan-registered aircraft, or those owned and operated by Pakistani airlines or operators, including military craft.
Ali Anwar Khan, General Secretary of the Gilgit-Baltistan Tour Operators Association, said, “The threat of war between Pakistan and India has impacted the region’s international tourism this year.”
He added that tourists, including well-heeled visitors from European and Commonwealth countries, have cancelled their trips to the region due to the heightened geopolitical tensions. Khan added that many tourists from Thailand had cancelled their reservations.
Additionally, he noted that around eight to ten foreign groups from his company had cancelled their trips, while 200 tour operators had also reported a number of cancellations.
According to Khan’s estimate, each operator lost at least $50,000 to $80,000 in potential earnings due to the current situation.
He said that most countries have already issued travel advisories due to which foreign tourists are rapidly cancelling their tours, while others have confirmed or are waiting for updates.
He said that one foreign tourist spends an average of $1,500 on a tour. “Now the cancellations will affect the entire industry — from hotels to transport,” he added.
He said the foreign tourists that are presently in Gilgit-Baltistan are worried about a potential escalation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. “They want to return to their countries immediately,” he said. “They are expressing fears that if they stay in Gilgit-Baltistan for longer to complete their tours, they will be caught in a possible war between the two countries.”
With regard to foreign mountaineers who visit the region to scale eight-thousander peaks, including K2, he said that the sector had already been “severely impacted” due to legal battles.
Previously, tour operators took to court to protest against the hike in taxes and fees for trekking and mountaineering by the Gilgit-Baltistan government.
A dispute between tour operators and the tourism department in Gilgit-Baltistan continues to impact the sector in the mountainous region, as the Supreme Court after suspending the increase in permit fees for foreign visitors had yet to provide clarity on the way forward.
Khan said that the circumstances impacted a total of 2,000 foreign tourists.
 
 

According to a statement issued by the GB tourism department on Sunday, about 25,000 foreign tourists visited Gilgit-Baltistan last year.
It said 2,300 foreign mountaineers and trekkers were issued permits by the GB government after paying permit fees, but 22,000 foreign tourists visited Gilgit-Baltistan, and many of them were allowed trekking and climbing without paying fees.
The Information Department also informed the GB Tourism Department that 700 foreign tourists interested in mountaineering and trekking have applied for permits this year.
However, due to the Pakistan Tour Operators Association approaching the court against the permit fees, the issuance of permits — which used to be completed in two to three days — has now been suspended due to court proceedings.
According to Director of Tourism Gilgit-Baltistan Iqbal Hussain, around 1.5 million domestic tourists visited the region last year.
He estimated that the revenue from tourism — domestic and foreign — would be around Rs64 billion.</p><small>2025-05-01 08:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602651-pakistani-media-at-crossroads-amid-rising-threats-shrinking-freedom-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani media at crossroads amid rising threats, shrinking freedom: report</strong></a><br><p>

As the world commemorated International Labour Day, the president and the premier issued separate messages to mark the occasion.
According to the International Labourers Organisation (ILO), Pakistan has yet to ratify 55 conventions and protocols. While labour laws exist but enforcement is weak, and despite government promises to create millions of jobs, issues like low pay, lack of social protection, and poor representation remain unresolved.
President Zardari paid tribute to the men and women labourers in the country and highlighted their struggles around the world, according to state-run Pakistan Television (PTV).
 






In his statement, he said: “We reiterate our commitment to workers’ autonomy, fair wages, a safe environment and social security. Workers and the working class are the driving force of our economy and national development.”
He highlighted the role of workers “in building our infrastructure, developing industries, agriculture, and the economy”.
He added: “Our workers are our pride. Our national development is due to the hard work and character of workers. In a rapidly changing world, we must focus on skilling our youth and workers for a bright future. We need to equip our workers and youth with modern skills.”
 
 

The president also stressed the need to create a comprehensive system for the skill development of workers.
“We will have to work to create a fair labor environment and for the welfare of workers. Let’s promote meaningful policies, inclusive development, and a culture in the country where the role of every worker is respected,” he added.
 
 

Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s “unwavering commitment to promoting safe, healthy, and dignified conditions for workers”, PTV reported.
“Our hardworking workforce is the driving force behind our nation’s progress and our resilience,” he said.
“The protection of fundamental rights of workers is enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan and is fully consistent with the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), to which Pakistan is a committed signatory,” he added.
The premier highlighted that the country has undertaken legislative and administrative reforms to strengthen labour and workforce protection, including key international labour conventions, such as the Forced Labour Convention and the 2014 Protocol to the Maritime Labour Convention.
He stated, “For the first time, every worker in Pakistan is benefiting from a national occupational safety and health profile, ensuring safe and healthy workplaces across the country.”
He urged workers, activists, civil society and the government to play their role for “a society that respects workers, upholds their rights, and creates opportunities for decent work”.
 






Senate Chairman Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani also paid tribute to all hardworking individuals of the nation, stating that May 1 is a shining symbol of determination, sacrifice, and human dignity.
Gilani said workers were the backbone of any nation. He emphasised that as a nation, we must realise that unless the labour class is provided with social, economic, and legal protection, the dream of sustainable development will remain incomplete.</p><small>2025-05-01 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602659-on-labour-day-daily-wage-workers-in-pakistan-share-stories-of-survival-struggle' target='_blank'><strong>On Labour Day, daily wage workers in Pakistan share stories of survival, struggle</strong></a><br><p>

The new indictment comes as Yoon stands trial for orchestrating an insurrection with his December 3 martial law attempt, which sought to suspend civilian rule in democratic South Korea.
Armed soldiers were deployed to parliament under the decree, but the order lasted only around six hours as it was swiftly voted down by opposition MPs, who scaled fences to enter the building. They later impeached Yoon over the martial law declaration.
Yoon, 64, was stripped of all power and privileges in April by the Constitutional Court, which upheld the impeachment motion. He was soon forced to move out of the presidential residence.
Prosecutors first indicted Yoon in January — when he was still president — as “the ringleader of an insurrection”, a charge not covered by presidential immunity.
“We have since proceeded with the (insurrection) trial while conducting supplementary investigations into the abuse of power allegation, leading to this additional indictment,” prosecutors said in a statement on Thursday.
The fresh charge comes a day after investigators raided Yoon’s private residence in Seoul as part of a probe into bribery allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee and a shaman accused of receiving lavish gifts on behalf of the former first lady.
If convicted of the insurrection charge, Yoon could be sentenced to life in prison or to death — although South Korea has had an unofficial moratorium on executions since 1997.
Yoon was the second South Korean president to be removed from office, and the third to be impeached by parliament.
With Yoon out of office, South Korea is set to hold a snap election on June 3.</p><small>2025-05-01 06:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602645-three-ctd-men-martyred-two-terrorists-killed-in-bannu-gun-battle' target='_blank'><strong>Three CTD men martyred, two terrorists killed in Bannu gun battle</strong></a><br><p>

Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, 84, who has led an interim government since autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled into exile as crowds stormed her palace in August, has said elections will be held as early as December, and at the latest by mid-2026.
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), widely tipped to win the poll, will hold a May Day rally in Dhaka.
“We are confident this will be the most memorable grand rally in recent times,” BNP media officer Shairul Kabir Khan said.
Jamaat-e-Islami will also take to the streets of the capital on Thursday.
The Jatiya Party, formerly close to Hasina’s regime, will also hold a rally.
It will be its first outdoor political event since its offices were vandalised in October, allegedly for helping Hasina’s Awami League cling to power.
On Friday, the National Citizens Party (NCP), formed by students who spearheaded the youth-led protests that overthrew Hasina, will hold a rally.
NCP leader Nahid Islam initially joined the interim government led by Yunus, before resigning to form the party.
“Political programmes help us build public engagement,” said senior NCP official Ariful Islam Adib. “This rally isn’t about showing strength, but we expect 20,000 to 30,000 attendees.”
Hefazat-e-Islam, a platform of Islamic seminaries, will hold a “grand rally” on Saturday.
“Our rally is a reminder to the government of the sacrifices we’ve made,” said its leader Mamunul Haque, adding they will use the event to present their demands.
Key among them is scrapping recommendations by a government women’s commission for ending discriminatory provisions against women, a further indication of how hardline, religiously fuelled activism is strengthening after years of suppression.
“We will present four demands. Chief among them is scrapping the recommendations of the Women’s Rights Commission,” Haque said.
“We don’t care if it’s Muhammad Yunus in charge or someone even more prominent, we’ll take to the streets,” he added.
Hasina, who remains in self-imposed exile in India, has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.</p><small>2025-05-01 06:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/01095217fa4f929.jpg?r=095223' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907647/body-of-boy-who-died-in-india-reaches-karachi-after-mishap' target='_blank'><strong>Body of boy who died in India reaches Karachi after mishap</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The body of a 23-year-old Quetta resident, Aryan Shah, who died in Chennai, India, last week while undergoing cancer treatment,  arrived in Karachi on Wednesday after a delay caused by an airline  mishap.
Aryan Shah, who had been receiving treatment for several months in a  hospital in Chennai, succumbed to the illness last week. He had travelled  to India with his parents for medical care.
Following his death, Shah’s mother appealed to Balochistan Chief  Minister Sarfraz Bugti for financial assistance to repatriate the body  as the family could not afford the costs.  Chief Minister Bugti arra­nged financial  support and contacted the Pakistani ambassador in India through the  Foreign Office to facilitate the transfer.
The parents travelled to Karachi via an international airline with the coffin. However, upon arrival, they discovered that the body had been  mistakenly left in Colombo.
“I have received the body of my son  from Colombo,” Shah’s mother said. “The Indian government or hospital  did not extend any help in shifting the body of my son.”
Pakistani  authorities contacted the airline, which subsequently flew the body  from Colombo to Karachi, where it arrived on Wednesday.
Officials  in Quetta said the family has arranged to transport the body to Quetta  by ambulance. They departed Karachi late on Wednesday evening and are  expec­ted to reach Quetta early Thursday morning.

Sindh’s Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon made this announcement in a social media post.
He said that the aim of this project was to bringing a revolutionary change to the public transport system, empower women, ensure safe travel, and promote eco-friendly transport across the province, said a press release issued on Wednesday evening.
Mr Memon, who also holds the portfolio of transport and information departments, described the Peoples Pink and Normal Taxi Service as a “historic milestone for Sindh”.
He said that the Sindh government was committed to modernising the transport system and creating equal opportunities for all segments of society.
Earlier, Mr Memon had said that the provincial government was working to bring ride-hailing services in Karachi under one system, Dawn.com reported.
“We are working to bring the [online] taxi system in Karachi under one umbrella in an integrated and modern manner,” he said while chairing a meeting of the transport department.
He added that these services will be organised under one umbrella so that safe, standard and legal facilities can be provided to passengers. “All online taxi services like Careem, Yango would be brought under one system,” he said.
Speaking about an earlier announcement by the Sindh government about providing pink scooters to women free of cost, Mr Memon said that rapid progress was being made in this regard to provide women with ease of transport facilities.
“Double-decker buses for the transport sector will arrive by June this year. A large batch of new buses is expected in late June or early July,” he added.

Led by Sanjay Kumar, a PPP minority member of the Balochistan Assembly, the rally included men and women carrying placards and banners with anti-Modi and anti-India slogans.
The protesters marched through various roads and streets of the provincial capital before gathering outside the Quetta Press Club.
Chanting slogans against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government, protesters rejected any involvement by Pakistan in the Pahalgam attack.
“The Hindu community in Pakistan stands united with the country’s armed forces. If India dares commit aggression, over 10 million Hindus in Pakistan will stand behind our military,” Sanjay Kumar said while addressing the gathering.
 
 

Other speakers, including several women, also condemned the Indian government’s actions and rhetoric. They criticised India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, calling it a violation of international agreements.
“India cannot unilaterally suspend the treaty signed in 1960 without the consent of other stakeholders,” protesters said.
The protest ended peacefully after the speeches.

Titled “Free speech and public interest journalism under siege”, the report finds that the existential crisis was triggered by amendments to Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) in January 2025 that now “makes it easier” for authorities to arrest, fine and imprison journalists and dissidents — both offline and online — besides other challenges.
 
 

“The existential threat is serious as such a situation is seen rare in Pakistani media history. This situation is threatening the very foundation of democracy and the state is more brutal now than it was before to tolerate hard questions,” Freedom Network Executive Director Iqbal Khattak said, as the report launch coincides with World Press Freedom Day being commemorated globally on May 3 every year.
Authored by Adnan Rehmat, the report provides an overview of the freedom of expression and media freedoms in Pakistan prevalent during May 2024-April 2025.

Freedom Network says crisis has been triggered by amendments to Peca; KP emerges as the most dangerous for journalists, followed by Islamabad and Punjab

“These challenges reflect the broader shrinking space for media freedoms in the country. Such a declining media space means citizens will have little access to information they need to know,” co-author Iqbal Khattak said.
Five journalists were killed during the period the report covered. Three journalists were killed in Sindh and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa while at least 82 journalists and other media professionals had faced different types of threats during the same period.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa emerged as the most dangerous province for journalists where 22 cases were documented while Islamabad recorded the second highest number of 20 cases against journalists and followed by 18 cases in Punjab. Four cases were recorded in Balochistan and one in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
The report said at least 14 journalists faced legal cases, mostly under Peca law while in eight cases journalists were arrested or detained in pursuance of legal cases.
Growing censorship, legal restrictions, violence against journalists, impact of disinformation on media and its practitioners’ integrity, challenges for women media practitioners, effects of political polarisation on media freedom and safety of journalists were key areas the report identified as main reasons for the current situation facing the freedom of expression and media freedom.
The women’s representation in the country’s media has improved over the time, but significant disparities remained in the period under review.
“Even though inadequately represented in media in quantitative terms, women are active in various forms of media, including print, television, radio and digital platforms,” the report says.
It recommended “national movement to protect and pursue the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression and the right to express dissent with policies and state action that impinge on the fundamental rights of citizens”.
The report also seeks inclusion and engagement to mobilise public and civil society actors to make “the national movement” stronger and working.
A national consensus of key stakeholders for a new charter on digital rights of the citizens of Pakistan that “guarantees the same constitutional guarantees online as offline, and ensure internet access for all, quality internet and digital rights including the right to digital freedom of expression”.

The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief becomes the country’s tenth NSA.
A notification issued by the Cabinet Division on Tuesday said that Gen Malik would retain his role as DG ISI, a position he has held since September 2024.
“Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik HI(M), DG (I), shall hold the additional charge of the National Security Adviser, with immediate effect,” the notification stated.
His appointment marks the first time a serving ISI chief will concurrently serve as the NSA.
The posting comes amid heightened tensions with India following the recent Pahalgam attack.
The NSA position had remained vacant since April 2022, when the PTI government was ousted after former Prime Minister Imran Khan lost a vote of confidence. At the time, Moeed Yusuf was serving as the NSA.
The NSA holds the status of a federal minister and serves as the principal adviser to the Prime Minister on matters of national security, foreign policy, and strategic affairs.
The adviser also heads the National Security Division, based at the Prime Minister’s Secretariat in Islamabad.

• Bushra Bibi’s appeal to be taken up by division bench next week
ISLAMABAD: In a major blow to Imran Khan’s hopes for a legal reprieve, the Islamabad High Court has signalled that his appeal against a 14-year sentence in the £190 million Al-Qadir Trust corruption case won’t be heard this year — effectively keeping the former prime minister in legal limbo throughout 2025.
The report by the IHC registrar office was submitted to a division bench in response to an application, seeking the early hearing of an appeal against the conviction of the PTI founder and his spouse, Bushra Bibi.
As per the report, a criminal appeal filed in January 2025 by Mr Khan, sentenced to 14 years imprisonment, faces indefinite delays, with the court confirming that the case would not be heard during the current calendar year.
 
 

The report cited the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC) recommendations, according to which the court had approved a ‘fixation policy’ in February 2023 to expedite pending cases, particularly the appeals filed by convicts. Key measures included designating special benches to resolve cases pending for over five years within two months. However, despite these directives, fresh cases like the 2025 appeal remain trapped in procedural limbo.
As per the report, 279 convict appeals are pending before the court, including 63 about the death sentence and 73 against life imprisonment. In 88 cases, the sentences are more than seven years and while in 55 cases, they are up to seven years.
The subject appeal, filed in January 2025, relates to a convict sentenced to 14 years imprisonment, said the report. Despite its recent filing, the case remains at the “motion stage”, requiring the preparation of paper books (mandatory legal documents) before admission.
“After [the appeal’s] admission, paper books are required to be prepared. So far, its fixation for regular hearing… is not in sight during the calendar year 2025,” the report stated, underscoring the procedural bottleneck. The report explicitly stated that due to existing priorities under the NJPMC’s policy—which focuses on older cases—the appeal of Mr Khan has “no sight of fixation for a regular hearing in 2025”.
Bushra’s appeal next week
During the hearing on the application for early hearing of this matter, the division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Asif scheduled Bushra Bibi’s plea for suspension of her seven-year sentence for hearing next week.
Barrister Salman Safdar, representing the petitioners, raised concerns over the court office’s handling of urgent applications. “For the third time, the PTI founder is in jail in this case, and our applications for suspension of sentence remain pending,” he told the bench.
He alleged that the registrar’s office was not processing the relevant applications and was instead prioritising other appeals unjustifiably.
Mr Safdar also emphasised that Bushra Bibi had no direct involvement in the case and requested immediate relief for her. He further urged the bench to fix the case for next Tuesday, citing travel arrangements from Lahore. In response, Acting Chief Justice Dogar remarked, “Let me tell you the day, I will see.”
Commenting on the development, advocate Faisal Hussain said that the delay has exposed the strategy of the PTI’s legal team. He said that the legal team should convince the court that this was not a routine case, and being its peculiar nature, the case should be heard on priority basis.

ISLAMABAD: Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at calming tensions in the Subcontinent, fears of a possible military confrontation between India and Pakistan continued to persist on Wednesday.
Following a statement by Information Minister Atta Tarar in the early hours of Wednesday, where he warned of a possible incursion by India within the next 24-36 hours, a number of incidents of Indian aggression heightened tensions.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, Pakistani security forces delivered a robust response to India’s unprovoked ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC), destroying an Indian checkpost after late-night aggression on April 29-30.
According to security officials, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked small arms fire in the Kiani and Mandal sectors, which was met with a prompt response.
Sources told APP that the retaliatory strikes destroyed several bunkers, including the Chakputra post in India-held Kashmir.
Reuters also reported that a conversation was held between top army officers from India and Pakistan — without naming them.
 
 

Separately, state media also reported that a “timely and swift response” by Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had forced four Indian Rafale jets to retreat.
Quoting security sources, state-run PTV and Radio Pakistan said that the previous night, four Indian Rafales were detected patrolling over the territory of held-Kashmir. A timely and prompt action by the PAF forced them to retreat.
They said that Indian jets became flustered and retreated owing to the PAF’s prompt response.
Airspace concerns
With tensions running high, Pakistan briefly closed the airspace over Gilgit-Baltistan, while India shut its airspace for all Pakistan-registered aircraft, or those owned and operated by Pakistani airlines or operators, including military craft.
A Notam (Notice to Airmen) issued by New Delhi said the closure would be from April 30 to May 23, 2025.
While PIA flights to the Gilgit and Skardu airports were cancelled on Wednesday, two Airblue flights between Skardu and Islamabad operated as per their schedule, sources said.
The PIA official noted that the air route between Gilgit-Baltistan and other cities passes “near Indian territories”.
However, the airspace closure ended after a few hours and flight schedules were restored.
One source told Dawn that the airspace closure was carried out due to certain exercises that were being carried out, but it was not clear if this was directly linked to the heightened tensions with India, or due to inclement weather, as rain and wind storms are predicted to sweep across the country’s northern parts from today.
Residents and visitors obviously faced difficulties, as alternative land routes are often less reliable and more time-consuming.
Diplomatic efforts
Meanwhile, the United States has urged both Pakistan and India to take steps to de-escalate tensions in the region.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio conveyed the message in separate calls with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.
In a readout of the call with PM Shehbaz, issued by the State Department, Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “The secretary spoke of the need to condemn the terror attack on April 22 in Pahalgam. Both leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence.”
“The Secretary urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack. He also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace and security in South Asia,” the statement said.
A separate readout of Rubio’s conversation with India’s foreign minister said: “[Secretary of State Marco Rubio] encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.”
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz shared Pakistan’s perspective on recent developments in South Asia since the Pahalgam incident with Rubio.
During the call, the prime minister condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and termed India’s escalatory and provocative behavior as deeply disappointing and worrisome, adding that these would only distract Pakistan from its ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism.
He categorically rejected Indian attempts to link Pakistan to the incident and pointed to his call for a transparent, credible, and neutral investigation to bring out the facts.
He urged the US to impress upon India to dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar contacted leaders from European Union countries, apprising them that Pakistan was open to an transparent investigation into the Pahalgam attack.
Mr Dar spoke with Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares and Oman’s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al Busaidi, briefing them on recent regional developments, including Indian propaganda and illegal unilateral measures against Pakistan, and placing Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a clear violation of international law.
He also met with US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker, who called on the foreign minister in Islamabad. Both leaders exchanged views on recent regional developments, a statement said.
In the meeting, Mr Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and security while safeguarding national interests, while Ms Baker conveyed the US desire for de-escalation, adding that Washin­gton would stay engaged with both countries on the evolving situation.
