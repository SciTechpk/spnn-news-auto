Waheed Billa, husband of accused Rida, and others were presented before the ATC, which remanded them in police custody.
In order to prevent any untoward incident in light of the people’s anger, the district administration sealed all cloth shops in the city belonging to Billa’s family. The key accused in the case, Shamrez, is still at large, increasing people’s resentment against police.
Dr Warda was laid to rest in the cantonment area graveyard on Monday night after funeral prayers were offered at 10pm.
Medical staff members of the hospital were among the people who took the body toher house for final rituals.
A pall of gloom descended over the place, with most people having teary eyes. With the doctor’s children, father, brother and other relatives present, some of them fainted. Fellow doctors went to Dr Warda’s grave and placed wreaths.
DIG of Hazara police Nasir Mahmood Satti said the investigation into the murder would consider all aspects.
A special police investigation team under the patronage of DPO Haroonur Rashid has already been formed.
Those named in the case have been arrested, while special teams have been formed to arrest crime facilitators.
“We will fulfil all legal requirements and bring killers and their facilitators to justice,” he said.
Meanwhile, the DPO removed Sub-Inspector Zubair Khan from the post of the SHO at the Cantonment Police Station and appointed Inspector Ali Jadoon in his place.
Health minister Khaliqur Rehman visited the deceased’s house and offered condolences to the family. He pledged all possible support to it.
“The brutal murder of Dr. Warda Mushtaq is a big tragedy. The government is taking it very seriously and will ensure dispensation of justice at all costs. The accused won’t get off scot-free,” he said.
The minister later visited the Benazir Teaching Hospital Abbottabad and met the representatives of the doctors association.
“The safety of doctors is the top priority of our government. Those serving in the health sector are a valuable asset to us,” he said.
He said a JIT had been formed to conduct a transparent investigation into the murder and it was discharging its responsibility in a completely professional manner.
Doctors at the Benazir Shaheed Hospital observed a complete strike.
A condolence reference was also held to pay tribute to the deceased. Doctors, nurses, paramedics and Class IV employees participated and prayed for Dr Warda. They also demanded exemplary punishment for the killers.
The doctors of Ayub Medical Complex staged a protest sit-in on the Silk Road. Along with nurses, paramedics and Class IV employees, they demanded that the killers and their facilitators be brought to justice. The protesters shouted slogans against the district administration and police and demanded the arrest of the SHO of the Cantonment police station and DSP (Cantt).
Also, medical staff members at the tehsil headquarters hospitals in Havelian and Lora staged street protests.
In Mansehra, doctors, paramedics and nurses from across upper parts of Hazara Division observed a complete strike, suspending all health services, except emergency for patients.
They also took to the streets and demanded exemplary punishment for the killers.
Healthcare professionals at public-sector facilities in Mansehra, Torghar, Upper and Lower Kohistan and Kolai-Palas districts participated in the strike.

The GMMP takes place once every five years and captures a snapshot of news content from one global monitoring day. This year marks the fourth cycle in which Uks has served as GMMP’s national partner,monitoring and contributing Pakistan’s data to the world’s longest-running study on gender representation in the news.
GMMP 2025 was monitored around the world on May 6, 2025, a day on which Pakistan’s news agenda was dominated by India-Pakistan military tensions. The conflict shaped the media landscape that day and left very limited space for gender-related reporting.
“No women reporters were recorded in television, radio, or internet news on May 6,” the statement said, which was issued ahead of the release of the GMMP report and Pakistan’s National Report.
“The overwhelming focus on cross-border shelling, political statements, and military assessments meant that women’s stories almost disappeared from the news cycle. While the conflict skewed 2025’s data, the long-term trend still shows biases that continue to limit women’s visibility and voice in Pakistani media.”
Regarding news on gender-based violence (GBV), the statement said that “across all media monitored on the monitoring day, only one story on GBV appeared,” adding “the sole story focused on intimate partner violence, portraying the woman strictly as a victim.”
“No human rights lens or legal framework was applied,” it stated.
The statement  further revealed that this year, women made only 13pc of news subjects, down from 18pc in 2020. “All stories that included women as subjects were reported by men.”
“These numbers show a clear reversal of progress made over previous cycles and highlight how deeply women’s representation is tied to editorial priorities and news routines,” it added.
It, however, added that the only area where women’s representation showed an increase in Pakistan was in social and legal news, where their presence rose to 20pc from 14pc in 2020.
Global highlights
Progress on gender equality in the news largely stalled across 94 countries, according to the statement.
“Women make up 26pc of people seen or cited in traditional news, and 29pc in digital news. These figures have barely shifted in a decade. The structure of news continues to prioritise male-dominated political and economic coverage, in both traditional and digital media.”
It added that women’s visibility improved over time in political and economic stories, but remained extremely low in sports (15pc).
“Women continue to be portrayed as victims at twice the rate of men, with 2025 showing a shift toward domestic violence and other crimes as the primary victim categories,” it said.
“Women remain underrepresented in expert roles, although digital news shows rising numbers of women experts. Stories by women journalists continue to feature more women sources and are more likely to apply a gender lens.”
Globally, it added, less than 2pc of news stories cover GBV. While the stories tend to apply a clearer gender perspective, the volume is too low to influence broader narratives.
“The 2025 findings show a media environment where change has slowed significantly, and existing approaches are not delivering meaningful improvements in gender equality,” it said.</p><small>2025-12-10 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10101955e57b581.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960191/fierce-gun-battle-in-shikarpur-leaves-10-suspects-dead-two-dsps-other-cops-wounded' target='_blank'><strong>Fierce gun battle in Shikarpur leaves 10 suspects dead; two DSPs, other cops wounded</strong></a><br><p>SUKKUR: Ten suspected gangsters were gunned down during a fierce gun battle which also left two DSPs and their two subordinates wounded in the Manchhar area of Shikarpur district on Tuesday.
According to an official statement, City DSP Paras Bakhrani, her Garhi Yasin counterpart, Zahoor Soomro, and two other members of the police team received critical wounds in the gun battle.
Sharing details of the whole episode with the media, Shikarpur SSP Shahzaib Chachar said that the police team led by the two DSPs had gone to the Manchhar area after receiving information about presence of a smaller gang that had robbed Rs2.6m from a grain trader in the city’s Anaj Mandi a day earlier.
The SSP said that the robbery suspects, along with their several other heavily armed associates, were spotted there and challenged. The suspects opened an indiscriminate fire on the police team and were given a matching response, he added.

He said that in the gun battle, 10 of the embattled suspects were gunned down while the two DSPs and two constables were critically wounded. Several other suspects might also have been wounded but all surviving outlaws fled the Manchhar area.
He said that reinforcement was called in and adjoining areas were cordoned off to apprehend all of them.
A house-to-house search was being carried out in and around the Manchhar area, he said.
The SSP said that eight of the killed suspects were identified as Gul Mohammad and his two sons, Shahzado alias Shaddo and Shahmore; Sajid, brother of Gul Mohammad; Imdad and his brother Ayaz, and Owais, s/o Abdul Jabbar — all belonging to the Shaikh community — and Ghulam Mohammad, s/o Sadiq Bakhrani. Two others were yet to be identified.
All the wounded police officers and personnel were rushed to the Ziauddin Hospital in Sukkur for treatment.
Sukkur DIG, SSP visit under treatment police officers
Sukkur DIG retired Captain Faisal Abdullah Chachar, along with Sukkur SSP Azhar Khan Mughal, visited them at the hospital and prayed for their speedy recovery. He issued necessary directives to the hospital administration regarding their best possible treatment.
Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also called for all possible medical assistance to them and held out the assurance that the provincial government would extend every possible cooperation to them.
The minister saluted the police team, especially the two DSPs, for the bravery it demonstrated in the fight against the gangsters. He said the officers and personnel risked their lives in the line of duty as well as for the safety and security of citizens.
He also congratulated the Shikarpur SSP and his subordinates for the successful police action.
He emphasised that operations against dacoit gangs and other criminals in Shikarpur district must continue.
The Sindh government stood with the police in the eradication of crime from society, he added.
Faryal Talpur speaks to DSP Paras
MPA Faryal Talpur made a telephonic call to under treatment DSP Paras and inquired about her health.
She prayed for her speedy recovery and praised her “unparalleled bravery and dedication to duty”.
She also prayed for early recovery of DSP Zahoor Soomro and the two injured policemen.
Doctors who were treating DSP Paras said that she had received one bullet each to her chest and abdomen.
Sindh IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon called in Police Surgeon Dr Fiza Jafri from Karachi and requested her to supervise the surgery. Dr Jafri flew into Sukkur by an air ambulance and proceeded straight to the Ziauddin Hospital to undertake the task.
The police authorities directed the hospital administration and other concerned to keep ready an air ambulance so that DSP Paras could be taken to Karachi for proper treatment, if need be.
On the request, Sukkur District Council Chairman Syed Kumail Haider Shah immediately arranged an air ambulance and put it at the disposal of the hospital administration.
A late evening report, however, suggested that the condition of DSP Paras was stable after surgery.
Meanwhile, the Shikarpur police were in the process of locating the bodies of two unidentified suspects killed during the gun battle. A picture released by the police showed bodies of eight suspects.
They named one of the two injured constables as Noor Brohi. Despite repeated requests by Dawn, they could not identify the other constable.

In a determination, Nepra said the 33 paise per unit higher charges would be applied to all consumers across the country, including K-Electric, under the quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA) for 1QFY26. The authority has allowed the positive quarterly adjustments of Rs6.067 billion to be applicable to all consumer categories, except lifeline consumers and prepaid consumers, in three months starting December, it said.
In a separate determination, the regulator also allowed the Power Division to notify its incremental consumption package for industrial and agricultural electricity consumers of ex-Wapda Distribu­tion Companies (Discos) and K-Electric.
Under the package, the reduced rate of Rs22.98 per unit — the marginal cost of power supply — would be applicable to industrial and private agricultural consumers, including both Time-of-Use and Non-ToU categories on their peak and off-peak incremental consumption over the corresponding reference period.
A Power Division spokesperson welcomed the decision and added that under the new tariff structure, the price of additional units for agriculture and industry had been reduced to Rs22.98 per unit from their existing rates of Rs38 and Rs34 per unit, respectively.

 

The package will remain applicable for three years on a monthly basis and the reference months for determining incremental consumption shall be from December 2023 to November 2024. The incremental package is subsidy-neutral for both but will be subject to positive Fuel Cost-Adjustments (FCAs). Further, Quarterly Tariff Adjustments (QTAs), Debt Service Surcharge (DSS) and negative FCAs shall not be applicable on incremental consumption for eligible consumers.
Nepra also released an additional note of its member, technical Rafique A Shaikh, exposing the deep-rooted inefficiencies, theft and mismanagement of power plants, including inadequate utilisation of cheaper plants and greater capacity payments.
Mr Shaikh, who completed his two terms at the regulator, in his departing note said such unnecessary costs arising from inefficiencies should not be passed on to consumers. “Transferring such costs to consumers may lead to an industrial slowdown, reduced GDP growth, increased unemployment, pressure on the current account deficit, weakened socio-economic activities, and an overall deterioration in the quality of life across the country”, he said and demanded that the concerned companies and organisations should bear these inefficiencies themselves.
He pointed out that QTAs primarily reflected variations in the Power Purchase Price (PPP), including the impact of T&D losses. The data clearly showed lower plant factors for thermal power plants operating under ‘Take-or-Pay’ capacity contracts.

The directive came from the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, who expressed displeasure over rising taxes on mobile phones, noting that these institutions have wrongly classified mobile phones as luxury items.
The chairman urged both the FBR and Tax Policy Office to review current tax rates on mobile phone imports under the personal baggage and registration schemes. Mr Qamar said the report should be prepared by March 2026, enabling the committee to examine the matter comprehensively ahead of the next budget.

 

MNA Qasim Gilani criticised the heavy taxes on mobile phones, noting that consumers are forced to pay taxes again if their phones are lost or stolen. He highlighted that smartphones are already very expensive, citing a tax of Rs35,000 on older iPhone 6 models and Rs100,000 on iPhone 12 imports. “People are using smartphones for content creation, video sharing, and e-commerce,” he said, stressing their role in livelihoods.

FBR chairman claims smartphone taxes, prices have declined overall

MNA Sharmila Faruqi pointed out that the latest iPhone costs Rs350,000, with an additional tax burden of Rs190,000. FBR officials clarified that levies are applied on the price of devices rather than on specific models.
MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig said that a clear mechanism for taxation is essential, rejecting the notion that smartphones are exclusively for the wealthy.
The PTA chairman informed the committee that only six per cent of high-end phones are imported, while the majority are locally manufactured. He also announced that 5G licences are expected to be issued by February-March next year.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said that smartphone prices and taxes have declined overall, except for a few major brands. He reported that Rs82 billion in tax revenue was generated from mobile phones in the last fiscal year.
The committee suggested placing smartphones under the Eighth Schedule to provide relief to consumers. Tax officials explained that the Ninth Schedule currently applies to telecom, while the Eighth Schedule offers concessions. They added that, apart from Apple, most smartphones are now manufactured domestically.

The development comes days after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
Since then a war of words continued between the leaders of ruling party Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and PTI over the presser, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Imran had used “harsh language” in the past for members of the opposition, insisting that the party had no right to object to the comments by the military’s spokesman, while the opposition party emphatically deplored “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson against ex-premier Imran Khan, saying he was “not a security threat”.
PML-N MPA Tahir Pervaiz moved the resolution in the House, which was passed by the treasury members amid a boycott of the proceedings by PTI lawmakers. The resolution did not specifically name the PTI or its founder Imran.
“The institutions that safeguard Pakistan on every front and have successfully countered an enemy five times larger, such as India, are vital to the country’s integrity and stability,” said the resolution.
“A ban should be imposed on the political party and its founder for acting as a tool of the enemy state. He is also accused of making statements against the country and spreading chaos.”
The resolution demanded that action be taken against any leader, whether belonging to political or non-political groups, in accordance with the law, and that they be awarded “appropriate punishment”.
It also paid tribute to the personnel and leadership of the institutions working for Pakistan’s stability and security.
Earlier in 2024, the federal government decided to ban the PTI and sought Article 6 proceedings against Imran, ex-president Dr Arif Alvi, and former National Assembly (NA) deputy speaker Qasim Suri.
The move appeared to be an attempt to prevent the PTI from becoming the single largest party in the NA, following the apex court’s ruling in the reserved seats case. However, the government did not follow through with the ban.
In October, the federal government approved a ban on the religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) under the anti-terrorism act (ATA) following violent protests.
However, banning political groups is not a new practice in Pakistan. It has followed the country across decades — from martial laws to seemingly democratic setups.</p><small>2025-12-10 04:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1008271052d10d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960261/chinese-group-eyes-setting-up-solar-panel-plant-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Chinese group eyes setting up solar panel plant in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: China’s Hebei Juhang Energy Technology Group has expressed keen interest in establishing a large-scale solar panel manufacturing plant in Pakistan to cater to both domestic demand and export markets.
A Chinese delegation headed by the Group’s Chairman, Wang Jianbin, accompanied by representatives of China-Pakistan Business Forum, met Minister for the Board of Investment (BoI) Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, on Tuesday. The delegation conveyed its intention to invest billions of dollars in Pakistan’s solar energy and other high-tech sectors.
Welcoming the proposal, Mr Sheikh said it was “a great time and a golden opportunity for investment in Pakistan”. He highlighted the government’s commitment to improving the business environment, citing recent reforms launched by the prime minister to ease of doing business, including the new single-window Business Facilitation Centre (BFC) process for business facilitation.
As part of its facilitation package, the BOI informed the delegation that the government is prepared to allocate 6,000 acres of land for investment. The minister also briefed the visitors on Special Economic Zones (SEZs), which offer various incentives, including zero income tax for the first 10 years.

Mr Sheikh noted that Pakistan is on a path to economic stabilisation, with the stock market index having risen nearly four-to-five-fold over the past year. He reiterated that sectors such as agriculture, solar energy, information technology, chemicals, and manufacturing offer significant growth and export potential for foreign investors.
The meeting also reviewed outcomes of the second edition of the Pakistan-China B2B Investment Conference held in Beijing in September this year, which resulted in agreements and joint ventures worth $8.5 billion across multiple priority sectors.
The minister reaffirmed the BOI’s commitment to supporting Chinese investors and called for expediting feasibility studies and joint-venture agreements.
He emphasised that Pakistan remains a strategic partner for China and welcomes high-quality, green-tech investments that will generate jobs and promote sustainable economic growth.

This emerged on Tuesday.
The PAQI is an independent research and advocacy organisation committed to addressing air pollution in Pakistan.
The report, Unveiling Pakistan’s Air Pollution: A National Landscape Report on Health Risks, Sources and Solutions, provides the country’s first multi-sectoral emissions inventories and concludes that urban smog is overwhelmingly generated within Pakistan’s own airsheds.
“Toxic air pollution reduces the life expectancy of the average Pakistani by 3.9 years,” the report states.
The report draws on satellite-derived aerosol datasets, chemical transport modelling and PAQI’s nationwide real-time monitoring network, the largest open-data air-quality system in Pakistan, to map the sources, scale, and health impacts of PM2.5 across the country’s largest cities.
PM2.5 is a cancer-causing microparticle small enough to enter the bloodstream. The World Health Organisation (WHO) established an annual average limit at 5 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) and a 24-hour limit at 15 µg/m³.
The cities studied in the report include Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Peshawar, where the emission profiles identified for these cities are sharply different.
In Lahore, transport, industry and brick kilns are the dominant contributors to particulate pollution, while in Karachi, industry accounts for nearly half of PM2.5 emissions.

Emissions in the twin cities are primarily transport-driven, and Peshawar shows the highest per-capita exposure due to transit-trade activity and valley geography.
The report represents nearly a decade of work to build a transparent, evidence-based foundation for air quality governance in Pakistan.
The chapters situate the emissions inventory within a broader national conversation on constitutional rights, environmental justice, and institutional reform, with contributions from leading national voices such as former justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Senator Sherry Rehman, Abid Suleiri and others.
“This inventory ends the era of speculation,” said Abid Omar, Founder of PAQI. “For the first time, Pakistan has a rigorous, data-driven map of where its pollution comes from. The science is clear: our crisis is overwhelmingly local and structural. We now have the evidence. What Pakistan needs next is implementation.”
Punjab Environment Protection Agency (EPA) spokesperson Sajid Bashir rejected PAQI’s report about local factors causing the pollution and told Dawn that the organisation did not have adequate data to develop it.
He said that the government was spending billions of rupees to control emissions and more than 80 per cent of industry in Lahore had adopted technologies to reduce pollution.
Bashir also questioned the report and noted that it did not have accurate data about light and heavy transport vehicles, motorcycles, rickshaws and brick kilns operating in the country. He termed traffic and brick kilns as key contributors to pollution.
The EPA spokesperson also said that PAQI should disclose its sources, the origin of its satellite data and images, and the laboratory where all the data were analysed.
“They should reveal their sources about the credibility of the report and question why authorities should comment on their report,” he stated.
“The government had taken measures and the smog crisis was addressed to a large extent. Continuous efforts are being carried out to improve the situation further.
Bashir added that the government had not closed educational institutions due to smog this year and said that the report was criticising their efforts.
According to a PAQI analysis released last week, Lahore experienced a significant reprieve from extreme smog conditions this November compared to the hazardous emergency of 2024.
Data for November 2025 confirms a dramatic 56 per cent reduction in daily peak pollution intensity. The maximum daily PM2.5 concentration plummeted to 237 µg/m³, a stark contrast to the severe peak of 539 µg/m³ recorded on November 14, 2024.
In October, Lahore was ranked the second most polluted city in the world in terms of air quality, according to global monitor IQAir.</p><small>2025-12-10 03:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/100751206add325.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960263/na-speaker-invites-opposition-for-consultation-on-water-food-security' target='_blank'><strong>NA speaker invites opposition for consultation on water, food security</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: National Assem­bly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Tuesday said that opposition members would be invited to a national-level consultation to devise a joint strategy for water issues and food security.
“Safeguarding Pakistan’s future depends on the protection of water resources and addressing food security challenges. National unity and collaborative efforts are essential to finding sustainable solutions to these pressing issues. Resolving national challenges lies in inclusive dialogue and joint decision-making,” Speaker Sadiq emphasised.
The National Assembly speaker chaired a meeting on national challenges related to water scarcity and food security at the Parliament House.
The meeting was attended by members of the National Assembly, Wapda Chairman retired Lt-Gen Muhammad Saeed and senior officials from the Ministry of Water Resources.
During the meeting, Wapda chairman retired Lt-Gen Muhammad Saeed gave a detailed briefing on the country’s water challenges, available water reservoirs, ongoing projects, and future requirements.

Says national unity key to resolve pressing issues; Wapda chairman briefs legislators on challenges

Mr Sadiq said that water scarcity and food security were the most serious national issues that required urgent and effective measures from all stakeholders.
Due to the sensitivity of the subject, he stated, opposition members were also invited to the meeting to discuss and formulate a comprehensive national strategy.
According to media reports, Pakistan has reported significant fluctuations in the flow of the Chenab River after India abruptly released and then restricted water from the Baglihar dam.

 

Wapda’s data showed a sharp swing in river inflows over the past 24 hours, prompting renewed concerns over India’s “tampering” with Chenab waters.
According to Wapda, the Chenab witnessed a dramatic increase of 58,300 cusecs in water flow on Monday after India opened the Baglihar dam spillways. However, within the next 24 hours, the river recorded a drop of 48,000 cusecs, marking an unusually steep drop.
On Tuesday, the Chenab’s inflow stood at 10,100 cusecs, compared to 7,000 cusecs the previous day.
If India continued, officials warned, to restrict outflows from the Baglihar dam, Pakistan could face even lower water levels in the Chenab.
The pattern of sudden releases followed by abrupt stoppages has heightened downstream vulnerability and added stress to water management systems.
The NA speaker had made similar offers to the opposition in the past as well. In one such offer made last month, Mr Sadiq told a group of parliamentarians from the opposition parties that dialogue between the ruling and opposition parties was the only way forward to resolve issues.
However, no substantial headway has been made so far as differences between the two sides on several issues largely remain unresolved.

ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet has approved an additional Rs2.56 per litre margin for petrol and diesel to boost the profitability of oil marketing companies (OMCs) and their dealers.
A meeting of the ECC, presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, also tightened rules for second-hand vehicle imports and restricted the import of chloroform solely to drug companies certified by the regulator.







A senior government official told Dawn that the ECC approved a Rs1.22 per litre increase in profit margins for OMCs and Rs1.34 per litre for petroleum dealers, to be implemented in two equal instalments.
The first increase — 61 paise per litre for OMCs and 67 paise per litre for dealers — will take effect with the upcoming fortnightly price revision. This will immediately raise the OMCs’ margin to Rs8.48 per litre and that of dealers to Rs9.31 per litre.
The second equivalent increase will come into force on June 1, 2026, subject to digitalisation of sales and stock networks and their live connectivity with government bodies, including the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, Federal Board of Revenue and Petroleum Division.
After this increase, OMCs will charge Rs9.10 per litre while dealers will receive about Rs9.98 per litre, compared to the current Rs7.87 and Rs8.64, respectively.
An official statement said the ECC had approved revising margins for OMCs and petroleum dealers on petrol and high-speed diesel in line with the National CPI for 2023-24 and 2024-25, with increases capped between 5pc and 10pc.
It added that half of the margin increase would be paid immediately while the remaining half would depend on progress in digitalisation, with the Petroleum Division to report back by June 1, 2026.
Vehicle import procedure
The ECC also approved amendments to the vehicle import procedure, retaining only the Transfer of Residence and Gift Schemes, as proposed by the commerce ministry in consultation with other ministries. The Personal Baggage Scheme has now been discontinued.
Under the revised framework, commercial-import safety and environmental standards will apply to these schemes, the allowed import period will be extended from two to three years, and imported vehicles will remain non-transferable for one year.
The changes follow widespread misuse of the Personal Baggage, Transfer of Residence and Gift Schemes under the Import Policy Order (IPO) 2022 — originally intended for genuine overseas Pakistanis — and pressure from local assemblers facing quality competition and foreign exchange concerns.
The decision includes a one-year non-transferability condition for imported vehicles, though enforcement of such rules has historically been weak.
It also increased the minimum stay abroad requirement to three years with at least 850 cumulative days, and retains the condition that vehicles under the Transfer of Residence Scheme must be exported from the same country where the sender resides.
The ECC also approved restrictions on chloroform imports due to its toxic and carcinogenic nature, deciding that Trichloromethane (chloroform) will only be imported by pharmaceutical companies with a no-objection certificate from the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap).
The move follows demands from the Pakistan Footwear Manufacturers Association (PFMA) and the Pakistan Chemical Manufacturers Association (PCMA) for a complete ban, arguing that chloroform was being used as an adhesive in the footwear industry and posed serious health and environmental risks.
The ministries of industries and production, climate change, national health services regulations and coordination and FBR supported a complete ban, but Drap argued that chloroform was essential as a laboratory reagent and for quality control testing in pharmaceutical industries.
The ECC also rejected a concessionary gas/RLNG tariff claim by M/s Ghani Glass, saying that such subsidies were no longer permissible and that broader export-support initiatives were already underway.
The meeting approved a Rs1.28bn supplementary grant for the Pakistan Digital Authority to support digital transformation and technological innovation across government departments, and another Rs5bn supplementary grant for the Ministry of Housing and Works.
It also approved, in principle, the release of budgetary allocations for PIA Holding Company Ltd to meet pension and medical expenses of PIACL employees.

In these places, girls are sometimes withdrawn from school long before adulthood. Women weigh the risk of reporting abuse against the danger of staying silent. Families negotiate impossible choices shaped by economic hardship, honour, patriarchy, or fear.
This year, however, Pakistan enters Human Rights Day with a shift both significant and delicate. The country has taken formidable steps acknowledging long-standing harm. Balochistan passed a law prohibiting child marriage, setting the minimum age at 18 years. Islamabad enacted its own child marriage restraint law earlier this year. Most recently, Pakistan’s parliament adopted the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill, 2025, defining abuse in its full breadth and recognising at a federal level that violence inside the home is not a private matter but a public concern.

 

These measures arise directly from the experiences of women and children who have carried the weight of silence for decades. The significance of these laws lies in what they validate. For years, human rights organisations, health professionals, feminists and educators have documented the consequences of early marriage: girls forced into adulthood before their bodies or minds are prepared; interrupted schooling; increased health risks. Likewise, studies on domestic violence have shown how women face cycles of harm that leave lasting consequences.
By passing these laws in 2025, the state has acknowledged truths that survivors have voiced for years: that a child is not ready to be a bride; that abuse does not require visible injury; that silence is not consent. Yet legislation, no matter how well-crafted, does not dismantle the forces that produced these harms. The challenges are structural. The under-registration of births makes age difficult to verify. Poverty pushes families towards early marriage for survival. Social norms in many areas treat domestic control as customary. The justice system often responds slowly. Survivors fear police inaction, institutional lag, sometimes community backlash. Shelters are limited and under-resourced. Counselling services are scarce. Referral pathways remain unclear.

Human Rights Day should continue to focus on what remains at stake and not solely on what has been achieved.

Patriarchy also shapes the basic documents that orient family life. Nearly 90 per cent of nikahnama forms in the country leave key sections blank: age, the right to divorce, maintenance, erasing rights before a marriage even begins. This is a cultural logic that disregards the entitlements of women. The struggle is therefore not only against individual harm but also against a social order that normalises the erosion of women’s autonomy long before the law is invoked.

 

These realities have been documented for years and they explain why the distance between the law and lived experience has remained so wide. Implementation of the law must therefore be the focus of any honest conversation today. With commitment, these new laws could shift daily life in tangible ways — by keeping girls in school, enabling intervention when a child is at risk, reshaping police responses so that domestic violence is treated as a rights violation rather than as an interpersonal dispute, and by strengthening shelters and referral systems so that the survivors are met with protection rather than indifference.
More importantly, these laws create room to think differently about what is possible. They let us imagine girls being valued for their futures rather than exchanged for honour or debt; survivors met with support rather than dismissal; communities that understand safety as collective work. This kind of shift has been achieved elsewhere when legal reform, public education, and community organising move together. When political will meets social effort, change becomes tangible.
Human Rights Day should therefore continue to focus on what remains at stake and not solely on what has been achieved. The progress of 2025 is meaningful but it remains fragile. Without investment in enforcement, training, social services, and public awareness, the laws risk becoming symbolic rather than transformative. Without data collection, monitoring, and accountability, the country will not know whether the promises made this year are being kept. Without sustained attention, the momentum could fade, leaving the most vulnerable exactly where they were before.
So we need to build systems that ensure implementation. Train police officers, prosecutors, judges, protection officers. Strengthen shelters and counselling services. Support teachers and community workers who confront early marriage and domestic abuse in their daily work. Improve registration systems so that age cannot be manipulated. Engage communities respectfully, recognising that lasting change cannot be imposed but must be built through trust and a shared understanding.
The progress made this year offers a reason to believe that a different future is possible. The laws passed in 2025 should be understood as the beginning of that future. Their measure will be whether girls are able to complete their education; whether survivors are able to seek help without fear; whether communities feel empowered to protect rather than control; whether safety and dignity become expectations, and not exceptions.
This Human Rights Day, we stand at a crossroads where legislation has opened up pathways that were previously blocked. The responsibility now is to walk those pathways with seriousness, empathy, and resolve. The country has taken steps that honour the lives of those who waited too long for recognition. The challenge ahead is to ensure that these steps lead to lasting change.

Hardly any top political leader, even one who has held the highest state office, has been spared this abasement. The latest addition to the list is incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, who has been referred to as a “security threat” and as having a “delusional mindset” by the ISPR chief. This labelling of an individual who not too long ago held the country’s highest political office and still leads its largest opposition party is disconcerting. The comments came in the wake of highly provocative remarks by Imran Khan on social media. Yet it is not deemed appropriate for security circles to engage publicly in polemics regarding the issue.
While classifying certain political leaders as ‘security risks’ or ‘traitors’ cannot be justified under any pretext, many PML-N ministers have joined in the chorus against their political rival, forgetting what happened to their own leader just a few years ago. Nawaz Sharif faced similar accusations in his last term as prime minister during the ‘Dawn Leaks’ saga in 2016. Though there was no public declaration by security circles, a concerted campaign was nonetheless launched against a sitting prime minister, bringing him in direct confrontation with the powers that be. Not only was he forced to sack a minister as well as a special adviser, the scandal also contributed to his own ouster.

 

Nawaz Sharif also faced similar allegations when he lashed out at the then security leadership after the fall of his government; in contrast, Imran Khan was seen to come to power aided by the establishment in 2018. Ironically, Sharif, who is now viewed as politically kosher, and his party men echoed the charges against Khan and were in favour of the PTI being banned. The revenge game works well with extra-constitutional powers at the expense of constitutional democracy.
Asif Ali Zardari, during his first presidential term, had also been a target of a similar ‘security risk’ campaign in ‘Memogate’. Then, too, the PML-N was instrumental in the drive, which seemed to have been orchestrated by hidden forces. The bogey of ‘security threat’ has conveniently been used to destabilise civilian governments and discredit political leaderships. Unfortunately, political parties have been willing pawns in the game.
Perhaps the worst victim of such a campaign was Benazir Bhutto who was constantly targeted, whether in or out of power. It was well known that she was reluctantly handed over the reins of power, although her party swept the 1988 polls, and the conspiracy to oust her government was soon afoot. A smear campaign labelling her a ‘security threat’, spearheaded by the PML-N with the state’s backing, was launched.

It is unfortunate that our political leadership has not learnt any lesson from their own history.

Her meetings with the then Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi at the Saarc summit and her efforts to normalise relations with India were used to whip up a concerted propaganda against her as a ‘security threat’. The drive was accelerated after the failure of an establishment-backed vote of no-confidence against her government. I remember Gen Hamid Gul, then corps commander Multan, after having been removed as ISI head, telling me in early 1990 that by conducting Zarb-i-Momin, one of the country’s biggest military exercises, the security leadership had undercut her move towards evolving friendlier ties with India. Journalists from all over the country and outside had been invited to watch the exercise as a part of what was described as Pakistan’s ‘glasnost’ moment.
A few months later, her government was ousted via a ‘constitutional coup’. Benazir Bhutto was also falsely accused of passing sensitive information about Pakistan’s nuclear programme to the US. It isn’t difficult to see from where such news originates. Anti-state charges against political leaders and elected representatives can only undermine national security, and it is unfortunate that our political leadership has not learnt any lesson from their own history. Meanwhile, criticism of extra-constitutional actions should not be construed as an attack on security institutions.
Just a few years ago, Imran Khan was projected by the establishment as an alternative to a ‘corrupt political leadership’. The former prime minister also attempted to cast doubt on the patriotic credentials of his political opponents. With a turn in fortunes, he himself is now branded as a ‘security threat’ by the same elements who helped him rise to power.
While Khan’s present personalised campaign against the military leadership cannot be condoned, the treatment meted out to him and his party leaders also cannot be justified. We have seen polarisation deepening with the growing involvement of state elements. Last week’s press conference has only intensified the political confrontation in the country, with the perceived role of the security apparatus raising questions. At this time, total support from the public is required for the defence forces to successfully tackle the multiple internal and external security challenges that Pakistan faces; the worsening confrontation will only exacerbate an already volatile situation.
The deeply polarised politics inside the country and a widening trust gap between the public and state can undermine the strong support needed to end the existentialist threat from terrorism in two strategic provinces. Meanwhile, the growing tension between the PTI-led government in KP and the establishment is also a cause of concern given the surge in terrorism in the province and a war-like situation on Pakistan’s western border with Afghanistan.
More than ever, the country needs political reconciliation so that it can focus on tackling these challenges. Branding a former prime minister a ‘security threat’ or abusing the security forces will only compound the current crisis.

A media report, however, suggests that the lender’s approval could not have been possible without it granting Islamabad waivers as it had failed to meet certain key targets related to tax collection, BISP disbursements, primary budget surplus, and so on.
That said, the programme’s policy priorities continue to remain focused on maintaining macroeconomic stability, advancing reforms to strengthen public finances, enhancing competition, raising productivity and competitiveness, bolstering the social safety net, reforming SOEs, keeping inflation in check, and improving public service provision and energy sector viability. The Fund has also commended the authorities for “maintain[ing] stability and improv[ing] financing and external conditions” despite the catastrophic floods.

 

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has touted the approval for disbursement as validation of “collective sacrifice”, contending that political unity and public endurance had helped avert a sovereign default. That may be true. But what is being repeatedly framed as ‘economic recovery’ by Mr Sharif and his finance managers is far from what this refrain denotes.
The programme projections for the present fiscal year themselves tell a more sobering story: the firefighting phase may be over, but the path ahead is one of economic containment, not recovery. Inflation has eased, foreign exchange reserves are improving, the current account remains manageable, and the budget deficit is expected to narrow further. Technically, macroeconomic indicators have stabilised and the threat of default averted.
However, the hard-won gains stand on very weak foundations: debt rollovers from ‘friendly’ countries and remittances. The country remains trapped in a low-growth trajectory with the GDP increasing at a much slower pace than the population. Fiscal consolidation comes at a huge cost to the salaried class and compliant businesses; the external balance remains manageable thanks to significant growth in remittances and extensions in debt rollovers; and non-debt-creating foreign private investment hovers around 0.5pc of GDP in a country of 250m.
While investment, productivity and exports continue to fall, poverty levels are increasing, with international lenders saying nearly half the people now live below the poverty line. Unemployment is on the rise. Is this economic recovery?
Indeed, the government has pursued reforms under the IMF agenda. But most reforms can hardly be labelled as such, while others have barely scratched the surface of structural issues. That the government had to seek waivers for missing some targets speaks volumes about the painfully slow pace of reforms and the limited ability to tackle deep-seated systemic rot.

“Following the understandings and a directive of the political echelon, starting tomorrow (Wednesday) the transfer of goods and aid from Jordan to the area of Judea and Samaria and to the Gaza Strip will be permitted through the Allenby Crossing,” an Israeli official said in a statement, using the Israeli Biblical term for the West Bank.
“All aid trucks destined for the Gaza Strip will proceed under escort and security, following a thorough security inspection,” the official added.
Israel closed the crossing, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, in September. The crossing in the Jordan Valley reopened to travellers a few days later, but not to humanitarian aid destined for the Gaza Strip, devastated by more than two years of war.
Since the closure at Allenby, Jordan said it had been able to send some aid to Gaza via the Sheikh Hussein crossing, north of the occupied West Bank.

Hamas says Gaza ceasefire plan cannot proceed to its second phase as long as Israeli violations persist

The Allenby crossing is the only international gateway for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank that does not require entering Israel, which has occupied the territory since 1967.
Israeli continues ceasefire violations
In a related development, Hamas said on Tuesday that the Gaza ceasefire plan cannot proceed to its second phase as long as Israeli “violations” persist and called on mediators to pressure Israel to respect the agreement.
The US-sponsored ceasefire, in effect since October 10, halted the Israel-Hamas war, but it remains fragile as Israel and Hamas accuse each other almost daily of breaches.
Hamas political bureau member Hossam Badran accused Israel of failing to respect the Gaza ceasefire deal, noting that under its terms, Israel should have reopened the Rafah crossing with Egypt and increased the volume of aid entering the territory.
He urged the mediators, who include Egypt, Qatar and the US, to pressure Israel “to complete the implementation of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement”.
Under the terms of the deal, Palestinians committed to releasing the remaining 48 living and dead Israeli prisoners held in the territory. All of the prisoners have so far been released except for one body.
In exchange, Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinians in its custody and returned the bodies of hundreds of Palestinians.
The first phase of the truce also stipulates significantly more aid enter Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he expects the second phase of the deal to begin soon but Badran said it could not start “as long as the occupation (Israel) continues its violations”.
Under the initial steps of the ceasefire plan, Israeli troops withdrew to positions behind a so-called “Yellow Line” in Gaza, though they remain in control of more than half of the territory.
As Israel’s military chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, was quoted as saying that the demarcation line was the “new border line”, Badran slammed the comments. “The statements… clearly reveal the criminal occupation’s lack of commitment to the ceasefire agreement,” he said.
The second stage of the truce plan concerns disarming Hamas, the further withdrawal of Israeli forces as a transitional authority is established, and the deployment of an international stabilisation force.
Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the Israeli premier’s office said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet President Donald Trump in the United States on December 29.
It will be Netanyahu’s fifth visit to meet Trump in the US since the start of the year.

The organisations, inclu­ding Amnesty Interna­tional, Save the Children, Human Rights Watch and church groups, urged the government to bring the roughly 1,800 Afghans to Germany from Pakistan before the end of the year.
Those affected must be evacuated in the coming weeks to protect them from deportation back to Afghanistan, the groups said.
The Afghans were accepted under a refugee scheme set up by the previous German government, but have been stuck in Pakistan since conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office in May and froze the programme.
Around 350 people on the scheme have been able to come to Germany after winning legal challenges against the government in German courts.

UNHCR survey shows only 1.2m of 2m Afghans in Pakistan are registered

According to the open letter sent to the German government by the NGOs on Tuesday, most of those left in Afghanistan are women and children.
“Especially now, during the Christmas season, we remember humanity and compassion. Therefore, we appeal to you: finally bring those to whom we have promised protection to safety,” the letter said.
Those affected include those who served with German armed forces in Afghanistan, as well as journalists and human rights activists.
Germany says it has received assurances from the Pakistan government that the Afghans on the scheme would not be deported before the year end, but this deadline cannot be extended.
UNHCR data
According to the UN refugee agency data released on Tuesday, a population count of Afghans living in Pakistan revealed that they number over 2.18 million, out of whom 1.22m are registered, with only 35pc of registered Afghans living in refugee villages.
It shows over 1.09m registered Afghan refugees holding PoR cards. According to the UN body, this figure does not include 138,701 unregistered members of registered families.
The number of asylum seekers registered with the UNHCR is 115,652, out of which Afghans number 115,390. Others are from Yemen, Iran, Somalia, Myanmar and Syria.
“The statistics of registered asylum seekers have been revised as a result of verification exercise,” the UN refugee agency says.

In a post on X at 3:58am, the party said, “Pakistani authorities used water cannons to disperse Imran Khan’s sisters and peaceful PTI workers outside Adiala Jail, despite a court order allowing a meeting with the jailed former PM.
“This brutal crackdown on a peaceful sit-in violates basic human rights and freedom of assembly in freezing weather!” the party said. It also shared a video of a water cannon being used as people, bundled up against the cold, fled the scene.







In another post, the party said that Imran’s family was deliberately blocked from meeting him, which led to the sit-in.
It said that the use of water cannons was “not only a shameless violation of Imran Khan’s prisoner rights but also an outright assault on the constitutional rights of people who gathered to protest the regime’s atrocities”.
“International human rights organisations and champions of democracy must not stay silent in the face of such inhumane and authoritarian actions in Pakistan,” the party said.
In yet another post, Imran’s sisters Aleema, telling drenched participants of the sit-in, “Kids, ghabrana nahin hai (don’t panic) … its just water, don’t panic because of water.”







PTI stages sit-in
The sit-in, led by Aleema and also including Imran’s other sisters Uzma and Noreen, was staged outside the jail on Tuesday after she was once again denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Senior party members, including PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI KP Provincial President Junaid Akbar Khan, had also joined the demonstration.
Police had contacted Imran’s sisters twice and suggested that they leave. Later, a heavy contingent of police was deployed at the scene.







The PTI has made multiple attempts to meet the incarcerated party founder, being denied an audience each time by jail authorities despite a court order allowing meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
However, last week, the authorities allowed Uzma Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, to meet her incarcerated brother. After the visit, she said he was “perfectly fine”.
Speaking in video statements as she made her way to the prison on Tuesday, Aleema alleged that the state had been breaking the law, while maintaining that the PTI had done nothing illegal.
“If they do operate illegally and we do our work according to the law, and if they are right and we are wrong, then that shows just how our system works,” she said,







She then highlighted that Imran has not been allowed to meet his personal physician for the past 14 months.
“What is the issue in allowing one doctor to meet Imran Khan?” she asked. “When Nawaz Sharif went to jail, a doctor was with him all day, counting his platelets.
“What sort of system is this?”







Aleema then exited her car and began to walk towards Adiala jail, accompanied by a large crowd of party members and supporters. She made it to Gorakhpur Market on Adiala Road — roughly a kilometre southwest of the prison — before being stopped by riot police.
Sitting at the police barricade, Aleema delivered another statement on video.
“This is unconstitutional and illegal. Why are they keeping Imran Khan isolated and tortured?” she asked. “These people are violating the Constitution and breaking the law.
“We will not move from here; they can beat us with sticks or shoot us,” Aleema added. “Do what you will.”







Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan spoke to reporters at Dahgal, just up the road from the prison and urged authorities to allow meetings with Imran, stating that it would “improve the situation”.
“We have a right to come here, and there is a court order allowing us to be here,” Gohar argued. “We had an agreement and a consent order that family and legal counsel could meet him (Imran), but even today, we have been stopped.”
“There are a lot of things we are trying to do, but they are not in our control. But if we are allowed to meet, if he is allowed to meet his wife then it will improve the situation.”
Gohar also said that there cannot be division in the country and while there is disagreement in politics, there should not be hostility.
He left the area without meeting the PTI founder.
PTI Secretary General Raja said there was no excuse to bar Imran’s sisters from meeting him, as it is one’s right to meet relatives.
“No one can deny the right to meet by saying that Imran Khan’s message was shared outside,” he said.
PTI provincial president Akbar said that a large number of party workers and supporters reached Adiala Jail because of a challenge from Senator Faisal Vawda.
“We have come here prepared and are willing to sit here the whole night,” Akbar said. “We hope that the meeting will be arranged, but workers are charged and we are ready for a prolonged sit-in.”
He added that the distance between people and state institutions is increasing, stating that the PTI does not want the gap to grow.
“People have started hating you, so you should think wisely,” said Akbar. It remains unclear whom he was addressing.
Similarly, PTI MNA Shahid Khattak said that they were peaceful people and would demonstrate peacefully.
“I am a parliamentary leader of the PTI in the National Assembly and it is my right to meet Imran Khan,” he said. “Workers have arrived here just because they love Imran Khan and they think that only he can address the issues of Pakistan.”
Khattak also said that a policy should be made to address the issue of military operations in tribal areas.
“We have no objection to drone attacks, but drones don’t strike the right targets, due to which civilians are being killed. I suggest that the elders of tribal areas be involved in negotiating with the terrorists. In the past, we were having tea in Afghanistan and now Afghans have been declared enemies,” the MNA added.
Meanwhile, KP MPA Shafiullah Jan said that in the mainstream media, someone was saying that nobody would reach Adiala Jail.
“He should see that we have reached here,” he stated. “I think anger has grown among workers after the press conference of DG ISPR. We will sit here unless one of the sisters is allowed to meet with Imran Khan.”
Last Tuesday, Uzma was accompanied by scores of PTI supporters who gathered outside the jail as she went inside the prison to meet her brother.
When she exited, she delivered remarks on Imran’s behalf, which were later posted to his X account. These remarks were critical of army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir and prompted a fiery response from the military’s spokesperson last Friday, who branded Imran “mentally ill” and a “narcissist”.
Last Thursday the federal government barred Uzma and others from meeting Imran over alleged violations of the prison code.
“There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen,” said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar.
That same day, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the ninth time. He addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access and said he would update the media on the future course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not.
The next day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that “the gloves are off” and that anyone protesting outside Adiala jail, where PTI founder Imran Khan is currently incarcerated, would be dealt with harshly.
The minister said that strict action would be taken against any individual who creates a law and order situation outside the prison, including arrests and the registration of legal cases.</p><small>2025-12-10 02:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/100729002e96bf1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960264/ihc-issues-order-on-christian-sanitary-workers-rights' target='_blank'><strong>IHC issues order on Christian sanitary workers’ rights</strong></a><br><p>• Directs immediate protective measures for sewerage workers nationwide• Recognises repeated deaths of manual scavengers as grave rights violations• Over 70 workers killed since 1988 due to toxic sewer gas
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has directed the federal government to immediately implement protective measures for sewerage workers across the country, declaring the continued deaths of Christian labourers engaged in manual scavenging a grave violation of fundamental rights and a persistent failure of the state to fulfil its constitutional obligations.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas, in a detailed judgement issued on Tuesday, allowed a public interest petition filed by the Center for Rule of Law Islamabad Pa­­kistan (CROLI) and the Pakistan United Christian Movement (PUCM). The petitioners had sought enforcement of safety protocols, a ban on manual scavenging, and legislative reforms to safeguard the rights of sewerage workers, most of whom belong to the Christian community.
The court noted with concern that more than 70 Christian workers have died since 1988 due to exposure to poisonous gases in sewers, while civil society reports documented at least 10 dea­ths since 2019, primarily due to the abs­ence of protective gear. According to the National Commission for Human Rights and other rights bodies, over 80 per cent of sewerage-related jobs in Pakistan are held by Christians, despite their small share in the national population.
Justice Minhas observed that ministr­i­­es and departments, instead of acknowle­d­­ging their responsibility, attempted to evade accountability by shifting blame to one another. “Has the exercise of public of­­fice been reduced to mere evasion of du­­ty? Does the Constitution not guarantee eq­­ual protection to all citizens? Are the lives of sewerage workers less valuable than those of other citizens?” the judgement asked.
The court held that the state has a “solemn constitutional obligation” under Articles 9, 25 and 27 to protect the lives, dignity and equality of all citizens, including those performing hazardous work. It further noted that Pakistan’s commitments under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and domestic labour laws require the provision of safe working conditions.
The judge highlighted that sewerage workers are routinely exposed to toxic underground gases, risking collapse, death, organ damage and serious infections — dangers that are “entirely avoidable” through proper equipment, monitoring devices and safety protocols. The continued omission by state authorities, the court held, amounted to a “systemic deficiency” requiring judicial intervention.
Allowing the petition, the IHC directed the federal government to issue a circular to all federal and provincial ministries, autonomous bodies and regulated private entities, ensuring that workers engaged in sewer maintenance are provided with functional protective gear, gas detectors, ventilation arrangements and first-aid facilities.
The government must also ensure that similar measures are enforced in the private sector.
Additionally, the court ordered the Ministry of Law and Justice to initiate legislation — or amendments to existing laws — to safeguard the rights, safety, compensation and insurance coverage of sewerage workers.
Justice Minhas further required all respondents to submit compliance reports within two months to the Deputy Registrar (Judicial), confirming implementation of the court’s directives.
The judgement underscores what the court described as Pakistan’s “constitutional commitment to equality and justice,” emphasising that “a nation cannot progress while consigning its citizens to hazardous working conditions without the basic necessities required to perform the job and preserve health.”

Raja, who runs a YouTube channel and has positioned himself as a whistleblower, was accused of making multiple defamatory statements on social media, including allegations of corruption, electoral interference, judicial manipulation, and human rights abuse, all of which Brigadier (retd) Naseer strongly denied.
Judge Richard Spearman KC directed that the apology must remain on Raja’s social media accounts and website for 28 days. The court also ordered Raja to pay £50,000 in damages and £260,000 in legal costs by December 22.
The order was issued after Raja lost a defamation case in October, in which the court ruled that allegations he made against Brigadier (retd) Naseer were unfounded.
The judge had earlier directed Raja to publish a summary confirming that the statements were defamatory and that the retired military official had succeeded in his claim.
During the latest hearing, Raja’s request for permission to appeal the October judgment was rejected. His legal counsel indicated that he intends to take the matter to the Court of Appeal.
The court also issued an injunction preventing Raja from repeating the defamatory claims in the future.
Brigadier (retd) Naseer was present in court for the proceedings, while Raja was represented by counsel.
The case concerned 10 publications on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, in which Raja accused the retired officer of taking control of the Lahore High Court (LHC), influencing elections and bribing politicians.</p><small>2025-12-09 19:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0923550160dd67d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960149/record-breaking-faryal-farooq-sets-alight-national-games' target='_blank'><strong>Record-breaking Faryal Farooq sets alight National Games</strong></a><br><p>The sun burned with a fierce, summer-like intensity on the winter morning but it couldn’t temper the spirit of the competitors gunning for glory at the National Games on Tuesday.
The open field at the athletics venue hummed with simultaneous action — discus flying in one sector, hurdlers pacing in another. On the track, athletes bobbed and stretched, their shadows short under the midday blaze. In the stands, a scattered crowd fanned themselves, eyes darting between events.
The pool offered some respite from the blazing sun as swimming began at the Games on a day headlined by Commonwealth Games gold medallist Inam Butt extending his remarkable legacy by clinching his 18th national title — the most by any wrestler — and a national record for discus thrower Faryal Farooq.
Faryal’s feat was the culmination of a four-years effort; those long days of lonely training meeting minutes of razor-edged opportunity.
Through her first four throws, she was nowhere near the mark. The record, it seemed, would elude her once more.
Then, before her final attempt, her coach Ashraf Ali leaned in and told her he would be proud if she breaks the record.
Those words lit up the fire. Faryal spun, released, and the discus sailed — a silent arc against the blue clear sky. Every eye followed it until it thudded into the earth, well beyond the previous best. The official announced 38.21 meters — a new national record.
The crowd erupted. For Faryal, from Azad Jammu and Kashmir, it was ecstasy, the triumphant end of a quest.
“After hearing my coach’s words, I put everything into the final throw,” she told Dawn, breathless. “We get few opportunities to compete throughout the year, so I train all year for one event and try to leave my heart out in the field.”
While Faryal’s moment shone brightest, other stories unfolded across the scorched field, each adding a different hue to the day’s tapestry.
In the women’s 400m hurdles, Musarrat Shaheen of Wapda, hailing from Mianwali in Punjab, powered through the last 100 meters to claim gold.
Her smile afterwards was bright, but her words were sobering.
“It’s a killer sport,” she said while talking to Dawn, referring to the constant risk of injury.
Her hurdles weren’t just on the track. “Where I am from, there is that backward thinking that girls should stay in the house. Thankfully my family is supportive.”
For Qasim Fayyaz of the Army, from Chiniot, the 20km walk race was a battle against the clock and the elements. He finished seven minutes behind of his personal best, due to the extreme weather.
His routine reveals the brutal behind-the-scenes sacrifice: 90km of road running per week, twice-daily gym sessions in winter. “The body gets fatigued… We get very little time to rest. Focus on diet, which is very integral, is also not much.”
The drama of endurance played out differently in the men’s 400m hurdles, where Abid Razzak staged a late surge to snatch gold.
For most of the race, his Army team-mate Tajammul Hussain (silver) was on his neck, but Razzak hung on his shoulder. As the second-placed athlete faded in the final metres, Razzak pounced, edging ahead at the line.
“I practiced more than my team-mate — I guess those hours in training paid off today,” Razzak, who participated in the 2019 Asian Games, told Dawn. “This was my sixth national medal and hopefully there are more to come.”
Then there was the pure class of Olympian Faiqa Riaz. After winning the 100m the day before, she edged out HEC’s Khoula Umer Khan by a mere tenth of a second in the 200m, finishing in 25.10 seconds.
So intense was the effort that she collapsed onto the track afterwards, a world-class athlete laid low by the fight on home soil.
Earlier in the day, Wapda’s Iram Shehzadi had dominated the women’s 800m, while in the field, Amtul Rehman of HEC leapt to gold in the triple jump.
ARMY’S AQUATIC RULE
If the athletics arena was a stage for personal struggle, the swimming pool nearby was a display of sheer systemic dominance.
For a unit representing the armed forces on land, Army sure knew how to rule the waters. Their men’s team bagged only gold and silver in every event — 11 medals without a single bronze — while their women opened the day with five golds and a bronze.
Leading the charge were Olympians, past and present.
Paris Olympian Jehanara Nabi and Tokyo veteran Bismah Khan bagged two individual golds each, then teamed up to cruise to first in the women’s 4x100m relay.
Jehanara, the Lahore-born all-rounder now based in the UK, stormed to gold in the 400m Individual Medley a full 35 seconds ahead of her rivals.
Her Paris team-mate, the soft-spoken Ahmed Durrani — now based in Dubai — mirrored that with two individual golds and a relay win.
“I haven’t really tapered for this event, it’s more of a warm-up competition for me,” he told Dawn off-handedly, a quiet statement of his calibre.Yet, even in this procession of Army, there were flashes of defiance. Hamza Asif disrupted the perfect winning streak to claim the men’s 100m freestyle gold.
And Hareem Malik emerged as Sindh’s saviour, snatching the province’s only swimming gold in the women’s 200m breaststroke.
“It always means a lot when you can win for your team, that too with such high stakes,” the national record holder told Dawn, though she admitted a crammed season and exams had clouded her training.
Army had another triumph on the tennis court, where they downed arch-rivals Wapda — led by the legendary Aqeel Khan — 2-1.
Wapda lost the women’s team final by the same scoreline to Islamabad.
INAM’S 18TH GOLD
Inam claimed the 92kg freestyle gold with his Wapda team-mate Junaid Khan winning in the 57kg. The 70kg crown was shared by Punjab’s Abdullah and Army’s Baber Shah. Army’s Asadullah secured gold in the 79kg category.
In shooting, Navy enjoyed a strong outing as Aqib Latif won the 10m Air Rifle men’s individual gold, while Rasam Gul clinched the 25m pistol women’s gold. Olympian Kishmala Talat settled for silver for Army.
Navy also captured the women’s 25m pistol team title through Rabia Kabir, Rasam Gul and Lubna Amin.
Army secured the 10m Air Rifle men’s team gold, courtesy Sarfraz Gul, Mohammad Uzman and Sulaiman Khan.
In gymnastics, Wapda topped the standings with 264.95 points, followed by Army (260.05) and Higher Education Commission (HEC) (214.10).
Wapda’s Shah Jehan dominated the men’s individual apparatus finals, taking gold in the Rings and High Bar, while sharing the Floor title with Punjab’s M. Waqas.
Wapda’s Mohammad Afzal claimed gold in the Parallel Bars and jointly in the Vault alongside team-mate Shehzad Ali. HEC’s Faizan won the Pommel Horse.
In women’s fencing, HEC’s Kareema secured gold in the sabre-style event, while Balochistan’s Barira triumphed in the foil-style final.
In sailing, Navy and the Pakistan Air Force won the J80 Fleet Racing and J80 Match Racing gold medals, respectively.
AN ECHOING CALL
Beneath the individual medals and across disciplines, a collective refrain echoed — a stark reminder of the chasm between heart and support system.
Back on the field, Fatima, the javelin gold medalist from Faisalabad, pointed to the very tools of her trade.
“The international-level javelins are very expensive. We don’t have them here,” she revealed while talking to Dawn.
Her best throw of 42.38m was solid, but she knows the world touches 65 meters.
Waqas Akbar of Army, who dominated the men’s 800m from Vihari, praised the “fast track” in Karachi but lamented, “We didn’t get these types of track in our hometown or in the camps… If we get more hard tracks like these in training, we can be even better.”
From the pole vault pit, Mohammad Asif of Sargodha, who came within 14cm of a national record, simply said, “I really wanted to break it… I am now eyeing the next meet.”
The sentiment was clear: the ambition is there, the talent is visible, but the path is made steeper by what’s missing — whether it’s equipment, tracks or competitive exposure.
FALLING AND RISING
As the sun began to dip, the last track events concluded. In the 110m hurdles, Army’s Mohammad Naeem from Qasoor secured gold, crediting the rivalry with his team-mate for bringing out his best.
For him, the event was a metaphor bigger than a medal.
“It’s the test of pure grit,” he told Dawn. “More important than a medal is that you complete and do your best. You fall and get up, and that’s what really matters.”
His words lingered in the evening air, as the empty field and quiet pool settled into dusk. The athletes had given their all — some broke records in the sand and water, some broke personal barriers on the track, all confronted the gaps they cannot bridge alone.
They fell, they got up, and for one more day, they rose. The heat would return tomorrow. So would they.</p><small>2025-12-09 19:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/09231700486a2a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960146/bilawal-suggests-allowing-provinces-to-collect-taxes-says-it-will-ease-centres-financial-woes' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal suggests allowing provinces to collect taxes, says it will ease Centre’s financial woes</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Tuesday said that the country’s economy cannot be run with force and suggested that the federal government allow provinces to collect taxes to bolster the economy.
Speaking to journalists after meeting with the business community at the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), Bilawal also suggested that the provinces could directly collect sales tax, in view of independent reports about a Rs3 trillion leakage.
“Wherever you need our help at the level of the president of Pakistan, our governors, we are ready to do so for your district-wise economic uplift plan,” the PPP chief said.
“The prime minister also desires to work for this, but the difference between their approach and ours is that they believe in centralisation and we focus on decentralisation,” he added.
Bilawal acknowledged the business community’s concerns about high tax rates, but maintained that his party believes in collecting more taxes to strengthen the economy.
“Though the goal is the same, the problem is that the sitting and previous governments wanted to run the economy by force. We think that the economy cannot be run by force, but through a soft attitude,” he added.
“You can attract more bees with honey than vinegar. Therefore, if we make our tax rates competitive and give respect to taxpayers, instead of snubbing them or bringing them into the tax net by force, we can get better results,” Bilawal argued.







He recalled that a major example of tax collection was observed before the 18th Amendment was passed, when the federal government used to collect taxes on services through the Federal Board of Revenue and added how taxes were collected during that time.
“After the 18th Amendment, this subject was transferred to the provinces, and Sindh played a leading role, breaking all of the FBR’s previous collection records,” Bilawal stated. “Punjab and Balochistan also broke all records, but Sindh remained on top. It all happened due to decentralisation.”
He suggested that the government give tax-collecting responsibilities to provinces. If the provinces collected more than the targets fixed by the federal government, they would return the difference to the Centre.
“I think it will greatly help the federal government resolve its financial issues,” the PPP chairman maintained.
Bilawal appreciated the proposals presented by the FPCCI and termed them highly valuable, assuring that the PPP would extend its full cooperation through its policy advisory boards.







Speaking on the GSP+ status, he highlighted that this policy had led to an 80 per cent increase in Pakistan’s exports to Europe, while European exports to Pakistan rose by 60pc.
He expressed his desire to learn from Punjab’s business community and welcomed their positive and practical suggestions, noting that historical narratives are often misrepresented.
The PPP chief underscored the vital role of the business community in strengthening the economy and recalled that the PPP laid the foundation of CPEC.
He assured that his party would provide full support in addressing issues faced by the business sector and noted China’s keenness to promote Pakistani products in its markets.
Reaffirming his commitment, he said his party would continue to play an active role in resolving problems of traders and added that, during his party’s tenure, significant opportunities were created to enhance exports.
Bilawal also expressed pride in working closely with China and stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is equally committed to resolving the challenges faced by the business community.
Bilawal urged traders and industrialists to increase exports and stressed the collective need to expand Pakistan’s tax base.
He noted that the national challenges cannot be attributed solely to the IMF, acknowledging the difficulties in establishing economic zones, and expressed his commitment to working closely with the federal government to overcome these hurdles.
Implement consensus on new provinces before creating them: Bilawal
At a separate event, Bilawal advised the government to first implement a consensus on forming new provinces in the National Assembly before discussing creating 20 new ones.
“Before talking about creating 20 provinces, first implement the consensus that already exists for new provinces,“ he said in a talk with senior journalists at Bilawal House on Tuesday evening.
The PPP scion said that the Punjab Assembly had passed a resolution for the creation of a new province.
“There is already consensus in the National Assembly on forming new provinces,” he said, suggesting acting on the existing consensus for South Punjab first before moving forward.
“I only referred to the Punjab Assembly’s resolution. I cannot even think of dividing Punjab,” he said.
A recent campaign for new provinces in Pakistan has gained traction. Federal Minister Abdul Aleem Khan and former Lahore district nazim Mian Amer Mahmood advocated for dividing existing large provinces like Punjab and Sindh into smaller, more manageable administrative units for improved governance, service delivery and local development.
The PPP chief said that reconciliation was the only way forward for the country. “If we continue in an environment where we cannot even talk to each other, or if the situation in one province worsens, problems will multiply.”
To a question whether he would meet PTI founder Imran Khan in jail, Bilawal said: “I went to meet Nawaz Sharif in Kot Lakhpat Jail, and he even walked free after he launched attacks on us.“
In a reference to the PML-N’s insecurities towards the PPP, he said that when he came to Punjab, he did not speak against anyone, yet even that was not tolerated.
“I ask them (PML-N) to appoint their own governor in Sindh, but they don’t. It has always been a hallmark of the PPP that we remained democratic,” he said.
Commenting on Imran, he said the PTI leader was still stuck in the same mode when he was ousted from power in 2022.
“This is not only creating problems for the PTI but also puts the entire system under stress,” he said, adding that if matters continued this way, there would be no path toward political reconciliation.</p><small>2025-12-09 19:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638416-pti-rejected-ppps-repeated-offers-to-form-govt-says-musadik-malik' target='_blank'><strong>PTI rejected PPP's repeated offers to form govt, says Musadik Malik</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking during a ceremony held for the signing of several memoranda of understanding between Indonesia and Pakistan, PM Shehbaz detailed the pair’s discussions and said, “What we have decided is […] to promote our bilateral trade, culture, interact in the field of medical health, education, and vocational training.”







He assured the Indonesian president that Pakistan would “work closely” with Indonesia to achieve the decided targets.
The premier noted that Pakistan’s current bilateral trade with Indonesia stood at $4.5 billion, out of which more than 90 per cent accounted for palm oil imports.
“We have discussed how to take corrective measures to balance this balance of trade through agricultural exports from Pakistan, through exports of IT-led initiatives,” adding that the “trade gap” can be filled in many other areas as well.
The premier shared that the two countries had reached an agreement to send Pakistani doctors, dentists, medical professors and experts to Indonesia, which he said was establishing a “a large number” of medical colleges and universities.
“I assure you that whatever is possible for us in this [regard], we will do it without any delay and with great pleasure,” PM Shehbaz said, reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to its “brotherly nation.”
PM Shehbaz conveyed Pakistan’s “warmth and sincerity” to Indonesia in his address.
He noted that the Indonesian president’s visit coincided with the anniversary of Pakistan’s diplomatic relations with Indonesia.
On that note, the premier stressed, “Let us agree to celebrate these 75 years with great fanfare in Jakarta and in Islamabad simultaneously, that will convey a very loud and clear message to all and sundry.”
The prime minister recalled that the two nations’ relations “predated” their independence.
“Our founder, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, supported the war of independence of Indonesia while he was president of the All India Muslim League,” he said, lauding the “great heroic struggle of the Indonesian people.”
The premier continued: “Little did we know in 1965, our war against our neighbouring country, [Indonesia] stood with Pakistan like a rock, and this has gone into the annals of history in golden words.”
“It will be remembered by the people of Pakistan for all times to come,” PM Shehbaz added.
He also appreciated Indonesia’s “unwavering stand” on Gaza, stressing that it had “resulted in peace in that part of the world”.
“By the grace of god, bloodshed has stopped. However, Israel’s ceasefire violations continue,” the premier noted.
He insisted that it was “high time that we sit down and really put our heads together and stop this bloodshed over there for all times to come”.
Coming back to Pakistan-Indonesia relations, the premier voiced optimism that “the bond between Pakistan and Indonesia will continue to grow in strength, depth, and vision”.
He stressed that the president’s visit “will take these wonderful relations to a much higher level”.
In his concluding remarks, the prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to “cooperate” with Indonesia for progress and peace in the region.
Nishan-i-Pakistan awarded to Indonesian president
In a ceremony at the Aiwan-i-Sadr today, President Asif Ali Zardari conferred the Nishan-i-Pakistan — the country’s highest civil award — upon President Subianto, the Presidency said in a statement.
According to the statement, the investiture ceremony was attended by Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir, the air force and navy chiefs and members of the federal cabinet.
Before the investiture ceremony, President Zardari held a meeting with his Indonesian counterpart, “which focused on historic ties between the two countries, shared values and the long-standing foundations laid by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and [then-Indonesian] president Sukarno”, the statement read.
“Both presidents noted the longstanding ties between Pakistan and Indonesia and agreed that their relationship continues to rest on shared values and long-standing goodwill,” it added. “They expressed the intent to work more closely for peace, stability and prosperity.”







The pair also highlighted the value of working together on climate resilience, disaster management and sustainable development, given the shared challenges facing the two countries. They also discussed areas where economic cooperation could expand, such as renewable energy and tourism.
“The president (Zardari) highlighted the need for more balanced market access and diversification of Pakistan’s exports. Both sides welcomed the establishment of the Joint Trade Committee as a useful forum for addressing trade issues and encouraging business linkages,” the statement read.
The pair also agreed on strengthening defence cooperation through both joint training and production, while also reaffirming cooperation in addressing issues like Islamophobia and Muslim unity.
President Zardari also expressed his condolences for those killed in floods that swept through Indonesia’s Sumatra island, according to the statement.
“While underscoring the need for peace, security and prosperity for the region, the President briefed the visiting dignitary on the situation in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK),” the statement read.
President Subianto hails ‘historic brotherly relations’
Meanwhile, President Subianto, at the outset of his speech, expressed his gratitude and appreciation for the warm reception he had received in Pakistan.

He thanked PM Shehbaz for receiving him in person along with President Zardari.
Echoing PM Shehbaz’s remarks, he said, “Today we have had very productive meetings. We have achieved many agreements in various fields, and we have addressed matters of mutual interest between us.”
“We have common values, we have common interests; we are both maybe the biggest Muslim countries in the world,” Subianto said.
“But our Islam is moderate Islam, which promotes inclusivity, tolerance.”
He added that the historic and brotherly relations between the two countries were “solid”.
“I think it is very important for us in the coming days and coming years that we make use of this history, make use of this brotherly bond, to benefit our people in most fields.”
He particularly expressed his gratitude that Pakistan was willing to help Indonesia in the field of health by sending doctors, professors and experts to assist in strengthening its health sector.
“We have a very vast need [for] doctors and dentists, and I am starting a massive programme of education in this field, so your assistance will be very strategic and critical for us,” he said.
Subianto also said that he had instructed his ministers to expedite the rebalancing of Pakistan-Indonesia trade relations “in practical terms” and assured the prime minister that “we want to move as fast as possible in all these fields”.
Additionally, the Indonesian president said that the two countries would be coordinating their foreign policy as they had a common stance and common principles, “especially towards Palestine”.
“Our foreign ministers are closely in contact with each other […] we will always maintain a common stance in this regard,” he said.
“Once again, we will not waver in our support for a two-state solution in Palestine.”
I think, going forward, […] I feel very optimistic, I feel very bullish,” he said.
Prabowo concluded by expressing his hope to officially invite Shehbaz to visit Indonesia, along with Pakistan’s other leaders, hoping to “provide assistance and advice on how the two countries could advance their cooperation.”
Meeting with Field Marshal Munir
Later in the day, Prabowo also held a meeting with Field Marshal Munir.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “during the meeting, matters of mutual interest, regional security, and bilateral defence cooperation were discussed.”Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to further strengthen existing ties between the armed forces of the two brotherly countries.

“The visiting dignitary appreciated the professionalism of the Pakistan Armed Forces and acknowledged Pakistan’s role in promoting regional peace and stability,” the statement said.
Field Marshal Munir reiterated that Pakistan values its longstanding relations with Indonesia and is committed to expanding defence collaboration in training, counter-terrorism, and capacity-building domains, it added.
Guard of honour
President Subianto, who is currently on a two-day official visit to Pakistan, was earlier presented a guard of honour upon his arrival at the Prime Minister’s House in Islamabad.
According to Radio Pakistan, a formal welcome ceremony was held for Subianto, who was received by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“A smartly turned out contingent of armed forces presented a guard of honour to the visiting dignitary,” it said.
The Indonesian president arrived in Islamabad yesterday at the invitation of PM Shehbaz.
In a post on X, the premier had said he was honoured to host President Subianto and looking forward to “our meaningful engagements tomorrow as we work to strengthen this enduring partnership”.







According to the Foreign Office (FO), this is the president’s first visit to Pakistan, as the last presidential visit was by ex-president Joko Widodo in 2018. The FO also said that the visit carried added significance as it coincided with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Indonesia.
President Prabowo will also meet President Asif Ali Zardari during his stay. Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir will also call on the Indonesian president, the FO said.</p><small>2025-12-09 16:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638381-imran-khans-sisters-stage-sit-in-after-being-denied-meeting-at-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Police forcefully end sit-in staged by Imran Khan's sisters near Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>

Several global corporations have announced large investments this year in the South Asian nation, which is projected to have more than 900 million internet users by year’s end.
“To support the country’s ambitions, Microsoft is committing US$17.5B (billion) – our largest investment ever in Asia – to help build the infrastructure, skills, and sovereign capabilities needed for India’s AI first future,” Nadella said in a post on X.
Nadella made the announcement on social media after he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, thanking the leader for “an inspiring conversation on India’s AI opportunity”.In a statement, Microsoft said the investment would be spread over four years.







“Together, Microsoft and India are poised to set new benchmarks and drive the country’s leap from digital public infrastructure to AI public infrastructure in the coming decade,” the statement said.
The tech giant said one of the key priorities of its investment plan was “building secure, sovereign-ready hyperscale infrastructure to enable AI adoption in India”.
“At the heart of this effort is the significant progress being made at the India South Central cloud region, based in Hyderabad – that is set to go live in mid-2026,” Microsoft added.
The planned cloud region is twice the size of the iconic Eden Gardens stadium in India’s eastern city Kolkata, which has a capacity of over 65,000 people.
Microsoft said the latest announcement “builds on” a previous investment pledge Nadella had made earlier this year, committing $3 billion for AI and cloud infrastructure in India over the next two years.
Modi said he was “happy” that the tech giant had chosen India as the destination for its largest investment in Asia.
“The youth of India will harness this opportunity to innovate and leverage the power of AI for a better planet,” the prime minister said in a post on X.
“When it comes to AI, the world is optimistic about India,” Modi added.
Tech giants
Global technology giants are aggressively courting more users in India, the world’s most populous country and fifth-largest economy.
A special area of focus has been artificial intelligence with US startup Anthropic in October unveiling plans to open an office in India. Its chief executive Dario Amodei has also met Modi.
The same month, Google said it will invest $15 billion in India over the next five years, as it announced a giant data centre and artificial intelligence base in the country.
OpenAI has said it will open an India office, with its chief Sam Altman noting that ChatGPT usage in the country had grown fourfold over the past year.
AI firm Perplexity also announced a major partnership in July with Indian telecom giant Airtel, offering the company’s 360 million customers a free one-year Perplexity Pro subscription.
But India’s bid to become a global technology and artificial intelligence hub is colliding with increasingly tightening digital regulations.
According to recent media reports, authorities are drafting plans to ensure that manufacturers enable satellite location tracking in smartphones that cannot be turned off by users - a proposal that rights groups have raised the alarm over.</p><small>2025-12-09 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/091421547f2b04e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960120/us-to-allow-nvidia-h200-chip-shipments-to-china-trump-says' target='_blank'><strong>US to allow Nvidia H200 chip shipments to China, Trump says</strong></a><br><p>The United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors, its second-best artificial intelligence chips, to be exported to China and collect a 25 per cent fee on such sales, US President Donald Trump said on Monday.
The decision appears to settle a US debate about whether Nvidia and rivals should maintain their global lead in AI chips by selling to China or withhold the exports, though Beijing has told companies not to use US technology, leaving it unclear whether Trump’s decision would lead to new sales.
Nvidia shares rose 2pc in after-hours trading after Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, following a 3pc rise during the day on a report by Semafor.
Trump said in his post that he had informed President Xi Jinping of China, where Nvidia’s chips are under government scrutiny, about the move and that he “responded positively.”
He said the US Commerce Department was finalising details of the arrangement and the same approach would apply to other AI chip firms such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.
Trump’s post said the fee to be paid to the US government was “$25 per cent”, and a White House official confirmed he meant 25 per cent, higher than the 15 per cent proposed in August.
“We will protect national security, create American jobs, and keep America’s lead in AI,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
“Nvidia’s US customers are already moving forward with their incredible, highly advanced Blackwell chips, and soon, Rubin, neither of which are part of this deal.”
Trump did not say how many H200 chips would be authorised for shipment or what conditions might apply, only that exports would occur “under conditions that allow for continued strong national security.”
Administration officials consider the move a compromise between sending Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips to China, which Trump has declined to allow, and sending China no US chips at all, which officials believe would bolster Huawei’s efforts to sell AI chips in China, a person familiar with the matter said.
“Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” Nvidia said in a statement.
Intel declined to comment. The US Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, and AMD did not respond to requests for comment.
A White House official said that the 25pc fee would be collected as an import tax from Taiwan, where the chips are made, to the United States, where the chips will undergo a security review by US officials before being exported to China.
Asked about the approval on Tuesday, the Chinese foreign ministry said that China believes it should cooperate with the US to achieve mutual benefits.
Fears of chips strengthening China’s military
China hawks in Washington are concerned that selling more advanced AI chips to China could help Beijing supercharge its military, fears that had first prompted limits on such exports by the Biden administration.
The Trump administration had been considering greenlighting the sale, sources told Reuters last month.
Trump said last week he met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and that the executive was aware of where he stood on export controls.
“It’s a terrible mistake to trade off national security for advantages in trade,” said Eric Hirschhorn, who was a senior Commerce Department official during the Obama administration.
“It cuts against the consistent policies of Democratic and Republican administrations alike not to assist China’s military modernisation.”
According to a report released on Sunday by the non-partisan think tank, the Institute for Progress (IFP), the H200 would be almost six times as powerful as the H20, the most advanced AI semiconductor that can legally be exported to China, after the Trump administration reversed its short-lived ban on such sales this year.
The Blackwell chip now in use by US AI firms is about 1.5 times faster than H200 chips for training AI systems, the IFP said, and five times faster for inferencing work where AI models are put to use. Nvidia’s own research has suggested Blackwell chips are 10 times faster than H200 chips for some tasks.
Several Democratic US senators in a statement described Trump’s decision as a “colossal economic and national security failure” that would be a boon to China’s industry and military.
Republican Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the House China Select Committee, said in a statement to Reuters that China would use the chips to strengthen its military capabilities and surveillance.
“Nvidia should be under no illusions – China will rip off its technology, mass-produce it themselves and seek to end Nvidia as a competitor,” he said.
In recent months, Beijing has cautioned Chinese tech companies against buying chips that Nvidia downgraded to sell to the Chinese market, which are the H20, RTX 6000D and L20, two sources said.
George Chen, partner at consultancy The Asia Group, said he expected Chinese regulators to soften their hardline approach to Nvidia following Trump’s comments on Xi’s reaction, given efforts to improve US–China relations. The H200 was also far more useful to China than the H20, he said.
“I expect state media to gradually change their narrative and be more welcoming to Nvidia,” he said.
Bo Zhengyuan, political analyst at consultancy firm Plenum, said he also believed that Beijing would be more cautious about intervening.
“But on a longer horizon, we don’t know how long this window can last. China will not be disturbed by this easing, and it will remain ultra-focused on gaining advanced chip-making capability of its own,” he said.
China’s domestic AI chip companies now include tech giant Huawei Technologies as well as smaller players such as Cambricon and Moore Threads.</p><small>2025-12-09 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/09174710070c60b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960128/as-militancy-surges-in-kp-police-ask-for-special-allowance-to-enhance-morale-of-force' target='_blank'><strong>As militancy surges in KP, police ask for special allowance to ‘enhance morale’ of force</strong></a><br><p>As militant attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa surge, the provincial police force has asked the government to grant a special allowance to its personnel, which would cost around Rs4.2 billion per month.
Attacks on police personnel have increased by around 56 per cent during the current year.
In this regard, the Central Police Office (CPO) moved a summary to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.
The summary stated that the provincial government prioritised the enhancement of police capacity and welfare in view of militancy and security challenges.
“Due to the government’s focused efforts and effective administrative measures, not only has the law and order situation improved, but the government’s overall public image has also strengthened,” the summary read.
The summary further stated that special financial incentives, such as a militancy allowance, were being provided to police personnel in view of the grave risks, operational responsibilities, and constant exposure to threats they face on a routine basis.
It added that these measures were intended to boost the morale of the force and enable them to discharge their duties with greater confidence.
The summary further stated that KP police continuously confronted terrorists and insurgents, often at great personal risk, due to their role on the front lines.
“KP police have made countless sacrifices, including the loss of precious lives and serious injuries,” the document reads.
The department pointed out that police duty in the province remained extremely risky, and exposed personnel to the threats of bombings, targeted attacks and other violent activities carried out by extremist elements.
It further stated that the KP police were currently performing their duties without any additional financial incentive, despite the challenging security environment and the operational nature of their assignments, in view of the continuous high-risk duties performed by all cadres of the force.
It was proposed that a special allowance, equivalent to one basic pay, be granted to all ranks of the provincial force.
“The provision of this allowance will not only recognise the extraordinary services and sacrifices of KP police but will significantly enhance their morale, efficiency, and motivation in carrying out critical security operations throughout the province,” the summary stated.
The summary stated that the special allowance would amount to Rs4.2bn per month.
Data showed that attacks on police personnel have increased by 56 per cent during the first 11 months of the current year as compared to the corresponding period of last year.
Till December 1 of this year, 137 KP police personnel were martyred, while 236 were injured in 510 incidents, as compared to the same period of 2024, in which 147 personnel were martyred in 327 attacks.
According to the police officials, the casualties during the current year have decreased by 7pc due to the police department’s focus on strengthening check posts, police stations and up-armouring of vehicles.
According to officials, the number of militant attacks repelled at police installations increased by 102pc. Police personnel repelled 320 attacks during the current year, compared to 158 last year
“This showed a high level of training, rapid response capacity and effective operational strategy,” an official said.
In addition, the KP police’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted 2,791 intelligence-based operations (IBOs), arrested 1,244 terrorists, and killed 420 during the first 11 months of the year — an increase of 61pc and 43pc, respectively. The CTD also arrested 25 high-value targets.
On Monday, KP CM Afridi handed over the newly-purchased armoured vehicles, modern weapons and security gadgets to the police at an event at the Malik Saad Shaheed Police Lines.
The equipment includes drones, anti-drone guns, anti-drone systems, thermal cameras, jammers, body armour, ballistic helmets, armoured vehicles, sniper rifles, Dragunov marksman rifles, M-16s, sub-machine guns, heavy machine guns, and various other advanced security tools, according to a statement.

Displaced children chased each other on the tarmac of Thailand’s Chang International Circuit race track, where hundreds of families were sheltering in vast silo-shaped tents.
“I want the government to deal with this decisively so it stops for good,” said handyman Boonsong Boonpimay at the racecourse in Buriram city, 70 kilometres from the fraught frontier.

 

“Otherwise we’ll have to keep living like this — unable to work and constantly on edge,” the 51-year-old told AFP.
Thailand and Cambodia have a long-standing dispute over portions of their boundary dating back to their colonial-era demarcation.

Five days of combat in July killed dozens of people and displaced around 300,000 on both sides of the border before a truce took effect.
But all-out fighting flared again along their jungle-clad frontier this week — with Thailand launching air strikes and Cambodia announcing retaliatory attacks on Tuesday.
At least seven Cambodian civilians and three Thai soldiers have been killed so far, according to officials, while more than 125,000 people have been evacuated on the Thai side alone.
Chang International Circuit owner Newin Chidchob told AFP he was ready for the surge of his displaced compatriots, sceptical this summer’s armistice would hold.

“After the clashes last time, when things quieted down, and villagers returned home, we did not believe it would truly be peaceful,” the former MP said.
“So we worked with the province to set up this system and prepare the site, because we felt that real peace or stability was unlikely.”
‘Ears open all the time’
Thai and Cambodian troops laid down their arms in July after intervention by US President Donald Trump as well China and Malaysia — current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Conflict monitors said a follow-on pact failed to adjudicate their core conflict, but Trump nonetheless touted it as a major peace-making achievement of his presidency.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has said he nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for halting the violence.
But cradling her five-year-old son at a makeshift shelter at a temple, Cambodian Ros Sambok lamented how her life was still being uprooted by the conflict.
“It is my third time fleeing home, and we have been on alert every day,” the 31-year-old said. “I just want peace so the kids can go to school together.”
She fled with around 20 family members from her village, about seven kilometres from the front line, on Monday morning — but her mental peace has remained broken since the original clashes.
“I could barely sleep in recent months. Authorities told us to be ready all the time,” she said.
“It is not easy. Our ears [are] open all [the] time.”
Though divided by a contested border, Thai evacuees expressed near-identical complaints about the conflict disrupting their lives again after a brief interlude of peace.
“We live day to day, and we have debts and children to take care of,” said 60-year-old Thai rubber farmer Painee Khengnok, displaced from the borderland where he earns his keep.
“Whatever the government needs to do, I just want them to solve this quickly so we can get back to making a normal living.”</p><small>2025-12-09 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/091541197bd4e74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960122/ihc-declares-plea-questioning-legitimacy-of-justice-jahangiris-law-degree-maintainable' target='_blank'><strong>IHC declares plea questioning legitimacy of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree maintainable</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) declared on Tuesday a petition seeking the verification of Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s degree maintainable and sought a reply from the judge on the matter within three days.
The petition questioning the legitimacy of the LLB degree of the IHC judge and seeking a judicial determination on whether he lawfully held office as a high court judge was filed by lawyer Mian Daud. The court had reserved its decision on the maintainability of the plea in July last year.
The case against Justice Jahangiri centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
A two-member IHC bench, comprising Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan, issued the verdict today after hearing arguments on the matter.
During the hearing, Ahmed Hassan Shah, who was representing the District Bar Association, contended that the matter should be referred to the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC), which issues licences to lawyers. He also argued that allegations of misconduct against any judge fell under Article 209 of the Constitution, which covers the subject of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
At that, CJ Dogar observed that the case did not pertain to misconduct but the eligibility of a judge to hold office.
However, the lawyer insisted that the SJC — the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges — was the right forum for the matter.
He further argued that Article 199 — the constitutional provision that deals with the jurisdiction of the high court and under which Daud’s plea was filed — should not be invoked where Article 209 could apply.
The lawyer argued that the “judges cannot proceed against one another”.
“The court cannot exercise its jurisdiction under Article 199 in competing circumstances,” he argued.
While presenting his arguments, Aleem Abbasi, who was representing the IBC, contended that while Article 209 could be applied in various matters, a “new trend” seemed to be emerging.
He said that Justice Jahangiri held three licences, and the matter of his qualification needed to be addressed by a competent authority.
Abbasi reminded the court that an intra-court appeal was pending — seemingly a reference to a plea filed in the Federal Constitutional Court by five IHC judges, including Justice Jahangiri — and the appointment of one of the judges hearing the case had previously been questioned.
“Your lordship may help him if a judge is being arm-twisted,” he further remarked.
For his part, amicus curiae Barrister Zafarullah Khan raised questions regarding the maintainability of the plea. He also raised the question whether the case should proceed under Article 209 or Article 199.
Highlighting that the case concerned the “integrity of a judge”, he noted that sub-clause 5 of Article 199 excluded courts and sub-clause 3 excluded the armed forces.
Moreover, he pointed out that the Supreme Court (SC) had also previously dealt with the matter at hand.
At that, CJ Dogar remarked that the SC had directed the IHC to proceed with the plea. He also observed that a writ of quo warranto could be issued against a judge.
The term quo warranto refers to legal action requiring a person to show by what warrant an office is held.
During the hearing today, Advocate General Ayaz Shaukat read out a report by the University of Karachi.
At the previous hearing, the Higher Education Commi­ssion (HEC), in its detailed report submitted to the IHC, had endorsed KU’s findings that the LLB degree of Justice Jahangiri was obtained through unfair means.
In its submission, the HEC enclosed KU’s inquiry report that revealed glaring discrepancies in the judge’s academic record.
Reading the report today, the advocate general said Justice Jahangiri had been debarred from appearing in an LLB exam for three years in 1988, but he still sat an exam under a different name.
At that, Abbasi argued that the Sindh High Court had suspended the KU notification cancelling the judge’s degree.
CJ Dogar, however, observed that the degree had not been restored.
The court then declared the plea questioning the legitimacy of the judge’s law degree maintainable and issued notices to the respondents, directing them to submit their replies within three days.
KU inquiry report
The KU’s report stated that candidate ‘Tariq Mehmood’ obtained an LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968, but records showed that another student, Imtiaz Ahmed, had been enrolled under the same number in 1987, while the transcript for LLB Part-I was issued in the name of ‘Tariq Jahangiri’.
The report added the judge had also enrolled for LLB Part-I under a second enrolment number, 7124 — a violation of the university’s rules, which permit only one enrolment number for the entire duration of a degree programme.
The inquiry committee refrained from labelling the degree as ‘bogus’, but it declared the credentials invalid on account of multiple identities and conflicting enrolment records.
The KU alleged the judge “used and appeared in LLB examinations on false identities having different enrolment numbers of Karachi University in collusion with university staff”. It further stated that he had “personified different other regular/ex-regular students of Islamia College, i.e., Mohammad Naeem­uddin, son of Mohammad Moinuddin, and Imtiaz Ahmed.”
As a result, the university declared the candidate guilty of using unfair means, cancelled the result, and imposed a three-year ban, allowing him to reappear in examinations in 1992.
Protracted legal trajectory
The controversy around Justice Jahangiri’s law degree has followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.</p><small>2025-12-09 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/090804010367f8c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960098/imf-sees-pakistan-stepping-back-from-default-risk' target='_blank'><strong>IMF sees Pakistan stepping back from default risk</strong></a><br><p>The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections for Pakistan suggest that the immediate risk of economic free fall has eased but the country remains locked into a narrow stabilisation path marked by weak growth, heavy debt and limited relief for households.
Projections by the Fund, released early on Tuesday alongside the statement announcing a fresh disbursement of around $1.2 billion to Pakistan, showed that the country’s economic growth was projected to inch up from 2.6 per cent in FY2024 to 3.2pc by FY2026, a pace that barely matches population growth in the country of 240.5 million people.
With a per capita income of $1,677, this trajectory points more to economic containment than recovery.
Pakistan’s population also continues to grow at a high pace, with mid-2025 official figures citing 2.55pc, while World Bank data points to 1.8–1.9pc. Though slightly lower than past peaks, the rate remains a significant development challenge.

 

Pakistan, however, appears to have made the most striking turnaround in inflation. After averaging 23.4pc in FY2024, consumer prices are estimated to have fallen sharply to 4.5pc in FY2025, and projected to rise to 6.3pc in FY2026.
End-period inflation is also projected to ease from 12.6pc in FY2024 to 3.2pc in FY2025, before climbing to 8.9pc in FY2026. The disinflation reflects tight monetary policy, lower subsidies and compressed demand under the IMF programme, though the projected rebound suggests price stability remains fragile.
Labour market conditions offer limited comfort. Unemployment is projected to fall only modestly from 8.3pc in FY2024 to 7.5pc in FY2026, underscoring the weak job-creating capacity of the current growth path.
On the fiscal front, the adjustment underway is substantial. Government revenue and grants are projected to rise from 12.7pc of the gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2024 to 16.3pc by FY2026, while expenditure is expected to remain near 20pc of GDP.
As a result, the budget deficit is projected to narrow from -6.8pc to -4.0pc of the GDP. Pakistan is also projected to maintain a primary surplus rising to 2.5pc of the GDP, a central IMF benchmark.
Despite this tightening, the public debt burden remains heavy. Total general government debt, including IMF obligations, is projected to hover around 72–73pc of the GDP, while government and guaranteed debt is expected to stay near 76pc.
Domestic debt accounts for nearly half of the GDP, keeping interest costs elevated amid high domestic borrowing rates.
External pressures have eased but vulnerabilities persist. The current account balance is projected to remain close to zero, shifting from a 0.6pc of GDP deficit in FY2024 to a 0.5pc surplus in FY2025, before slipping back into a small deficit in FY2026. Foreign exchange reserves are projected to rise from $9.4bn in FY2024 to $17.8bn by FY2026, lifting import cover from 1.6 months to 2.7 months — an improvement, but still short of comfortable levels.
Foreign investment, however, remains subdued. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is projected at just 0.5–0.6pc of the GDP throughout the period under review, pointing to persistent investor caution despite improved macro stability.
Monetary conditions also remain tight. Broad money growth is projected in the 14–16pc range, while private sector credit growth, though improving from 6pc to 15pc, remains constrained by high interest rates. The six-month treasury bill rate stood at 21.5pc in FY2024, reflecting the heavy cost of domestic borrowing.
Meanwhile, the 15.4pc real effective appreciation of the rupee in FY2024 signals a shift towards currency stability after a period of sharp depreciation, though it also carries risks for export competitiveness in an economy where textiles, valued at $17.3bn, remain the dominant export.
Taken together, the IMF projections depict an economy that has regained short-term stability through sharp fiscal and monetary adjustment, but remains burdened by high debt, weak investment and slow employment growth.
The immediate crisis may have passed, but the challenge of translating stabilisation into sustained, inclusive growth remains unresolved.
‘Stability achieved, more efforts needed for growth’
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has termed the latest IMF disbursement a “proof that Pakistan is making progress in implementing the necessary steps for economic stability and growth”, according to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan.
A statement carried by Radio Pakistan further quoted the premier as saying that “the IMF’s expression of satisfaction with the effective implementation of economic reforms and measures in Pakistan is a clear testament to the hard work of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and his team”.
The statement added that the PM also acknowledged that Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir “played a key role in supporting the implementation of the reform agenda and paving the way for Pakistan’s economic development”.
He said that steering the country from the brink of default toward stability and growth was a “challenging phase, requiring collective sacrifice from everyone”.
“Political parties sacrificed politics, and the nation endured economic hardships to make the impossible possible,” he was quoted as saying.
Moreover, PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction that Pakistan’s economic reforms and digitisation [process] had “become a successful case study and an example for the world”, the statement said, adding that the premier also expressed the confidence that the “dream of Pakistan’s economic development will soon be realised”.
He said that while “stability had been achieved, more efforts are needed to move the economy toward growth”.
The PM expressed his “firm commitment to working diligently for the prosperity of the people and completely freeing the country from foreign debt. He is confident that time is not far when Pakistan will achieve economic self-sufficiency after getting rid of debt”, the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-09 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/091611217aa7b70.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960126/not-in-favour-of-banning-political-parties-governor-rule-but-pti-pushing-authorities-in-that-direction-azma' target='_blank'><strong>Not in favour of banning political parties, governor rule but PTI pushing authorities in that direction: Azma</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari on Tuesday said that she was not in favour of a ban on political parties or the imposition of governor’s rule in a province, but stressed that the PTI’s “recent actions” were “pushing” authorities in that direction.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore, Bokhari, in response to a two-part question regarding the possibility of a ban on PTI and the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, said, “As a political worker, I do not support that any party should be banned or that governor’s rule should be imposed.”
But, she continued, “considering the state of affairs, the PTI is pushing us to go in that direction.”
“On the one hand, KP remains most afflicted by terrorism, the police their remain understaffed; they do not yet have a Crimes Control Department (CCD), and police do not have the necessary equipment,” she said. The minister stressed that the PTI’s rhetoric was putting “Pakistan at stake, and if they do not stop, we will not be left with any other options.”

 

The minister further added that the incarcerated PTI leader had “become Altaf Hussain part two,” referring to the self-exiled MQM leader. In 2015, the Lahore High Court had banned the broadcast of images and speeches of Hussain across all electronic and print media till further orders for his inflammatory speech against state institutions.
“He has the same policies as Altaf Hussain, which were still quite mild compared to his (Imran),” she said.
At a later point in the press conference, Bokhari remarked about the PTI founder that “I fear that perhaps he will meet the same fate as Altaf Hussain.”
Bokhari alleged that PTI was engaging in maligning the head of an institute — an apparent reference to Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“If you are going to engage in a campaign against the head of an institution, it will not be long until a full stop is placed,” she warned.
She recalled that during the party’s tenure, Pakistan remained “globally isolated.”
However, she said, Pakistan was “now on track, and the PTI cannot digest it because whatever is good for Pakistan…this group considers it bad news.”
She stressed that Pakistan “cannot run in parallel with Imran’s politics.”
“We have tolerated this for 2.5 years; there is a limit,” she noted, adding that the party had become a “threat” to the country.
Over the past week, PTI has received a string of admonishments from the country’s politicians, who have been rallying behind the armed forces after a fiery press conference by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on December 5.
The press conference, where the army spokesperson assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, followed the former prime minister’s latest outburst against the military leadership, delivered last week through his sister Uzma Khan during a jail visit after weeks of restricted access.
On Monday, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said that the PTI’s “unjustified” criticism of the army had pushed the institution to respond.</p><small>2025-12-09 11:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638309-muhammad-hashir-secures-bronze-for-pakistan-at-ijso-2025' target='_blank'><strong>Muhammad Hashir secures bronze for Pakistan at IJSO 2025</strong></a><br><p>

A section of the motorway (M5) from Zahir Pir in Rahim Yar Khan to the Multan Sher Shah Interchange — near which the collision took place — was also briefly closed in the morning due to fog hampering visibility.
According to a statement by the Rescue 1122, trucks being driven on the motorway collided with stationary ones due to fog.
Separately, Multan Rescue 1122 spokesperson Arshad Hussain told Dawn that the collision had taken place between six trucks.
The rescue service’s statement further detailed that seven people were injured in the accident, of whom two were taken out of a truck during a rescue operation.
Traffic diverted due to closure
National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) spokesperson Imran Shah earlier confirmed to Dawn that the M5 was closed from the Multan Sher Shah Interchange to Zahir Pir in Rahim Yar Khan between 6am and 11:30am due to foggy conditions.
The M5 is part of the Lahore–Karachi Motorway network and is operational up to Sukkur. Tuesday’s temporary closure forced thousands of travellers to shift to the National Highway to reach their destinations.
Following the closure, traffic was diverted onto the National Highway from Zahir Pir to Uch Sharif, Alipur and Muzaffargarh to access Multan and Rahim Yar Khan.
The disruption inconvenienced commuters travelling to Jalalpur Pirwala and Shujabad tehsils of Multan district.
Heavy traffic congestion was also reported near several interchanges, including Zahir Pir, Uch Sharif, Jhangra, Jalalpur Pirwala and Shujabad, after the motorway closure.
In a statement released earlier in the day, the NHMP spokesperson said the decision to close a section of the M5 was taken to ensure the safety of motorists as visibility had dropped significantly along the affected stretch.
The spokesperson said lane violations during fog could lead to serious accidents and urged motorists to strictly adhere to lane discipline.
He advised citizens to travel during the daytime between 10am and 6pm. He also instructed motorists to use fog lights, avoid unnecessary travel, maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and refrain from overspeeding.
Weather forecast
Meanwhile, the weather forecast by the Pakistan Meteorological Department shows fog was expected to blanket multiple areas in Punjab from today until Thursday, including Sahiwal, Bahawalpur, Multan, Faisalabad and Lahore. Foggy weather was also expected in Dera Ghazi Khan, Sargodha and Jhelum on Wednesday and Thursday.
However, the weather forecast on the Met Office’s website for the M5 Motorway shows that foggy weather was not expected until at least 11pm.
Fog had disrupted travel in various areas of Punjab in January as well, when authorities had to close sections of motorways due to reduced visibility. Low visibility caused by dense fog had also led to several flights being either delayed, cancelled or diverted at the time and had also affected train traffic.</p><small>2025-12-09 08:44</small></div><hr>
