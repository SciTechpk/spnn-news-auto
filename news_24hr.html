The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited Tejas jet crashed at about 2:10pm local time.
Videos circulating on social media showed the aircraft going down at speed and bursting into a ball of flames on impact as onlookers watched in shock. A plume of smoke billowed from the crash site as emergency vehicles sped towards it.
The incident happened on the last day of the Middle East’s biggest airshow, which features a flying display each afternoon. Hundreds of people were watching from a grandstand, while the apron was packed with planes, helicopters and other hardware on static display.
In a post on X, the Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed the death of the pilot in the incident.
 






“An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at Dubai Air Show, today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident,” said the post.
“IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief. A court of inquiry is being constituted, to ascertain the cause of the accident,” it added.

Footage of the crash showed the fighter executing a low roll before crashing in flames about a mile (1.6 kilometres) from the show site.
The Tejas, meaning “brilliance” in Hindi, is a domestically designed and built fighter jet that was commissioned into the Indian Air Force in 2016. The Tejas has been beset by design and other challenges and was once rejected by the Indian Navy as too heavy.
 






The biennial airshow is being held at Dubai’s Al Maktoum International Airport from November 17-21.
The show, according to its website, brought together over 1,500 exhibitors, 200 aircraft across flying and static displays, 12 conference tracks, and 450 global visionaries.
This is the second known crash of the fighter jet, which is powered by General Electric (GE) engines. The first crash was during an exercise in India in 2024.
The Tejas Mk-1A fighters are crucial for India’s efforts to bolster its air force’s depleting fighter squadrons and replace ageing jets in the face of China’s growing military strength and support for arch-rival Pakistan.
The rollout of the fighter has been delayed due to slow deliveries from GE of 99 engines ordered in 2021, of which only four have arrived so far. GE has blamed supply chain issues following Covid-19.

Police officials told Dawn one among those killed was ‘good Taliban’ — a term used to refer to former militants who surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives.
In their complaint to the police, the victims’ family has maintained that the attack was a result of a family feud. However, police say the family has taken the stance to avoid another potential attack carried out in retaliation.
Peace committees, or village defence committees, were formed to assist law enforcement agencies in defending KP areas against terror attacks. These also include former militants, often referred to as ‘good Taliban’.
Peace committee officials in KP have been targeted by terrorists in the past as well.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “strongly condemned” today’s attack, state-run APP reported.
The prime minister expressed “deep grief and sorrow” over the loss of precious lives in the attack, which he said was carried out by “Fitna-al-Khawarij”.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term designated by the state for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP).
APP, citing an official statement, reported that PM Shehbaz prayed for the “elevation of ranks of the departed souls in jannah (paradise) and for patience for their families”.
He directed relevant authorities to identify those responsible and ensure they received due punishment, the report said.
“Such cowardly acts, aimed at sabotaging peace efforts, expose the evil intentions of the Fitna-al-Khawarij to create unrest in Pakistan. These cowardly actions cannot, at any cost, weaken the resolve of the people.
“The entire nation stands united to defeat anti-state elements,” the statement quoted him as saying.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack “carried out by *Fitna-al-Khawarij”,* a statement issued by his office said.
“He expressed deep sorrow over the loss of life in the attack,” the statement said, adding that he also extended condolences to the bereaved families.
The statement quoted him as saying: “This cowardly attack of terrorism is a nefarious attempt to undermine peace and stability. Such cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken the high morale of the people. The state and the nation are standing united against enemies of peace.”

Peshgi system is the commonly used term for the practice of debt bondage in Pakistan. Instead of just seeking wages in exchange for labour, poor workers take an advance from an employer (in cash or any other form) under the obligation to work for that employer until the debt is paid off.
“Child labour at kilns, once a painful reality, was eliminated under a campaign initiated by [then chief minister] Shehbaz Sharif, neglected for [four] years, and now fully revived and strengthened by CM Maryam Nawaz,” Aurangzeb said in a post on X.
 







The senior minister’s post highlighted that all brick kilns across Punjab have been geo-mapped, QR-coded, drone-surveyed and linked to a central monitoring dashboard.

“Punjab is now also transitioning government construction towards block-based building, moving away from traditional kiln bricks,” she added, calling the development “not just reform” but a “human rights revolution”.
According to a letter addressed to CM Maryam by Members of Congress Thomas R. Suozzi and Jack Bergman (shared by Aurangzeb on X), “the mechanisation and modernisation of this critical sector will not only support Pakistan in fulfilling its international obligations to end bonded [labour] but also position Punjab as a more attractive destination for foreign direct investment, particularly from American businesses committed to ethical and sustainable engagement”.
The letter added that the progress is “vital” to enhancing bilateral economic relations and strengthening the overall Pakistan-US partnership, “fostering long-term growth and cooperation”.
Moreover, it said that the province is “well-positioned to serve as a pilot province for this initiative”, setting a benchmark for the nation.
“Modernising brick kilns is a critical step that will not only advance human rights but will also make Pakistan more attractive to long-term foreign investment,” stated the letter.
Over 12.5 million children in Pakistan are involved in child labour, according to the Child Rights Movement National Secretariat. One in four households in Pakistan employs a child for domestic work, often in hazardous conditions, as per the International Labour Organisation.
According to a provincial survey, working children accounted for 11.1 per cent of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s child population.
On this year’s World Day Against Child Labour in June, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged parents and employers to join forces in eliminating child labour.</p><small>2025-11-21 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/211452379355be3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956494/mohsin-naqvi-announces-revised-prize-money-for-next-psl-edition' target='_blank'><strong>Mohsin Naqvi announces revised prize money for next PSL edition</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Friday announced a “new reward” for the upcoming Pakistan Super League (PSL) edition set to be held in April 2026.
“Complementing the Pakistan Super League’s growth, I am thrilled to announce a new reward for franchises in the forthcoming editions,” Naqvi said on X.
The champions will take home $500,000 — the same as the 2025 edition — while the runner-up team will take home $300,000, which is an increase of the previous year’s $200,000 reward.
Additionally, a $200,000 reward will be given to the “best franchise contributing towards cricket development.
 






Separately, PCB announced on Friday that the auction for the two new PSL franchise teams will take place on 6 January, 2026, while the decision for which cities have been shortlisted will be made after December 15.
“This marks a significant milestone in the league’s continued expansion and its commitment to expanding its footprint across Pakistan,” the board said of the development.
“The addition of two new teams will also create fresh commercial, sporting and fan engagement opportunities.” 
PSL, which began in 2016 with five teams, expanded to six franchises with the addition of Multan Sultans in 2018. The inclusion of two more sides would mark its first major restructuring in seven years and push the total number of teams to eight.</p><small>2025-11-21 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634707-french-commander-reveals-secret-behind-air-combat-victory-of-pakistan-over-india-in-may-2025' target='_blank'><strong>French commander reveals secret behind air combat victory of Pakistan over India in May 2025</strong></a><br><p>

In the consumerist chaos of modern Pakistan, we don’t just show love anymore — we buy it, carefully packaged, influencer-approved, and preferably imported. I wanted to get something special for my nieces and nephews who are TikTok obsessed. Labubu was a bit too rich for my mortgaged blood so I found the next best viral thing that I was sure the kids would get excited about: Dubai chocolate, the original Fix one.
I had found a 50-pound note in my travel fanny pack from a couple of years ago when I was hustling for donations after my standup comedy shows at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. This crisp British bill was going to buy adoration from my clan. Money really can buy a lot of things, including the label of being the ‘cool aunt’.
Dubai chocolate is an interesting viral phenomenon. When I first heard about it, I asked out of genuine curiosity without trying to be ignorant: “is it made from camel milk, is that what makes it Dubai chocolate?” All my life fancy chocolate was Belgian and Swiss. Now it’s anywhere with effective influencers. I felt like I’d been living under a rock.
At Dubai airport before boarding my flight to Islamabad, I found the coveted Fix chocolate store. One bar for around Rs5000. I got two. Why the hell not? It costs a million to just get out of Australia. What’s a bit more? As I coughed up the cash, I remembered as a child being excited just to be able to buy a Jubilee bar for Rs5. How times have changed.
The unwrapping of Dubai chocolate with my siblings and their children was an exciting event. The teens had their phones out and ready for reels that would be shared with their envious friends. My 7-year-old nephew ate so much that he puked. In short, it was a hit.
Once the excitement had subsided, I settled into the reality of life in Pakistan today. Sidebar: how you perceive reality in Pakistan mostly depends on how much money you have. The more you have, the better your experience. In my case, the experience could have been significantly better.
The curious case of the costly tomatoes
An overseas Pakistani friend had warned me I’d feel the pinch when I visited this time. I assumed she meant the usual — that Chen One bedroom sets now cost a small fortune. But the pinch came in unexpected places. Tomatoes suddenly felt like luxury items. I’d been anticipating worrying about the cost of original artwork in Pakistan. Turns out, I had to factor in the cost of everyday necessities, like most others.
Restaurants had adjusted how many slices of tomatoes they could add to a salad and the sabzi wallah explained why tomatoes couldn’t be stocked regularly anymore. “It’s the Torkham border. It’s closed.” And an even simpler explanation: “Floods”.
Tomatoes were in shortage but reels on shortage of tomatoes were in abundance. Crisis became content, generating income for some — maybe even enough to afford imported canned tomatoes for making marinara sauce to be had with pasta in the comfort of a dry living room, while the rain outside battered crops and other sentient beings without mercy.
Hitting the right notes (Pakistan Idol edition)
Amidst all this, there was the trusty distraction of 60-odd television stations, a quarter of which are dedicated to churning out a version of the same story involving family disputes, grand marriages and devastating divorces. As always on my visits to the motherland, I spent an obscene amount of time staring at the idiot box. It’s easier to escape with TV dramas than to be present with real life family drama.
During my channel surfs I discovered that Pakistan Idol was on. Now, I usually don’t care about the Idol franchise or any other talent show franchise really. But a show like Idol in a place like Pakistan symbolises defiance in the face of societal disapproval while paying homage to the rich musical tradition of the subcontinent. These aren’t nepo babies crooning semi-melodically. These are brilliant, talented and courageous aam (common) people who’ve dared to dream differently.
By the time my hometown, Peshawar, was featured during the auditions phase, the number of people qualified past auditions had already exceeded the original allotted spots because of the overwhelming amount of talent across the country. I’d sat there in front of the television in my mother’s room watching audition after audition, jaw dropped in awe. Pre-audition interviews revealed hopes of these young people who had a real chance at breaking through barriers of entrenched systemic inequality to grasp something precious that would lead them to what an average person living outside of a DHA colony desires: economic prosperity.
Young women spoke about family resistance that melted once they made it past the first round. Fathers stood before cameras explaining why they’d fought their own parents, their extended families, to let their daughters sing publicly. These were men of my generation giving their daughters access to opportunities that girls of my generation were mostly denied. Now that men from regular, shareef families were proudly backing their daughters in talent shows, suddenly it wasn’t so taboo anymore.
My own religious mother, now frail and old, asked me during one of these episodes: “You used to love singing didn’t you? Do you still sing?” I looked at her and said no. If only she’d asked me this when I’d been actually singing.
Welcome to late-stage capitalism!
Pakistan has always contained multitudes — staggering wealth and devastating poverty, rigid tradition and surprising defiance, sincere faith and thinly veiled hypocrisy.
But something about this visit felt different, sharper. Maybe it was the floods. Maybe it was new political tensions in a year that had already been marked with a war with a different neighbour. Maybe it was watching talent being packaged as economic opportunities. Maybe it was finding a Tim Hortons in Peshawar that catered to the rich instead of blue-collar workers in Canada. Maybe it was just seeing more clearly what had always been true: in late-stage capitalism, everything becomes negotiable when there’s money to be made.</p><small>2025-11-21 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/211326246979f71.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956489/3-killed-several-injured-as-57-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>3 killed, several injured as 5.7-magnitude earthquake jolts Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>At least three people were killed and several injured after a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Bangladesh on Friday, police said, with buildings damaged in many areas including Dhaka, the densely populated capital.
Tremors were felt in eastern states in India that border Bangladesh, but there were no immediate reports of major damage in either country, authorities said.
The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake’s epicentre was in the city of Narsingdi, about 40 kilometres east of Dhaka.
City residents rushed out of their homes as buildings shook and some makeshift structures collapsed, Reuters witnesses said.
Three people were killed when the railing of a six-storey building collapsed during the earthquake, police said.

“We felt a strong jolt and buildings were shaking like trees,” said Suman Rahman, a Dhaka resident. “Staircases were jammed as people rushed down. Everyone was terrified, children were crying.”
The fire department reported injuries after bricks and loose cement fell from buildings that were under construction.
“I have never felt such a tremor in my life. We were at the office when furniture started shaking. We rushed down the stairs on the street and saw other people on the road already,” said Sadman Sakib, who works in a private firm in Dhaka.
 
 

Muhammad Yunus, the head of the South Asian country’s interim government, urged people to remain calm as authorities assess the damage.
“Everyone is urged to remain alert and not pay attention to any kind of rumours or misinformation,” he said in a statement. “Further guidance will be provided through hotlines and official channels if necessary. We remain committed to ensuring the safety of all citizens.”</p><small>2025-11-21 08:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2113344739e07da.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956461/modi-heads-to-south-africa-for-g20-summit-boycotted-by-trump' target='_blank'><strong>Modi heads to South Africa for G20 summit boycotted by Trump</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was earlier reported to have skipped out on attending an Asean summit to avoid broaching the issue of Pakistan in a possible meeting with United States President Donald Trump, will be attending the G20 summit in South Africa which has been boycotted by the American leader.
The Kolkata-based Telegraph reported that Modi had avoided the last two multilateral platforms where the US President was present — the Asean summit in Malaysia and Trump’s Gaza Peace Summit in Egypt — “resulting in speculation that the prime minister was trying to avoid a meeting with the American leader till the India-US trade deal is finalised”.
Trump’s administration has said it will not attend the first G20 summit in Africa, alleging that the host country, previously ruled by its white minority apartheid system until 1994, discriminates against white people. The US president has also rejected South Africa’s agenda for the November 22-23 summit of promoting solidarity and helping developing nations adapt to worse weather disasters, transition to clean energy and cut their excessive debt costs.
The Indian Ministry of External Affairs on Wednesday had confirmed Modi’s participation in the G20 summit.
Prior to embarking on the trip, Modi said he will present India’s perspective at the forum in line with its vision of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ and ‘One Earth, One Family and One Future’.

“Will be attending the G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa. This is a particularly special summit as it is being held in Africa. Various global issues will be discussed there. Will be meeting various world leaders during the summit,” Modi posted on social media platform X.
 






“During the visit, I also look forward to my interaction with the Indian diaspora in South Africa, which is one of the largest outside India,” Modi said in the statement he shared along with his post on X.
On the margins of the summit, Modi is expected to hold bilateral meetings with some of the leaders present in Johannesburg. He is attending at the invitation of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.
Earlier this week, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs had said that Modi was expected to speak at all three sessions of the summit.
According to Press Trust of India, a top official of the MEA on Thursday had said that he would not like to prejudge what would figure in the leaders’ declaration, but all important matters relevant from the perspective of India and the Global South will be “highlighted by our leadership”.

The FCC was established under the recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment amid much opposition from the opposition and within the judiciary. According to government officials, the creation of the FCC is intended to reduce the Supreme Court’s workload, ensure timely adjudication of constitutional cases, and strengthen the independence and credibility of the judicial system.
“The creation of this court represents an important moment in the nation’s ongoing constitutional journey,” Justice Aminuddin said in a message posted on the newly launched website for the FCC.
“One that reinforces our collective commitment to the rule of law and to the enduring promise of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” he stressed.
He said that the FCC “has been entrusted with a mandate of great significance: to interpret the Constitution with clarity, independence and fidelity; to safeguard the fundamental rights guaranteed to the people; and to ensure that the constitutional order remains a source of stability, justice and balance for all institutions of the state.”
“The work of this court is not only judicial — it is also a solemn trust that carries profound implications for the lives, liberties and aspirations of Pakistan’s citizens,” he said.
“As we begin our institutional life, our focus remains firmly on building a judicial forum that embodies integrity, impartiality and intellectual rigour,” he said.
Justice Aminuddin added that each matter brought before the court would be approached with an “unwavering commitment to fairness and restraint, guided solely by the Constitution and the principles of justice that lie at its heart”.
“We aspire to nurture a tradition of reasoned adjudication, institutional dignity and public confidence — qualities that are indispensable to any constitutional court,” he said.
He further said that as the first FCC chief justice, he considered it a “privilege to contribute to the foundations of an institution whose purpose transcends individuals and moments in time”.
On Thursday, Justice Aminuddin Khan had visited the designated site for the establishment of a new record room within the premises of the Islamabad High Court.
Accompanied by Justice Ali Baqir Najafi and Justice Arshad Hussain Shah, the FCC CJ reviewed the proposed arrangements and approved the shifting of the relevant judicial files from the Supreme Court to the newly identified Record Room facility at the IHC.
During the visit, Justice Aminuddin stressed the importance of a secure archiving and efficient accessibility of judicial records to support ongoing and future judicial proceedings.</p><small>2025-11-21 08:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634704-in-maiden-message-as-cj-justice-aminuddin-terms-fcc-creation-a-landmark-in-constitutional-journey' target='_blank'><strong>In maiden message as CJ, Justice Aminuddin terms FCC creation a landmark in constitutional journey</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier, an initial statement by Rescue 1122 said the incident took place early in the morning after the boiler of the factory exploded, causing the collapse of the building and nearby structures.
However, the rescue service later attributed the explosion to a gas leak, which was also confirmed in the statement issued by Faisalabad Commissioner Raja Jahangir Anwar’s office.
The statement by the commissioner’s office said no boiler was present in the factory, adding that four factories were operating in the Malikpur area. “A fire erupted in one of the factories due to gas leakage and engulfed the other factories as well.”
Seven houses in the area were also affected, the statement said. According to Rescue 1122, the explosion caused the roof of the factory and those of adjacent houses to collapse.
The statement by the commissioner’s office said that 15 bodies had been pulled out from the rubble, five more than the earlier reported death toll of 10 by Rescue 1122.
According to the statement, 10 of the injured people were taken to Allied Hospital, and three were discharged after first aid.
It added that a five-member inquiry team was being constituted to probe the incident.
The statement said that the rescue operation at the site had been completed and the clearance process was under way. The situation was being monitored, it added, further quoting Commissioner Raja saying that “we share the grief of the heirs of those killed in this unfortunate accident”.
An earlier statement by Rescue 1122 detailed the rescue operation at the glue factory, saying that it was carried out under the supervision of the district emergency officer, and more than 20 ambulances and fire tenders took part in it.
It also said that the Faisalabad Control Room had received a call about the explosion at the glue factory at 5:28am.
Videos of the rescue work shared by Rescue 1122 showed workers combing through the rubble of buildings and looking for survivors.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz expressed grief over the loss of lives in the incident, a statement issued by her office said. It said she extended condolences to the bereaved families and sought a report on the incident from the Faisalabad commissioner.
Meanwhile, Punjab Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar had directed that Rescue 1122, the fire brigade and all related agencies be provided full support.
In a statement, he said that police officers and officials should continue rescue operations to find people buried underneath the rubble. He also directed traffic police to ensure easy access to the site of the incident for ambulances and other rescue vehicles.
National Trade Union Federation (NTUF) Secretary General Nasir Mansoor expressed concern over the “tragic deaths of labourers” in the incident and expressed solidarity with their families, a press release issued by the labour organisation said.
It quoted Mansoor as saying: “Factories have turned into death [traps] for labourers and industrialists are doling out death certificates.” He further accused governments and the labour department of “criminal negligence”.
“The Punjab government is directly responsible for the labourers’ death,” he said, according to the press release.
The NTUF stressed that safe working conditions should be prioritised and demanded Rs3 million be given in compensation to the family of each labourer killed in the incident. The organisation also called for the provision of complete and free medical treatment for the injured.
Last year in April, a dozen workers were injured in a steam boiler explosion at a textile mill in Faisalabad. Rescue 1122 reported that as a result of the blast, not only did fire break out in the factory, but the roof of a hall also caved in.

“The CCP has issued show cause notices to seventeen major private school systems for allegedly abusing their dominant position by compelling parents to purchase expensive, logo-branded notebooks, workbooks, and uniforms exclusively from school-authorised vendors,” a press release by the CCP said.
“The action has been taken to safeguard millions of school-going children and their families from unfair pricing practices,” it added.
According to the commission, the enforcement action follows a detailed suo motu inquiry initiated on the basis of numerous complaints from parents, guardians, and other stakeholders.
It said that the complainants alleged “arbitrary fee hikes, non-transparent selling practices, and the bundling of mandatory branded school supplies, effectively leaving families with no choice but to purchase these items at inflated prices”.
The CCP said that the school systems under scrutiny included the Beaconhouse School System, The City School, Headstart, Lahore Grammar School, Froebel’s, Roots International, Roots Millennium, KIPS, Allied Schools, Super Nova, Dar-e-Arqam, STEP School, Westminster International, United Charter School, and The Smart School, among others.
“These school networks operate hundreds of campuses nationwide and collectively educate millions of students, giving them considerable influence over enrolled families,” it said.
According to the handout, the CCP’s inquiry showed that parents were mandated to buy logo-bearing notebooks, workbooks, uniforms, and other ancillary school products from exclusive school-authorised outlets, the statement said.
“In several instances, schools sold compulsory ‘study packs’ through online portals or designated vendors, with students prohibited from using generic notebooks or uniforms from the open market,” it added.
The CCP defined the relevant markets as, firstly, the provision of education services to enrolled students, where each school enjoyed a 100 per cent market share, making students “captive consumers”; and secondly, the market for ancillary school products, which became the “tied market”.
 
 

The inquiry report concluded that many study packs were “up to 280pc more expensive than similar items available in open markets”.
It also found that leading school systems engaged in tying arrangements, making continued enrollment conditional upon purchasing secondary products such as notebooks and uniforms.
The report also added that schools appointed exclusive vendors, foreclosing the market for thousands of small stationery and uniform sellers nationwide, according to the statement. It said that mandatory branded supplies and restrictive trading conditions violated sections 4(1) and 4(2)(a) of the Competition Act, 2010.
“High switching costs, such as limited school options, substantial transfer fees, and transportation constraints left parents with no viable alternative, enabling schools to enforce these practices without resistance,” the press release added.
The CCP observed that these practices “restricted market access, harmed small retailers, and limited consumer choice across Pakistan”.
“Private educational institutions account for nearly half of all student enrollment in the country, it said. “With inflation already straining household budgets, the imposition of overpriced branded materials further burdens families and raises concerns about excessive commercialisation within the education sector.”
According to the commission’s statement, it has directed the seventeen school systems to submit written responses within 14 days, appear before the commission through duly authorised representatives, and explain why enforcement orders under Section 31 and penalties under Section 38 should not be imposed.
Failure to comply may result in ex-parte proceedings, the statement said.
Under the law, it added, CCP may impose a penalty of up to 10pc of the annual turnover or Rs750 million, whichever is higher, for such violations.</p><small>2025-11-21 07:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/21113322f16ec27.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956463/death-toll-from-indonesia-landslides-rises-to-30' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from Indonesia landslides rises to 30</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from a series of landslides on Indonesia’s Java island has risen to 30, with rescuers still searching for many missing people, officials said.
Heavy rainfall triggered a major landslide in Banjarnegara district in Central Java on Saturday, destroying at least 48 homes, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB).
More than 700 personnel from the military, police, search-and-rescue units and volunteer groups have been deployed, along with tracking dogs, BNPB spokesman Abdul Muhari said late on Thursday.
Muhari confirmed that rescuers had recovered seven additional bodies, bringing the Banjarnegara toll to 10, with 18 people still unaccounted for.
Nearly 1,000 residents remain evacuated, and authorities warn that continuing rain, water build-up and active springs could trigger further slides and hinder operations. An AFP photographer reported heavy machinery working through deep mud as teams combed debris in affected villages.
In a separate disaster, a landslide struck three villages in neighbouring Cilacap district last Thursday. At least 20 people have been confirmed dead and three remain missing, BNPB said on Wednesday, with no further update issued.
The monsoon season, which typically runs from June to September, routinely brings landslides, flash floods and waterborne disease across the archipelago. The National Weather Service has warned of more heavy rain in the coming weeks.
Officials say climate change is altering storm patterns, intensifying rainfall, flash flooding and wind gusts. In eastern Indonesia, flash floods and landslides in remote Papua have killed at least 23 people, according to Muhari.</p><small>2025-11-21 07:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2110322030a0b71.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956457/afridi-pens-letter-to-maryam-over-manhandling-of-imrans-sisters-denial-of-his-visitation-rights' target='_blank'><strong>Afridi pens letter to Maryam over manhandling of Imran’s sisters, denial of his visitation rights</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter to his counterpart in Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, has raised concerns over the alleged manhandling of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters by police and the obstruction of the incarcerated ex-premier’s visitation rights.
The development comes after Afridi on Thursday was denied access to meet Imran for a seventh time. Further, two days ago police had allegedly manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters from outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with him.
The letter, which was shared by the PTI on social media platform X early on Friday, said that Afridi wished to draw Maryam’s attention to “serious concerns” regarding the “administration of court-mandated visitation rights” of Imran and the recent treatment of his family members.
 






“Clear and binding judicial directions govern Imran’s visitation schedule. These orders explicitly permit his close family members and nominated individuals to meet him on specified days. Despite the unambiguous nature of these instructions, repeated reports indicate persistent non-implementation by the authorities responsible for compliance,” Afridi said.
He also termed accounts of the “inappropriate and rough treatment” of Imran’s sisters during a recent attempt to visit him as “particularly disturbing”.
“These individuals are apolitical private citizens, seeking only to meet their brother in accordance with court permissions. Even if restrictions were to exist for political visitors — which is a different category altogether — there is no conceivable legal or administrative basis for obstructing or mishandling immediate family members whose presence is neither political nor disruptive in nature,” the KP chief minister said.
“Their obstruction, physical restraint or temporary detention is therefore wholly unacceptable,” he said.
Afridi said that such actions created a “clear impression” that judicial directives were being disregarded, and that jail and police authorities were not safeguarding or facilitating the rights of visitors.
He urged Maryam to ensure a proper, safe and dignified waiting area for authorised visitors.
“The current practice of stopping them nearly a kilometre away and compelling elderly family members — particularly women — to sit on roads is wholly inappropriate and must be discontinued,” he said.
He said that the Punjab government should ensure the implementation of all court directives on visitation. He also called for identifying and holding individuals accountable for obstructing, insulting, or physically manhandling peaceful visitors, including Imran’s family and members of the KP cabinet.
He said that the Punjab government should also issue instructions to the prison and police authorities to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Further, he called for establishing a mechanism ensuring that all future meetings were facilitated in an “orderly, respectful and legally compliant manner”.
Afridi ended his letter by saying that Imran was a former prime minister and the leader of a political party he himself represented.
“Any deviation from court-mandated procedures in his case, or any disrespectful treatment of his immediate family, becomes a matter of direct institutional concern,” he said, adding that he could not remain indifferent when Imran’s dignity and rights were being compromised.
“I am therefore constrained to demand that these issues be addressed promptly, decisively and in full conformity with judicial directions,” he said.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
On Thursday, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed concern over the reports of Imran’s sisters being “manhandled” and noted that the rights of prisoners’ families to meet their relatives and the right to peaceful assembly were protected under national and international human rights law.
“HRCP calls for a transparent inquiry and urges authorities to ensure the rights, safety and dignity of all involved are fully respected,” it said in a post on X.</p><small>2025-11-21 06:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634682-after-e-challans-robot-cars-to-curb-no-parking-violations-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>After e-challans, robot cars to curb no-parking violations in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

The Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) has openly opposed the move and is making efforts to ensure that the IHC continues to function at its current building. The building presently houses the newly-established Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which had initially been shifted there temporarily but is now expected to continue operations in the building.
In view of the growing concerns, the IHCBA convened a meeting of its executive body and also announced that it would hold a press conference on Friday (today). Earlier on Wednesday, IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Gillani and Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja met Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to discuss the matter.
According to the association, the minister assured the delegation that the IHC would continue functioning in its present building for the time being.
However, the Islamabad District Bar Association (IDBA) has welcomed the proposed transfer of the high court to G-10. The IDBA convened a cabinet meeting under the chairmanship of its president Naeem Gujjar to deliberate on the matter. According to a statement issued after the meeting, the cabinet said relocating the high court would make it easier for lawyers to perform their duties and would also facilitate the production of prisoners, potentially speeding up the process of justice.
The IDBA stressed the need for broader consultation on the matter and called a general body meeting for November 22 to gauge the collective opinion of the legal community. All lawyers have been instructed to ensure their participation.
Meanwhile, in a parallel development, a delegation of the IHCBA called on FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan and other judges. The delegation led by President Gillani and Secretary Jajja visited the chamber of the chief justice where all the FCC judges were present.
The delegation presented bouquets to Chief Justice Aminuddin, Justice Arshad Hussain Shah, Justice Rozi Khan and others, congratulating them on assuming their roles at the newly-established court.

Talking to media persons, he said it was unfortunate that despite having orders from the Islamabad High Court, he was not allowed to meet the patron-in-chief of his party.
He revealed that he has written a letter to the Chief Justice but has not received any response regarding the issue.
When asked about the Election Commission of Pakistan taking notice of his statement, Sohail Afridi said that he had only said rigging would not be allowed in the by-elections, but his statement was twisted.

• ADB delegation calls on Sindh CM, expresses willingness to consider loan extension, additional financing
• University Road users continue to face hardships due to delays
KARACHI: The stalled construction on the much-delayed Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Red Line has resumed after the removal of several bottlenecks following the chief minister’s intervention but there is still no clear timeline in sight for the project’s completion while thousands of University Road commuters continue to face daily hardships.
The work was stopped around two months ago due to a number of issues, including the rising cost of the project and relocation of underground utility lines.
On Thursday, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon told a delegation of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which funds the project, that the work has been resumed on the Red Line project and that the provincial government was committed to accelerating implementation and addressing bottlenecks.
Designed to cover around 27 kilometres from Malir Halt to Numaish via University Road, the BRT Red Line project was announced in 2017 with an initial cost of around Rs79 billion, but due to persistent delays and mismanagement by the provincial government, the estimated cost has now escalated to Rs103 billion.
After commencement of the work in early 2022, the project was initially scheduled for completion by 2023, which was later pushed to 2024 and has subsequently been extended to the end of 2026.
For many, even the revised timeline appears to be wholly unrealistic as the project continues to progress at a snail’s pace and various factors have been cited by officials to justify these delays, including disputes with contractors, safety stoppages, rising construction costs due to depreciation of the rupee, difficulties in land acquisition, relocation of utilities and coordination failures between implementing agencies.
However, following renewed commitments and claims by the authorities that all bottlenecks have been removed, the project’s development has resumed after its suspension in September, the sources said.
‘ADB ready to consider loan extension, additional financing’
On Thursday, an ADB delegation led by its country head Emma Fan called on Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah at CM House, where the two sides reviewed the progress of development projects in the province being funded by the bank and discussed future cooperation in major sectors, including transport, infrastructure, urban development, and climate resilience.
According to a statement issued by the CM House, the meeting reviewed key initiatives, including the Karachi BRT Red Line Project, urban mobility improvements, infrastructure modernisation, and programmes aimed at strengthening resilience against climate shocks. The ADB country director expressed appreciation for the Sindh government’s engagement and reaffirmed ADB’s support for ongoing and future initiatives. She said the Sindh Government has demonstrated strong ownership of ADB-supported programmes.
She also stressed the importance of meeting performance benchmarks, enhancing institutional capacity, particularly within TransKarachi for the BRT system and addressing safeguards and community concerns promptly.
“The ADB is ready to consider loan extensions and additional financing based on improved performance and compliance. We encourage the province to maintain momentum so that key development objectives can be achieved within agreed timelines,” she added.
Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon told the meeting that the bottlenecks in the BRT Red Line had been removed with the intervention of the chief minister and the halted work has been resumed.
The CM assured the ADB team of the provincial government’s commitment to accelerate implementation and address bottlenecks.
The discussion included updates on financing needs, institutional strengthening, project performance, and timelines for the completion of major components.
“The projects related to urban transport, water, climate resilience and infrastructure are essential for improving the quality of life in Karachi and other cities. My government is closely monitoring progress and will extend every support needed for timely completion,” the statement quoted the CM as saying.
Both sides agreed to maintain close coordination in the coming months, particularly on issues related to financing, project restructuring where needed, community grievance redressal, safeguard compliance, and capacity strengthening of implementing agencies.
The CM also thanked the ADB delegation for their continued support and expressed confidence that the partnership would further deepen through cooperation and shared development goals.

According to Anadolu Agency, the meeting, held at Nato headquarters, focused on the state of Pakistan-US ties amid rising instability in South Asia. According to Pakistan’s foreign ministry post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the discussions also covered climate change and other global developments.
 






Mr Rutte praised Pakist­an’s “contributions to regional pea­ce and stability” and acknowledged its counterterrorism efforts. Mr Dar rei­terated Islamabad’s “unwavering commitment” to tackling militancy, warning that the threat Pakistan fa­­ces is “primarily supported and perpetrated from beyond its borders”.
The foreign minister said Pakistan sought a “peaceful and stable South Asia” and emphasised the need for constructive dialogue. Both sides agreed to expand engagement and continue cooperation on security challenges.
“European and South Asian security are intertwined,” Rutte said on X after the meeting, calling close cooperation “essential for promoting stability and prosperity”.
 






The deputy PM’s meeting with the Nato chief is part of a three-day visit to Brussels, which began on Wednesday. It marked the first such high-level meeting since then-Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi met with former Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg in 2021.
In a separate engagement, Mr Dar met EU Commissioner for Inter­national Partnerships Jutta Urpila­inen to discuss ways of strengthening Pakistan-EU cooperation ahead of the 7th Pakist­an-EU Strategic Dialogue, which the foreign minister will co-chair.
Later, hosting a dinner for members of the European parliament at Pakistan House, the deputy PM urged European businesses to invest in Pakistan, citing opportunities in agriculture, textiles, housing and information technology, APP reported.
With more than 60pc of its population under 30, Pakistan was em­­erging as a rising economy, he said.
Calling the Pakistan-EU relationship a “pillar for peace, stability and development”, Mr Dar said Islamabad aimed to deepen political and economic ties with the bloc, highlighting the role of the GSP+ trade regime in boosting bilateral trade and investment.
 
 

The dinner was attended by senior MEPs, including committee chairs and coordinators dealing with Sou­th Asia, foreign affairs, trade and security, as well as Pakistan’s senior diplomatic representatives.

Chairing a meeting to review the privatisation status of the national flag carrier, the premier emphasised the need to develop a clear strategy to increase the number of airworthy aircraft in its fleet and ensure that all flights depart on time.
The prime minister also stressed that improving operational efficiency must remain a top priority.
The premier was informed that the Privatisation Commission had prequalified four parties for the long-awaited PIA transaction. The business plan aims to sell a 75 per cent stake with management control. However, strict conditions will be enforced to ensure that the airline’s name and branding remain unchanged after privatisation.
A press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said the officials briefed the meeting on the ongoing PIA privatisation process and the accompanying business plan.
The premier was also informed that the bidding phase would commence soon.
In early July, after detailed scrutiny, the Board of the Privatisation Commission prequalified four entities — Fauji Fert­iliser Company Ltd; Air Blue (Private) Ltd; a consortium comprising Lucky Cement Ltd, Hub Power Holdings Ltd, Kohat Cement Company Ltd and Metro Ventures (Pvt) Ltd; and another consortium consisting of Arif Habib Corporation Ltd, Fatima Fertiliser Company Ltd, City Schools (Private) Ltd and Lake City Holdings (Private) Ltd.
In the current month, the government approved the inclusion of AKD Group Holdings (Pvt) Ltd in the consortium led by Arif Habib Corporation Ltd (AHCL), following the consortium’s request.
The meeting was attended by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali, and senior government officials.
The meeting was further informed that the number of airworthy aircraft in PIA’s fleet will be increased from 18 to 38 by 2029. Currently serving over 30 cities, PIA aims to expand its service network to more than 40 destinations by 2029.
Meanwhile, the premier separately discussed matters related to the Housing Ministry with Minister for Housing and Works Riaz Hussain Pirzada and reviewed the country’s overall political situation.

The ministry in its press release said a total of 168,000 tonnes of seed from the private sector and 196,000 tonnes from the Punjab Seed Corporation have been supplied. The allocations are as follows: 23,000 tonnes to Balochistan, 82,000 tonnes to Sindh, 22,000 tonnes to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 41,000 tonnes retained in Punjab.
Daily convoy tracking and check-post monitoring confirmed smooth movement without any hindrances or disruptions. The Federal Seed Certification and Research and Development (FSC&RD) validated these reports shared by the Punjab government.
The food security ministry noted a petition filed in the high court by certain seed companies challenging existing seed movement SOPs. The federal government assured full legal support to address the matter.

Food ministry hopes to achieve sowing target by end of November

Provinces have reported accelerated sowing momentum, supported by timely floodwater recession, easier land access, and improved availability of certified seeds.
The Punjab Agriculture Department reported that the province is completing cultivation on 12.5 million acres against its target of 16.5 million acres for the ongoing Rabi season, eyeing to achieve the target in the next two weeks.
Special trends observed in Punjab include early and rapid sowing due to post-flood land availability. Furthermore, subsidies offered through the Punjab Seed Corporation (Rs500 per bag) and collaboration with private seed companies (Rs550 per bag, totalling Rs5,500 for certified seed) have led to 100 per cent improvement in certified seed usage.
The Ministry’s Secretary Amir Mohyuddin confirmed that media announcements regarding a 20 per cent increase in sowing this year have positively influenced farmers, who have also responded well to the indicative National Wheat Policy price of Rs3,500 per 40kg bag.
In Sindh, the Director-General Extension reported good availability of certified seed. A total of 533,000 hectares had been sown, marking the peak sowing window. By the end of the current month, 85pc of the target is expected to be completed.
KP reported a target of 781,000 hectares, with 461,000 hectares sown so far (59pc progress). Sowing in sugarcane and rice areas has been slower; however, it is expected to accelerate by the end of November, as temperatures remain favourable and the sowing window extends until Dec 15.
In Balochistan, most cultivation occurs in tube-well irrigated areas, with a few districts relying on canal irrigation, where sowing follows rice harvesting. Out of the 643,000 hectares target, approximately 85,000 hectares had been sown. Tube-well-irrigated and barani areas are progressing steadily, while the canal-fed Nasirabad division is expected to pick up pace soon.
The secretary agreed that the ongoing mapping of storage facilities will continue next week to facilitate informed future decisions regarding storage planning.

The forum is expected to elevate a judge to the Supreme Court from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) as well as nominate the chief justices of the Sindh High Court (SHC) and the Balochistan High Court (BHC).
The meeting of the JCP will be convened at 2:30pm in the conference room of Islamabad’s SC building.
One of the agendas of the meeting is to consider appointment of a judge to the SC from the senior judges of the IHC. How­ever, the names of the judges and their seniority position will be disclosed at a later stage.
SC strength
With the establishment of the FCC, where four judges from the Supreme Court — Justices Aminuddin Khan, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi — have been appointed as well as the resignation of Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, the total strength of the SC has been reduced to 18 judges from the earlier 24.
Presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the JCP meeting will also be attended by FCC CJ Aminuddin Khan; Jus­tices Munib Akhtar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Aamer Farooq; Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan; Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar; Pakistan Bar Council representative Ahsan Bhoon; Sen­ators Farooq Hamid Naek and Syed Ali Zafar as well as MNAs Sheikh Aftab Ahmad and Gohar Ali Khan.
Likewise, the JCP during its meeting will also consider the appointment of SHC CJ from among the three senior-most judges of the high court.
Those who will be considered for the office are acting SHC Chief Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput and Justices Muhammad Iqbal Kalohoro and Justice Mahmood A. Khan.
Similarly, the JCP will also consider for the appointment of the BHC chief justice from among the three senior-most judges of the high court.
They include acting BHC Chief Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhai and Justices Iqbal Ahmed Kasi and Shaukat Ali Rakhshani. After the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, changes were made to key constitutional and statutory judicial bodies.
Following these changes, SC’s Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail was included in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and the Practice and Procedure Committee while FCC’s Justice Farooq was made a member of the JCP.
Among the three statutory bodies, the SJC is the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges, the Practice and Procedure Committee forms benches and fixes cases, and the JCP is responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary.

• Registry refuses to entertain plea, says SC original jurisdiction doesn’t exist anymore
• Judges asked to approach new Federal Constitutional Court, the very institution assailed in their draft petition
ISLAMABAD: Four judges of the Isla­mabad High Court (IHC) — who wanted to challenge the recently introduced 27th Amendment — were turned away by the Supreme Court and told to approach the newly-formed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), it emerged on Thursday.
The four judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rifat Imtiaz — had drafted a petition invoking the original jurisdiction of the top court under Article 184(3), and sent a representation to the apex court’s registry branch.
However, sources said the petition was not entertained on the grounds that Article 184(3), which used to be an inherent power of the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights, has been omitted from the Constitution.
The petitioner judges did not personally visit the Supreme Court to either file the petition or undergo biometric verification, the sources added.
Insiders told Dawn that the four judges had decided to move the Supreme Court after months of raising concerns over what they described as an “incremental but systematic dismantling” of judicial independence, beginning with the 26th Amendment and culminating in the latest constitutional changes.
 
 

As they declined to accept the application, court officials reportedly communicated to the petitioners that the petition may not fall within the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction because it relates to a constitutional amendment. The branch adv­i­sed that the matter might require review under procedures dealing specifically with challenges to constitutional amendments.
However, the petitioners maintained that only the Supreme Court — not the newly-formed FCC — could adjudicate the legality of the amendment because its very existence depends on the amendment being upheld.
 
 

As per the draft petition, a forum created by the disputed amendment cannot “judge its own birth”, and the Supreme Court’s inherent power to interpret the Constitution cannot be ousted.
Draft petition
The draft petition, seen by Dawn, argues that the fresh amendment violated articles 9, 10A and 25 of the Constitution, which guarantee the rights to due process, fair trial and equal protection, by subordinating the judiciary to the executive.
It also said the tweaks restructured the constitutional scheme of separation of powers and altered the terms of service of sitting judges in violation of the Constitution.
Ironically, the very forum the judges were advised to approach, i.e. the FCC, which now has exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, is one of the main targets of the petition.
In it, the judges argue that the FCC chief justice was appointed by the president solely on the advice of the prime minister, without any consultation with the judiciary, in violation of established principles reiterated in landmark judgements such as Al-Jehad Trust and Sharaf Faridi.
The draft petition also assails the appointment of the first batch of the FCC judges, asserting that their selection was predetermined and “handpicked” by the executive, even before the amendment was enacted.
According to the draft, the structure and powers of the new court — which binds all other courts but is not bound by precedent itself — create a parallel judicial system unprecedented in common-law jurisdictions. It warned that the FCC’s unlimited discretion to withdraw cases from high courts raised the risk of executive control over constitutional adjudication.
The judges also challenged the amendments to Article 200, which allowed the transfer of high court judges without their consent. The petition further argued that such provisions exposed judges to pressure, fear of retaliation, and manipulation of court composition.
In addition, the petition challenges the altered composition of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), noting that both bodies now contain a majority of non-judicial members or judges appointed under the contested framework.
The petitioners argued that the appointment mechanism had been reduced to “an election by an executive-dominated electoral college”, replacing merit-based selection with political influence.

• Says NAB’s ‘political compromise’ hindering anti-corruption efforts
• Seeks autonomous oversight body to audit internal control processes
ISLAMABAD: With the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF) describing the country’s top anti-corruption agency, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), as a “political compromise”, the government has agreed to the publication of asset declarations of high-level public officials in 2026 and their risk-based verification to improve the country’s accountability and integrity standards against widespread corruption.
According to IMF’s Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), released by the Ministry of Finance as a structural benchmark of the ongoing $7 billion loan programme, the two sides have agreed under a short-term action plan to “strengthen accountability and integrity among high-level federal civil servants by initiating the publication of asset declarations in 2026, and introduce risk-based verification of asset declarations”.
In the longer term, the two sides agreed to “consider establishing a centralised authority to collect, digitise and publish asset declarations of high-level public officials with adequate powers and resources to conduct risk-based verification”, a vision that may remain elusive given the expiry of the IMF programme.
The lender also required the government in the medium term to enhance NAB’s independence and effectiveness in investigating high-level corruption by strengthening appointment procedures of its head, enhancing investigative capacities and establishing robust internal accountability.
The report noted with concern that disciplinary actions related to corruption in the government machinery, particularly senior revenue officials, were inadequate. Their investigative powers were limited to conducting interviews and checking asset declarations.
 
 

“Penalties imposed can range from minor (e.g. withholding a promotion) to major (e.g. dismissal from service), but do not include a proposal for criminal prosecution” as criminal prosecution is legally possible “but occurs only occasionally”, it said.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) could not provide data on the number of criminal prosecutions in recent years. While criminal prosecution can serve as a crucial deterrent in fighting corruption by imposing significant consequences on corrupt actions, “its effectiveness for the FBR is limited due to its limited application in practice and the de facto exclusion of high-ranked staff”.
In provinces, anti-corruption agencies require permission from the highest provincial authorities before investigations begin. “In the context of patronage politics in Pakistan, this creates risks that corruption investigations will not prosper against allies or supporters of the provincial governors. Investigative capacities and training are further hindered by their lack of access to databases, including on the national identification system, tax information, asset declarations and bank accounts,” the report said.
The report noted that the primary issue with asset declaration of government officials was that they were not subject to robust risk-based verification, “which also blunts its preventive impact”.
Moreover, the asset declaration system in Pakistan remained fragmented. The asset declaration requirements for “government servants” or “holders of public office”, active members of the armed forces and the judiciary are distinct.
Serving members of the armed forces are also subject to separate asset declaration rules, which do not include requirements for declarations to be made public. All public office-holders and government servants (federal as well as provincial), as taxpayers, are required to declare income returns and wealth statements annually to the FBR under the Income Tax Ordinance, but these are for tax compliance and not for anti-corruption purposes.
As for the judiciary, every judge is required to submit their asset declarations to the chief justice of the Supreme Court, but these are not made public.
Notably, asset declarations of the NAB chair and other senior officials cannot be disclosed due to privacy concerns. “It is critical, however, that there is a robust, independent and credible system for collecting and verifying asset declarations,” the report said.
To supplement verification efforts, procedures for lifestyle monitoring (investigating a public official’s standard of living and comparing it with their declared income and assets) would be another valuable tool to detect illicit enrichment and deter corruption.
The report said the current system for appointing the NAB chief was a political compromise. The “agreement between the administration and opposition on the candidate for the NAB chairman lends itself to political compromises rather than a merit-based, open and competitive selection process”, it said.
It advised that following global best anti-corruption practices, the selection process for the NAB chief should be strengthened by designating a multi-sectoral stakeholder commission with representatives from administration, opposition, judiciary, civil service, academia and civil society to conduct an open, rules-based, rigorous and transparent competition.
It also questioned the broader qualification criteria for prosecutors and the NAB chairman, which allowed only retired officials like former chief justice or a judge of the Supreme Court, chief justice of a high court, officer of the armed forces, or Grade 22 or equivalent federal government officer, which already limited the pool of candidates.
Finally, an autonomous and multi-stakeholder oversight body should be formed to audit the internal control processes for significantly improving transparency and legitimacy in NAB and minimise risks of politicisation, the IMF advised.

• Questions validity of judicial confessions used to convict accused; holds that appellants are entitled to benefit of doubt
ISLAMABAD: Former Supreme Court judge Justice Athar Minallah, in a recently uploaded judgement, expressed disappointment over the state of the criminal justice system, highlighting deficiencies in integrity, competence, and professionalism in investigations and prosecutions.
Justice Minallah headed a three-judge SC bench deciding an appeal filed by Said-ur-Rehman against a Peshawar High Court, Mingora Bench (Darul Qaza Swat) verdict dated June 9, 2021.
He observed that the case reflected the inability of investigating officers to effectively discharge their statutory duties.
The case was related to the murders of two young men, Shah Faisal, 18, and Shafi-ur-Rehman, 15, in a remote area of Chitral in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The complainant, Zulekha Bibi, and her husband Gul Zaman resided with a family in Jibraik village located on the bank of Chitral River.
A bridge connecting the village to Domel was hindered by Chitral Scouts, who restricted evening crossings unless permission was granted, the judgement recalled.
Zulekha Bibi reported to Sub-Inspector Paneen Nawaz on Feb 16, 2016, that her son, Shah Faisal, and her husband’s nephew, Shafi-ur-Rehman, had gone missing.
She named eight suspects, including the appellants, alleging abduction. The complaint was received on Feb 17, 2016.
Despite disclosing a cognisable offence, it was recorded in the daily diary rather than the register under Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (CrPC).
An application for inquiry under Section 156(3) CrPC was submitted to a magistrate and allowed. After making the entry, SI Nawaz arrested both the appellants.
However, the events narrated in the complainant’s testimony during the trial differed from the version recorded in the official complaint.
The appellant, Said-ur-Rehman, was convicted under Section 201 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and sentenced to five years’ rigorous imprisonment, with an additional three years under Section 15(AA) PPC, to run concurrently with the benefit of Section 382-B CrPC.
The high court upheld the convictions and dismissed the appeals filed by the appellants through the impugned judgement of June 9, 2021.
The appellants challenged the decision before the SC, while the complainant also filed separate petitions against the acquittal of the co-accused.
Validity of judicial confessions
Justice Minallah observed that there was no last seen evidence except for the statements of the prosecution witnesses regarding the victims’ movement over the bridge, adding that the prosecution’s case rested mainly on the judicial confessions of the appellants under Section 164 CrPC.
He recalled that the SC had consistently held that a judicial confession might form the basis of a conviction if it was found to be true and made voluntarily.
Even a retracted confession retained evidentiary value if it was recorded in accordance with law and was corroborated by independent evidence.
Justice Minallah observed that the delay in recording a judicial confession, particularly while the accused remained in police custody, caste doubt on its voluntariness and necessitated heightened judicial scrutiny.
The judgement read that the prosecution’s case was in its entirety based on circumstantial evidence as there was no direct ocular testimony linking the appellants to the commission of the offence.
Therefore, their arrest was illegal, and the judicial confession, purportedly voluntary, was surrounded by serious doubts.
At the conclusion, the SC held that the appellants were entitled to the benefit of doubt and could not be convicted on the charges framed against them.
