The two — 24-year-old Sadia and her 10-month-old daughter Rida — had fallen into the sewer at the site of the under-construction Data Darbar expansion project near Bhati Gate on January 28. While the woman’s body was found late at night, the same day, the child’s body was recovered the next day. Subsequently, three officials of the contractor working on the project were arrested along with two others.
Magistrate Shafqat Abbas conducted Monday’s proceedings after police presented the suspects before the court on the expiry of their physical remand.
The suspects included Project Manager Asghar Sandhu, contractor company’s chief executive officer Salman Yasin, Site In-charge Hunzala, Ahmed Nawaz, and Daniyal.
Sajid Hussain, the father of the deceased woman, and her husband, Murtaza, the complainant, also appeared before the court.
Both informed the court that they did not wish to pursue further legal action against the suspects and had no objection to their acquittal or discharge from the case.
In light of the complainant’s statement, the magistrate approved the post-arrest bail applications of the suspects and directed them to furnish surety bonds of Rs50,000 each.
It is worth mentioning that at the previous hearing, the defence counsel told the court that the company’s owner had voluntarily surrendered to the police and presented a cheque of Rs10 million for the aggrieved family.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09184932b79ce1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972072/former-ihc-judge-tariq-mehmood-jahangiri-challenges-removal-in-fcc' target='_blank'><strong>Former IHC judge Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri challenges removal in FCC</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Former Islamabad High Court (IHC) judge Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri moved the Federal Constitutional Court on Monday against his removal.
He was removed as an IHC judge in December last year by President Asif Ali Zardari in compliance with an order by the high court, which declared that his elevation was “without lawful authority”.
A division bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan had announced the verdict on a plea challenging the validity of Jahangiri’s law degree and, by extension, his appointment as a high court judge.
On Monday, Jahangiri filed a plea in the FCC through his lawyer, Salahuddin Ahmed. The federation of Pakistan, the president of Pakistan, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan, the parliamentary committee (defunct) for the appointment of judges to superior courts, the Higher Education Commission, the University of Karachi (KU) and lawyer Mian Dawood were named as respondents. Dawood had approached the courts over Jahangiri’s appointment.
The petition, seen by Dawn, contended that an “orchestrated campaign” against Jahangiri had culminated in the removal of a constitutionally appointed high court judge. But, it continued, the development was not a “personal tragedy” for Jahangiri.
“He is satisfied with the public service he has rendered and his adherence to the dictates of his conscience and his constitutional oath,” the plea said, adding that the development, however, was “a mortal blow to the independence of the judiciary as enshrined in the very preamble and Articles 2-A, 37 and 175 of the Constitution”.
If not remedied, it “shall surely serve as a grim lesson for serving and future judges”, the plea stated.
The plea further stated that the IHC order that led to Jahangiri’s removal “proceeds on certain assumptions as opposed to appreciating the record that was before the court to determine whether” he met the constitutional qualifications to become a judge.
“The impugned order incorrectly assumes that the petitioner was ‘not holding a valid LLB degree, which is a prerequisite for enrollment as an advocate’,” plea said.
It further quoted the IHC order as stating that when Jahangiri “could not be considered as an advocate, then consequently he was not eligible for elevation as a judge of a high court in terms of the requirements of Article 175-A of the Constitution“.
But, the plea contended, the requirements for the appointment of a high court judge were described in Article 193 of the Constitution and not Article 175-A.
And the said requirements did not list the LLB degree as one of the requirements, it added.
Moreover, from the date of the issuance of the IHC order till the passing of Jahangiri’s plea in the FCC, there had been no declaration by any competent authority or court of law that declared his degree invalid, the petition further stated.
It said KU, which awarded Jahangiri his law degree, had taken the position before the IHC that the degree was declared invalid for the first time in 2024.
“Consequently, the assumption in the impugned order that the petitioner did not possess a valid degree at the time of his elevation is completely contrary to the record that was placed before the court. At no stage, any party before the court asserted that Jahangiri’s degree was invalid in the year 2020 when he was considered for elevation.”
The plea further contended that IHC order relied on the university’s declaration that the degree was invalid. But the declaration, the plea argued, had no legal effect as it had been suspended by the Sindh High Court.
And not just that, the order “also proceeds to give the declaration a retrospective effect”.
The petition further argued that the IHC division bench did not have the “jurisdiction to make any declarations regarding the validity of Jahangiri’s degree. Consequently, it proceeded to make assumptions regarding the validity of his degree.”
Moreover, the bench also made assumptions regarding Jahangiri’s licence as an advocate, the plea said.
“It asserts that Jahangiri ‘could not have been considered as an advocate’.”
But, it was a matter of record that the relevant bar council was present before the IHC and repeatedly asserted that the petitioner was their licencee and no complaint had ever been received regarding the his licence.
“The representatives of the bar council urged the court to summon the record of the bar council … The bench, instead of relying on the record of the bar council, deemed it appropriate to assume that Jahangiri could not have been considered as an advocate.”
The plea argued that the order, “being solely based on assumptions and conjectures is unconstitutional, devoid of any constitutional basis and coherence, and beyond the quo warranto jurisdiction of the high court”.
It further said: “Indeed, in the present case, it is not even disputed that Jahangiri fulfilled the constitutional qualifications prescribed by Article 193 for appointment as a judge (namely, that he has been an advocate of the high courts for more than 10 years and is over the age of 45). Rather, it is alleged (which allegations are factually disputed) that the petitioner was wrongly awarded an LLB degree (and hence was wrongly enrolled as an advocate of the high courts). Clearly, such factual disputes lie beyond the limited purview of quo warranto proceedings and require a full-fledged trial.
“Moreover, even KU proceedings through which the LLB degree of Jahangiri was withdrawn/ cancelled presently stand suspended.”
The plea also recalled that the IHC had not heard Jahangiri on the maintainability of the petition challenging his degree and had over-ruled office objections raised on it, declaring it maintainable without issuing a pre-admission notice to the former IHC judge.
“It is, of course, well-settled that the overruling of office objections does not preclude the court from examining the issue of maintainability subsequently nor does it prohibit a litigant from raising the question of maintainability (especially when he has not been heard in this regard). On this ground alone, the IHC order is liable to be set aside.”
The petition also contended the proceedings before the division bench were “vitiated by bias”, adding that the IHC order was “legally and constitutionally unsustainable as Jahangiri had been denied due process and a fair trial guaranteed under Article 10-A of the Constitution”.
“In particular, he was deprived of a fair trial and impartial tribunal; an opportunity to be heard on legal maintainability; and a reasonable opportunity to file a reply” to Dawood’s plea and address the merits of that case, the plea stated.
It also contended that the IHC lacked the jurisdiction to determine the validity of KU’s proceedings regarding Jahangiri.
“It was only the SHC that could do so and it had, already, suspended KU’s declaration cancelling/ withdrawing Jahangiri’s degree and LLB results as well as prior proceeding,” it said.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09213643a1077dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972085/khawaja-asif-stresses-need-for-national-identity-as-na-passes-resolution-condemning-islamabad-suicide-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif stresses need for national identity as NA passes resolution condemning Islamabad suicide attack</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Monday stressed the need for a national identity as the National Assembly passed a resolution condemning the attack at an imambargah in Islamabad.
Speaking on the floor of the house, Asif said, “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees.”
Talking about terrorism, he said, “The spike in terrorism in the country; I am sad to say that we are not even united in the condemnation of terrorism.”
He said that in order to protect political interests, some refrained from attending the funerals of martyrs.
“At least on national issues — all of us sitting here, regardless of which party they belong to … this is one thing on which there needs to be consensus on and that is Pakistan and its integrity as well as respect for those sacrificing their lives,” he said.
In his remarks, the minister said that two dictators in the past had joined the war in Afghanistan to please a superpower. He said terrorism was a blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past.

 

The minister said religious hatred was being fanned in Pakistan under an international conspiracy. He said the last four presidents of the United States were responsible for the killings of millions of Muslims.
“But we always try to get support from the world powers,” he added.
He said India was sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan, adding that it was the need of the hour that all Pakistanis be united to foil India’s plan.
He said that the Afghan government in the past had agreed with Pakistan’s stance but now were reluctant to give any guarantee for controlling terrorism.
“Now, India is using Afghan terrorists against us. India is fighting a proxy war in Pakistan,” he added.
He said there were differences among our religious sects which could be sorted out in Parliament instead of in mosques and imambargahs.
“Let us make this parliament functional in a real manner,” he added.
“History gives us an opportunity for course correction but we have to be loyal to the Constitution. All issues can be resolved here. All problems can be addressed if our politics becomes subservient to the state. Our loyalties to the motherland should not be conditional,” he said.
Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai, in his speech, said that a three-day debate should be held on terrorism. He said all stakeholders should sit together to find solutions to the problems plaguing the country.
He also offered unconditional support to the government for strengthening Parliament.
“If today we decide that Parliament will be the hub of power and all decisions will be taken here, all our problems will be resolved,” he added.
He also urged the government to ask the United Nations secretary general to hold an international conference on Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the NA also passed a resolution condemning the suicide bombing at the imambargah.
The resolution — tabled by PML-N lawmaker Hameed Hussain — called the attack “a direct attack on the Constitution of Pakistan, religious freedom, national security and interfaith harmony”.
“This house demands that the suicide bombers, facilitators, planners and patrons involved in this incident be exposed and brought to justice,” it said.
It further demanded indiscriminate action be taken against banned organisations and their networks, social media propaganda and public activities.







“Effective and permanent arrangements should be made for the security of places of worship, especially mosques and imambargahs,” the resolution added.
“Immediate and adequate financial assistance should be provided to the families of martyrs, while the injured should be provided with the best medical facilities,” it further demanded.
The resolution further called for an effective counterterrorism strategy at the national level, which should be practically implemented by authorities.
“This house reiterates its resolve that terrorism, sectarianism and hate-based violence will not be tolerated in Pakistan, and will ensure the protection of lives and property of the citizens at all costs,” it said.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0919162606f69a1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972074/psl-franchise-multan-sultans-sold-for-record-rs245bn-new-owner-says-name-will-be-changed-to-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>PSL franchise Multan Sultans sold for record Rs2.45bn; new owner says name will be changed to Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Super League franchise (PSL) Multan Sultans on Monday was sold to Walee Technologies for a record Rs2.45 billion ahead of the tournament’s 11th edition.
At the auction in Lahore, show host Fakhr-i-Alam informed bidders that the winning bid would also cover the annual fee to maintain ownership of the team for the next 10 years.







Speaking at the auction ceremony, the new owner of the team announced that they would be changing the name to Rawalpindi.
“Are you ready for a surprise? We will be going for Rawalpindi!” announced the company’s chief executive officer, Ahsan Tahir.
Speaking at the ceremony, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi congratulated Walee Technologies on their successful bid and expressed gratitude to former board chairman Najam Sethi for his vision for the Multan Sultans franchise.
“Multan Sultans was created by Najam Sethi sahib; we are so pleased he is with us today,” Naqvi said, inviting Sethi onto the stage.
In his remarks, Sethi said, “I’m obviously delighted to be here; this is the culmination of a dream come true.
“I’m obviously over the moon that it’s come through under Mohsin Naqvi, who is a dear, dear friend of mine,” he said.
Sethi hailed the winning bid as a “great moment for Pakistan cricket”, adding that Naqvi would give good news “beyond PSL” over the coming days.
Later, at a press conference with representatives from Walee Technologies, Naqvi said that the future of the Multan Sultans brand would have to be considered.
“I cannot ask the person paying Rs2.45bn to keep the name Multan Sultans,” he said.
“When we discussed auctioning Multan Sultans, we planned to keep it for one or two years. But there was a good environment in the market and we were already auctioning five or six teams,” he said.
The PCB chief noted that there were concerns, given the brand’s age and the possibility of damage to its reputation.
“For me, Multan Sultans is very close to my heart, so we will come up with a solution,” Naqvi said.
When asked about the criteria for setting the opening bid at Rs1.82bn, he replied that it was the second-highest bid for the Sialkot team, which was sold for Rs1.85bn.
To a question about ongoing meetings with a delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Pakistan’s boycott of the match with India in the T20 World Cup, Naqvi replied, “The issue was Bangladesh’s. We did not want to let their point of view go; they are our brothers and you saw the situation.
“Things are happening, which is why I won’t say much, but the ICC and the Bangladesh board are in that phase where if I say anything, it won’t be right. We’ll update you once we receive information,” the PCB chief said.
Naqvi said that “guests need to be respected” when asked about the attitude of the visiting ICC delegation.
Walee Technologies is a global company specialising in projects in the media, finance and technology sectors, according to their website, which added that the company had also earlier acquired PSL livestreaming rights.
The Multan franchise, started in 2017, competed in eight consecutive editions of the PSL, winning the league in 2021.
Last November, the franchise was left ownerless after the PCB did not extend a renewal offer to owner Ali Khan Tareen. The PCB then announced it would take over the franchise for the upcoming tournament.
Bids were invited on January 14 and their technical evaluation was completed by February 3.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/092320265cdc3e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to play T20 World Cup match against India, govt announces</strong></a><br><p>The government announced on Monday that Pakistan would play the T20 World Cup match against India, scheduled for February 15.
The decision to play the match comes after a delegation from the ICC arrived in the country over the weekend and held meetings with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match against India. It also came hours after Sri Lanka urged Pakistan to play India.
In a post on X, the government said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was formally briefed by PCB Chairman Naqvi regarding the outcomes of high-level deliberations held between the PCB, representatives of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).
“The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the BCB, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges,” it said.







“The government further noted the statement by BCB President Aminul Islam. The profound gratitude expressed by our brotherly nation is received with great warmth. Pakistan reaffirms that it stands shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh,” it said.
It noted that PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier in the day.
“During their warm and friendly conversation, they recalled that Pakistan and Sri Lanka had always stood shoulder to shoulder, especially during challenging times. The Sri Lankan president requested the prime minister to accord serious consideration to amicably resolve the current impasse,” the government said.
“In view of the outcomes achieved in multilateral discussions, as well as the request of friendly countries, the government of Pakistan hereby directs the Pakistan national cricket team to take the field on February 15, 2026, for its scheduled fixture in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” it said.
“Moreover, this decision has been taken with the aim of protecting the spirit of cricket, and to support the continuity of this global sport in all participating nations,” the government said.
“The prime minister and the people of Pakistan extend their best wishes to the Men in Green. We remain confident that our team will carry the spirit of sportsmanship and national pride onto the field as they compete for global glory,” the government said.
Reacting to the post, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said, “Game on hai (the game is on)!”
“The whole nation stands behind the men in green. Great decision by the PM Shehbaz and great diplomacy by PCB chairman,” he said.







Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called PM Shehbaz earlier in the day, thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.
“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said.







“As co-host of the tournament, Sri Lanka thanks the ICC and all concerned for their efforts. Sri Lanka hasn’t forgotten the solidarity shown by both India and Pakistan during the 1996 World Cup, when they played in Colombo at a time when others refrained due to security concerns,” he said.
Sri Lanka urges Pakistan to play match
Earlier in the day, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake had urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India. He made the request during a phone call with PM Shehbaz, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
“Pakistan fully supported Sri Lankan cricket during terrorism in Sri Lanka,” he was quoted as saying.
“Pakistan gave priority to its long-standing relations with Sri Lanka above all else, and the Pakistani cricket team continued to tour the country to play cricket despite terrorism,” Dissanayake said.







The premier welcomed the Sri Lankan president’s sentiments and noted how Colombo also stood with Islamabad during difficult times and kept cricket going in Pakistan.
“Recently, the Sri Lankan team took an unforgettable step for the Pakistani nation and cricket fans by not cancelling the tour of Pakistan,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.
According to the statement, PM Shehbaz said he would inform the Sri Lankan president about a “final decision” regarding the Pak-India match after consultations.
Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India. In the statement shared by state-run PTV on X, the BCB expressed gratitude to the PCB and ICC for their “positive roles in trying to overcome recent challenges”.
He particularly thanked the PCB, its chairman and cricket fans in Pakistan for their support.
“Throughout this period, the PCB has demonstrated exemplary sportsmanship and solidarity,” the statement read.







Quoting BCB President Islam, the statement read, “We are deeply moved by Pakistan’s efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish.
“Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,” Islam added.
No penalty on Bangladesh for opting out of World Cup: ICC
Meanwhile, the ICC said that it would not impose any penalty on the BCB for opting out of the T20 World Cup and also agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the 2031 tournament.
In a statement, the ICC said that it had concluded an “open, constructive and congenial dialogue” with PCB and BCB officials, saying that the meeting was not limited to the tournament in India, but the “broader outlook for cricket in South Asia”.
“While reflecting on the Bangladesh cricket team’s unfortunate absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the global governing body for cricket reaffirmed BCB’s position as a valued full member, with a proud cricketing history and a vital role in the growth of the global game,” it said.







The statement reiterated the ICC’s continued facilitation of growth in one of cricket’s “most vibrant” markets, with more than 200 million passionate fans, to ensure that Bangladesh’s non-participation in the tournament did not have any long-term effects on cricket in the country.
Sharing the highlights of the dialogue with BCB and PCB officials, the statement said that it reflected “a forward-looking alignment reached in good faith” and was “intended to provide clarity on the current position of the stakeholders”.
It further mentioned that these outcomes did not “alter, qualify or detract from the ICC’s constitutional autonomy, governance framework or established decision-making processes”, all of which remained fully applicable.
The governing body added that it was agreed that “no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on [the] BCB” in relation to the current matter.
“It is acknowledged that BCB retains the right to approach the dispute resolution committee should it choose to do so. This right exists under current ICC regulations and remains intact,” it stated.
The statement noted that the ICC’s approach was guided by its principles of neutrality and fairness and reflected the shared objective of facilitative support rather than punishment.
Moreover, all the parties reached an agreement that Bangladesh would host an ICC event prior to the Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2031, “subject to the usual ICC hosting processes, timelines and operational requirements”.
“This reflects confidence in Bangladesh’s capability as a host and reinforces the ICC’s commitment to providing meaningful hosting opportunities across its membership to develop cricket in the country,” the statement read.
It added that the governing body, the Pakistani and Bangladeshi boards and other members remained committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport.
“All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity,” the statement read
ICC Chief Executive Sanjog Gupta was quoted as saying, “Bangladesh’s absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is regrettable but it does not alter the ICC’s enduring commitment to Bangladesh as a core cricketing nation.
“Our focus continues to be on working closely with key stakeholders, including BCB, to ensure the sport grows sustainably in the country and that future opportunities for its players and fans are strengthened,” Gupta said.
He further added that Bangladesh remained a priority cricket ecosystem deserving of long-term investment in its development, competitiveness and global integration, and was not defined by short-term disruptions.
Earlier this month, the government had given the cricket team the nod to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.
The decision had come after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the tournament, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
It should be mentioned that Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1000015537caa75.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972093/iran-says-it-could-dilute-enriched-uranium-if-all-sanctions-are-lifted' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says it could dilute enriched uranium if all sanctions are lifted</strong></a><br><p>Iran could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for all financial sanctions being lifted, its atomic chief said on Monday, one of the most direct indications so far of its position at talks with Washington.
US and Iranian diplomats held talks through Omani mediators in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy, after US President Donald Trump positioned a naval flotilla in the region, raising fears of new military action.
The talks follow a crackdown on anti-government demonstrations in Iran last month.
Trump joined an Israeli bombing campaign last year and hit Iranian nuclear sites. He also threatened last month to intervene militarily during the protests, but ultimately held off.
Washington has demanded Iran relinquish its stockpile — estimated last year by the UN nuclear agency at more than 440 kilogrammes — of uranium enriched to up to 60 per cent fissile purity, a small step away from the 90pc that is considered weapons grade.
The head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation, Mohammad Eslami, said on Monday: “The possibility of diluting 60pc enriched uranium … depends on whether, in return, all sanctions are lifted or not”.
Eslami, whose remarks were reported by Iran’s ISNA news agency, said, however, that another proposal, sending Iran’s highly enriched uranium abroad to another country, had not been discussed at the talks with US officials.
Khamenei adviser to visit Oman
Ali Larijani, a close adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and secretary of its national security council, will visit Oman on Tuesday following the US-Iranian talks there, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.
“During this trip, (Larijani) will meet with high-ranking officials of the Sultanate of Oman and discuss the latest regional and international developments and bilateral cooperation at various levels,” Tasnim said.
The date and venue of the next round of talks have yet to be announced.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Monday that a new round of talks would be “an appropriate opportunity for a fair and balanced resolution of this case,” and that a desired outcome could be reached if the US avoids maximalist positions and respects its commitments.
Iran would continue to demand the lifting of sanctions and insist on its nuclear rights, including enrichment, he said.
Iran and the US held five rounds of talks last year on curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme, with the process breaking down mainly due to disputes over uranium enrichment inside Iran.
Since Trump struck Iran’s facilities, Tehran has said it has halted enrichment activity. It has always said its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes.
The United States wants to include Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal in negotiations, but Tehran has ruled this out.
In a televised statement aired on Monday, Khamenei called on Iranians to participate in the coming anniversary of the 1979 revolution.
“The presence of the people in the march and their expression of loyalty to the Islamic Republic will cause the enemy to stop coveting Iran,” Khamenei said.</p><small>2026-02-09 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649989-defence-minister-calls-for-unity-as-na-unanimously-adopts-resolution-against-tarlai-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif calls for unity as NA unanimously adopts resolution against Islamabad attack</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking in the National Assembly, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that 33 people were killed in the attack while more than 150 were injured. However, hospital records show that the toll has increased.
On the day of the incident, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) spokesperson Dr Aneeza Jalil said that 28 dead bodies were brought to the hospital. On the other hand, Polyclinic said that four dead bodies were brought to the hospital, which added up to 32 deaths, as reported by the media.
A day later, on Saturday, the Pims Spokesperson confirmed that a patient had died. The same day, it was also learnt that some of the injured were shifted to the HBS Institute of Healthcare and Allied Health Sciences, out of which three had died.
The hospital’s representative, Dr Riaz Janjua, told Dawn that three deaths were reported at his hospital. He informed that as many as 67 injured were brought to the medical facility.
Therefore, with the addition of three deaths at the private hospital, the death toll reached 36.
On Monday, two more deaths were confirmed; one of the injured died at Polyclinic while another, who was shifted from Pims to a private hospital, also breathed his last, taking the toll to 38.
Moreover, a document from Polyclinic shows that five deaths involving the incident have been recorded so far, with the first four being on Friday and the latest on Monday. The document also showed that seven patients were in critical condition and one was on the ventilator.
According to the Pims spokesperson, 40 of those injured were still being treated at the hospital. Out of these, seven were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). She said that 29 deaths had been recorded at the hospital so far.
Friday’s suicide blast at the Tarlai Imambargah was the second major terrorist attack in the federal capital in less than three months despite heightened security measures adopted by the police and the capital administration.

 

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday said that four facilitators behind the incident, including the mastermind, had been arrested, saying the suspects were detained in overnight raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2026-02-09 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09204222f8f70ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972080/t20-world-cup-all-the-pressure-on-pakistan-says-usa-leg-spinner-mohammad-mohsin' target='_blank'><strong>T20 World Cup: ‘All the pressure’ on Pakistan, says USA leg-spinner Mohammad Mohsin</strong></a><br><p>USA leg-spinner Mohammad Mohsin said on Monday that “the pressure will be on Pakistan” when the teams lock horns in the T20 World Cup again, two years after the Americans inflicted a shock defeat on the former champions.
But Pakistan quick bowler Salman Mirza insisted the stunning super over defeat in Dallas in the 2024 T20 World Cup would be firmly “in the past” when the two clash in Colombo on Tuesday.
The USA team gave tournament favourites India a big scare in their opening match in Mumbai, reducing them to 77-6 at one point, with Mohsin taking a wicket on his T20 World Cup debut, before losing by 29 runs.
They are confident they can repeat their stunning upset of two years ago in the Group A encounter.
“The pressure of losing the last game will be on Pakistan,” said Mohsin.
Born and brought up playing cricket in Pakistan, Mohsin migrated to the US five years ago and warned that the USA was a better team now than two years ago.
“I have played with most of the players in this Pakistan team, so I have given my input to the team and we are a more skilled and confident team.”
Mirza was confident the last defeat would not prey on the Pakistan players’ minds.
“Winning and losing are part of the game; it happens in cricket,” Mirza said. “The defeat against the USA is now past and behind us.”
Pakistan, the 2009 champions, were close to suffering another shock in their opening match against the Netherlands on Saturday.
Pakistan were staring at defeat with 29 runs needed in the last two overs but all-rounder Faheem Ashraf’s big hitting bailed them out.
Pakistan cannot afford any slip-ups if they are to qualify for the super eight stage as one of the top two teams in Group A after saying they would not play India on February 15.
Defeat to the USA two years ago saw them fail to get out of the group.
Mirza admitted the smaller teams were dangerous opponents.
“Until now, all the matches are close and no team is small or big in this format,” said Mirza, who took 3-24 against the Netherlands.
Pakistan may bring back experienced batsman Fakhar Zaman to replace Babar Azam, who has been criticised for slow scoring.</p><small>2026-02-09 15:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09164534ccaad8c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972063/uks-prince-william-and-kate-deeply-concerned-about-epstein-revelations' target='_blank'><strong>UK’s Prince William and Kate ‘deeply concerned’ about Epstein revelations</strong></a><br><p>Britain’s Prince William and his wife Kate said on Monday they were deeply concerned by the revelations in the Jeffrey Epstein files amid further damning disclosures about the heir-to-the-throne’s uncle Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles who had already been cast out of the royal inner circle over his close relationship with Epstein, has faced fresh scrutiny since the recent publication of millions of new documents relating to the late convicted US sex offender.
While Charles and his wife Camilla said in October that their thoughts and sympathies were with the victims and survivors of abuse, Monday’s comment by the Prince and Princess of Wales is the most pointed message so far delivered by the royal family on the Epstein scandal.
“I can confirm the prince and princess have been deeply concerned by the continuing revelations,” a spokesperson for William and Kate told reporters ahead of the prince’s arrival in Riyadh for a high-profile trip. “Their thoughts remain focused on the victims.”
Mountbatten-Windsor, 65, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has faced years of scrutiny over his friendship with Epstein, and in 2022 settled a lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre which accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager. Giuffre died by suicide in April.
He has always denied any wrongdoing and not responded to requests for comment since the latest release of Epstein files, but his relationship with Epstein has cost him his role in the royal family, titles and home.
He was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 and in October Charles removed his title of prince. Last week, he was forced to move out of his royal mansion.
In the latest batch of files released in the US, emails suggest he shared official British trade documents with Epstein in 2010, after Epstein’s conviction for child sex crimes, leaking information from his then-official role as a government envoy.
The documents appear to show that Andrew forwarded Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places that he had been sent in relation to an official trip.
Trade envoys are usually barred from sharing sensitive or commercial documents under strict confidentiality rules.
Police say ‘assessing’ accusation of misconduct
British police said officers were “assessing” accusations of misconduct in public office against Andrew after emails emerged showing the ex-UK trade envoy may have passed potentially confidential reports to Epstein.
“We can confirm receipt of this report and are assessing the information in line with our established procedures,” a spokesperson for Thames Valley Police, west of London, said in a statement.
Anti-monarchy activist Graham Smith, who heads the pressure group Republic, said earlier on Monday he had filed the police report after the emails were among US government files on the late US sex offender Epstein released last month.
Thames Valley Police said last week they were reviewing a new allegation against Andrew involving a woman being taken to an address in Windsor in light of the latest Epstein files.
Over the last 10 days, revelations from the Epstein files have engulfed British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in what is widely viewed as the biggest crisis of his premiership.
Starmer appointed an acquaintance of Epstein, Peter Mandelson, as ambassador to the United States.
Like Andrew, it appears that Mandelson also shared sensitive government files from 2009 and 2010 with Epstein and police are investigating claims of misconduct in public office.</p><small>2026-02-09 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09183501f273bd3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972071/india-says-it-will-maintain-multiple-sources-of-energy-supply' target='_blank'><strong>India says it will maintain multiple sources of energy supply</strong></a><br><p>India plans to maintain multiple sources of energy supply and diversify them when needed as New Delhi looks to ensure consumers receive “adequate energy at the right price through reliable and secure supplies”, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said on Monday.
Misri was responding to a question at a media briefing seeking clarity on India’s position on the purchase of Russian oil after US President Donald Trump said last week that New Delhi had “committed to stop directly or indirectly” importing it.
“India’s priority is to safeguard the interests of its consumers through an energy policy driven by adequate availability, fair pricing, and reliability of supply,” Misri said.
He added that India was neither dependent on any single source for crude oil nor did it “intend to be”, importing from a “mix of sources” depending on “objective market conditions”, adding that “national interests” guide both the government and Indian energy companies.
Last week, Trump signed an executive order lifting the punitive 25% tariff on all imports from India over its purchase of Russian oil.
The Kremlin earlier said it saw nothing new in India’s announcement that it would diversify its energy sourcing.
India’s Russian oil imports slipped in January as refiners sought more alternative barrels under Western sanctions pressure and US-India trade talks, Reuters reported.</p><small>2026-02-09 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649928-lahore-manhole-deaths-court-grants-bail-after-complainants-forgive-accused' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore manhole deaths: Suspects granted bail after victims' heirs pardon them</strong></a><br><p>

At the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on Friday, Thomas DiNanno, the US under secretary of state for arms control, accused China of conducting the tests, including one on 22 June, 2020, and of preparing for more tests with massive yields.
“The US allegations are completely groundless and are outright lies. China firmly opposes the US attempt to fabricate excuses for its own restarting of nuclear tests,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement to AFP on Monday.
It also urged the US to “immediately stop its irresponsible actions”.
US President Donald Trump said in October that Washington would start testing nuclear weapons “on an equal basis” with Moscow and Beijing, but without elaborating or explaining what kind of nuclear testing he wanted to resume.

 

DiNanno’s comments came as he was presenting a new US plan calling for three-way talks with Russia and China to set new limits on nuclear weapons, after the expiration of New START — the last treaty between top nuclear powers Washington and Moscow, which expired last Thursday.
China has already rejected joining disarmament negotiations “at this stage”.</p><small>2026-02-09 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0917242785c7a54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972067/omar-ayub-ali-amin-gandapur-declared-absconders-in-haqeeqi-azadi-march-case' target='_blank'><strong>Omar Ayub, Ali Amin Gandapur declared absconders in ‘Haqeeqi Azadi March’ case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A judicial magistrate on Monday declared two PTI leaders — former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur and ex-National Assembly opposition leader Omar Ayub — absconders in two case pertaining to the party’s 2022 ‘Haqeeqi Azadi March’.
The march is one of several protests that the party has carried out following the ouster of PTI founder Imran Khan as the prime minister through a no-confidence vote in 2022.
Judicial Magistrate Mubashir Hassan Chishti heard the two cases related to the protest, registered at Islamabad’s Bara Kahu police station, declaring Ayub and Gandapur absconders and issuing their perpetual arrest warrants over their persistent absence from hearings.
Judge Chishti observed that the two had failed to appear before the court despite the issuance of summons multiple times. They also did not furnish any plausible justification for their absence, the judge noted.
They were summoned several times, but they continued to evade the proceedings, the judge remarked.
Making these observations, he declared both PTI leaders absconders and directed the issuance of permanent arrest warrants for them so that they are presented before the court.
Over Gandapur and Ayub’s persistent absence from the proceedings, the court had formalised their status as proclaimed offenders at a previous hearing.
Meanwhile, the court had acquitted several others accused in the case, including PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Zartaj Gul, in the two cases on the basis of insufficient evidence to establish their involvement in the allegations levelled by the police.
According to the prosecution, the two cases were registered in connection with alleged violations of law and order during the ‘Haqeeqi Azadi March’, with police claiming that the accused had incited people to commit unlawful activities and obstructed officials from performing their duties. The defence, however, had consistently maintained that the cases were politically motivated.</p><small>2026-02-09 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09171847b2b288f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972066/punjab-cm-lauds-authorities-on-organising-safe-basant' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM lauds authorities on organising ‘safe Basant’</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif on Monday praised authorities for organising a “safe Basant” festival over the weekend in Lahore.
In televised remarks, she expressed gratitude to various authorities for their arrangements and work during the three-day festival to make sure it was a success.
“I wish to praise all 15 departments of the Punjab government for arranging a safe Basant with a whole-of-government approach,” she said. She made special mention of Punjab Inspector General Rao Abdul Kareem, Lahore Capital City Police Officer Bilal Kamyana, Lahore Deputy Inspector General Operations Faisal Kamran and their teams.
CM Maryam also expressed happiness that citizens followed standard operating procedures and installed “safety rods” on their bikes, aimed at preventing motorcyclists from suffering injuries caused by kite strings.
“It was a positive change for lots of people, where people saw that citizens in Lahore were abiding by the law and following safety protocols,” she added.
“It gave me hope that we can achieve our potential as a disciplined and law-abiding nation,” she said.
CM Maryam also stated that there was not a single death caused by injuries from kite strings during the festival.
“For the first time, not a single death from kite string injuries, such as throats being slit, was recorded during the festival,” she noted.
“There were some incidents; there were two electrocutions, where children climbed power pylons to retrieve kites. But it was the first Basant; it used to be called ‘Bloody Basant’ because so many people’s throats were slit with kite strings.”
CM Maryam also lauded the efforts of Lahore Commissioner Maryam Khan, as well as deputy and assistant commissioners, for real-time monitoring of violations throughout the festival.
“I would also like to thank the Punjab Information and Technology Board for using technology to make Basant easier for us to manage,” CM Maryam said.
She also thanked the traffic police for successfully managing heavy traffic inflows and the Punjab Horticulture Authority for their “beautiful arrangements”.
She also thanked the Lahore Electric Supply Company for ensuring teams were on standby to prevent accidents involving people recovering kites caught in power lines.
“After so many years, it brings me happiness to see positive headlines and a positive image of Punjab,” CM Maryam said.
“The world learned that Punjab has a storied history, culture and heritage,” she said.
She expressed happiness that Gen Z could leave behind their screens and gadgets, and experience the festival in an open atmosphere with their families.
“They have connected to their culture and history,” she stated. “The day is not far away when they will fully take pride in their history and culture and the confidence that comes with it.”
The chief minister added that people from all over Pakistan came to Lahore to participate in the festivities.
“Punjab is healing, Pakistan is healing”, she said. “People put aside their differences, their sorrow and their problems and celebrated as one nation.”
A day earlier, CM Maryam had lauded the people of Lahore for abiding by the standard operating procedures set by the provincial government.
However, on Saturday, it had emerged that the Punjab home department’s control room had received at least 118 Basant-related accident cases, including six casualties, during the first two days of the festival. The six casualties included four incidents of falling from rooftops and one each when young boys tried to climb an electric pole and a tree to catch kites.
Meanwhile, a young journalist also reportedly died after falling from the rooftop of his house in Sanda area on Sunday night.</p><small>2026-02-09 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0917115549a87c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972056/pakistan-to-invest-1bn-in-artificial-intelligence-by-2030-announces-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to invest $1bn in artificial intelligence by 2030, announces PM</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday announced the government’s plan to invest $1 billion in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030.
The Indus AI Week 2026 is being held from February 9 to 15 (Sunday). The event’s website describes it as “Pakistan’s official national platform for artificial intelligence — where policy, innovation, talent and investment converge”.
“The government of Pakistan is committed to investing $1 billion in AI by 2030, which will go a long way in building an AI ecosystem in our country,” the premier said while addressing the event’s inauguration ceremony in Islamabad.



Announcing further steps the country aims to take to keep up with modern technologies, PM Shehbaz said an AI curriculum would be introduced “not only in all federally-controlled or -run schools but all schools” of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB).
He emphasised that the plan would be implemented in remote parts of Balochistan as well to “pair our youth for leadership and digital economy”.
The prime minister further said the government would provide 1,000 fully-funded PHD scholarships in AI to students across the country by 2030, which is aimed at building Pakistan’s “world-class research centre fully capacitated”.

 

“Last but not least, we will launch a nationwide programme to train 1 million non-IT professionals in AI skills, enabling them to enhance productivity and improving livelihoods,” he added.
“Pakistan is absolutely ready to accept the challenge and walk with our global partners, absolutely with great commitment and dedication,” PM Shehbaz affirmed.
He elaborated that agriculture and mines and minerals would be among the areas of focus, adding that the government aimed to empower the youth, which he said comprises 60 per cent of the country’s total population.
“We have to empower them with modern knowledge and modern techniques, and IT startups and IT technicians are already very concerned and feeling the heat and the challenge,” he noted, assuring them the government would bring programmes to “transform them from IT technicians to AI experts”.

 

He added this would unlock unprecedented gains in agricultural yield, quality and efficiency, as well as in industrial growth and women’s empowerment.
The government approved the National AI Policy in July 2025 to democratise access to artificial intelligence, enhance public services and open up new employment and innovation avenues.
However, the policy’s implementation has stalled more than six months after its approval due to a government decision to amend the composition of the AI Council and a lack of response from provincial governments.
The only pillar of the National AI Policy currently being implemented is creating “Awareness and Readiness”. Officials claim the Indus AI week is the first step in this regard.
‘Nothing short of a game-changer’
At the outset of his address, the premier noted that the Indus AI Week is “going to not only change the technological landscape of Pakistan, but this will be nothing short of a game-changer”.
“In collaboration with our most friendly and brotherly countries, we will start running on this shared pathway with great commitment and enthusiasm,” he added.







PM Shehbaz stressed that the government of his brother and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif was “striving our best to be in line with modern requirements and meet modern challenges”.
He recalled that as the chief minister of Punjab back then, the government undertook various initiatives which were “very, very relevant and important to the promotion of education, health, revenues and encouraging our youth”.
The premier highlighted that the Punjab government initiated a laptop distribution scheme in 2010 in the province’s schools and colleges. He further mentioned that the government rolled out e-libraries and e-stamp papers, with the latter aimed at generating “additional revenue which was being siphoned off through collusion”.

 

PM Shehbaz also pointed out the computerisation of land records in Punjab carried out with “great partnership with World Bank, which eased out corrupt revenue officers”.
“They were carrying bags in their offices. They were tinkering with the record, and money was exchanged in hands. All of this was brought to a grinding halt through complete digitisation,” he asserted.
The prime minister highlighted that the country’s first Safe City project — which uses surveillance cameras to reduce crime — and the first IT university were established in Lahore.
“Here we are today, learning our lessons from the past and today Pakistan is absolutely ready on its toes to join the world in the field of AI interventions,” he affirmed.
PM Shehbaz also mentioned the digitalisation process of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), saying it was “almost transformed” at this point.
He said: “It’s doing a great job. We have controlled smuggling in Pakistan through various, most modern initiatives, bringing in scanners and other digital instruments which have been installed at various ports of Pakistan.
“We are recovering lost sums of money [and] tax evaded through collusion through these platforms.”
“Our commitment is solid, unwavering. We will never look back, we will keep on moving forward, marching forward till a point will soon come one day when Pakistan will find its destiny among the comity of nations.”
Addressing the event, IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja said Indus AI Week aimed to strengthen coordination between universities, governments and international companies, state-run APP reported.
She noted that the Pakistan Digital Authority was preparing a nationwide digital master plan to guide future transformation.
In his remarks, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal highlighted that the world had entered a moment where intelligence itself had become a factor of production, with nations competing on ideas, talent, data and technology rather than commodities.
He described AI as a bigger “disruptor” than electricity or the internet.
The minister stated that Pakistan’s engagement with technology began over two decades ago with early IT policies, the creation of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), and large-scale investment in advanced human capital.</p><small>2026-02-09 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0916190580344ad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972062/8-muslim-nations-including-pakistan-warn-against-expansionist-israeli-policies-in-occupied-west-bank' target='_blank'><strong>8 Muslim nations, including Pakistan, warn against ‘expansionist Israeli policies’ in occupied West Bank</strong></a><br><p>Eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, in a joint statement on Monday, warned against the “continued expansionist Israeli policies” in the occupied West Bank.
In the statement, the foreign minister of Pakistan — along with those of Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and Qatar — “condemned in the strongest terms the illegal Israeli decisions and measures aimed at imposing unlawful Israeli sovereignty, entrenching settlement activity, and enforcing a new legal and administrative reality in the occupied West Bank, thereby accelerating attempts at its illegal annexation and the displacement of the Palestinian people”.







The statement comes a day after Israel’s security cabinet approved a series of steps that would make it easier for settlers in the occupied West Bank to buy land while granting Israeli authorities more enforcement powers over Palestinians, according to Israeli media.
Citing statements by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defence Minister Israel Katz, Israeli news sites Ynet and Haaretz said the measures included scrapping decades-old regulations that prevent Jewish private citizens buying land in the West Bank.
The statement issued on Monday by the eight Muslim countries reaffirmed that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory”.
“The ministers warned against the continued expansionist Israeli policies and illegal measures pursued by the Israeli government in the occupied West Bank, which fuel violence and conflict in the region,” the statement said.
The ministers expressed “absolute rejection” of Israel’s actions, which they maintained “constitute a blatant violation of international law, undermine the two-state solution, and represent an assault on the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to realise their independent and sovereign state”.
“Such actions also undermine the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the region,” the statement added.
The ministers also held that “these illegal measures in the occupied West Bank are null and void and constitute a clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 2334, which condemns all Israeli measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character, and status of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967”.
In that regard, the ministers recalled the “2024 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which found that Israel’s policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territory and its continued presence is illegal, affirmed the necessity of ending the Israeli occupation, and the nullity of the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.”
The ministers, in their statement, called on the international community to “fulfil its legal and moral responsibilities and to compel Israel to halt its dangerous escalation in the occupied West Bank and the inciting statements of its officials.”
“They stressed that the fulfilment of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and statehood,” the ministers said.
They further underscored the need for the statehood to be “based on the two-state solution in accordance with resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative,” which the minister said “remains the only path to achieving just and comprehensive peace that ensures security and stability in the region”.
It should be mentioned that the same eight countries had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza.
In a statement issued earlier this month, the eight nations had condemned the repeated violations of the ceasefire in Gaza by Israel, asserting that these actions risked undermining efforts for restoring stability at a time when regional and international partners were working collectively to advance the second phase of Trump’s plan.</p><small>2026-02-09 11:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09153211da62f8b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972060/ihcs-justice-minhas-questions-what-constitutes-fake-news-in-peca-amendments' target='_blank'><strong>IHC’s Justice Minhas questions what constitutes ‘fake news’ in Peca amendments</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday questioned the mechanism for determining what constitutes “fake news” in the amended Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
The IHC judge made the remarks while hearing petitions filed by journalists’ bodies and senior journalists challenging the controversial amendments to Peca, which they argue curtail freedom of expression and vest excessive powers in the executive.
The petitions have been filed by senior journalist Hamid Mir, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), the Islamabad High Court Journalists Association (IHCJA), and others.
During the hearing, the counsel for the petitioner read out the added provisions of the amended law and contended that powers traditionally exercised by the judiciary had been transferred to the executive through the amendments.
The counsel argued that matters relating to the determination of false or fake information should be adjudicated by an independent judicial tribunal constituted in consultation with the chief justice of Pakistan, rather than by executive authorities.
Referring to Section 2C of the amended law, which deals with a ban on fake and false information on social media, Justice Minhas raised a series of critical questions.
“Who will decide whether the information is fake or false?” the judge asked, seeking clarification on the procedure and standards laid down in the law. “Explain how fake news will be determined. How will proceedings regarding fake news begin?” he further inquired.
In response, the petitioner’s counsel submitted that the amended law introduced a new mechanism for filing complaints, under which not only the aggrieved party but also a third party could initiate proceedings.
“This provision opens the door for proxies to file complaints, which will inevitably lead to misuse of the law,” the counsel argued. He added that it was essential to assess the actual harm caused by the alleged fake information, as not every incorrect statement amounted to disinformation.
“Fake information can also be the result of an error that does not cause harm to anyone,” he said.
During the proceedings, Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists (RIUJ) President Asif Bashir Chaudhry also addressed the court.
He informed the bench that PFUJ had approached the court against Peca on February 6 last year, but the case had remained pending without any stay order.

 

He claimed that during this period, more than two dozen journalists had been sentenced to life imprisonment. He also referred to a case registered against a journalist who had reported the use of substandard materials in road construction, which later led to the road’s early demolition.
In response to the petition, Justice Minhas observed that the matter involved legislation enacted by parliament and reiterated that such a law could not be suspended through a restraining order at the interim stage.
“This is legislation. It cannot be suspended through an interim order,” the judge remarked, adding that the court would decide the matter after hearing detailed arguments from all sides.
The court subsequently adjourned the hearing until March 6.

 

Peca, since its introduction in 2016, has been widely criticised as a “black law” created mainly to punish dissent. Last year, new provisions in the law introduced harsher penalties for what the government considers “fake news”, the expansion of state oversight of digital platforms, and the creation of new regulatory bodies to monitor social media.
At the time of its passage, Amnesty International had warned that the proposed changes to the country’s cybercrime laws could “further tighten the government’s grip over Pakistan’s heavily controlled digital landscape” if enacted into law.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had also expressed concern that amendments “would curb fundamental rights.”
In August 2025, the Senate Standing Committee on Information and Broadcasting showed its concern over registration of cases against journalists under Peca and called for urgent action to address growing concerns of media persons regarding FIRs and arrests of journalists.</p><small>2026-02-09 11:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/091531559be72ad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972054/around-a-million-children-missed-during-years-first-nationwide-polio-campaign-53000-refusals-reported' target='_blank'><strong>Around a million children missed during year’s first nationwide polio campaign; 53,000 refusals reported</strong></a><br><p>Around a million children were missed and 53,000 refusals were reported during the year’s first nationwide polio campaign.

During the campaign, polio drops were administered to more than 44.3 million children, marking a significant milestone in Pakistan’s continued efforts to eradicate polio.
While the data shows that the polio programme achieved overall household coverage of 98pc, with 2pc children missed, the number of missed children is still huge and worrisome given Pakistan’s population.
Overall, 0.95m children were reported as missed during the campaign. A large proportion of these (0.67m) were missed because children were not available at home at the time of vaccination.
During the campaign, 2.5 million guest children were vaccinated, likely covering a substantial share of children recorded as not being available at home.
“233,000 children were reported as leftovers due to security constraints, community boycotts, and snow-bound areas,” an official of the programme said, wishing not to be quoted.
“Of the total leftovers, 184,000 were from KP, including 113,000 from south KP. In AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan, around 50,000 children remained unreachable due to snow-bound areas and non-conduct of campaigns.”
“In Balochistan, the polio eradication campaign was postponed in Mastung, Gwadar, Chagai, and Awaran due to security reasons. 0.14pc of the total targeted children were reported as refusals, with 31,000 refusals from Karachi, forming the largest share,” the official added.
“The National Emergency Operation Center (EOC) extends its sincere appreciation to all relevant stakeholders for their cooperation, commitment, and active participation in ensuring the successful implementation of the campaign,” said a statement issued by the EOC.

 

The statement said that in Punjab, more than 22.9m children were vaccinated. In Sindh, over 10.5m children, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, more than 7.13 million and in Balochistan, over 2.36m children were vaccinated.
In Islamabad, more than 455,000, in Gilgit-Baltistan, approximately 261,000, and in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, over 673,000 children were administered the drops.
The EOC further noted that the first nationwide polio campaign of 2026 was conducted simultaneously in Pakistan and Afghanistan, reflecting strengthened cross-border coordination to interrupt poliovirus transmission and protect children in both countries.
“The Government of Pakistan reaffirmed its strong commitment to achieve a polio-free Pakistan through sustained immunisation efforts, community engagement, and regional collaboration,” the statement added.
Pakistan Polio Programme Head Anwarul Haq, while speaking to Dawn, said the positive development was that Pakistan reported fewer cases — 31 in 2025 compared with 74 in 2024.
“Moreover, in terms of poliovirus, Punjab is negative, Peshawar is negative, and Balochistan is also negative. We just need to focus more on some critical areas, namely Sindh and south KP,” he said.
Prime Minister’s Focal Person on Polio, Ayesha Raza Farooq, told Dawn that the post-campaign independent assessment was underway.
“It will take a week before results are compiled and the programme will share them with all the stakeholders,” she said.</p><small>2026-02-09 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0910542849c4e9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972044/sc-rejects-request-for-immediate-meeting-with-pti-founder-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>SC rejects request for ‘immediate meeting’ with PTI founder Imran Khan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the request for an “immediate” meeting with PTI founder Imran Khan, and issued a notice to the government for tomorrow.
The SC had fixed for hearing 13 petitions related to Imran and his spouse Bushra Bibi, and said PTI’s memorandum seeking jail visitation rights for the party founder has been forwarded to the relevant executive authorities for consideration under the law.
Imran has been in jail since August 2023, convicted in a string of cases he says were politically driven following his ouster in a 2022 no-confidence vote.
The request for the meeting, submitted by senior PTI leader Latif Khosa, was rejected by a two-member bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan.
The bench observed that such an order could not be passed without hearing the other side. Hence, a notice was then issued to the government for tomorrow (Tuesday).
Addressing Khosa during the hearing, CJP Afridi said that “we have to overcome the hurdle of the maintainability of the application”. “Keep in mind that you have cases pending in other courts,” he remarked.
“We believe that the case has become infructuous,” he said, recalling an Aug 24, 2023 order “against which the case was filed”.
The court “cannot issue any order regarding the meeting without issuing notice”, CJP Afridi added.
The SC also ordered the formation of a three-member bench to hear appeals against the PTI founder’s acquittal in the cipher case.
A three-member bench has also been ordered to hear appeals against the acquittal of PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the same case. The Islamabad High Court (IHC) had acquitted Imran and Qureshi in the cipher case on June 3, 2024.
Hearing Imran’s bail petition in the Al-Qadir University Trust case, in which the former premier was sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2025, the court dismissed the PTI founder’s bail plea as infructuous.
According to a supplementary cause list issued last week, the petitions fixed for hearing for Monday included the Punjab government’s appeal against the granting of bail to the PTI founder and his wife.
Further, Imran’s appeal against the case registered against him under the Official Secrets Act and the National Accountability Bureau case against the ex-premier in relation to the Al-Qadir University Trust was also fixed for hearing.
Imran’s appeal against a Rs10 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was also set to be heard.
‘Sign of political victimisation’
Later, speaking to the media, Imran’s lawyer, Salman Safdar, maintained that hearing 14 petitions at once was a “sign of political victimisation”.
“The chief justice today heard all the petitions against the PTI founder’s cases,” he said.
Safdar maintained that the government had filed appeals “against every case in which the former premier had received relief”.
Recalling the cipher case, he said that “it was the most high-stakes trial in Pakistan, and you saw how it ended”, the counsel added.
He held that the SC had “always granted us relief”, adding that he “appealed to meet the chief justice”.
“In the past five months, we have only had a five-minute meeting” with the former premier, he said.
“Our cases are not being fixed for hearing, and there is a ban on our meetings,” Safdar lamented.
The lawyer asserted that “more than 300 cases” had been filed against the incarcerated former premier. He added that multiple bail pleas were pending before Additional District and Sessions Judge Afzal Majoka.
Safdar recalled that “a letter was written to the chief justice of the IHC this month”, but said that “IHC is not ready to fix any case for hearing”.
He claimed that, as IHC “had no standing at all”, such a case should be “directed to the SC”.
The IHC has been “reduced to a palace for show”, Safdar said.
Shifting his attention to the former premier’s health, he said that the defence had “not yet even brought up medical ground in the court” for bail.
“This does not mean that we should be kept in the dark about PTI founder’s health,” he added.







The former premier has been incarcerated since Aug 5, 2023, currently imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Central Jail.
A two-page memorandum filed by the PTI on Friday alleged that Imran’s rights as a prisoner and a human being have been consistently violated during this period.
The PTI memorandum also highlighted the reports about “Imran being subjected to some secretive medical procedure at a hospital in Islamabad and keeping his relatives in the dark in violation of jail rules”.
Separately, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja, speaking to the media, said that the party had “submitted a memorandum that cases were not being fixed in the IHC”.
“The cases heard today were government cases, which were unnecessary,” Raja said, adding that the cases in which the party was seeking relief “have not yet been fixed”.
“Khan Sahib is not being allowed to meet us, and neither does he have any information regarding the facts,” he added.
“This is completely unfair.”
Addressing the matter of Imran’s health, he said, “We have been given an incomplete medical report.”
“We have no hope of getting justice at this point; however, we will keep knocking on the doors of the court,” he further said.</p><small>2026-02-09 09:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649895-govt-extends-deadline-of-hajj-visa-biometric-verification' target='_blank'><strong>Govt extends deadline of Hajj visa biometric verification</strong></a><br><p>

Since the latest conflict between Israel and Hamas broke out on Oct 7, 2023, Pakistan has sent numerous aid items intended for the Gaza Strip, which was besieged at least until a ceasefire was secured in October 2025.
According to NDMA, the consignment comprised 100 tonnes of tents and was sent with the support of Alkhidmat Foundation.
This was the 28th relief consignment sent by Pakistan, bringing the total volume of humanitarian assistance sent to 2,727 tonnes.
The relief goods were dispatched through a special flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore to Egypt’s El Arish International Airport “for onward delivery to Gaza”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Punjab housing minister Bilal Yasin was a special guest at the dispatch, which was attended by officials of the NDMA and the foreign ministry, NDMA stated.
Pakistan had first sent aid, including medicines and tents, for the people of Gaza on Oct 19, 2023 — days after the Israeli bombardment began.
The activists who were behind the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which was intercepted at sea by Israel in September 2025, said last week they will try again this year.
The organisers said they hope to bring 100 boats for their next attempt, carrying up to 1,000 medics.
Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents.

 

On Sept 27, 2025, Israeli drones hit the GSF — a collection of boats carrying humanitarian aid with rights activists, doctors, parliamentarians, journalists and others — as they entered the final stretch of their journey to Gaza.
The aid boats were carrying delegations from over 40 countries, including Pakistan, which aimed to distribute vital humanitarian aid such as baby formula, food, water and medicine to the malnourished, forcibly displaced and injured civilians suffering from almost two years of genocide, as classified by the United Nations.
Israel’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, displaced most of its population and left much of the strip in ruins.
Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.</p><small>2026-02-09 08:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6989280210c97.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971975/sanaullahs-remarks-on-balochistan-trigger-row' target='_blank'><strong>Sanaullah’s remarks on Balochistan trigger row</strong></a><br><p>• PM aide’s contention that ‘innocents may get caught up’ in the wake of action following terror attacks prompts heckling, walkout• Dr Malik, Akhtar Mengal stress need for political, not military-based solutions
LAHORE: At a charged discussion about the situation in Balochistan, PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah ignited controversy when he implied that innocent civilians were bound to get caught up in the fallout of attacks such as the ones witnessed across the province on Jan 31.
The PM’s aide was speaking during a session, titled ‘Is There a Political Will to Solve the Crisis in Balochistan’, at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday.
The minister was part of a distinguished panel, which also incl­uded BNP-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal and National Party leader Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, and was moderated by Mujahid Barelvi.


PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday.

The controversy reared its head when Mr Sanaullah was responding to points raised by the other speaker regarding the treatment meted out to the people from Balochistan.
Referring to demands such as the abolition of checkpoints from across the province, he said that this could not happen unless terrorism and violence were rooted out.
“If incidents like Jan 31 happen, then security forces will take act­ion, and there is a possibility that some of the people taken into custody could be innocent,” he said.
This prompted a reaction from the audience, and some — like rights activist Sheema Kermani — got up from her seat and began to heckle the minister. He responded by chiding the hecklers, saying that their refusal to listen to him had ‘exposed them’.
Ms Kermani then walked out of the venue, with many people following suit. Speaking to Dawn outside the hall, she said: “Asma Jahangir must be turning in her grave”.
“Asma’s name is a symbol for people’s rights, for resistance, defiance and justice. If in this conference, you give a platform to such people who justify state violence, then we will not sit and hear it… If [Asma] had been here, she herself would have walked out and wouldn’t have let such persons speak.”
‘Political people’
Earlier, in his remarks, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch termed insurgency and enforced disappearances as the two major issues facing the province, which did not seem to have a solution. “Whenever I go to my area, four or five people come [up to me] daily, complaining about a missing person.”
The state and political leadership should find a solution to these issues, he demanded.
“If you deal with Balochistan as a security issue, then conditions would get worse by the day. If you involve political people and parties, then the situation may improve,” he suggested.
“For parties which have roots among the masses, in Balochistan as well as [Khyber] Pakhtunkhwa, space is shrinking on a daily basis,” he regretted.
He also regretted how those who got the votes from the people were not allowed to enter parliament, but others were sent there ‘symbolically’.
Dr Baloch, who was also part of the Pakistan Democratic Movement alliance, recalled that they had agreed on a number of points, including an end to enforced disappearances.
He called for political reforms and the handover of resources to the province, and stressed the need to protect the 1972 Constitution, the 18th Amendment and the National Finance Commission Award.
‘Military solution to a political issue’
At the outset, BNP-M leader Akhtar Mengal posited that while the Balochistan issue was a political one, successive rulers had tried to solve it through military means, and warned that continued reliance on the coercive approach could lead to further tensions.
Going into history, he recalled the original arrangement between the Khan of Kalat and the Quaid-i-Azam, where it was agreed that most administrative powers would remain with Balochistan. However, he regretted that this and subsequent pacts were not implemented.
He also referred to past periods of conflict, including operations under different governments, the killing of Nawab Akbar Bugti and the issue of enforced disappearances, which he said had deeply affected many families, including his own.
He also criticised recent political and electoral developments, alleging that mainstream Baloch political leadership had been sidelined, while expressing concern over restrictions on political activity, media access and civil liberties.
He also referred to jailed human rights lawyers and activists, Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying that they had been jailed for 17 years over a mere tweet, while those who had harmed the country and looted had not spent a single day behind bars, or were accorded A or B class prison facilities.
Sanaullah’s response
Responding to these grievances, Mr Sanaullah said nothing could be done about the past, as it could not be changed.
“Right now Balochistan had two crises, one is being represented by Akhtar Mengal and Dr Malik, and the other side being Bashir Zaib and his accomplices,” he said, referring to one of the leaders of the banned BLA.
“In my view, both these crises have different solutions and different demands. We are making a mistake by taking them as one.” He also maintained that enforced disappearances and violence in Balochistan started simultaneously, calling it a ‘chicken and egg story’, adding that they would also end together, just as they had started.

Cummins pulled out with a back injury and Hazlewood lost a race to be fit after sustaining Achilles and hamstring injuries.
With Mitchell Starc having quit the format, Australia will be without all three of their top quicks for the first World Cup in over a decade.
Ellis, the default leader of a pace attack featuring Xavier Bartlett and Ben Dwarshuis, said the new trio would be able to cover for the loss of their more experienced teammates.
“We’ve had 18-24 months of cricket together where the big three haven’t been playing and have had big workloads in the test arena,” he told reporters on Monday.
“I actually think we work together really, really well.
“We’ve all got different skill-sets and can gel together on the night in different phases of the game.
“A squad without ‘Hoff’ (Hazlewood) and Cummo (Cummins) is a strong squad obviously, but without them I feel like we’re just as well placed to go deep.”
Ellis will go into Australia’s opener against Ireland in Colombo on Wednesday without any recent match practice, having suffered a hamstring strain bowling for the Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League.
In his absence, Australia were whitewashed 3-0 in a warm-up series against Pakistan.
Ellis has been used more as a specialist death bowler than a powerplay enforcer, but conceded his role might need to change in the absence of Hazlewood.
“Obviously, you have to take each game, conditions as they come. But losing one of the better white ball bowlers in the world in Hoff, things are always going to have to change,” he said.
“My role will try to be adaptable as much as I can.”</p><small>2026-02-09 08:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09123015e03587c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972051/fm-dar-underscores-importance-of-expanding-trade-economic-ties-with-the-eu' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar underscores importance of expanding trade, economic ties with the EU</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar on Monday chaired a high-level inter-ministerial meeting to review measures aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s economic and trade cooperation with the European Union (EU).
According to a post shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on X, the deputy prime minister underscored the importance of expanding trade and economic ties with the EU, noting that the bloc remains a key economic partner for Pakistan, particularly under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP-Plus) framework.







Dar highlighted that Pakistan has completed four biennial GSP-Plus reviews and reaffirmed the country’s commitment to fully meeting its obligations under the scheme in order to expand mutually beneficial trade opportunities with the EU.
GSP-Plus is a trade initiative by the EU that allows developing countries to export goods to the region with reduced or zero tariffs, making their products more competitive in European markets.
Under the enhanced GSP-Plus scheme, countries that implement international conventions on human rights, labour rights, environmental protection, and good governance receive additional benefits, including duty-free access for most exports.
The GSP-Plus status has especially benefited Pakistan’s key export sectors in textiles, leather goods, and surgical instruments, which contribute significantly to the country’s foreign exchange earnings.
The meeting was attended by federal minister for law and justice, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa, Secretary Foreign Affairs Ambassador Amna Baloch, and the secretaries of commerce, interior, overseas Pakistanis and human rights.
Pakistan’s ambassador to the EU and senior officials from relevant federal and provincial departments were also present.
At the meeting with the EU’s Ambassador to Pakistan, Raimundas Karoblis, in Jan, 2026, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working closely with the EU on initiatives to enhance trade, particularly under the GSP-Plus framework.
The country was granted the GSP-Plus status by the EU in 2014, resulting in a 108 per cent increase in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs.
In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP-Plus status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan.</p><small>2026-02-09 08:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649878-pakistan-seeks-stronger-ties-with-japan-after-takaichi-re-elected-as-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks stronger ties with Japan after Takaichi re-elected as PM</strong></a><br><p>

The 78-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper was found guilty in December on two counts of foreign collusion under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing, as well as one count of seditious publication.
His sentence is by far the harshest handed out under the national security law, surpassing the previous record of 10 years given to legal scholar Benny Tai in 2024.
A summary document from the judges said they had settled on 20 years’ imprisonment “after considering the serious and grave criminal conduct of Lai”.
Two of those years will overlap with Lai’s existing prison term, meaning that he will serve an additional 18 years, the judges wrote.
Lai, who has been behind bars since 2020, sat impassively in the dock as his sentence was read out, an AFP journalist in the court saw.
As he was led away, he waved solemnly to people in the public gallery, including his wife Teresa, former Hong Kong bishop Cardinal Joseph Zen, and former Apple Daily reporters.
His defence lawyer Robert Pang, declined to comment on whether Lai would lodge an appeal, which can be done in the next 28 days.
Asked if the sentence was in line with expectations, Pang told AFP: “In these times I don’t know what to expect.”
Teresa Lai was grim-faced during the hearing and made no comment as she left the court, but the family condemned the sentence in a statement.
“Sentencing my father to this draconian prison sentence is devastating for our family and life-threatening for my father,” Lai’s son Sebastien said.
His daughter Claire called it “a heartbreakingly cruel sentence” given his declining health in prison, and if carried out, “he will die a martyr behind bars”.
‘Effectively a death sentence’
Rights groups also said Lai’s punishment amounted to a grave injustice.
“The harsh 20-year sentence against 78-year-old Jimmy Lai is effectively a death sentence. A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust,” Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.
Amnesty International called the case “another grim milestone in Hong Kong’s transformation from a city governed by the rule of law to one ruled by fear”.
Jodie Ginsberg, the CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said “today’s egregious decision is the final nail in the coffin for freedom of the press in Hong Kong”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer previously said he had raised the issue of Lai, a British citizen, during his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing last month, while US President Donald Trump has also called for his release.
Beijing has dismissed critics as smearing Hong Kong’s judicial system, while Hong Kong authorities say Lai’s case “has nothing to do with freedom of speech and of the press”.
Staunch supporters
Dozens of former Apple Daily employees and others braved the cold to queue overnight outside the West Kowloon court for a spot in court, while journalists gathered outside the building’s entrance.
The mood was tense as police deployed dozens of officers, an armoured car and a bomb disposal van to the area.
“I think this is equivalent to sentencing Lai to life imprisonment,” Lam Ying-kit, a former history teacher in his 50s, told AFP.
Lai’s supporters, children, lawyers and rights groups have all raised concerns about his deteriorating health in prison.
Lai was kept in solitary confinement at his own request to avoid harassment, according to prosecutors, while authorities maintain he receives “adequate” care.
Long a thorn in Beijing’s side, Lai was prosecuted under the national security law imposed by China on Hong Kong in 2020, following huge pro-democracy protests in the finance hub.
Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021 following police raids.
Eight other defendants, including six Apple Daily executives, are due to be sentenced alongside Lai on Monday, all of whom pleaded guilty.
As of the start of the month, Hong Kong had arrested a total of 386 people for various national security crimes, with 176 of them being convicted.</p><small>2026-02-09 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09114255891eac7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972047/youtuber-ducky-bhai-indicted-in-gambling-app-promotion-case' target='_blank'><strong>YouTuber Ducky Bhai indicted in gambling app promotion case</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A judicial magistrate on Monday indicted YouTuber Saadur Rehman, alias Ducky Bhai, his wife Aroob Jatoi, and others over the alleged promotion of gambling apps on social media.
All the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges and decided to contest the trial. Magistrate Naeem Wattoo ordered the prosecution to present its witnesses at the next hearing.
Further proceedings will be held on Feb 23.
The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had registered the cases of several YouTubers and Tiktokers on charges of promoting gambling apps on their social media accounts.
The agency had arrested Rehman in August of last year. The Lahore High Court (LHC) had released him on bail on Nov 24.
The case is related to an inquiry dated June 13, 2025, and registered on the “receipt of information from reliable source(s)” that some YouTubers and social media influencers were promoting gambling and betting applications to the general public via their social media accounts for their own monetary benefits.
It was registered under sections 13 (Electronic forgery), 14 (Electronic fraud), 25 (Spamming) and 26 (Spoofing) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 read with sections 294 B (Offering prize in connection with trade) and 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducting delivery of property) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
In December, Rehman had uploaded a nearly hour-long video to his YouTube channel in which he made allegations of physical and verbal abuse while in NCCIA custody.
In October, six NCCIA officials were given a three-day physical remand for allegedly misusing their authority, extorting money and taking bribes, after a case was registered against them on the complaint of Aroob Jatoi.

Brenton Tarrant, an Australian former gym instructor, admitted carrying out New Zealand’s deadliest modern-day mass shooting before being sentenced to life in jail in August 2020.
Now, the convicted killer argues that his “torturous and inhumane” detention conditions during his trial made him incapable of making rational decisions when he pleaded guilty, according to a court synopsis of the case.
Tarrant is being held in a specialist unit for prisoners of extreme risk at Auckland Prison, seldom interacting with inmates or other people.
“I did not have the mind frame or mental health required to be making informed decisions at that time,” Tarrant told the court, according to the New Zealand Herald.
Tarrant said his state of mind was such that he had considered trying to implicate President Donald Trump in the crime.
Life without parole
“What I said at the time is ‘perhaps I could go out and say there was a second shooter on the roof, perhaps I could say it was Donald J Trump’,” he said, according to national broadcaster RNZ.
If the Court of Appeal in Wellington upholds Tarrant’s conviction, it would hold a separate hearing later in the year to consider an appeal against his sentence.
His penalty of life imprisonment without parole was the stiffest in New Zealand history.
Armed with an arsenal of semi-automatic weapons, Tarrant attacked worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, 2019.
He published an online manifesto before the attacks and then livestreamed the killings for 17 minutes.
His victims were all Muslim and included children, women and the elderly.
‘Not prepared’
There are heavy restrictions on who can be in court during Monday’s appeal hearing, with only counsel, media and court officials allowed.
Families and friends of those killed or wounded in the attacks have been invited to watch proceedings in Christchurch remotely by video with a one-hour delay.
Members of the public are also able to watch the hearing by video link with a one-hour delay at a separate courtroom in Wellington.
Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein was killed by Tarrant inside the Linwood mosque, told Christchurch’s The Press newspaper she had thought “this is the end of it” when Tarrant was sentenced.
“Little did you know that you are allowed to do this six years later. I was not prepared to do this,” she said.
The hearing is being held before three Court of Appeal judges.
In most Court of Appeal hearings the judges reserve their decision to be published at a later date, meaning a verdict is unlikely this week.
After Tarrant’s livestream, Facebook said it removed 1.5 million videos that proliferated within the first 24 hours showing the harrowing viral footage.
Then-prime minister Jacinda Ardern quickly moved to tighten gun laws in the aftermath and put pressure on social media giants to curb online extremism.
In 2021, Tarrant’s former lawyer, Tony Ellis, said his client had believed “the simplest way out was to plead guilty”, arguing the plea was made under duress.
The names of Tarrant’s current lawyers have been suppressed by the court.</p><small>2026-02-09 04:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649809-oppositions-feb-8-strike-call-largely-fizzles-as-normal-life-continues-nationwide' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP's Feb 8 strike call draws largely 'muted response'</strong></a><br><p>

ISLAMABAD: Amid a decline in the revenue-to-GDP ratio despite purported reforms, the four provinces reached close to meeting their IMF-dictated annual target of delivering a cash surplus to the Centre within the first half of the current fiscal year.
The official fiscal operations data released by the Ministry of Finance for July-December 2025 suggest the four provinces returned Rs1.18 trillion in cash to the Centre, just Rs285 billion short of the Rs1.464tr target set for the whole under the IMF’s $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
During the same period last year, the provinces had jointly produced over 50 lower surpluses worth Rs775bn against the budgeted target of Rs1.2tr.
With its larger fiscal muscle, Punjab led the provinces by providing Rs609bn budget surplus in six months, followed by Sindh’s Rs354bn. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s PTI government was not to be left behind as it extended Rs175bn surplus, while Balochistan also came up with Rs41bn bounty to the Centre.
This helped the federal government in containing fiscal balance in Rs542bn surplus when compared to Rs1.5tr deficit of last year — a turnaround of almost four times.
The six-monthly fiscal surplus came in at 0.4pc of GDP in the current year when compared to a deficit of 1.3pc of GDP last year. Despite this improvement, primary balance — the gap between total revenues and expenditures excluding interest payments — stood at 3.2pc of GDP when compared to 3.1pc of GDP last year, showing little improvement in government expenses despite the so-called rightsizing and administrative reforms.
Except for Balochistan, all three provinces appeared to be in competition and put in extra effort to create fiscal surpluses, given their healthy shares or were hampered by their institutional capacity to spend on their people. The Punjab government spared Rs610bn for the Centre this year, almost 83pc greater than Rs333bn of last year. Sindh provided Rs354bn this year against Rs264bn of last year, up 34pc.
Despite being an opposition administration, KP more than doubled (up 103pc) its budget surplus to Rs175bn this year when compared to its Rs86bn of the first half of last year. Balochistan had extended a surplus of Rs92bn to the Centre in the first six months of the fiscal year last year, but more than halved to Rs41bn in the current year.
On the other hand, the country’s revenue-to-GDP ratio dropped to 8.2pc in the first six months this year when compared to 8.5pc of the same period last year despite additional measures and so-called reforms.
The decline here was on both fronts, ie tax and non-tax. The data showed the tax-to-GDP ratio falling from 5.3pc in July-December of last year to 5.2pc this year. Non-tax revenue to GDP ratio also dropped from 3.2pc last year to 3.1pc this year, despite a 50pc increase in petroleum development alone to Rs823bn.
The Ministry of Finance data suggested the Centre’s own total revenue collection also dropped to 4.8pc of GDP from 4.9pc last year. This was mainly because of a decline in direct taxes to 2.3pc of GDP in the current fiscal, down from 2.4pc last year.
While the share of customs and excise duties remained unchanged at 0.5pc and 0.3pc of GDP, the general sales tax collection also fell to 1.6pc of GDP from 1.7pc last year. Provincial collection also remained static at 0.4pc of GDP.
On the expenditure front, total expenditure dropped to 7.8pc of GDP in the first half of the current year from 9.9pc of GDP last year, chiefly because of lower interest costs following the State Bank’s policy rate cut by half to 11pc from a historic 22pc a year earlier. Of this, current expenditure was down to 7.4pc of GDP as of Dec 31 this year when compared to 8.8pc last year.
The Ministry of Finance reported that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected Rs6.161tr during the first half of the current fiscal year, an increase of Rs536bn compared to the amount collected in the corresponding period of last year, a growth of 10pc.
Non-tax revenue was reported at Rs3.799tr, which included Rs2.428tr profit received from the State Bank of Pakistan. Petroleum development levy collection stood at Rs823bn, an increase of 50pc compared to the corresponding period of last year.
Provincial tax collection showed a robust 28pc growth to Rs569bn, an increase of Rs126bn compared to the corresponding period of the last fiscal. Provincial non-tax revenue was Rs155bn, showing an increase of Rs12bn compared to the corresponding period of the previous year, a growth of 8pc.

NEW DELHI: Indian farmers on Monday slammed a new US trade deal as “a surrender to multinational agricultural giants”, calling for the commerce minister’s resignation as Congress accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of capitulating to US President Donald Trump over the “Epstein files” release.
Congress leaders claimed an Indian minister, a businessman and individuals close to the prime minister were mentioned in the files, along with Modi.

 

According to a report in The Hindu, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) demanded Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s immediate resignation as soon as he explained the details of the bilateral pact.
Leaders of the union representing apple and cotton growers said any relaxation on the import of cotton would be disastrous for the economies of Jammu and Kashmir, Him­­­­achal Pradesh, Mah­ar­ashtra and Gujarat.
Talking to reporters at a press conference on Saturday, SKM leaders called the framework for the interim agreement on bilateral trade a “total surrender” to America’s agriculture sector.
They cited the inclusion of dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits in the joint statement.
The leaders warned that the animal feed market would be completely monopolised by US companies.
SKM leaders urged farmers across the country to join protest demonstrations on Feb 12 and to support a general strike of workers as a “befitting reply to the anti-people Modi government”.
The leaders said Goyal’s claim that the agriculture and dairy sectors were excluded from the agreement was incorrect.
“Dairy products are part of the FTAs signed with the UK, New Zealand and European Union and the fresh revelations have undoubtedly proved the Commerce Minister is consciously propagating falsehood and betraying the farmers and the entire people,” the SKM statement said.
“SKM considers the role of Commerce Minister as a traitor and demands his immediate resignation.”
The organisation demanded that Prime Minister Modi desist from signing the India-US Free Trade Agreement or face “massive pan-India united mass struggles”.
Farmers’ leaders highlighted tariff disparities, noting that US tariffs on Indian goods rose from zero in 2023-24 to 18pc, while Indian tariff rates on US agriculture products dropped from between 30pc and 150pc to zero. They said this would make Indian agriculture hang by the noose of US MNCs.
The SKM also questioned Goyal’s position that the animal husbandry sector had requested imported feed. The group said poultry groups were the ones demanding feed based on maize and soybean to reduce minimum support prices for domestic crops.
“We have heard that the animal feed in US may contain non-vegetarian items too. Why does the government want our cows to eat non-vegetarian food?” asked Rakesh Tikait, a prominent SKM leader.
The statement also targeted the ruling party’s ideological parent organisation.
“The RSS had been claiming no import of milk of animals fed with meat. That was a non-tariff barrier,” the statement said. “Now, the RSS has been made to eat its own claim by ‘Master’ Donald Trump and they have cowed down completely.”
M.Y. Tarigami, leader of the Apple Farmers Federation of India and a Jammu and Kashmir lawmaker, said the trade deal would devastate regional economies.
“We have been facing problems in apple cultivation due to lack of marketing facilities and climatic challenges,” Tarigami said. “Farmers in both the states are already in distress. This announcement will be a huge setback for apple and tree nut growers.”
“In a state like Jammu and Kashmir, where there are no other economic avenues such as industry, the only source of income was cultivation of apples and dry fruits,” Tarigami added. “The Union government does not care about farmers here and is working for their masters in the United States.”
Protesting against the government’s lack of transparency regarding the deal, the Congress party on Friday displayed a poster reading “Trap Deal” at the main entrance of the Parliament complex.
Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters that President Trump pressured Modi into signing the deal because of the Epstein files.
“The truth is that over the past few days, Narendra Modi has been troubled because matters related to him have come up in the Epstein files. After that, Narendra Modi surrendered before Trump and struck a trade deal,” Kharge said.
“He sacrificed the country’s farmers. Modi is making our people poor and making America’s farmers rich.”
