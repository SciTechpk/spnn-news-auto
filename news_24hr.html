Saqib’s video statement, televised on Sunday, comes after Pakistan gave initial clearance for Binance and HTX on Friday to register with regulators to set up local subsidiaries and begin preparations for full exchange licence applications.
The clearances allow the exchanges to register on the Anti-Money Laundering system, set up local units and prepare full applications.
Speaking about the development, Saqib said the issuance of the NOCs to Binance and HTX was the “first practical step” that reflected a “new mindset”.
He further said that the step was based on the “Pakistan-first” approach.
Saqib detailed that by working under a supervised entry framework, authorities had been able to establish “control” in three areas, namely money laundering and terrorism financing; transparency of ownership and fitness and propreitary checks; and paving the way for licensing through the enforcement of timelines.
“It is mandatory for every platform to register on the AML [system] and have direct linkages with the financial monitoring unit,” he said, further asserting that no platform would be allowed entry in the country without “disclosures and verification”.
Moreover, he said, the process of licensing would be initiated for entities after they would “move forward in line with Pakistan’s law and with its oversight”.

The enduring idea is best encapsulated by former British prime minister Winston Churchill’s 1944 observation: “The longer you can look back, the farther you can look forward.”
The Renaissance period thinker Niccolò Machiavelli argued that the people’s fundamental desires and behaviours remain unchanged across epochs, which is why a close study of past events can aid one to predict future political and social dynamics. The 19th century German ideologist Karl Marx famously noted that history repeats itself, “first as tragedy, then as farce.” The 20th century Spanish philosopher George Santayana warned that those who cannot remember mistakes of the past are condemned to repeat them.
While this concept remains a popular belief, its relevance as a reliable predictive tool has begun to struggle. This is driven by unprecedented shifts in geopolitics, technology and ecology, which are introducing challenges without direct historical parallels. For over a decade, many experts and political commentators have found their predictions consistently wrong. A major contributing factor is their heavy reliance on historical parallels to understand current events — a methodology that is proving insufficient for the new realities of the 21st century.
A powerful early example of this failure actually stretches back to the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The US failed to predict the revolution because CIA analysts could not accurately gauge the political traction of the religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini. The CIA’s analytical framework was largely based on studies of left wing revolutions, and those rooted in secular and nationalist movements since the French Revolution. The CIA lacked experts on the then-unique power of a new kind of radical religious movement that was emerging in Iran.

From Iran in 1979 to America in 2016 and Pakistan today, analysts continue reaching for historical parallels to predict the future. But these parallels no longer apply in a world being reshaped by new social, technological and geopolitical forces

The French philosopher Michel Foucault, however, observing the climate in Iran a year before the revolution, wrote extensively on an event that was challenging the Western understanding of revolutionary upheavals. It was a mass movement taking shape on the basis of religion; a phenomenon for which American analysts and the CIA could not find any suitable historical precedence. This led to flawed conclusions.
The failure to predict the game-changing 2016 US presidential election provides a powerful example of the limitations of relying on historical parallels in the 21st century. Before the election, most major political commentators ridiculed the idea of Donald Trump ever entering the White House. Their assessment was driven by historical precedents involving past charismatic American populists who ultimately failed to capture the presidency.

 

They compared Trump to figures whose popularity ultimately collapsed. These included the fiery governor of Louisiana Huey Long, who was a serious presidential contender but who became embroiled in political and financial scandals, before being assassinated in 1935.
Then there was the right-wing figure Barry Goldwater, who won the Republican nomination in 1964 but suffered a massive electoral defeat to Lyndon B. Johnson. Goldwater’s supporters mistook his regional popularity for national viability. There was also Ross Perot, dubbed “the billionaire populist”, who managed to secure nearly 19 million votes in the 1992 election but saw his support fade significantly in 1996, before his influence declined.
These were valid historical precedents of non-mainstream figures who failed to reach the White House. However, in 2016, these precedents did not account for the rapid, profound changes reshaping the American political landscape after the 2008 stock market crash.
The unique confluence of factors in the 2010s rendered old comparisons obsolete, marking the beginning of a new history that analysts failed to grasp. Intense distrust in mainstream politics following the 2008 economic crisis created fertile ground for an ‘anti-system’ candidate. ‘Cultural wars’ intensified and a more radical arm of the ‘new right’ began to gain significant traction among large sections of the American electorate.
Rapidly evolving digital technology was cleverly and effectively used, particularly by the radical right, to formulate new ways to construct perceptions of popularity and demonise opponents, bypassing traditional media gatekeepers. Analysts looked back, but the ground beneath them had moved, leading to flawed assessments and conclusions.



The tendency to rely on historical precedents remains particularly entrenched in Pakistani political analysis. This methodology has strongly influenced the discourse surrounding the political survival of former prime minister Imran Khan. Until the recent press conference by the DG ISPR, in which Khan was branded as “mentally unstable” and a “security threat”, only a few analysts or journalists were willing to predict Khan’s complete ouster from the country’s political scene.
The ‘predictions’ of Khan’s return were rooted in several historical assumptions about the power structure in Pakistan. These included the fact that the establishment has historically demonstrated a willingness to change its mind about opposed politicians, often ‘allowing’ them to return to power; and the perception that the establishment has never been as aggressively opposed to a leading politician hailing from Punjab than it has to non-Punjab politicians.
Conversely, Khan himself has consistently drawn upon the historical tragedy of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the former East Pakistani politician. Khan’s narrative suggests that the establishment’s refusal to allow Mujibur Rahman to assume power after his 1970 victory ultimately led to the breaking away of East Pakistan, implying similar dire consequences if his (Khan’s) ‘mandate’ is denied.
Despite the strong hold of these historical analogies on public discourse, current facts suggest that most of these precedents are struggling to remain relevant in the face of various new political realities. It is these realities that have fundamentally driven the creation of the current government in Pakistan and dictated the establishment’s current state of mind, making past dynamics a less reliable guide for the future.
The world is rapidly moving into unprecedented territory, necessitating political and state structures purpose-built to effectively address novel local and international challenges. The introduction of new technologies has compounded these challenges. Many of the new realities lack clear historical precedents. They are demanding innovative and unprecedented solutions rather than relying on past playbooks.
This line of thinking is being used to justify measures such as the controversial 27th Amendment to the Pakistani Constitution. The proponents of the amendment argue that it is a way to adapt to new internal and external realities. Critics of the amendment will continue to misfire, though, because their critiques are largely rooted in an understanding of politics that remains tied to historical precedents and traditional political norms that do not account for the unprecedented nature of contemporary challenges the state is facing.
The past remains essential for context but, in the 21st century, it has ceased to be the definitive teacher.

The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had in 2016 filed a reference against the former petroleum minister and others for their alleged involvement in depriving the state of Rs462.5 billion from 2010 to 2013.
The accused were charged with causing financial losses of Rs450bn through a fertiliser scam, Rs9.5bn through land encroachment / fraud and Rs3bn through money laundering. However, the reference was transferred to the anti-corruption court after tweaks in the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO).
The ACE filed an investigation report before Judge Muhammad Aminullah Siddiqui of the special provincial anti-corruption court seeking cancellation of graft charges against Dr Asim and others.

Judge asks ACE Sindh to file report on Rs3bn money laundering allegations in relevant court; NAB transferred graft case to provincial anti-corruption court after accountability law tweaks

The IO filed the report under Section 173 of the criminal procedure code (CrPC) seeking disposal of the case in class C (cancelation).
In the report, the IO submitted that after holding a fresh investigation, the allegations were found within the domain of the provincial anti-graft body and being recommended for cancelation.
The judge in his order said, “Upon appraisal of the material so placed, it prima facie appears that the investigating officer has justifiable concluded that the ingredient of the offences related to corruption, misconduct, or abuse of authority, [which] offences triable exclusively by this court, have not been substantiated during investigation. Consequently, the classification of such allegations as C-class appears to be in consonance with the settled principles governing disposal of the cases where the foundational facts do not support prosecution.”
However, the court accepted the report to the limited extent of those allegations falling within the statutory jurisdiction of the court under the anti-corruption laws.
About allegations of money laundering, the judge noted that this court “has lacked jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same” while the “AML Act was a special law providing for a distinct mechanism, designated forums and exclusive jurisdiction”.
Therefore, the court directed the IO to prepare and submit a separate and independent report under Section 173 of the CrPC before the competent court under the relevant law without any undue delay.
NAB accused Dr Asim and others of getting plots allotted fraudulently and encroaching upon state land for expansion of his hospital, money laundering and commission through fertiliser cartel for illegal curtailment of gas for exploitative price hike.
After amendments to the NAB law, Dr Asim had approached the Sindh High Court seeking transfer of the reference from an accountability court to a court having jurisdiction.
In September 2023, the SHC had ordered an accountability court to return the corruption reference to the NAB chairman so that he could refer the matter to a relevant forum as per law. Thereafter, NAB had transferred the matter to the ACE.

Sources in the valley told Dawn that hectic deliberations had been taking place between the Tirah Bagh Brigade Headquarters and local elders since Wednesday (Dec 10) to develop a mechanism for the ‘willful’ relocation of families from the valley and an acceptable package for the new internally displaced persons (IDPs).
They said that while expressing satisfaction with the voluntary repatriation of families from different areas of Tirah in the last few weeks, officials posted to the Bagh Brigade Headquarters made it clear to local elders that those unwilling to vacate their houses would face “utter difficulties” after the launch of the operation.
A Malakdinkhel elder, who was part of the negotiating team, told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the launch of the military operation was a matter of time now while the security officials were now insisting on devising modalities which could minimise chances of collateral damage to residents and reduce their misery.

Security officials, elders discussing mechanism for families’ relocation

He said that security officials in Peshawar and Rawalpindi were pondering over the timeframe of the Tirah military operation as the General Headquarters and 11 Corps were insisting on the shortest possible duration in order to minimise the sufferings of local families.
The elder said that security officials agreed to give residents time for voluntary displacement and offered transport and other facilities to them.
“The security forces are showing the maximum restraint by not imposing curfews in different parts despite clear-cut instructions from high-ups, while avoiding indiscriminate shelling on troubled areas,” he said.
The Malakdinkhel elder further said that a warning was issued about the closure of most exit routes, including Dwa Theoye, Arhanga and Haider Kandaw, if the residents failed to avail the deadline for willful repatriation.
Security officials also told Tirah elders that the new IDPs would be allowed to return in the two months’ time at maximum on the successful completion of military operation, while a verbal assurance was given about the meeting of the “legitimate” demands of Tirah residents through the execution of development schemes.
The security officials also urged elders to form local peace committees on return following the military operation. However, as there was no mention of the committees’ responsibilities, the elders didn’t disapprove of the idea.
On Wednesday, the Tirah elders submitted a long list of demands to the officials of Brigade Headquarters, including advance payment of Rs500,000, provision of free transport, formal IDP status for the newly-displaced families and a firm assurance that no military operations and forced displacement will take place after the completion of operations and return of IDPs.
The elders also called for a written agreement about all decisions made during their meetings with security officials, with the Supreme Court chief justice, interior minister, Peshawar’s corps commander, the provincial chief minister and the 27 Brigade acting as guarantors.
Sources said that while agreeing to continue parlays, both sides failed to make a deal.
Both MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani from Bara along with representatives of Bara Siyasi Ittehad and elders from Bara were kept out of Tirah deliberations. They have vehemently opposed any fresh military operation in Tirah and forced displacement of residents.
While Tirah elders and security forces were busy sorting out modalities for the operation and evacuation, the families in different parts of the valley continued to vacate their homes and departed for Bara and Peshawar.

The situation looks bad even in the coming days with no rain prediction that may bring some respite.
On Saturday, the city recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 527 at 8pm, classified as hazardous, following Delhi (710).
Lahore’s three-day average AQI hovered above 300. Some hotspots in the city such as Allama Iqbal Town (802), Bedian Road (674) and CERP Office (672) performed worst.
The air pollution crisis in the country extends beyond Lahore. Cities across Punjab reported AQI readings well above safe thresholds between December 11 and 13, prompting widespread health warnings.
Khurrianwala registered an AQI of 558, Faisalabad 547, Kahna Nau 350, Gujranwala 284, Gujrat 254, Islamabad 246, and both Bahawalpur and Sialkot at 244.
Health experts warned that such high concentrations of PM2.5 particulate matter that penetrates deep into the lungs and pose serious risks to public health, especially for children, the elderly and those with respiratory conditions.
Residents have been advised to avoid outdoor activities, keep windows closed, wear protective masks and use air purifiers indoors.
Pakistan’s average PM2.5 concentration in 2024 stood at 73.7 µg/m³, nearly 15 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s annual guideline of 5µg/m³. This places Pakistan as the third most polluted country globally, underscoring the scale of the environmental challenge.
Experts say the pollution is due to a combination of industrial emissions, vehicular exhaust, crop residue burning, biomass and waste incineration and domestic fires.
Winter conditions exacerbate the crisis with temperature inversions, low wind speed and reduced rainfall trapping pollutants close to the ground.
Trans-boundary pollution from India further compounds the issue, especially during the post-harvest stubble burning season.

BANGKOK: Cambodia shut its border crossings with Thailand on Saturday, after Bangkok denied US President Donald Trump’s claim that a truce had been agreed to end days of deadly fighting.
Violence between the Southeast Asian neighbours, which stems from a long-running dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, has displaced around half a million people on both sides.
At least 25 people have died this week, including four Thai soldiers, the defence ministry said were killed in the border area on Saturday.
The latest fatalities were followed by Phnom Penh announcing it would immediately “suspend all entry and exit movements at all Cambodia-Thailand border crossings”, the interior ministry said.
Each side blamed the other for reigniting the conflict, before Trump said a truce had been agreed.
Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said Trump “didn’t mention whether we should make a ceasefire” during their Friday phone call.
The two leaders “didn’t discuss” the issue, Anutin told journalists on Saturday.
Trump had hailed his “very good conversation” with Anutin and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet on Friday.
“They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord” agreed in July, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.







The United States, China, and Malaysia, as chair of the regional bloc Asean, brokered a ceasefire in July after an initial five-day spate of violence.
In October, Trump backed a follow-on joint declaration between Thailand and Cambodia, touting new trade deals after they agreed to prolong their truce.
But Thailand suspended the agreement the following month after Thai soldiers were wounded by landmines at the border.
In Thailand, evacuee Kanyapat Saopria said she doesn’t “trust Cambodia anymore”.
“The last round of peace efforts didn’t work out… I don’t know if this one will either,” the 39-year-old said.
Across the border, a Cambodian evacuee said she was “sad” the fighting hadn’t stopped despite Trump’s intervention.
“I am not happy with brutal acts,” said Vy Rina, 43.
Trading blame over civilians
Bangkok and Phnom Penh have traded accusations of attacks against civilians, with the Thai army reporting six wounded on Saturday by Cambodian rockets.
Cambodia’s information minister, Neth Pheaktra, meanwhile, said Thai forces had “expanded their attacks to include civilian infrastructure and Cambodian civilians”.
A Thai navy spokesman said the air force “successfully destroyed” two Cambodian bridges used to transport weapons to the conflict zone.
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Saturday urged both sides to “cease all forms of hostilities and refrain from any further military actions”.
Thailand has reported 14 soldiers killed and seven civilian deaths, while Cambodia said four civilians were killed earlier this week.
At a camp in Thailand’s Buriram, journalists saw displaced residents calling relatives near the border who reported that fighting was ongoing.
Thailand’s prime minister has vowed to “continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people”.
After the call with Trump, Anutin said, “the one who violated the agreement needs to fix (the situation)”.
Cambodia’s Hun Manet, meanwhile, said his country “has always been adhering to peaceful means for dispute resolutions”.

A second term for Bajwa fitted in with Faiz Hameed’s plans too.
The newly appointed DGC, Maj-Gen Faiz Hameed, hit the ground running and within no time established his stranglehold over the media, cajoling and threatening everyone from YouTubers to senior editors, empowered street agitators such as the TLP, and spread his tentacles to grip key members of the country’s superior judiciary. He seemed to have mesmerised even hitherto respected judges.
With unprecedented viciousness, he quickly removed all the obstacles in the path of the brief he’d been given and anyone who knew what was happening would say Nawaz Sharif’s goose was cooked and he was not just looking at being ousted from office but was going to end up in prison. The general also worked on making sure that the alternative who’d not had much electoral success till that stage became a serious contender.

 

Perhaps, today the focus of mostly unbiased observers rightly remains on the 2024 elections but it is equally important to see how the 2018 elections were conducted. In the process, Faiz Hameed cultivated close ties with the man who was to become the prime minister or let’s say the man Faiz Hameed dragged over the finish line in the 2018 elections.
In April 2019, after the PTI-led coalition had formed the government the year before, in no small measure thanks to the efforts of the very effective and ambitious two-star, Faiz Hameed was promoted to three stars and posted as adjutant general, Pakistan Army. Normally, three-star appointments are for a four-year tenure that is split between command and staff roles half and half.

One can safely say the man who planned to be king made a hash of it by not knowing when to stop.

Within two months of this elevation, the new prime minister, Imran Khan, insisted that the man be appointed his DG ISI, the top spymaster of the country, and the two men moved ever closer. Nobody knows whether this move was the prime minister’s own decision or whether it was at the instigation of the general himself.
The same year Bajwa was granted his much-coveted extension, despite a last-ditch effort by (possibly a) guilt-ridden Supreme Court to stall it. By this time, the opposition too had been beaten into total submission and voted alongside the treasury benches for it.
This suited Faiz Hameed as well, as Bajwa’s additional three years would put him among the cohort of the senior-most lieutenant-generals in running for the next chief.

 

And with a prime minister in office close to him, he’d be the frontrunner. He seemed to have played his cards well.
It seems Gen Bajwa had other ideas. He knew that with the incumbent prime minister, he would be hard-pressed to get yet another extension because of the Faiz factor. So, after a lot of back and forth, Bajwa apparently either convinced the prime minister that without ‘command’ experience Faiz Hameed would not be in the running for chief or just forced the decision on him. In October 2021, he was posted as corps commander to Peshawar and Lt-Gen Naveed Anjum replaced him as DG ISI.
With an eye to the end of Bajwa’s second three-year tenure in November 2022, Imran Khan’s carefully constructed, contrived actually, majority was eroded till he eventually was voted out in April 2022 and a new prime minister, a man who had long sought the top office and advocated a live-and let-live policy with the military within his party, the PML-N, took office.

 

Analysts who claim to have a window to Faiz Hameed’s thinking are convinced that even his proximity to the PTI leader and apparent loyalty to the latter was devious to say the least as he aimed to use that as a stepping stone to the most powerful office in the country. Once (and if) in, he’d be king! In fact, the way he was acting was if he’d already been crowned.
But then Imran Khan, the prime minister at the time, who’d have named Faiz as the chief had reportedly rubbed another senior officer the wrong way when he insisted Bajwa remove the latter as ISI chief.
As November of 2022 approached, Bajwa reportedly started to put pressure on the current prime minister for yet another extension. There were even suggestions of drastic action. But these were never confirmed. However, the prime minister’s elder brother reportedly advised him to appoint the current chief. The rest is history.
Having lost in the race he’d arranged so diligently to be among the frontrunners, any other officer would have given up. Not Faiz Hameed. And that was his biggest mistake. The establishment may take a dim view of civilian politicians but there is nothing more intolerable than internal disloyalty.
As in militaries the world over, issues around the chief’s decisions may be debated within the appropriate internal forum by officers but no one is allowed to subvert them. One can safely say the man who planned to be king made a hash of it by not knowing when to stop. There are now reports — again unsubstantiated — of him being used as a state witness against the former prime minister.
One hopes for the country’s sake this talk is just talk and no more. Pakistan needs political stability for economic progress. The hybrid set-up should focus on that as a one-point agenda and nothing else.

At first glance, the idea feels compelling.
If machines can scrape information across multiple feeds in real time, summarise parliamentary proceedings, monitor political developments, crunch data, and respond to user queries in conversational language, why would end users still need traditional journalism outlets, or even digital platforms as intermediaries for news? The argument implies a future where individuals bypass traditional journalism outlets entirely and receive information directly from intelligent systems in a conversational, real-time format.

 

Those who make this argument often point to changing audience behaviour, especially among younger users. Consumers are steadily turning away from conventional news platforms and gravitating toward faster, more personal, and more direct sources of information.
And to be fair, the trend is clear.
The latest Reuters Institute Digital News Report shows a consistent decline in trust, viewership, and platform dependence on mainstream news outlets. Users, particularly young people, increasingly prefer to consume information from influencers, content creators, and niche commentators rather than from professional journalists. Their relationship with news is personal, interactive, emotional, and algorithmically curated.
Thus, many in the industry look at this shift and assume that AI-mediated information access will make journalism redundant faster than we imagine.
But this prediction misunderstands both journalism and technological disruption.
Journalism has never merely been about transmitting information from point A to point B. If journalism were equivalent to distribution, then journalists would already have become irrelevant when blogs, Twitter, and user-generated content exploded over a decade ago. Yet even as more voices entered the digital information space, the public’s need for verification, investigation, context, scrutiny, and accountability only grew stronger.
Every time a major national or geopolitical event unfolds, the world still turns to journalists to understand what actually happened, who benefits, who is responsible, and what it means.

How will journalism evolve to meet the challenges ushered in by AI?

AI does not eliminate the need for this work. On the contrary, AI multiplies it.
We are moving into a period where the volume of available information will exceed human comprehension by several orders of magnitude. Generative systems will not just surface facts; they will hallucinate, remix, misattribute, and infer things that never happened at all.

 

Political actors, commercial interests, and even the state authorities now possess the ability to manufacture narratives, emotional atmospheres, and public sentiments on an industrial scale, with minimal cost and high precision. The idea that ordinary users will be able to navigate that universe alone, without a professional class dedicated to verification, investigation, and ethical interpretation, is, to say the least, misplaced.
If AI is going to rewrite the information environment, then journalism is not becoming less necessary; it is becoming structurally essential. In five years, the hardest problems in public communication will not be about finding information. It will be about establishing what is real, what is synthetic, what is manipulated, and what is politically engineered for attention and outrage.
For me, the question was never whether journalists would become irrelevant. They won’t.
The real question is two-fold: how the profession will evolve to meet the challenges ushered in by AI, and whether journalists will be able to meaningfully integrate these technologies into their workflows, their verification practices, and their investigative muscle.
To begin with, journalists will need an expanded skillset that goes far beyond traditional verification or deepfake detection. As AI becomes embedded in governance, bureaucracy, law enforcement, welfare delivery, and public administration, journalistic storytelling will have to evolve as well.
In the past, governance reporting focused on the effectiveness of systems, corruption, procurement flaws, or regulatory gaps. In the future, many of those stories will be about data bias, algorithmic discrimination, opaque model assumptions, automated decision-making, and the ways poorly designed AI systems can harm citizens at scale. And journalists will only be able to report on these issues meaningfully if they understand how these systems work.
For instance, they will have to learn algorithmic auditing, network analysis, and the ability to interrogate opaque systems. Similarly, they will need to be able to trace financial and political incentives behind influence operations, scrutinise the training data that powers decision-making models, and investigate how platforms, corporations, and governments deploy automated systems to shape public sentiment, marginalise voices, or suppress inconvenient truths.
In an ‘automated’ information environment, human accountability must become more rigorous, not less. If, for example, a government uses predictive policing, automated welfare systems, or algorithmic surveillance, someone must investigate who designed the system, what assumptions it encodes, whose rights it affects, and whether its outputs reinforce bias or injustice. No machine can perform that function independently. It requires reporters with access, independence, courage, and analytical skill.
Thus, I believe one of the biggest democratic risks in the near future is not that AI will make journalists irrelevant, but that there will be too few trained journalists capable of interrogating AI-driven systems.
Which brings me to the second part of the issue: are we, the journalists, integrating AI into our workflows the right way? The answer is complicated. AI offers extraordinary efficiencies that can support research, transcription, analysis, visualisation, and verification at a scale that traditional newsrooms have never experienced. But integration without standards is risky.
If journalists outsource too much judgement to opaque systems, we risk importing algorithmic bias into editorial choices, eroding verification practices, and unintentionally weakening our core responsibility: the independent assessment of facts.
My take on the question of whether journalism as we know it will ‘survive’ the AI boom is simple: journalism will be just fine; it is the journalists who refuse to evolve who should be worried, not the craft itself.

In fact, targeting mainstream voices — for example banning advertisements to the Dawn Media Group — will only hurt credible outlets, with unverified gossip and fake news filling the void.
For the last several months, the Dawn Media Group has been subjected to an unannounced ban on government ads. While the newspaper had been enduring this for 13 months, the restrictions have now been extended to the group’s TV and radio outlets.

 

Pakistan’s leading media bodies have called out this targeting of Dawn.
On Friday, the Council of Newspaper Editors said the ad ban was akin to “financially crippling the organisation”, while the All Pakistan Newspapers Society said that the step had been taken to “force the media group to change its editorial policy”. A Joint Action Committee of media bodies, including the PFUJ, has issued a similar statement.
This is not the first time this group has been facing the state’s wrath. The so-called Dawn Leaks saga springs to mind.
It must be asked why Dawn is being singled out, and at whose behest ads have been stopped.
Government ads are a major source of revenue for Pakistani publications. Instead of giving Dawn its due share, certain dummy publications are patronised to please influential backers of the government.

 

These funds are not coming out of the coffers of any political party or institution; this is the taxpayers’ money, and the public’s right to know is being denied by throttling independent media voices. The outcome of this would be managed news, where no one dares to question the powerful.
To err is human, but this paper has always striven to uphold the highest standards of journalism, and the values its founder, the Quaid, has bequeathed it. Dawn must not be silenced.

Trade and industry have repeatedly urged the government to improve the investment climate by addressing political uncertainty and terrorism.
“How is it possible to invest in a country where uncertainty has a strong grip and is clearly reflected in declining foreign investment?” asked Aamir Aziz, a textile finishing manufacturer and exporter.
He said domestic textile groups have begun investing abroad, citing Interloop and Artistic Milliners as examples. As a result, jobs are effectively being outsourced. For the first time in the country’s recent history, domestic investors are actively securing their investments outside Pakistan.

Experts cite political uncertainty, terrorism as main barriers

A senior banker described the situation as grim for both the economy and the public, saying job creation is only possible through higher investment, both domestic and foreign.
The Investment Policy announced in 2023 set a target of raising the investment-to-GDP ratio to 20pc through local and foreign inflows. To attract foreign investment, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) was established, but so far it has failed to deliver tangible results.
“Look at the ground realities. Two provinces are facing severe terrorism, while tensions with India and Afghanistan persist along the borders. Under these circumstances, no government can convincingly attract domestic or foreign investors,” said an industrialist, explaining the low level of investment.
Pakistan’s investment-to-GDP ratio is almost half that of competing regional economies, where it ranges between 25pc and 30pc. The ratio fell to its lowest level in FY24 at 13.1pc, later revised to 13.8pc, and edged up slightly to 14.1pc in FY25. The long-term average from 1960 to 2024 stands at 15.9pc, indicating that conditions have steadily worsened.
Another major concern is the very high tax burden, with rates reaching up to 60pc, along with interest rates that remain elevated compared to regional peers. Industrialists are demanding tax reductions and a 100 basis point cut in the policy interest rate. The current policy rate stands at 11pc, while inflation was recorded at 6.1pc in November.
“We have yet to develop economic policies in line with the global economic shift. China is replacing the old model of global economic dominance.
Pakistan must read this change and revise its trade and industrial policies to remain connected to the new economic world order,” said S.S. Iqbal, an expert on the economy and money markets.
Pakistan’s trade with China has expanded significantly, making it the country’s largest trading partner. However, Pakistani exporters have struggled to gain meaningful access to Chinese markets.
Mr Iqbal said foreign investment typically follows domestic investment, adding that without local investment momentum, foreign inflows are unlikely.
An independent economist said Pakistan’s biggest economic failure is not inflation, debt, or even governance, but the lack of consensus on long-term direction, timelines, and measures of success.
This, he said, is what economist Atif Mian refers to as “Five-for-Fifty” — achieving 5pc GDP growth every year for the next 50 years. The concept was cited by Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark, who said the goal is achievable but requires a collective national decision to prioritise growth, even when it clashes with comfort, ideology, or short-term political interests.

Mr Sharif, who was speaking at a multilateral forum in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan on Friday, also observed that the international community should press the Afghan Taliban to fulfil their commitments vis-à-vis preventing terrorists from using their soil to attack others. At the same forum, Turkish President Recep Erdogan again offered his good offices to maintain an “extended ceasefire” between Islamabad and Kabul.
Meanwhile, a recent resolution adopted by around 1,000 Afghan clerics at a gathering in Kabul, calling for prohibition of cross-border movement of fighters, is a step in the right direction.
Yet the effectiveness of this decree will only be proved if there is a visible drop in the number of terrorist attacks targeting Pakistan carried out by Afghanistan-based militants.

 

According to reports, the clerics pledged that Afghan soil would not be used against other countries, while calling for “necessary measures” towards those who violate the edict. They also observed that Afghan Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada had prohibited Afghan nationals from participating in military activity abroad.
The resolution is most likely referring to Mullah Akhundzada’s 2023 decree in which the Taliban head declared cross-border attacks, including those targeting Pakistan, as “haram”. Yet the Taliban chief’s prohibition has not been heeded by terrorists, who continue their bloody campaign against Pakistan.
The resolution seems to be an attempt by the Afghan side to rebuild trust with Pakistan, and prevent bilateral ties from deteriorating further. The call was issued by independent clerics, not by the Taliban authorities, though as an Afghan participant of the Kabul conclave told this paper, Mullah Akhundzada “does not want a neighbour to have problems because of us”.

 

The number of Afghans participating in cross-border attacks has risen, so perhaps the resolution is also an attempt to quell this trend. But the question remains: what about Pakistani terrorists based in Afghanistan who are involved in cross-border attacks? Will the Taliban regime take concrete action against them?
If the realisation has dawned in Kabul and Kandahar that giving free rein to terrorist groups such as the TTP to attack Pakistan and other neighbours will further isolate Afghanistan regionally and globally, then it would be a case of ‘better late than never’.
We hope these are not mere words, and that there is a sincere will on the Afghan side to address the issue of terrorism.
The Foreign Office has cautiously welcomed the resolution.
Continued bilateral tension and conflict is in the interest of neither state. Therefore, the mediation efforts of friendly states must continue. Once the terrorism issue is resolved, both states can start work on building a fruitful relationship.

This presents a big challenge for the government in identifying individuals not paying their taxes, with 2.262 million out of 5.912 million filed up to Oct 31, potentially concealing their taxable income. This means that only 3.650m taxpayers declared incomes in their returns for tax year 2025 (TY25).
The pattern of nil-filers are across the three main categories — individuals, associations of persons (AoPs) and the corporate sector. The nil returns are submitted for one-time financial transactions or to take advantage of lower tax rates for placement on the Active Taxpayers List (ATL).
Concerns are mounting within the FBR that Pakistan’s income tax system is failing to capture the true wealth of its citizens, as approximately half of taxpayers continue to declare nil incomes far below the lavish lifestyles they maintain.

Zero income with lavish lifestyle exposes weak enforcement as millions stay on the rolls without paying a rupee

In TY25, the number of nil-filers, both salaried and non-salaried individuals, remained significantly high. Out of 5.805m total individual returns filed, 2.206m were nil-returns, declaring no taxable income.
This means 38pc of all individual filers fell into the nil-filer category, highlighting a growing trend of non-contributory filings and raising concerns about the quality of the tax base. In TY24, almost a similar trend of nil-filers was recorded, which shows consistency of the trend.
Despite being considered a highly documented segment, the corporate sector posted the highest proportion of nil-filers in TY25. Of the 17,873 corporate returns filed, 13,739 companies, accounting for 76.87pc, declared nil income.
This means only 4,134 companies reported any taxable income, raising concerns over underreporting and the effectiveness of enforcement within the formal business sector.
The second-largest category of nil-filers in TY25 was Associations of Persons (AOPs). Out of 89,510 AOP returns filed, 42,834, or 47.85pc, declared nil income. This indicates that only 46,676 AOPs reported any taxable income, highlighting significant underreporting within this segment of taxpayers.
This pattern appears to be continuing for the last few years owing to the government’s introduction of the higher rates for non-filers. It was also proposed that non-filers be prohibited from engaging in any financial or investment activities. As a result, the junk filing has become a routine practice, which gives a feel good figure of returns filing to FBR.
People are living in palatial houses, enjoying 24/7 air conditioning, riding fancy cars, wearing branded clothes, making multiple international trips, buying branded watches/jewellery and other luxuries but their income tax returns do not reflect their lifestyles. Income declared and tax paid is not reflective of their living standards, as pointed out after an internal analysis of the tax returns filed with the FBR.
A senior tax officer told Dawn that junk returns resulted from tax policy lacunas. He stated the existing policy encourages people to submit tax returns without paying taxes to benefit from reduced tax rates. He said the FBR would have to redefine the terms filer and non-filer and relate tax return filing exclusively to tax payment.
He went on to say that the present system suffers from data integration issues.
Pakistan’s cash-driven and largely undocumented economy continues to shield undeclared wealth from formal scrutiny. This undocumented economy continues to frustrate efforts to broaden the tax base.

While the Foreign Office has described the envoy’s presence as interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs and a breach of diplomatic protocol and Article 41 of the Vienna Convention, several diplomats and former envoys argue that observing open court proceedings does not, in itself, amount to meddling.
Former ambassador to India Abdul Basit, when asked whether the move could be construed as interference, said that “in the strict sense of the word”, it could not. He added that there was no provision in the Vienna Convention that bound diplomats to stay away from public court proceedings.
However, he noted that diplomatic practice “would strongly suggest that diplomats in their host countries usually keep themselves away from internal politics”. But this doesn’t mean “they cannot interact with opposition politicians, which they do all the time, including our diplomats around the world”, Mr Basit added.

The summoning of Norway’s envoy over attending a court hearing has ignited debate over how far diplomats can go in observing sensitive domestic proceedings under the Vienna Convention

A senior European diplomat also insisted that mere observation of open court proceedings could not be labelled as interference.
Citing Article 3(d) of the Vienna Convention — which outlines the functions of a diplomatic mission and includes “ascertaining by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State” — the diplomat said it was not a breach of protocol for an envoy to attend open proceedings in a host country.
Diplomatic immunity protected envoys from the jurisdiction of host-country courts but did not prevent them from observing public proceedings out of professional interest, the diplomat added.
The Vienna Convention also emphasises freedom of movement (Article 26) and does not explicitly prohibit attendance at public events, including court hearings, as long as diplomats do not interfere with proceedings or undertake actions that could be seen as official intervention in domestic affairs.
The diplomat said the Norwegian ambassador attended as a silent observer, sought no meeting with any judge and made no public comment about the case, which could not be viewed as an attempt to influence the judiciary or interfere with the judicial process.
“When foreign observers monitor elections in Pakistan, do they interfere in the electoral process?” he asked, arguing that independent observation strengthened transparency. “Observers should be welcomed if there is nothing to hide and the trials are fair,” he said.
‘Serious error of judgement’
However, former ambassador to the European Union Naghmana Hashmi took a different view, saying Article 41 was explicit in requiring diplomats not to interfere “in any way” in the internal affairs of the host country.
“If I were to analyse the actions of the Norwegian ambassador, I would say that it certainly falls under a violation of Article 41 of the Vienna Convention. He should not have gone there. I think it is a very, very serious error of judgement,” she said.
Ms Hashmi acknowledged that the envoy did not make public statements or speak to the media, but she argued that the diplomat’s presence created an impression that he had been asked to attend by individuals facing accusations in a sensitive case.
She pointed out that no other ambassador was seen attending the hearing, adding that the envoy was also seen on television shaking hands and speaking with the accused within the Supreme Court premises.
“The Norwegian government may not be expressly saying that, but the perception certainly is that Norway is supporting the accused, which in any case is totally unacceptable,” she said. Ms Hashmi maintained that amb­assadors generally do not sit in court proceedings in other countries, particularly in cases linked to internal affairs and national security. Dip­lo­matic conduct, she said, was gov­ern­­ed by international law and established norms that must be respected.
‘Fair trial is a human right’
A European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the right to a fair trial was a human right and alleged violations could not be termed an internal matter.
The diplomat cautioned against setting new precedents by summoning an ambassador for observing proceedings in open court, and questioned whether the move was intended as a signal to the rest of the diplomatic community in Pakistan.
Former ambassador Muhammad Ayaz Wazir said attending court proceedings was not interference in itself, but added that any public comment on a pending case would be inconsistent with an envoy’s role.
“He is not only an individual but a representative of a government. His words would therefore be attributed to the authority he represents,” he said, adding that much depended on how the host government viewed a particular case. “It is my personal view, as I am not privy to the government’s current policies on various issues,” he said.
Another former ambassador said there was “no issue” with a foreign diplomat at­­­tending court or parliamentary proceedings, calling it part of normal diplomatic reporting and observation. He described the summoning as “intimidatory tactics” to discourage outside interest in the human rights situation in the country.
The Vienna Convention and diplomatic conduct
The Vienna Convention on Diplo­matic Relations (1961) is a cornerstone treaty of international law go­­verning diplomatic relations bet­ween sovereign states.
It sets out the privileges, immunities and obligations of diplomatic missions, and is intended to ensure diplomats can perform their duties without intimidation or undue hindrance from the host state.
The convention was adopted on April 18, 1961, and entered into force on April 24, 1964. It has achieved near-universal acceptance, with almost 200 states party to it. By codifying long-standing customs and practices, it provides a detailed framework for diplomatic engagement and has been central to maintaining channels of communication even amid serious disagreements between states.
While the purpose of diplomacy is to preserve communication and manage differences, actions perceived as offending the host country can cause tension and lead to a formal protest, including summoning an ambassador to the foreign ministry to convey concern. In rare cases, disputes escalate to the downgrading or suspension of diplomatic representation.
Some of the key provisions of the convention include:
Article 9: The host country can declare a diplomat “persona non gr­­a­ta” and expel them, no reason ne­­ed­­ed, typically used in serious breaches.
The declaration of persona non grata is a mechanism frequently employed in diplomatic disputes. Specific instances where ambassadors or other diplomatic agents have been declared persona non grata are often the result of bilateral tensions or breaches of the conduct expected under the convention.
High-profile cases often make it to public knowledge, typically in the context of espionage, interference in domestic affairs or other diplomatic indiscretions.
Article 22: Diplomatic missions are inviolable. The host country can’t enter without permission.
Article 26: Diplomats have freedom of movement and travel in the host country, with some security exceptions.
Article 27: Diplomatic missions can communicate freely with their government, using diplomatic bags that aren’t to be opened or detained.
Article 29: Diplomats can’t be arrested or detained. Their private residences are also protected.
Article 30: Diplomatic archives and documents are inviolable, wherever they are.
Article 31: Diplomats have immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the host country. Civil immunity applies except in specific cases (e.g. private property disputes).
Article 41: Diplomats must resp­ect the laws of the host country and not interfere in its internal affairs.
These provisions aim to ensure diplomats can perform their duties without fear or hindrance, promoting smooth international relations.

NAROWAL: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday maintained that the deadly riots on May 9, 2023 was a ‘joint venture’ between ex-spymaster Faiz Ham­eed and PTI founder Imran Khan, vowing that the process of acc­o­untability for ‘enemies’ of Paki­stan, whether they were civilian or in uniform, would continue.
The minister also asserted there were still other charges against Hameed on which legal proceedings would be initiated soon.
He made these remarks after the former director general of Inter-Services Intelligence was sentenced to a 14-year jail term in a case related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and causing harm to others.
Addressing a press conference in Sialkot, Mr Asif claimed both the ex-spymaster and the ex-premier were partners in the ‘plan to destroy Pakistan and its army’. “Faiz Hameed and Imran Khan were equally involved in planning what happened in Mianwali, Lahore, Peshawar, and in front of GHQ on May 9,” he said.
“Those who have put the country’s future at stake for power cannot be considered Pakistanis whe­ther they are in uniform like Faiz or in a waistcoat and Peshawari sandals like Imran,” he added.
Calling the May 9 riots an ‘attack on the sanctity of the armed forces’, he said the same institution had restored national pride through Operation Bunyanul Marsoos against India in May, earning Pakistan international acclaim.
“God forbid, if the Faiz-Imran nexus still existed, perhaps there would not have been a need for war at all since they would have ensured the country’s destruction from the inside,” he said.
Nawaz’s ouster, parliament’s role
The minister alleged Hameed was in charge of ‘Project Imran’, blaming him for the ouster of prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017. “The removal of Nawaz Sharif, the cases lodged against him, the allegations, and Imran’s [Khan] coming into power, this whole project was enacted under the supervision of Faiz Hameed. Nawaz Sharif was kept in prison during the 2018 elections. Imran [Khan] had put Nawaz Sharif, his family members and other politicians in jail through Faiz.”
He claimed Mr Khan was made the prime minister through rigging under Hameed’s supervision and alleged that they played a ‘dangerous game’ with the country during the next four years. He said the ex-spymaster facilitated the ‘imprisonment of political opponents’.
While terming the period a ‘shameful chapter’ in country’s history, the defence minister said parliament was converted into an ISI ‘subsidiary’. “During the Faiz’s tenure [as ISI chief], the agency used to dictate legislation to parliament.”
He claimed that after Hameed’s transfer, the ‘project’ started to slowly ‘unravel’, but as a corps commander he continued to facilitate Mr Khan. “Faiz used to plan mischief in Pakistan, and the PTI provided the manpower to execute those plans.”
‘Conspirators still active’
While admitting that the current system of governance a ‘hybrid system’ involving cooperation bet­ween the government and the military, the defence minister said the stability was brought through this.
But, he added, conspirators were again attempting to prop up the PTI founder and bring him back to power, adding that ‘all these seeds were sown by Faiz’. He said 3,000 to 4,000 Afghans were brought to and settled in Pakistan to cause mischief in the country. “These Afghans were accommodated in the homes of citizens.”
He accused PTI leaders of bribing the Taliban, alleging that party wanted to hold talks with Pakistan’s ‘enemies’.
About the recent conviction of the ex-spymaster, the minister noted that Hameed still had the right to appeal at relevant forums, including the army’s court of appeals and high court.

A ninth person was hurt by bullet fragments, the mayor said.
Streets around campus remained blocked and packed with emergency vehicles hours after the shooting and law enforcement officials heightened security around the city as police continued their manhunt.
“The individual responsible is still at large,” Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters at a 9:30pm (7:30am PKT) press conference. Deputy Police Chief Timothy O’Hara said the suspect had not been identified.
Officials said they are looking for a male dressed in black and were releasing a video of the suspect, who O’Hara said may have been wearing a mask. He said officials had retrieved shell casings from the scene of the shooting, but that police were not prepared to release details.
Officials said the gunman escaped after shooting students in Brown’s Barus & Holley engineering building, where exams were taking place at the time.
“We are a week and a half away from Christmas. And two people died today and another eight are in the hospital,” Smiley said earlier in the evening. “So please pray for those families.”
Brown is on College Hill in Providence, Rhode Island’s state capital. The university has hundreds of buildings, including lecture halls, laboratories and dormitories.
“This is the day one hopes never happens, and it has,” Brown’s president Christina Paxson told reporters, confirming all or nearly all of the victims were students.
As news of the shooting spread, the school told students to shelter in place.
Brown student Chiang-Heng Chien told local TV station WJAR he was working in a lab with three other students when he saw the text about the active shooter situation a block away. They waited under desks for about two hours, he said.
Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee vowed that the shooter would be brought to justice. “We’re going to make sure that we catch the individual that brought so much suffering to so many people.”
The search for the suspect was hampered in part because downtown Providence was crowded with holiday shoppers and thousands of people attending concerts, local media said. Federal law enforcement and police from surrounding cities and towns were assisting in the search, officials said. According to local news reports, venues across the city were bringing in extra security.
President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that he had been briefed on the situation, which he called “terrible”.
“All we can do right now is pray for the victims and for those that were very badly hurt.”
Compared to many countries, mass shootings in schools, workplaces, and places of worship are more common in the US, which has some of the most permissive gun laws in the developed world. The Gun Violence Archive, which defines mass shootings as any incident in which four or more victims have been shot, has counted 389 of them this year in the US, including at least six such shootings at schools.
Last year the US had more than 500 mass shootings, according to the archive.</p><small>2025-12-14 03:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14080833a56cb1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961026/afghan-girl-wins-relief-in-college-admission-case' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan girl wins relief in college admission case</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Pesh­awar High Court has temporarily restrai­n­­ed the admission committee for public-sector medical colleges from excluding an Afghan female student from the ongoing admissions process over her inability to produce an Afghan passport and visa.
A bench comprising Ju­­stice Ijaz Anwar and Jus­tice Wiqar Ahmad issued notices to the responden­ts, including the vice chancellor of Khyber Medical Uni­versity and the cha­­ir­­man of the admission committee, seeking their replies to a petition filed by the student, Ruby, an Afg­h­­an refugee holding a Proof of Registration card.
The petitioner has asked the court to declare the requirement to submit a passport and visa before admission as contrary to the admissions policy, illegal and discriminatory.
She has also sought court directives for the respondents to call her for an interview after the final merit list is displayed and, if she secures a place on merit, to grant her admission to the relevant MBBS or BDS programme.
She has also requested the court to restrain the respondents from altering the merit list on the basis of her failure to produce a passport and visa at this stage. The bench fixed Dec 30 for the next hearing.
Advocate Mian Zakir Hussain appeared for the petitioner and told the court that his client was an Afghan national regis­te­r­­ed with the Commis­sio­n­erate of Afghan Refu­ge­­es along with her family.
He said his client had completed her SSC and HSSC and then appeared in the MDCAT, securing good marks.

ISLAMABAD: Overturning a lower court order for a DNA test to ascertain the parentage of a petitioner, the Supreme Court has ruled that the right to privacy — recognised as an entitlement to personal sanctuary — requires protecting individuals from undue intrusion into their private lives.
“The unnecessary public challenge to the paternity of a person inherently res­ults in societal embarrassment, humiliation, and severe psychological stigma,” observed Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar while accepting an appeal filed by petitioner Khalid Hameed.
On Nov 3, 2022, a special judge of the Anti-Corruption Court, Pakpattan, had ordered the respective circle officer to conduct DNA tests of the petitioner and one Mohammad Haneef, holding that the real dispute in an inheritance matter centred on the petitioner’s paternity.
The directive was challenged through a revision petition before the Lahore High Court, which rejected the plea on Dec 6, 2022.
The controversy involved several res­pondents allegedly involved in forgery and corruption pertaining to a material alteration of the petitioner’s parentage in educational records, purportedly to deprive him of his rightful inheritance.
The Supreme Court said challen­ges to paternity must not be taken light­­ly, as compelling a DNA test without ade­quate grounds inherently casts serious aspersions on the character and moral integrity of the mother — a course the top court has previously declared impermissible.
Such judicial directives, when lacking proper legal basis, amount to an unwarranted intrusion into the sanctity of family life and a woman’s reputation, which should never be tolerated under the gui­se of legal process, observed Justice Kak­ar, who was heading a two-judge bench.
“This protection extends to personal data, communications, family life, and all facets of the personal sphere against un­­w­arranted interference by the state or pri­v­a­te entities,” the six-page judgement said.
Justice Kakar observed that any de­­m­and for a DNA test, particularly to determine parentage, encroaches upon fundamental privacy rights, as genetic information contains comprehensive data about lineage and physical characteristics. These fundamental rights, the jud­gement said, safeguard bodily integrity and ensure an individual’s autonomy to refuse unsolicited medical procedures.

 

The right conferred under Article 14 does not concern any premises, home or office, but the person — the man or woman wherever he or she may be, Justice Kakar underscored. He said that obtaining someone’s DNA without due process fundamentally violates rights to privacy, autonomy, and liberty, as it involves extracting extre­mely sensitive personal information.
While intrinsically linked to the rig­hts to existence and autonomy, the right to privacy has evolved into an independent fundamental guarantee under Article 14, representing the ultimate honour of the human person and the essence of individuality, the judgement stated. It protects a zone of choice and self-determination, enabling individuals to make intimate decisions without fear of surveillance or unauthorised disclosure.
“The inviolability of privacy is direc­tly linked with the dignity of man,” Jus­tice Kakar remarked, adding that preserving human dignity requires safeguarding privacy from invasion and unlawful intrusion. The judgement warned that such encroachment carries the serious risk of misuse or unauthorised dissemination of an individual’s genetic blueprint, potentially causing grave personal and professional harm.
The right to liberty under Article 9, it said, goes beyond protection from physical detention and encompasses freedom from arbitrary or purposeless restraints on personal autonomy that are inconsistent with public interest or statutory provisions.
A judicial order for DNA testing without consent or legal justification, therefore, is not a mere procedural flaw but one that causes profound adverse effects on an individual’s life and dignity.

The NRE Step-I will be conducted by the National University of Medical Sciences (NUMS) in Rawalpindi, in accordance with the policy of the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC).
A total of 7,076 graduates registered with the PMDC for the exam, including 6,989 medical graduates and 87 dental graduates, according to council data.
According to a statement from the PMDC, the examination will take place at four venues.
In Islamabad/Rawa­lpindi, 2,358 medical and 43 dental candidates will appear; in Lahore, 3,562 medical and 30 dental candidates; in Karachi, 499 medical and four dental candidates; and in Peshawar, 570 medical and 10 dental candidates.
The candidates are graduates who obtained their medical and dental degr­ees from various countries and are seeking licensure to practice in Pakistan. Under PMDC policy, no foreign graduate is eligible for provisional or permanent registration to practice independently until they pass the examination.

 

“PMDC has consistently ensured a transparent, standardised, and internationally aligned examination system to assess the professional competence of returning graduates,” a PMDC spokesperson said. “Candidates who will successfully clear both steps of the NRE will be issued registration certificates, in accordance with the relevant provisions of law.”
All preparations for the examination were completed, with candidates required to report to their centres by 10am for the exam commencing at 12 noon. The PMDC stated that any candidate found violating standard operating procedures (SOPs) would be barred from the examination.
In its statement, the PMDC also advised parents sending their children abroad for medical or dental education to enroll them only in recognised, accredited, and PMDC-approved institutions.
The council warned that non-compliance with its policies could result in consequences for prospective candidates.
It further advised parents and students to exercise “utmost caution and refrain from enrolling in substandard or poor quality medical and dental colleges”.

A division bench comprising Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan will take up the matter for further proceedings on Monday (tomorrow).
In a detailed written order issued on Dec 9, the IHC held that the question regarding the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree fell squarely within the scope of a writ of quo warranto — his right to hold public office.
The two-member bench ruled that the petition was maintainable and set aside the office objection earlier raised by the registrar.
The bench had also gra­nted Justice Jahangiri thr­ee days to respond to the facts unearthed till date.
The registrar’s office served the notice at the judge’s chamber due to time constraints. Sources said court staff of Justice Jahangiri received the notice and submitted it to his chamber. They added that Justice Jahangiri dec­ided to appear before the bench at the next hearing.
While Justice Jahangiri along with four other IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — had earlier app­eared before the Sup­reme Court as well on the same matter, it is not yet clear whether his fellow judges will accompany him in the IHC on Monday.
However, lawyers are expected to attend the proceedings to express solidarity with him. According to for­­mer president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association Riasat Ali Azad, he, along with scores of lawyers, will be present in the courtroom during the hearing.
Fake degree controversy
The petition, filed by Advocate Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeks a judicial determination on whether Justice Jahangiri lawfully holds the office of a high court judge in view of allegations concerning his LLB degree obtained from the University of Karachi (KU).
According to the order, the bench observed that the petitioner had challenged the judge’s eligibility to hold office rather than alleging misconduct.
As such, the matter did not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of Article 209 of the Constitution, which governs proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council.
During the hearings, IHC Chief Justice Dogar consistently observed that the petition raised a direct question of qualification, whether the respondent fulfilled the statutory requirements to hold judicial office, which could be examined through a writ of quo warranto. The bench also noted that the SC had already directed the IHC to proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
The court order referred to a report submitted by KU through the Higher Education Commission (HEC), which highlighted several discrepancies in the academic record of the degree in question.
According to the report, a candidate named “Tariq Mehmood” obtained an LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, university records showed that the same enrolment number had already been issued to another student, Imtiaz Ahmed, in 1987.
The report further stated that the transcript for LLB Part-I was issued in the name “Tariq Jahangiri”, while the inquiry revealed that the judge had also been assigned a separate enrolment number (7124) for the same degree programme. The committee observed that this violated university rules, which allow only one enrolment number for the entire duration of a degree.
According to the inquiry findings, the existence of multiple identities, duplicate enrolment numbers, and conflicting transcripts rendered the academic credentials “invalid”, although the committee stopped short of declaring the degree “bogus”.
The report also noted that the candidate had been debarred for three years in 1988 on grounds of using unfair means but later appeared in examinations under a different name.
The university alleged collusion with staff and impersonation of other enrolled students, following which the results were cancelled and a three-year ban was imposed, effective until 1992.
In its order, the IHC bench reproduced and relied upon several SC judgements — including Abrar Hassan vs Government of Pakistan, Malik Asad Ali vs Federation, and Sindh High Court Bar Association vs Federation — to conclude that a writ of quo warranto could be issued against a judge in matters relating to eligibility.
The bench also referenced the SC’s direction in Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri vs Mian Dawood.
It noted that the apex court had explicitly ordered the IHC to proceed with Mr Dawood’s petition. “Keeping in view the stance of the petitioner that Respondent No. 1 [Justice Jahangiri] possesses an invalid/fake LLB degree, as well as a careful perusal of the report submitted by the University of Karachi through [the] HEC, we deem it appropriate to issue notice to Respondent No. 1 to submit his reply within three days,” the order stated.

Also, the Sheikh Landik police post in Bannu came under attack, where terrorists carried out assaults using quadcopters and sniper fire on Friday, according to police.
They said terrorists dropped two quadcopter bombs, while sniper firing was also carried out from another direction. Both quadcopter bombs exploded after landing near the police post building. However, no loss of life was reported.
On Saturday, however, locals said the quadcopter crashed in the Pattona Mamand Khel area of Bannu, killing Faisal, 16, Abrar, 20, and Muhammad, 12, and injuring nine-year-old Muhammad Aiman.

Soon after the crash, rescue and security personnel reached the site as locals reached the spot. Security forces cordoned off the area and launched an investigation to ascertain the nature and origin of the drone.
Police claimed the Sheikh Landik police post had been targeted repeatedly, with at least 14 terrorist attacks within a month.
Afghan girl killed in blast
A minor Afghan girl was killed and a bridge was destroyed after a powerful IED blast occurred on the Wana-Karikot Road in Lower South Waziristan on Saturday, police officials said.

 

Lower South Waziristan DPO Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir said the explosion took place near a bridge, causing severe structural damage.
According to sources, the bridge collapsed due to the intensity of the blast, disrupting traffic in the area. The explosion also caused partial damage to a nearby house and a private vehicle parked close to the site.
Police said that at the time of the blast, the minor Afghan girl was present on the roof of her house. The force of the explosion caused a portion of the roof to collapsed, leaving her critically injured.
Local residents rushed to the scene and shifted the injured girl to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Wana for emergency treatment. Hospital officials said she was in a critical condition upon arrival and later succumbed to her injuries despite efforts by doctors to save her.
Following the explosion, police cordoned off the area, collected evidence from the site, and launched an investigation to trace the perpetrators and determine the nature of the explosive device.

Chundrigar Road in a “joint operation” declaring it a federal trust property.
In a joint statement, the FIA and ETPB said that the Karachi Cotton Exchange Building is a trust property as per federal government’s gazette notification and hence the title of this property is vested in the federal government. 
During the operation, the statement said, it was found that the Karachi Cotton Association had been illegally occupying the premises, keeping multiple tenants inside the building and charging them rent without any lawful authority.
The two agencies said the premises were secured in the presence of FIA and ETPB officials and representatives of the Karachi Cotton Association (KCA).
“All occupants and tenants were afforded an opportunity to safely retrieve their personal belongings before the premises were sealed under their lock and key,” the statement said, adding that arrangements have been made to facilitate retrieval of remaining valuables and records through a formal application and verification process.

Association terms operation by FIA, Evacuee Trust ‘illegal’

The FIA and ETPB reiterated that they are “fully cognisant that valuables and records may be lying inside” and reaffirmed their commitment to protecting federal assets and taking action against illegal occupation.
However, the KCA strongly condemned the operation, terming it illegal and without lawful authority.
“An unlawful raid was conducted on the Cotton Exchange Building jointly by the Evacuee Trust and the FIA despite the fact that KCA is in lawful possession of the property under a valid lease issued by the Karachi Municipal Corporation, extending up to the year 2081,” said a KCA statement.
The association rejected the classification of the building as an evacuee or trust property, asserting and claimed that the property was purchased by the Karachi Cotton Association Ltd through a registered conveyance deed on in May 1936, prior to 1947, and therefore cannot be treated as abandoned or evacuee property under the law.
“The KCA takes serious objections to the unlawful act of the Evacuee Trust and the FIA and calls upon them to forthwith withdraw the sealing notice if any, and to de-seal the building immediately, failing which the KCA reserves the right to take appropriate action against them as provided by law for the unlawful action, losses to them,” added the KCA statement.

Three other US soldiers were wounded, the US military’s Central Command said.
In a statement, Central Command said the attack by a lone gunman occurred “as the soldiers were conducting a key leader engagement” in the central Syrian town of Palmyra.







“Partner forces” killed the attacker, US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth wrote in a social media post.







IS did not immediately claim responsibility, but a senior US official said initial assessments indicate the militant group probably carried out the attack. It took place in an area not controlled by the Syrian government, the official said.
The soldiers’ names will be withheld until 24 hours after the next-of-kin notification, the US military said.
Syrian state news agency SANA quoted a security source as saying two Syrian service personnel were injured, without providing further details. The source told SANA that American helicopters evacuated the injured to a US base in Syria’s Al-Tanf region near the Iraqi border.
Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkiye and special envoy to Syria, condemned the attack.
“We mourn the loss of three brave US service members and civilian personnel and wish a speedy recovery to the Syrian troops wounded in the attack,” Barrack said in a statement.
“We remain committed to defeating terrorism with our Syrian partners.”







The attack came barely a month after Syria announced it had signed a political cooperation agreement with the US-led coalition against IS, which coincided with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s visit to the White House.
The coalition has carried out air strikes and ground operations in Syria targeting IS suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria’s security forces. Syria last month also carried out a nationwide campaign arresting more than 70 people accused of links to the group.
The US has troops stationed in northeastern Syria as part of a decade-long effort to help a Kurdish-led force there.</p><small>2025-12-13 18:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/13223733930cf4c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960926/trump-appears-in-newly-released-photos-from-jeffrey-epsteins-estate' target='_blank'><strong>Trump appears in newly released photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate</strong></a><br><p>Congressional Democrats released 19 new images from the estate of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, including photos of now-President Donald Trump, as the deadline for an extensive release of documents related to the disgraced financier nears.
Trump is featured in three of the photos shared by House Oversight Committee Democrats, who said they are reviewing more than 95,000 images produced by the estate.
In one black-and-white photo, Trump is seen smiling with several women — whose faces are redacted — on each side of him. A second image shows Trump standing beside Epstein, and a third, less-clear image shows him seated alongside another woman, whose face is also redacted, with his red tie loosened. It was not clear when or where the photos were taken.
“Everybody knew this man,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. “He was all over Palm Beach. He has photos with everybody. I mean, almost — there are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him. So that’s no big deal.”
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Trump’s administration “has done more for Epstein’s victims than Democrats ever have.
“It’s time for the media to stop regurgitating Democrat talking points and start asking Democrats why they wanted to hang around Epstein after he was convicted,” she said.
Trump fanned Epstein conspiracies
The Epstein scandal has been a political headache for Trump for months, partly because he amplified conspiracy theories about Epstein to his own supporters. Many Trump voters believe Trump administration officials have covered up Epstein’s ties to powerful figures and obscured details surrounding his death, which was ruled a suicide, in a Manhattan jail in 2019.
The Justice Department said in July that there was no evidence to justify investigating any third parties in the Epstein case, and that it had found no “client list” or people who might have been involved in sex trafficking, or any evidence that Epstein had blackmailed anyone.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week found that just half of Republicans approve of Trump’s handling of the Epstein case, well below his overall 85 per cent approval rating in his own party.
Trump and Epstein were friends during the 1990s and early 2000s, but Trump says he broke off ties before Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges.
Trump has consistently denied knowing about Epstein’s abuse and sex trafficking of underage girls.
Other men also shown
Democratic former president Bill Clinton, former Trump aide Steve Bannon, Bill Gates and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers also appear in the batch of images.

A spokesperson for the committee, which is led by Republican Chairman James Comer of Kentucky, said Democrats were politicising the investigation by “cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump”.
Democrats said the tens of thousands of photos include “images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein” and “photographs of women and Epstein properties” and more will be released in the coming days.
“These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world,” Representative Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the oversight committee, said in a statement. “We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW.”
The congressional Democrats said they redacted the women’s faces to protect the identities of Epstein’s victims.
The committee is continuing to obtain and release documents even as the US Department of Justice is expected to publicise unclassified Epstein files from its federal investigation late next week.
Trump signed into law last month an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill led by Democratic Representative Ro Khanna of California and Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky that compels the Justice Department to release the Epstein files within 30 days. December 19 will mark the end of that window.</p><small>2025-12-13 17:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1321254130ff3b7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960921/president-zardari-directs-ppp-to-prepare-for-local-body-polls-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari directs PPP to prepare for local body polls in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday tasked PPP lawmakers and members with commencing preparations for the local body polls in Punjab.
The local body polls are likely to be held in Punjab next year after some amendments to the local government law. Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is bound to hold elections within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions.

 

In April 2019, the then PTI-led Punjab government dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on December 31, 2021. The elections were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022, but this was not possible because the provincial government kept amending the local government law repeatedly.
President Zardari arrived in Lahore on Friday evening and met party leaders today at Bilawal House, directing them to enhance their public interaction.
Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider, MNA Makhdoom Murtaza Mahmood, PPP Lahore leader Faisal Mir, PPP South Punjab Coordinator Abdul Qadir Shaheen, MPA Alamdar Qureshi, Malik Muzaffar, Zaki Chaudhry and Ali Zaki were among those present in the meeting.
“President Zardari asked the party to start preparation for local body polls in Punjab,” Shaheen told Dawn after the meeting.
He said the president tasked all lawmakers, ticket holders and party office bearers to enhance their public outreach so the party’s narrative of “serving the people” could be effectively disseminated.
Shaheen added that the president also appreciated the party’s performance in the south Punjab and said he would visit the region next month.
“There is a need to strengthen PPP in Punjab,” Zardari was quoted by him as saying.
Governor Haider also briefed the president on the political situation in the province. He and other leaders apprised the party co-chairman of the challenges being faced by the PPP in Punjab.
Shaheen said the president was also informed that PPP candidate Dost Muhammad Khosa for the National Assembly by-poll in DG Khan had won, but was declared the losing candidate through “massive rigging”.
In the by-election for NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan-2), Khosa secured 49,262 votes, while his PML-N rival Mahmood Qadir Khan won the seat with 82,413 votes.
“The party will challenge the victory of the PML-N candidate in the election tribunal on Monday,” Shaheen said.</p><small>2025-12-13 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639235-arts-matric-students-allowed-to-enroll-in-pre-medical-pre-engineering-groups' target='_blank'><strong>Arts matric students allowed to enroll in pre-medical, pre-engineering groups</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on X , Mohsin said the original deadline of December 15 had been pushed back by one week to December 22, to accommodate the surge in inquiries.
“Witnessing growing interest from Europe, USA, the Middle East and beyond in acquiring new HBL PSL teams, we have decided to extend the bid submission deadline by one week to 22 December 2025,” he wrote, while quoting an earlier PSL announcement about a promotional roadshow in New York.
“Good luck to everyone excited to welcome our new franchise owners to the HBL PSL family,” Mohsin added.
The announcement came on the very day the PCB hosted a high-profile PSL roadshow in New York City, featuring current Pakistan players including T20 captain Salman Ali Agha, Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Saim Ayub, Shan Masood and Saud Shakeel, along with legends Wasim Akram and Ramiz Raja, and singer Ali Zafar.
The event followed a similar roadshow at Lord’s Cricket Ground in London last week, as part of efforts to attract global investment ahead of the league’s expansion to eight teams for its 11th edition in 2026.
The addition of two new franchises marks the PSL’s first major structural growth since 2018, when Multan Sultans joined as the sixth team.
The auction for the new teams is expected to follow shortly after the bidding process concludes.
Mohsin, who also serves as Pakistan’s Interior Minister, has been vocal about elevating the PSL’s global standing, including recent pledges for transparent bidding and infrastructure development.
The league’s expansion is seen as a step towards enhancing its commercial appeal and competitiveness on the international T20 circuit.</p><small>2025-12-13 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1311484075ed9f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960880/rt-india-deletes-x-post-about-pm-waiting-to-meet-putin-says-it-may-have-been-misrepresentation-of-events' target='_blank'><strong>RT India deletes X post about PM ‘waiting to meet’ Putin, says it ‘may have been misrepresentation of events’</strong></a><br><p>RT India has deleted a post on social media platform X about Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “waiting to meet” Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that it “may have been a misrepresentation of events”, it emerged on Saturday.
The development came as PM Shehbaz was in Ashgabat to attend an international forum. On Friday, the premier met a host of leaders on the sidelines of the gathering, including Turkish Pre­sident Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon, Kyrgyzstan Pres­ident Sadyr Japarov and Putin.
“Great interactions with world leaders. Pakistan shining at the global stage,” said Information Minister Ataullah Tarar on X on Friday night, sharing a video of PM Shehbaz shaking hands with Putin as the two stood in what appeared to be a hallway.
He also termed the meetings with Putin, Erdogan and Pezeshkian “warm and cordial exchanges”.







Prime Minister’s Spokesperson for Foreign Media Mosharraf Zaidi also shared the same video, saying PM Shehbaz had “productive meetings with his peers from all the countries” that attended the forum.
“The customary warmth in relations was in ample evidence as the prime minister shared the day with President Erdogan, President Putin and a host of other key world leaders,” he said.







The same video was also shared by the Russian embassy in Pakistan.







However, RT India, appeared to have shared a different video, which has since been deleted from X.
In a clarification issued late on Friday night, it said, “We deleted an earlier post about Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif waiting to meet Vladimir Putin at the Peace and Trust forum in Turkmenistan. The post may have been a misrepresentation of the events.”
RT India is the newest branch of Russia’s state-funded global media network. Putin had launched the RT India news channel last week during a visit to New Delhi.







According to Indian media, the original RT India post stated that PM Shehbaz waited for Putin for 40 minutes before “growing tired and gate-crashing” the Russian leader’s meeting with Erdogan.
“He left ten minutes later,” Times of India and Hindustan Times quoted the original post as saying.
Meanwhile, Russia’s RIA news agency reported that PM Shehbaz had later joined the talks between Erdogan and Putin, which had lasted 40 minutes behind closed doors.
In a remark on the situation, Tarar told Dawn: “No need for any comment on an Indian outlet which posted a fake story then deleted it, calling a misrepresentation of facts.”</p><small>2025-12-13 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1319144969153e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960900/pm-shehbaz-says-economy-out-of-the-woods-key-indicators-show-wonderful-performance' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz says economy ‘out of the woods’, key indicators show ‘wonderful’ performance</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that the country had exited a period of economic turmoil and jeopardy, with its key indicators now showing “wonderful” performance due to the government’s efforts.
The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections for Pakistan suggest that the immediate risk of an economic free fall has eased, but the country remains locked into a narrow stabilisation path, marked by weak growth, heavy debt, and limited relief for households.
Projections by the Fund, released early on Tuesday alongside the statement announcing a fresh disbursement of around $1.2 billion to Pakistan, showed that the country’s economic growth was projected to inch up from 2.6 per cent in FY2024 to 3.2pc by FY2026.
Addressing the launch ceremony of the National Regulatory Reforms in Islamabad, the prime minister said the national economy was in a very difficult situation when the current government took the reins.
“Through our outstanding teamwork, excellent planning and untiring efforts, I can say today with a sense of relief and achievement that Pakistan is economically out of the woods; our mega indicators are wonderful,” he said, pointing to the news of the recent release of the $1.2bn IMF tranche.







The premier said the government was now focused on and discussing how to move forward and grow the economy with foreign investment in “attractive areas of mutual benefits” such as agriculture, information technology, and mines and minerals.
“We have a very young population, a youth bulge. We are offering them vast opportunities for vocational training and with international certification. They will find productive jobs not only in Pakistan but abroad, making Pakistan richer and prosperous.”
He termed the launch of the regulatory framework as a “quantum jump” that would facilitate the business community, industry, agriculture and foreign direct investment, adding that it would also eliminate the “immense waste of time and resources” in the country that led to corruption and nepotism.
“We are able to now announce and let the nation know … that the government is fully aware of the challenges of the day and they are ready to walk with them with the speed they want us to walk,” the premier added.
PM Shehbaz also thanked the British government for its support.
The prime minister said that the United Kingdom had been a great partner in the country’s progress.
He also said that Pakistan had a “wonderful relationship” with the United States and was looking forward to a “wonderful time of mutual cooperation”.
Earlier, Special Assistant to PM for Industry and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan said today was more than a policy moment as it also marked a turning of the page.
He said that, among the many reforms the government was undertaking, one stood out as foundational: the transformation of Pakistan from a regulatory state into a developmental state.
Khan added that the regulatory reform was not an isolated effort, but part of a wider transformation guided by three pillars: tariff rationalisation, regulatory modernisation, and export-led industrial revival.
“Under the new national tariff policy, we are moving towards predictability, competitiveness and phasing out of arbitrary duties,” he added.
UK Minister for International Development and Africa Baroness Jenny Chapman also highlighted the full potential, prospects of entrepreneurship, availability of natural resources and Pakistan’s place at the centre of global trade.
Terming the reforms as a positive achievement, she said these were the ambitions that both the UK and Pakistan shared.
“The links between our people play a huge part in the flow of trade and investment between our two countries as well. Trade is now at 5.5bn pounds a year. We’ve got a new trade dialogue and we’re supporting Pakistan’s efforts to work with the 1.6 million-strong Pakistani diaspora in the UK to unlock private capital,” she added.</p><small>2025-12-13 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/131940001393c8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960892/pakistan-army-takes-top-spot-with-353-medals-as-national-games-closing-ceremony-held-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Army takes top spot with 353 medals as National Games closing ceremony held in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>The closing ceremony of the 35th National Games was held in Karachi on Saturday, with Pakistan Army taking home the highest number of medals.

Addressing the ceremony, Bilawal said, “These National Games were not merely a competition of speed, strength or skill; they were a celebration of Pakistan itself.
“From Gilgit-Baltistan to Gwadar, from Khyber to Karachi, from Lahore to Larkana, every athlete who competed here carried the colours of their province but stood united under one flag,” he said.
He said that Sindh was “proud” to have hosted the sporting event.
“To our athletes, you are the pride of Pakistan. Whether you return home with medals or memories, you return as ambassadors; ambassadors of discipline, perseverance and national unity.
“You have shown us what Pakistan’s youth can achieve when given the opportunity and encouragement,” he said.







“Sport teaches us teamwork, courage, respect for rules and resilience in the face of challenge. These are not just sporting values, they are national values,” Bilawal said.
Talking about the May conflict with India, the PPP Chairman said that the army, airforce and navy demonstrated professionalism, coordination and strength.
“Pakistan emerged victorious with its sovereignty defended and its honour upheld. This victory was not only a military victory, it was a national one. It reflected the unity of our people, the discipline of our forces and the unbreakable bond between the nation and those who stand guard over it,” he said.
“As these National Games conclude, may the friendships formed here endure, may the lessons learnt here guide us and may the unity displayed here continue to define our federation,” he concluded.</p><small>2025-12-13 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639207-judicial-body-seeks-mechanism-to-present-detainee-before-magistrate-within-24-hours' target='_blank'><strong>Judicial body seeks mechanism to present detainee before magistrate within 24 hours</strong></a><br><p>

As a part of a so-called GOAT Tour, the 38-year-old Argentina and Inter Miami superstar touched down in the eastern state of West Bengal early Saturday, greeted by a chorus of exuberant fans chanting his name.
Hours later, thousands of fans wearing Messi jerseys and waving the Argentine flag packed into Salt Lake stadium in the state capital Kolkata, but heavy security around the footballer left fans struggling to catch a glimpse of him.
Messi walked around the pitch waving to fans and left the stadium earlier than expected.

Frustrated fans, many having paid more than $100 for tickets, ripped out stadium seats and hurled water bottles onto the track.
Many others stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents.
“For me, to watch Messi is a pleasure, a dream. But I have missed the chance to have a glimpse because of the mismanagement in the stadium,” businessman Nabin Chatterjee, 37, told AFP.
Before the chaos erupted, Messi unveiled a 21-metre (70-foot) statue which shows him holding aloft the World Cup.
He was also expected to play a short exhibition game at the stadium.
Another angry fan told the Press Trust of India (PTI) that people had spent “a month’s salary” to see Messi.

“I paid Rs 5,000 ($55) for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians. The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame,” Ajay Shah, told PTI.
Javed Shamim, a senior police official in the state, told reporters that the event’s “chief organiser” had been arrested, without giving any further details.
“There is total normalcy,” he said, adding that authorities would look into how organisers could refund money to those who bought tickets.
State chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she was “disturbed” and “shocked” at the mismanagement.
“I sincerely apologise to Lionel Messi, as well as to all sports lovers and his fans, for the unfortunate incident,” she said in a post on X, adding that she had ordered a probe into the incident.
The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it was not involved in the “organisation, planning, or execution” of the “private event”.
“Furthermore, the details of the event were neither communicated to the AIFF, nor was any clearance sought from the Federation,” a statement said.

Messi will now head to Hyderabad, Mumbai and New Delhi as part of the four-city tour.
His time in India also includes a possible meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Messi won his second consecutive Major League Soccer Most Valuable Player award this week after propelling Inter Miami to the MLS title and leading the league in goals.
