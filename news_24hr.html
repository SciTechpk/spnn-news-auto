“More than 100 people were arrested under charges of violating Section 144, forcefully shutting down markets and blocking highways,” Quetta Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Muhammad Baloch told Dawn.com.
The arrests come as six opposition political parties announced a complete wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across Balochistan today to protest against the suicide bombing that targeted a public meeting of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) on Sept 2 and claimed 15 lives.
Police in Quetta fired tear gas to disperse protesters and arrested them, AFP reported. AFP pictures showed people blocking roads by placing stones, which they were also pelting, and burning objects.
At 12pm, the National Highways and Motorways Police said the N-25 highway near Baleli Custom in Quetta was closed due to a “public protest”.
 






Parts of the N-25 highway, which extends from Karachi to Quetta, were also blocked near Hub and Mastung’s Sona Khan area, the motorway police said in the morning.
 






 






The Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance — which the PTI, PkMAP and BNP-M are a part of — shared purported pictures on its X account of closed shops in Awaran.
 






In another post, it claimed that the Western Bypass in Quetta was “completely shut”. “Violence and shelling by the police on PTI workers. The workers are continuing to resist the police shelling,” it added.
 






The opposition parties had declared that highways, intercity roads and routes leading to Quetta airport and railway station would be blocked during the strike. Other airports in the province would also be shut, they added, urging the business community and transporters to support the strike.
The Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry, along with other business associations, had announced the closure of businesses across the province in solidarity with the victims of the suicide bombing. The Private Schools Association also declared that all private schools, colleges, and universities would remain closed.
 
 

Last night, the Balochistan government warned protesters of “strict and immediate action” if they tried to disrupt law and order, or block roads and highways.
Fifteen people lost their lives, while 38 were injured in the blast that targeted a rally held at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium to mark the fourth death anniversary of former Balochistan chief minister Sardar Attaullah Mengal, a veteran nationalist leader and BNP founder.
Subsequently, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Par­ty (PkMAP) Chairman Mah­mood Khan Achakzai, BNP-M Chief Sar­dar Akhtar Mengal, along with lea­ders of the PTI, Awami National Party (ANP), National Party (NP) and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM), had announced the strike at a joint press conference.
Mengal, calling the stadium bombing a “painful and tragic act”, had criticised the state for not fulfilling its “duty” to protect the gathering. Mengal, Achakzai, former NP senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai had remained unhurt in the suicide attack as they had left the venue just a few minutes before the blast.</p><small>2025-09-08 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/081022342feff37.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940454/sc-plans-to-use-ai-to-categorise-cases-for-fixing-but-not-yet-ready-cjp-afridi' target='_blank'><strong>SC plans to use AI to categorise cases for fixing but ‘not yet ready’: CJP Afridi</strong></a><br><p>Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi on Monday said the Supreme Court had plans to use artificial intelligence to categorise cases for fixation but the judiciary was “not ready” for the technology yet.
He was addressing a judicial conference at the apex court, marking the commencement of the new judicial year.
“We all talk about technology, we all talk about AI to be utilised for enhancing the justice delivery system,” Justice Afridi said, adding that 61,000 files will be digitally screened under a project that will be completed within six months.
 
 

“It is only when you have them digitally scanned that you can utilise the tools of AI for categorisation. It will be easy to categorise cases and to fix before one bench one issue,” he said.
The chief justice emphasised, “Yes, technology is necessary. Yes, AI has to be utilised. But no, not now. We are not ready for it. We have to prepare ourselves for that.”
Justices Mansoor Ali Shah, Munib Akhtar, Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Athar Minallah, Shahid Waheed, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Malik Shahzad Ahmad were among the fellow SC judges seen attending the event. Judges of the high courts were also present.

‘No issue on judges’ leaves during holidays’
During his speech, CJP Afridi also detailed a number of new policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs) introduced to address the structure of discussions on important issues.
Justice Afridi remarked that the chief justice could previously take up any case out of order for an early hearing, but SOPs were now in place to prevent that.
Stating that the court was taking up cases on a “first-come, first-served” basis, the top judge clarified that the court would not hear cases out of their order.
Then, apparently responding to one of the questions raised in Justice Shah’s recent letter on the CJP having powers to grant or refuse judges’ leaves, Justice Afridi said leaves outside of judicial holidays required permission.
“Let’s look at the grant of leave. I made it very clear, during holidays anyone who wants to go anywhere, no issue. But when there is court work, then I said here is the discretion, discretion is the exercise, it is the criteria, you have got everything in writing.”
 
 

Just last month, the SC issued a number of policy decisions taken between Oct 26, 2024 and Aug 12, 2025. One such decision, reflected in a General Standing Order dated July 29, 2025, amended the Supreme Court Judges (Leave, Pension and Privileges) Order 1997, empowering the CJP to grant or refuse leave, whether within or outside Pakistan, or to revoke or curtail leave already granted to judges of the court.
In his letter, Justice Shah wrote: “In principle, leave can, if at all, only possibly be considered for refusal where: (i) a part-heard case cannot be adjourned; (ii) urgent administrative duty demands presence; or (iii) a judge is negligent in work and seeks leave to evade it.
“Yet, in practice, leave is being denied even when none of these circumstances exist-apparently to enforce compliance and control, and to prevent independent judges from speaking at international forums.”
Enforced disappearances’ issue given ‘serious attention’
CJP Afridi further observed that the National Judicial Policy-Making Committee, which he heads and includes all the chief justices, had given “serious attention” to the issue of enforced disappearances.
“We sat down and decided on 17 items on which we are to proceed […]
First and foremost was that serious attention was given to enforced disappearances,” the top judge said.
He thanked Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan for assuring the judiciary that the government was “seriously considering a mechanism to ensure the production of detained persons”.
 
 

“I thank you for that and I expect that soon, we will have a good news regarding that,” Justice Afridi remarked.
“Number two, to safeguard the dignity of judges, SOPs have also been framed by the high courts to protect the judicial officers from external influence. This is the district judiciary. We have done it; all the district judiciary, all the high courts have framed their rules,” the CJP stated.
SC reforms based on 5 principles
Justice Afridi observed that after assuming the CJP’s office in October 2024, he felt the need for reforms, which were categorised based on “five principles”.
The CJP listed those principles: “To improve service delivery through technology, to improve access and transparency, to strengthen legal and regulatory framework, leverage international and external resources, and to revitalise the attached departments.”
 


Noting that the apex court had eight sections, CJP Afridi said each section prioritised speedy justice. He said digital case-filing and case-tracking were among the measures raised during six interactive meetings held to discuss the SC’s reforms.
“There are two groups in the lawyers’ community,” the CJP remarked, adding that members from both were included in the consultation process for judicial reforms.
He detailed that a high-powered committee led by Justice Shahid Waheed, which also included Justices Irfan Saadat Khan, Afghan and Abbasi, reviewed suggestions made by the SC “sections”, some judges and lawyers. Those were then placed before an administrative full court meeting on April 17.
Justice Afridi also spoke of the “Public Facilitation Centre” inaugurated today, which will begin its operations on October 1 and will provide “all details” related to cases.
Reiterating the need for speedy disposal of cases, he asserted: “We have always worked for the supremacy of the law.”
Emphasising that rules cannot be made within a single day, the judge urged those having objections to file their recommendations, which would then be taken up by a committee and eventually the full court. “I assure you that whatever your proposals are will be […] taken into consideration,” he affirmed.
‘Reduced security protocols for judges’
During his address, CJP Afridi highlighted that the security provided to him and other judges has been reduced, as well as the protocols when in Islamabad’s Red Zone, which houses key government buildings.
“I had nine security contingents as the chief justice. I sat down with the security people and I said ‘I am in the Red Zone, my residence is in the Red Zone, please have a heart’. So we have come down to this that there will only be two security vehicles with me, and same is the case with the worthy judges.”
 
 

He remarked that judges could need security when going outside of Islamabad, but not as much when in the Red Zone.
Continuing his speech, Justice Afridi noted that the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) had decided on 64 complaints against judges, 72 had been referred to the council’s members, and 65 were pending, which would be considered in the SJC meeting later this month.
AGP Awan, Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Tahir Nasrullah Warraich, and Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President Mian Rauf Atta also addressed the event.
Separately, CJP Afridi also inaugurated a “Media Station” at the SC, telling mediapersons on the occasion: “You people are necessary for the system because you keep everyone in check. […] Please keep us on check but it should be healthy.”
The CJP’s address today came ahead of a full court meeting later today — in which all SC judges are expected to participate — to review and approve the Supreme Court Rules 2025, as cracks in the judiciary become starker.
In his recent letter to the CJP, senior puisne judge Justice Shah asked him to answer six questions he raised about judicial independence, the court’s rules and policies, and the appeals against the 26th Amendment.</p><small>2025-09-08 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622604-scuffle-erupts-during-aleema-khans-media-talk-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Scuffle erupts during Aleema Khan's media talk outside Adiala Jail</strong></a><br><p>

They dubbed the full court meeting, called for this purpose today, a mere “stamp of approval” for the rules, which they said were already decided and unilaterally approved.
The letter addressed to Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was sent by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Ayesha Malik, and Justice Athar Minallah.
They pointed out that “if the full court was not deemed necessary for the adoption of the rules themselves, how can it now be summoned to deliberate upon their amendment?”
The judges said the working paper for the meeting’s agenda stated that under Rule 1(4) of the Supreme Court Rules 2025, the CJP may “remove any difficulty in giving effect to the said rules” on the recommendations of a committee that was constituted by him and had already been formed.
Moreover, “the chief justice, through a letter dated August 12, 2025, informed the judges that the rules had already been approved through circulation and duly notified in the Gazette on August 9, 2025,” the judges highlighted.
Yet, they further stated, the CJP had sought suggestions “for further amendments” to the rules.
Calling into question the legality of the rules themselves, the judges noted that the “present Supreme Court rules were never placed before, nor approved by, the full court.”
Citing Article 191 of the Constitution, they said the SC had the “power to make rules regulating its practice and procedure, but this power is exercised collectively by the court as an institution”.
The judges concluded that any rules established “without deliberation and approval of the full court” lacked its approval and could not acquire “binding legal status”.
They were of the opinion that the rules, in their present form, “suffer from both substantive and procedural illegality”. In this connection, they  expressed reservations rules were processed through circulation.
“Circulation is an administrative convenience to deal with routine or minor procedural matters; it is not, and cannot be, the vehicle for laying down the constitutional architecture of this court’s governance.
“Unless the full court had itself had expressly resolved to adopt circulation for this purpose the chief justice alone could not unilaterally resort to it.”

The KSE-100 index climbed by 1,810.11 points to close at 156,087.30, up by 1.17 per cent from the previous close of 154,277.19.
The PSX has witnessed a bullish trend in recent days, despite concerns over risks to the economy due to the ongoing floods, with the Pakistan Business Forum estimating the losses to crops worth billions of rupees.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, told Dawn.com: “Investors remain optimistic on improving macroeconomic indicators and stronger-than-expected corporate results, which have outweighed concerns over the recent floods.“
He said the market was expected to remain positive in the coming weeks, with the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meeting and any developments over circular debt remaining in the limelight.
“The KSE-100 is anticipated to sustain its upward trajectory, with a target of 165,215 points by December 25, primarily driven by strong earnings in fertilisers, sustained return on equity in banks and improving cash flows of exploration and production and oil marketing companies, benefiting from falling interest rates and economic stability.”
Meanwhile, Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities, noted that the stock market was being powered by abundant domestic liquidity, individuals and funds steadily deploying cash, placing the market in the “optimism phase” of the cycle.
“Confidence in forward earnings is improving, lower interest rates are pushing savers out of fixed income into equities and early movement on circular-debt resolution has supported a re-rating.”
He said the monetary policy was still tight in real terms so additional cuts could extend the runway. “The risks aren’t invisible — market leverage is rising and flood damage could weigh on growth — but this is a market to participate in with discipline: stagger entries, size positions prudently and let improving earnings — not euphoria — do the heavy lifting,” he added.</p><small>2025-09-08 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08171109a789210.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940510/emirati-naval-chief-awarded-nishan-e-imtiaz-by-president-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>Emirati naval chief awarded Nishan-e-Imtiaz by President Zardari</strong></a><br><p>Commander of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Naval Forces, Major General Humaid Abdulla Alremeithi, was on Monday awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz (Military) by President Asif Ali Zardari at a special investiture ceremony at the Presidency.
A press release from the President’s Secretariat quoted Zardari as saying that the award was “in recognition of his outstanding services and contributions”.
“He (President Zardari) added that the commander’s visit reflected the enduring fraternal ties between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, which stand as a testament to the two countries’ shared commitment to deepening cooperation in all fields,” the press release read.
According to the press release, the president appreciated the confidence the UAE’s Navy placed in the professional expertise of the Pakistan Navy and expressed interest in further collaboration, stating that they remain ready to support their Emirati counterpart’s manpower requirements in the future.
President Zardari also highlighted the extraordinary and exemplary relations that Pakistan and the UAE enjoy, which are “rooted in history and strengthened by enduring people-to-people bonds”. The press release said that he reaffirmed Islamabad’s resolve to continue working closely with the UAE and bolster brotherly ties.
“Commander Alremeithi informed the president that he had close ties with Pakistan, having spent four years in the country while graduating from the Pakistan Naval Academy [in] Karachi,” the press release stated.
During his visit, Maj Gen Alremeithi also called on Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza at the Joint Staff Headquarters in Rawalpindi, where he was welcomed with a guard of honour, according to a press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
 


“The two dignitaries held in-depth discussions on professional matters, reviewing the evolving global and regional geo-strategic environment,” the ISPR said. “Both sides emphasised the vital role of bilateral defence and security cooperation, including in the maritime domain, for regional peace and stability.”
The ISPR stated that Maj Gen Alremeithi expressed appreciation for the professional standards and achievements of the Pakistan Armed Forces, as well as their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and continued efforts towards achieving regional peace and stability.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.</p><small>2025-09-08 12:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08134208c68389b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940481/6-killed-several-others-injured-in-jerusalem-shooting-attack-israeli-foreign-minister' target='_blank'><strong>6 killed, several others injured in Jerusalem shooting attack: Israeli foreign minister</strong></a><br><p>Monday’s bus stop shooting in Jerusalem killed six people and injured several others, including a pregnant woman, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said at a press conference during a visit to Budapest.
Earlier, emergency service and medical teams “pronounced the deaths of four victims, including a man about 50 years old and three men aged around 30”, a statement from Magen David Adom — Israel’s emergency service — said, adding it was providing medical treatment to several other people, with five evacuated to hospitals.
The service received reports of more than a dozen people injured by gunfire on Monday at a road junction in east Jerusalem, with police saying the assailants had been “neutralised”.
 






It later said paramedics and ambulance crews were providing medical treatment and evacuating five “seriously wounded people” who had been sent to hospitals in Jerusalem.
“Several other victims, with varying degrees of injury, are also being treated at the scene,” it added.

It was not immediately clear who carried out the shooting or what the motive was. Israeli police described the shooters as “terrorists” without saying how many had been involved in the incident. They also claimed that the perpetrators had been killed, according to Reuters.
The Israeli ambulance service said earlier that 15 people were wounded and at least five were in serious condition with gunshot wounds. Paramedics arriving at the scene found victims lying on the road and sidewalk near a bus stop, some of them unconscious.
Footage from a dashboard camera at the scene showed people fleeing from the vicinity of a bus stopped by the side of a road as shots rang out. Another video showed a bus’s windscreen and windows pierced with bullet holes.
“Suddenly I hear the shots starting … I felt like I was running for an eternity,” Ester Lugasi, who was injured in the attack, told Israeli TV from the hospital. “I thought I was going to die.”
Haaretz further said, citing the police, that the two suspects had been shot dead by “a civilian member of the security forces who was present at the scene”.
“The Israeli security establishment estimates that the two are West Bank residents, and that they fired at a bus and a bus stop at the junction,” the newspaper reported.
Haaretz also reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at the site of the shooting after he conducted a situation assessment with officials. Speaking at the scene of the attack, Netanyahu said Israeli forces were pursuing suspects who aided the shooters.
Several weapons, ammunition and a knife used by the attackers were recovered at the scene, police said.
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said he was “deeply shocked” by the incident, describing it as a “cowardly terror attack”.
“My thoughts are with the victims’ families. I wish those who were injured a speedy recovery,” he wrote on X.
 






In October 2024, two Palestinians, one armed with a gun and the other armed with a knife, killed seven people in Tel Aviv.
In November 2023, two Palestinian gunmen killed three people at a Jerusalem bus stop. Israeli security services said that the attackers in the 2023 Jerusalem shooting were linked to Hamas.
Hamas, Islamic Jihad do not claim responsibility
Meanwhile, Hamas issued a statement about the attack, not claiming it but saying it was carried out by two Palestinians.
“We affirm that this operation is a natural response to the crimes of the occupation and the genocide it is waging against our people,” Hamas stated, according to AFP.
Al Jazeera reported that in its statement, Hamas called for “more armed attacks in occupied territory”. It quoted the group as saying that Israel’s aggression against Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank “will not weaken the determination of our people and their resistance”.
Similarly, Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian group did not claim responsibility for it.
Al Jazeera reported that the group’s armed wing said in a short statement that the shooting was “a natural and legitimate response to the ongoing crimes of the Zionist enemy” in Palestinian territories.
However, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas issued a statement which condemned “any targeting of Palestinian and Israeli civilians”.
Israel likely to retaliate for Jerusalem shootings: expert
Israel will likely respond to the shooting with acts of retribution targeting the homes of the gunmen, going by its track record of retaliation to previous attacks, Israeli political analyst Ori Goldberg says.
“I would assume the response would be extremely tactical,” he said, according to Al Jazeera. “They would try to identify the gunmen who carried out the attack, then they would go after their village or town of residence, [and] demolish their homes.”
He said in response to a previous attack, Israel had ordered thousands of trees to be destroyed in an attacker’s home village. “They would take all kinds of punitive actions,” he said.
“Israel is not capable of carrying out anything that is broader than a … tit-for-tat, trying to show it has the upper hand by using an excessive level of force,” he added. “This is true in Gaza, it’s going to be true in the West Bank.”</p><small>2025-09-08 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/081643460572130.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940508/gb-police-chief-bans-use-of-tiktok-by-personnel-to-ensure-discipline' target='_blank'><strong>GB police chief bans use of TikTok by personnel to ensure ‘discipline’</strong></a><br><p>The Gilgit-Baltistan police chief on Monday banned the use of social media platform TikTok by personnel of the force for the purpose of maintaining “discipline”.
A notification issued today from the office of the GB inspector general of police said: “In order to maintain discipline, uniformity and dignity of the force, it is hereby directed that no GB police officer/official shall use social media platform (TikTok).”
It ordered all district police officers and unit heads to bring the direction to the notice of all personnel under their command, warning that any non-compliance would be “viewed seriously and cause disciplinary action”.
In July, two constables from the Security Division Islamabad were suspended and facing an inquiry for allegedly violating the capital police’s social media policy by making and uploading TikTok videos in uniform.
Sources had said that dozens of other lower-ranking officials had been warned and directed to remove their TikTok accounts to avoid further action.
In March, the Punjab Police warned its officials against expressing “offensive views” about the state using their personal social media accounts.
In September 2024, the Islamabad and Punjab Police had devised policies regarding the use of social media platforms by officials and officers. The policies had restrained police officers and officials from giving any opinions or statements across all social media platforms.
Heads were also made responsible for personally supervising and monitoring the activities of officers and officials posted in their respective divisions, zones and units.
In the same month, the government had once again asked its employees to refrain from using social media to express political or religious opinions as well as from sharing information with any unauthorised government official or the media.</p><small>2025-09-08 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08134037412e972.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940482/two-gunned-down-one-injured-over-minor-dispute-in-nankana-sahib-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two gunned down, one injured over minor dispute in Nankana Sahib: police</strong></a><br><p>Two people were killed and another was injured on Monday when a “minor dispute” escalated into a gun battle between two groups in Punjab’s Nankana Sahib, according to police.
In a statement, Nankana police said that the incident took place in Sangla Hill and that two people were killed and one was injured; the latter was moved to the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad.
“As soon as the incident was reported, Nankana DPO (District Police Officer) Faraz Ahmed reached the spot,” the statement read, quoting a police spokesperson. “The scene of the incident was inspected, and orders were issued for the immediate arrest of the suspects involved.”
The statement added that the DPO visited the victims’ families and vowed that the suspects would “be arrested and brought to justice as per the law”.
Later, another statement from Nankana Police confirmed that following an operation in Sangla Hill, two of the suspects were arrested.
“A successful police operation was carried out under the leadership of DPO Faraz Ahmed,” the second statement read. “Two suspects involved in the incident were arrested, and further action is underway.”
A first information report (FIR) was filed on September 7 against four nominated suspects and two unidentified assailants under Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (murder) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code. A copy is available with Dawn.com.
The complainant, who was at the scene, alleged in the FIR that the suspects approached his sons’ fruit carts on Sunday evening to buy some fruit. The vendors refused to sell, claiming that the suspects would not pay for the items. This dispute escalated, with the suspects allegedly abusing the fruit vendors.
“The suspects drew their weapons and shot one of my sons in the hand and the left side of his chest,” the complainant alleged. “His brother was shot twice in the chest, while my third son was shot once in the arm and three times in the stomach.”
According to the FIR, the complainant and other people tried to transport the victims to THQ Hospital in Sangla Hill, but one of the deceased succumbed to his wounds on the way, while the other was pronounced dead upon arrival.
The third victim was in critical condition, so he was referred to Allied Hospital in Faisalabad for treatment.

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the “heinous” attack on the police station in Balcova, a district just west of the resort city, left two officers dead and a third “seriously injured”.
“The suspect in the incident, 16-year-old E.B., has been arrested and an investigation has been opened,” he wrote on X.
 






It was not immediately clear why the station was attacked, but footage posted by the Gercek Gundem news website showed mobile phone footage of a person in a balaclava, a black top and pale trousers jogging along the pavement carrying a rifle, then entering a building.
Another clip broadcast by Turkish TV stations showed a group of civilians helping to manhandle the alleged attacker, wearing white trousers, into a police van.
The DHA news agency said the assailant had used “a long-barrelled gun” while NTV television described the weapon as a “pump-action shotgun”.
Police immediately fanned out across the area, imposing tight security measures, media reports said.
Izmir Mayor Cemil Tugay denounced a “treacherous” attack and sent his condolences to the families of the dead in a post on X.

While issuing a severe weather warning, the PMD highlighted the likelihood of torrential rains, gusty winds and possible urban flooding across Karachi and other parts of Sindh.
“Thunderstorm and rains are expected tomorrow [Monday] in Karachi with possibility of heavy falls,” said PMD’s focal person Anjum Nazeer Zaigham.
An advisory issued by the PMD stated that a depression over southwest Rajasthan and adjoining Guajrat has intensified further into a deep depression. “It is very likely to move westward and entered in southeastern Sindh during the next 24 hours causing widespread rains with strong winds.”
During the day, Karachi experienced overcast and humid conditions, with dense cloud cover persisting throughout. Light rain was also reported in the outskirts of the city.
The maximum temperature in the city was 32.6 degrees Celsius with 75 per cent humidity, increasing the discomfort for residents even before the anticipated downpour.
The Met office has warned that thundershowers with strong gusty winds and scattered “heavy to very heavy falls” are likely in Karachi Division, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal, Dadu, and Mirpurkhas until September 10.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari has called on all institutions to remain fully prepared in view of the heavy rains in Sindh.
He directed provincial, district and municipal authorities to stay on high alert and ensure advance arrangements. He also emphasised the need for close monitoring of water levels in Hub Dam and other reservoirs to safeguard communities.

“A very big issue now is the increasing paucity of female staff in these places,” Dr Mukta Sharma, the deputy representative of WHO’s Afghanistan office, told Reuters.
She estimated around 90 per cent of medical staff in the area were male, and the remaining 10pc were often midwives and nurses, rather than doctors, who could treat severe wounds.
This was hampering care as women were uncomfortable or afraid to interact with male staff and travel alone to receive care.
The September 1 magnitude-6 quake and its aftershocks injured more than 3,600 people and left thousands homeless in a country already dealing with severe aid cuts and a slew of humanitarian crises since the Taliban took over in 2021 as foreign forces left.
The Afghan health ministry and a spokesperson for the Taliban administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Taliban say they respect women’s rights in line with their interpretation of Islamic law and have previously said they would ensure women could receive aid. Its administration in 2022 ordered Afghan female NGO staff to stop working outside the home.
 
 

Humanitarian officials say there have been exemptions, particularly in the health and education sectors, but many said these were patchwork and not sufficient to allow a surge of female staff, particularly in an emergency situation that required travel.
That meant aid organisations and female staff faced uncertainty, Sharma said, and in some cases were not able to take the risk.
“The restrictions are huge, the mahram (male guardian requirements) issue continues and no formal exemption has been provided by the de facto authorities,” she said, adding her team had raised the issue with authorities last week.
“That’s why we felt we had to advocate with [authorities] to say, this is the time you really need to have more female health workers present, let us bring them in, and let us search from other places where they’re available.”
Sharma said she was extremely concerned about women in the future being able to access mental health care to deal with trauma as well as for those whose male family members had been killed, leaving them to navigate restrictions on women without a male guardian.
Peer Gul from Somai district in Kunar province, which was severely hit by the quakes, said many women from his village had experienced trauma and high blood pressure after the earthquake and were struggling to reach medical care.
“There is no female doctor for examinations; only one male doctor is available,” he said.
Sharma noted the growing shortage of Afghan female doctors as the Taliban have barred female students from high school and university, meaning a pipeline of women doctors was not being replenished.
The United Nations estimates around 11,600 pregnant women were also impacted by the quakes in a country with some of the highest maternal mortality rates in Asia.
Funding cuts, including by the US administration this year, had already left the health system reeling. Around 80 health facilities had already closed in the affected areas this year due to US aid cuts and another 16 health posts had to be shuttered due to damage from the earthquake, Sharma said.</p><small>2025-09-08 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622528-judicial-policymaking-panel-to-review-missing-persons-key-issues-on-oct-17-cjp' target='_blank'><strong>Judicial policymaking panel to review missing persons, other key cases on October 17: CJP</strong></a><br><p>

For people who had grown up with the river as playground, lifeline, and legend, its sudden return was less catastrophe than reunion, a reminder that Lahore’s history is inseparable from the waters that once defined it.
Rooted in myths, epics and legends
From its earliest myths, Lahore has been inseparable from the Ravi. The river doesn’t just flow past the city — it flows through its memory and identity.
Foundational folklore locates the city’s origins in Lava or Loh, son of Rama and Sita, casting the river as both guardian and witness, flowing by the fort’s walls. In fact, Ravi’s banks were the stage for one of the earliest remembered battles: the Dasarajna, or Battle of Ten Kings.
 
 

In an archival compilation on Lahore’s antiquities, the Deshwa Bhaga — a traditional account naming Lahore as Lavpor or ‘City of Lava’ — reportedly speaks of a duel between the Raja of Lahore [ruler of the ancient Hindu principality of Lahore before its conquest] and the Pandava Bhim [a central heroic figure in the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata] at a forest by the Ravi’s edge. Punjabi ballads, too, place Lahore’s jungles, then called Udinagar, as the site where folk-hero Raja Rasalu slew a man-eating rakshas, casting the Ravi as a theatre of defiance and courage.
Together, these texts and oral traditions present Lahore not as a city beside a river but as a city forged through it: a civic identity built on epic landscapes of struggle and survival.
According to an article in Dawn, the Ravi, known in the Vedas [a body of religious scriptures originating in India] as Iravati, was part of Saptasindu, the land of seven rivers that defined the earliest cultural imagination of Punjab. The same piece recalls how the Battle of the Ten Kings, one of the most celebrated episodes of the Rig Veda (an ancient Sanskrit collection of hymns), was fought “on the banks of the River Ravi surrounding Lahore.” In that clash, King Bharata’s tribe defeated a powerful confederation of rulers.
Thus, from the very outset of South Asia’s mythic consciousness, Lahore and the Ravi are intertwined: the city emerges not just as a settlement on water but as a battlefield, a site of identity forged through conflict and survival.
This cultural symbolism extended into Lahore’s religious imagination. The 16th-century mystic Shah Hussain, better known as Madho Lal Hussain, was first buried on the Ravi’s bank. When the river flooded, his grave was swept to higher ground near Shalimar, far from the current river course, an act his devotees interpreted as the Ravi’s own homage, carrying its lover to safety. Lahore’s famous Mela Chiraghan (‘Festival of Lights’) grew up around this shrine, once involving lamps floated on the Ravi’s waters in his memory. Through this story, the Ravi itself becomes a character in Lahore’s Sufi history — a vehicle of divine will and protector of saints.
In Sikh tradition, Ravi and Lahore are immortalised as a site of martyrdom and faith. It was along the fort’s Ravi-wall in 1606 that the 5th Sikh Guru, Arjan Dev, met his end.  Sikh scriptures recount that after days of torture in Lahore, Guru Arjan was permitted to bathe in the Ravi, which then flowed just outside the city walls. According to legend, Guru Arjan’s soul merged with the Ravi’s waters — a serene acceptance of God’s will.
This poignant event is commemorated at Gurdwara Dera Sahib in Lahore (on the old Ravi bank), and the river itself is revered as a witness to the Guru’s sacrifice.
These are not idle fictions, rather collective myths: narratives through which communities stabilise identity and transmit values across generations. For Lahoris, the Ravi functioned as a symbolic reservoir, embodying both beauty and defiance, and each retelling on the bridges or in the gardens reinforced their social frameworks of memory. In this way, folklore was less about individual imagination and more about a shared cultural memory that allowed the city to see itself reflected in the river, century after century.
That inheritance began to fade as the river itself receded. By the late 20th century, upstream diversions and unchecked pollution left the Ravi a blackened trickle. Experts noted a 36pc decline in annual flow and more than 40pc in summer months, transforming what was once a gold-bearing artery of Punjab into an open sewer.
For Lahoris, the sight of a dry bed beneath the bridges was more than ecological loss; it was cultural bereavement. A city once defined by its river was left with nothing but dust and memory.
 
 

The reunion of August 2025
This August, unprecedented monsoon rains and dam releases forced the Ravi back into Lahore. Alongside the Sutlej and Chenab, it produced one of the largest floods in Punjab’s history, displacing over two million people. Yet amid danger, Lahoris flocked to the bridges not in fear but in awe. Families gathered to watch the river swell, stretched their hands towards the water, and the two long-lost lovers had met again.
So what does it mean when a community celebrates the very flood that endangers it? The answer lies not in irrationality but in collective memory.
In Lahore, the Ravi has long functioned as what sociologist Maurice Halbwachs might call a “social framework of memory” — a living symbol through which people situate themselves in history and culture. The river is not merely water; it is a repository of myth, identity, and continuity. Its disappearance hollowed out not only Lahore’s landscape but also its cultural self-understanding. Its sudden return, how ever destructive, activated what French historian Pierre Nora describes as a lieu de mémoire: a site where memory condenses, reviving an ancient rhythm in the civic imagination.
Yet nostalgia must be distinguished from material conditions. The flood did not simply return romance to the city; it also exposed the structural vulnerabilities of Lahore’s urban planning, the weakness of its embankments, and the absence of a coherent ecological strategy. Schemes like the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project as well as the myriad of other real estate projects dotting the riverbanks are framed as progress, but without critical attention to ecology and equity, they risk repeating the very extractive logic that once killed the river.
The paradox
When Lahore expanded toward the Ravi, it wasn’t simply a cartographic shift; it was an urban philosophy that treated a living floodplain as a real estate frontier. For some Lahoris, this August’s flood was a moment of dread as their homes swept away, their lives upended. For others, it was a bittersweet reunion with a river they had long cherished as memory. Yet what returned was not nostalgia alone but the Ravi itself, in its own course, at its own speed, with the force of disaster. And the truth that must be faced is this: it is not only the river that has returned to its place, but human construction that has trespassed into it now stands exposed and precariously at risk.
Entire swathes of land, formerly declared “prone to floods” by the Punjab Irrigation Department are now filled with private housing schemes, many of which have seen considerable damage in the recent floods. Supported by regulators applying rules unevenly and even approving projects inside the flood-influence zone, many of these housing schemes are located in the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project. The irony here is that the “river training works” and construction of flood protection embankments, which were supposed to be carried out by the Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda), lagged far behind in approvals.
Moreover, the Human Rights Watch too reported that the scheme spans over 100,000 acres, with around 85pc of the land under cultivation before its acquisition. At the time, the HRW documented how farmers were pressured off their land even as environmental groups warned of the risks posed by the channelisation and paving of the floodplain.
Together, these findings expose how Lahore’s expansion into the Ravi was less development than denial; a refusal to respect the ecological logic of the river, and a gamble that was always going to end up in catastrophe.
Today, the river’s return denotes the paradox of affective attachment in contexts of risk: people are drawn to it because it anchors identity, even as it threatens material survival. Lahoris are interpreting the river both as symbol of who they are and as hazard to what they have built.

According to the ‘Global Islamic Fintech Report 2024-25’, the sector, with 490 fintech firms, was valued at $161 billion in 2023-24 and is projected to more than double to $306bn by 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6 per cent. This outpaces conventional fintech growth (11pc), underscoring the sector’s dynamism and investor appeal.
Islamic fintech refers to the use of financial technology solutions specifically designed to comply with the principles of Islamic finance. In simple terms, it is the intersection of technology, innovation, and Islamic finance — creating digital financial products and services that avoid interest (riba), excessive uncertainty (gharar), and prohibited activities (such as gambling), while promoting ethical finance, transparency, and risk-sharing.
Several global trends are shaping the future of Islamic fintech, including digital Islamic banks and alternative finance platforms, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven applications, digital credit scoring and assessments, blockchain and asset tokenisation, smart payment solutions, and central bank digital currencies.
Islamic digital banks and fintech firms are challenging traditional norms. Players like AEON Bank (Malaysia) and STC Bank (Saudi Arabia) are redefining retail banking for younger, tech-savvy customers. By combining real-time analytics, tailored offerings, and instant compliance monitoring, they illustrate the future of Shariah-compliant banking.

As Islamic fintech gains momentum globally, Pakistan presents the ideal environment for growth if forward-looking policies are implemented

Artificial intelligence is increasingly integral to Islamic fintech. AI systems can now automate Shariah compliance audits, improve credit risk assessment, detect fraud, and deliver personalised investment advisory services. These applications help build consumer trust and expand financial access to underbanked populations.
Blockchain-based applications are also transforming Islamic capital markets. Digital sukuk pilots in Russia and Nigeria have demonstrated how distributed ledger technology reduces settlement costs and improves transparency. In Malaysia, tokenisation platforms such as Kapital DX are opening new investment opportunities by enabling retail investors to access Shariah-compliant assets such as healthcare and infrastructure projects.
 
 

Countries including Iran and Pakistan are exploring legislation or pilots for Shariah-compliant central bank digital currencies and virtual assets. These digital currencies can ensure asset-backed stability and enhance cross-border remittances — critical for remittance-dependent Muslim economies.
With growing investor appetite, venture capital is increasingly flowing into Islamic fintech. For example, Saudi Arabia’s Arbah Capital, alongside international partners, has invested nearly $40 million in early-stage fintech firms. Similar momentum is visible in Egypt, Malaysia, and across the Middle East and North Africa, reflecting investor confidence in the sector’s scalability and profitability.
On the domestic front, Pakistan has made significant progress, ranking among the Top 10 Islamic fintech hubs for the first time in the 2024-25 Global Islamic Fintech Index. This achievement reflects improvements in regulation, ecosystem readiness, and talent availability. Although smaller in absolute size, Pakistan’s fintech market holds enormous growth potential given its demographics: a large Muslim population, low financial inclusion, and rapid digital adoption.
According to the ‘Global Islamic Fintech Report’, Pakistan hosts 19 Islamic fintech firms, spanning digital wallets, small and medium enterprise (SME) financing, earned-wage access, credit scoring, and wealth management, thereby addressing diverse needs of underserved segments. The ecosystem is buoyed by a young, digitally active population. With over 200m mobile connections and rising smartphone penetration, Pakistan offers fertile ground for fintech adoption. The expansion of e-commerce further fuels demand for Islamic wallets, gateways, and embedded finance platforms.
However, challenges persist for local fintech firms. These include limited access to venture funding, regulatory overlaps, low financial literacy, weak digital infrastructure in remote areas, high customer acquisition costs, and cybersecurity concerns that affect consumer trust.
Realising the full potential of Islamic fintech in Pakistan will require focused and coordinated policy measures, with the objective of establishing a comprehensive and resilient Islamic fintech ecosystem by December 2027 — the mandated deadline for transitioning to a fully Shariah-compliant financial system.
To promote Islamic fintech in Pakistan, regulators such as the State Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan should expand Shariah-compliant sandboxes, simplify licensing, and set clear rules for Islamic crowdfunding, peer-to-peer financing, and digital assets.
Access to capital must be enhanced through dedicated venture funds, tax incentives, and partnerships with Gulf Cooperation Council investors. Strong digital infrastructure — including broadband, open banking, and cybersecurity — is also vital for growth and trust. At the same time, nationwide financial literacy campaigns, supported by apps in Urdu and regional languages, can drive adoption.
Collaboration between fintechs, Islamic banks, and the government through innovation hubs, along with cross-border partnerships with Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will further strengthen Pakistan’s position. Developing skilled talent in fintech and Islamic finance, while expanding beyond payments into Zakat, Waqf, SME lending, wealth management, and tokenised Sukuk, will ensure a robust ecosystem.

The  High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules-2025 were passed at the recent full court meeting of the IHC by a narrow margin, with six of the 11 judges voting in favour.
Justice  Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar  Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz — the five senior judges who opposed the move and demanded certain amendments — would file their dissenting notes.
The newly promulgated rules substantially enhanced the authority of the chief justice, empowering him to nominate any judge to the powerful administration committee, while simultaneously eliminating the inclusion of the senior puisne judge as a de facto member of that body.

Dissenting notes ready to be filed after new rules divide judges

‘Misuse of powers’
A  day before the full court meeting, Justice Babar Sattar and Justice  Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan wrote a letter among their colleagues, expressing  grave concerns that administrative powers were allegedly being misused  to “sideline dissenting judges”. Later, they also objected to the way  the rules were presented at the meeting, complaining that “insufficient  time” had been provided for a proper review.
Also, according to  Justice Ejaz, the new Practice and Procedure Rules (PPR) were officially gazetted without meaningful debate or approval by the full court. He claimed the voluminous document — spanning more than 600 pages — was circulated only a day and a half before the meeting, thereby reducing consultation to a “mere formality and making substantive input impossible”.
A senior IHC official, however, disputed this claim,  insisting that every judge had been fully on board during the rule-making exercise. He cited an office order, dated June 12, 2019, and issued by then chief justice Athar Minallah, which constituted a committee to draft the rules in line with those of the Lahore High  Court. The committee included additional registrars Ijaz Ahmed and  Salamatullah.
Input of all judges sought
According to the official, the draft rules were duly circulated among all the judges,  months before the meeting was convened, and their input was solicited.  Apart from Justice Sattar, he said, no judge provided any suggestions.
However,  the recommendations submitted by Justice Sattar were rejected by the then chief justice on the grounds that they appeared tantamount to empowering judges with suo motu authority.
One of the dissenting judges, nonetheless, claimed that the version of the rules presented at  the full court meeting was “different from the one previously  circulated”.
Administration committee
Defending the changes, the official maintained that only minor alterations had been made. For instance, Rule 237 now provides that the administration committee, headed by the chief justice, shall ordinarily comprise three judges, though the chief justice may nominate additional members if deemed necessary. Likewise, Rule 239 now stipulates that each member of the administration committee shall serve as an administration judge,  with their powers and responsibilities to be defined by the chief justice from time to time.
Previously, the senior puisne judge automatically served as an administration judge, granting him significant authority over court affairs. Under the revised framework,  however, the chief justice has complete discretion to assign administrative functions, a change that effectively curtails Justice  Kayani’s role.
Justice Sattar and Justice Ejaz reportedly objected to the way case assignments were being structured, alleging that the  process was “manipulated to favour” judges transferred to the IHC along with the chief justice, while sidelining permanent judges who had opposed his transfer.
Special bench
They specifically referred to the formation of a special bench to address the backlog of tax cases. on which both dissenting judges were placed and assigned more than 200 tax references to be heard daily from 9am until the court’s rising.
Their pending cases were reassigned to other judges. The IHC official, on the other hand, rejected the objections, citing the LHC  practice where specialised benches are also assigned to senior judges.
Referring to the ‘Roster of Sitting’ at the LHC’s principal seat, he pointed out that Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh and Justice Javid Iqbal Wains sit on a bench for tax and commercial cases and hear such matters full-time from  Monday through Friday.

Across the capital, from upscale sectors to suburban communities, residents are hosting online Mahafil-i-Milad, streaming live naat sessions, and attending digital Seerat conferences.
Prominent platforms such as Zoom, Facebook Live, YouTube, and WhatsApp have become key tools for organising and participating in these spiritual events.
University students are actively conducting online naat competitions, Seerat quizzes, and live Q&A sessions with scholars — playing a proactive role in combining religious expression with modern technology.
Anam, a media student at International Islamic University Islamabad, said social media gave people the chance to make religious content more accessible, especially to younger audience.
Many mosques in Islamabad are also adapting the trend.
Some have launched daily live sessions covering Seeratun Nabi, while others have set up online donation channels to fund charitable activities during Rabiul Awwal.
Renowned Islamic scholars have taken to YouTube and Facebook to deliver special lectures, reaching thousands of viewers in real time.
Sadaf Sajid, a Qaria from Sector G-10, said Digital Milad is not a substitute but an extension of devotion.
“It allows people from different cities, even countries, to come together and celebrate the blessed month,” she said.
Joint online gatherings, where families from different cities and countries participate in collective recitations and prayers, are becoming increasingly popular.
Shireen, a resident of F-8, said her son was studying in the UK, and this was the second year they have included him in their family Milad via video call.
While physical celebrations — such as illuminating homes, distributing sweets, and attending mosque events — continue as per tradition, the rise of Digital Milad points to an evolving pattern of religious observance in Pakistan’s urban centres.

Police sources told Dawn that the transperson, who made a living by dancing at wedding functions, was at her home in Allama Iqbal Town, Maroot, on Sept 9 when two young men, residents of Chak 314-HR, reached there to invite her to dance at a wedding function.
Meanwhile, one youth forcibly raped the transgender person while the other kept watch. When people reached the spot after hearing the transperson’s screams, the duo took the victim’s wallet containing cash and documents and her mobile phone and fled.
A police spokesperson said the suspects had been arrested.
FRATRICIDE: A youth, along with his two cousins, was booked for shooting his elder brother to death over a domestic issue at Chishtian on Sunday.
The FIR registered with Saddar police stated that Ali Waqas, a resident of village Mari Shoq Shah, along with his cousins, Imtiaz and Qasim, argued with his elder brother, Zaffar Iqbal, over some domestic matter.
On Sept 6, Imtiaz and Qasim once again started arguing with Zafar. Meanwhile, Ali Waqas shot his brother with a rifle, killing him on the spot. Police said the main suspect had been arrested.

Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, former National Party senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai remained unhurt in the suicide attack as they had left the venue just a few minutes before the blast.

Traders, transporters, and businesses pledge support to opposition alliance

Leaders of six opposition parties — Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Tehreek Tahaffuz-i-Aain-i-Pakistan, Awami National Party (ANP), Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, and National Party — strongly condemned the tragic incident in a meeting and announced a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike throughout the province.
They declared that during the strike highways, intercity roads, and routes leading to Quetta airport and railway station would be blocked. Other airports in the province would also be shut, with no air travel allowed.
 
 

Opposition leaders and their supporters also distributed pamphlets about the strike among traders, business centres, hotels, and the general public. They urged the business community and transporters to support the strike.
Trader organisations and transporters had already expressed their support for the strike call. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry, along with other business associations, also announced closure of businesses across the province in solidarity with the victims of the suicide bombing.
Though the government has not announced the closure of its educational institutions today, the Private Schools Association declared that all private schools, colleges, and universities would remain closed.

The 22-year-old Alcaraz won 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to capture his second US Open crown and sixth Grand Slam title, avenging his lone defeat in a major final by Sinner at Wimbledon in July.
“It’s a great feeling. I’m working really hard just to lift this trophy. It’s my second one but it’s still a dream come true,” said Alcaraz.
Alcaraz will reclaim the world number one ranking from Sinner, returning to top spot on Monday for the first time since September 2023 after ending the Italian’s 27-match winning run at hard-court Grand Slams.
 


“It was one of the first goals that I had, to recover the number one (ranking),” said Alcaraz, who also defeated Sinner in an epic French Open final in June.
Alcaraz has now won seven of the past eight meetings and is 10-5 overall against Sinner.
“I tried my best today. I couldn’t do more,” said Sinner. “I felt like he was doing everything slightly better today.
“He raised his level when he had to … He played better than me today.”
Alcaraz and Sinner have shared the last eight Grand Slams on offer, winning four apiece to assert their superiority over the rest of the sport, including Novak Djokovic.
But while Sinner is 109-4 against the rest of the tour over the past two seasons, Alcaraz has had his number.
“It’s going to be on me if I want to make changes or not,” said Sinner. “That’s what I have to do, trying to become a better tennis player.”
 


Sinner’s defeat at Flushing Meadows extends the longest drought without a successful men’s title defence of any Grand Slam in the Open era.
No man has retained the US Open crown since Roger Federer won five in a row from 2004 to 2008.
Anticipation for the third straight Grand Slam final between the game’s top two players assumed an even greater dimension with the presence of Trump.
It was the latest in a series of visits to major sporting events for the US leader after his trip to the NFL’s Super Bowl in February and the FIFA Club World Cup final in July.
 


He appeared before the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, waving to the crowd, which greeted him with a mix of cheers and boos. He was given a frostier reception later in the match though, when shown again on the stadium’s big screens.
A constellation of showbiz and sports icons turned out as well on Sunday, with rock star Bruce Springsteen, fashion icon Tommy Hilfiger, actor Michael Douglas and basketball superstar Stephen Curry all on hand.
 






Start delayed by Trump visit
The start of the final was pushed back 30 minutes to allow fans additional time to enter Arthur Ashe Stadium as a result of tighter security measures in effect due to Trump’s attendance.
Even then, the 23,000-capacity venue was no more than three-quarters full when Alcaraz broke Sinner in the opening game of the match.
As he did in the Wimbledon final, Alcaraz pinned Sinner on the back foot early and broke a second time for a 5-2 lead before serving out to love.
With hundreds of spectators still waiting to get in at the start of the second set, Alcaraz sought to hammer home his advantage against Sinner.
He created a break point but Sinner hung on and stalled Alcaraz’s momentum, belatedly ramping up his game and surging 3-1 ahead as the Spaniard suffered a brief dip on serve.

Sinner levelled the contest at a set apiece but Alcaraz stormed back with another break early in the third, wriggling out of a tight spot on serve with the help of a sensational baseline smash that sliced away from his rival for a 3-0 edge.
He padded his lead with another break and quickly wrapped up the set, keeping his foot down to corner Sinner again to begin the fourth set.
This time Sinner saved two break points but Alcaraz made another charge in the fifth game, delivering the decisive blow for an advantage he never relinquished as the Spaniard became only the fourth man to win multiple majors on hard courts, grass and clay.</p><small>2025-09-08 05:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/080803035703fb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940394/pakistan-to-have-cancer-registry-national-institutes-of-health-bill-signed' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to have cancer registry; National Institutes of Health bill signed</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a bid to reform the health sector, President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday appro­ved the National Institutes of Health (Reorganisation) Amendment Bill 2025, which aims to reorganise the institution and also set up a cancer database.
The president also approved the Anti-Dumping Duties Amend­ment Bill 2025 for legal clarity regarding the imposition of anti-dumping duties on projects funded by Chinese grants.
The National Assembly passed the NIH bill on August 12, 2025. “There is a dire need for establishing the national cancer registry to understand the actual burden of disease, and to implement a nati­onal action plan for cancer prevention, and management strategies to control the growing epidemic,” according to the bill.
“Through this bill, the structure and governance of the National Institute of Health will be made more effective. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the reorganisation of the institution and enhance its performance,” the President Secretariat’s press wing said in a press release. It said that the approval of the bill marked a significant step toward reforms in the health sector and institutional improvement.
The NIH bill said that the centre “shall assure the registration of cancer patients in central repository” to understand the actual burden of disease and to implement a national action plan for its prevention.
It also envisaged management strategies to control the growing epidemic, collect data on the cancer cases and establish a database of the cancer pat­ients.
Through this bill, the government also aimed to encourage awareness at the village and union council level and to work with other governmental and non-governmental agencies whose goal was the eradication of cancer.
It said the center would register the cancer cases under the ‘confirmed cancer cases’, ‘deaths due to cancer’, ‘recoveries from cancer’, ‘hospitalised pendency of cancer’, and cancer demographic information (age, gender, location).
 
 

As per the bill, the personal particulars of a cancer patient would not be disclosed to any unauthorised person without the prior written consent of the patient.
The bill said the cancer cases were rising globally at a remarkable rate. According to the Global Cancer Observatory, the total number of cases in Pakistan was 178,388 in 2020; and these figures were provided by the Punjab Cancer Registry, which represented the population of Lahore and some parts of central Punjab.
“Considering the overall 220 million population, these figures are severe underestimation of the true cancer burden in Pakistan,” the bill added. It said that several atte­mpts at establishing a national cancer registry in the country had failed in the past due to resource limitations.
Anti-dumping duties bill
President Asif Ali Zardari has approved the Anti-Dumping Duties Amendment Bill 2025. “Following his approval, the duties will be effective from July 1, 2020. The bill was sent to the President after (it was) adopted by the National Assembly and (the) Senate,” the President Secretariat’s media wing said.
 
 

It said that the bill was approved to provide legal clarity regarding the imposition of anti-dumping duties on projects, funded by China.
The decision for this amendment was made during the progress review meeting of the Gwadar projects in October 2022.

“Following the interior minister’s directives, the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency has constituted a special inves­tigation team to probe into the matter and submit its report within 14 days,” says an official press rel­ease issued by the Interior Ministry here on Sunday.
It said the team will thoroughly examine the circumstances and those involved in the data leakage will be identified and brought to justice through legal action.
Media reports say that data of all SIM holders, including Interior Minister Naqvi, was sold at Google.
They further said that information regarding mobile location was being sold for Rs500, mobile data record for Rs2,000 and details of foreign trips for Rs5,000.
A couple of months ago, the National Cyber Emer­gency Response Team of Pakistan (PKCERT) iss­ued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan have been stolen in a global data breach, urging people to take immediate protective measures. Media reports said PKCERT had identified the global breach involving a publicly accessible, unencrypted file containing more than 184 million unique account credentials.
“The breach exposed user names, passwords, emails and associated URLs tied to major social media services, as well as government portals, banking institutions, and healthcare platforms worldwide,” the reports said quoting the PKCERT’s advisory.
“The leaked database is believed to have been compiled using infostealer malware — malicious software that extracts sensitive information from compromised systems,” it added.  “This data was stored in plain text and left completely unprotected, without encryption or password safeguarding.”
PKCERT is a federal government entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information, and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage.
It outlined the potential impacts of the data breach, warning that the stolen credentials could be used for account takeovers, identity theft and unauthorised access to government portals or other sensitive sites.
The advisory highlighted that the publicly hosted database was storing credentials stolen from “infected endpoints” without any form of authentication or protection and “included sensitive login information for major platforms, enterprises, government agencies, and financial institutions”.
“Attackers may exploit this breach through credential stuffing across services with reused passwords; phishing attacks using associated emails and historical data; targeted social engineering leveraging exposed personal content; unauthorised acc­ess to business and gove­rnment accounts; and malware deployment using credentials,” the advisory warned.
The advisory also recommended that people change their passwords annually and use a credible online service to find out about potential breaches.
In March 2024, a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) formed to probe a data leak from the National Database and Registr­ation Authority (Nadra), told the interior ministry that the credentials of as many as 2.7 million people had been compromised between 2019 and 2023.

Besides CM Khan, members of GB Legislative Assembly Surayya Zaman, Shamsul Haq Lone, Raja Nasir Khan Maqpoon, Raja Azam Khan Amacha, Syed Amjad Zaidi, Mushtaq Ahmad, Haji Shah Baig, Dilshad Bano, Abdul Hameed and Fazal Rahim were given formal termination notices, all containing identical wording.
“This letter serves as formal notice of termination of your membership, effective immediately. This decision has been made in accordance with party’s policy and procedures. The reason for this termination is your actions in the GB Assembly, specifically making a forward bloc and voting against the party decision, which is a clear violation of our party’s policy.
“Your actions have caused harm to the party’s interests and reputation,” stated the letters issued by Additional Secretary General of PTI Firdous Shamim Naqvi.

Party announces complete support for strike in Balochistan against lawlessness

All the 11 lawmakers were directed to “refrain from using party’s [PTI] name, designation and/or membership in any manner or whatsoever, failing which the party reserves to take action against you which may also lead to legal action,” the letters stated.
However, according to a party insider, the issuance of letters may not make any difference to them, as the “whole system” was allegedly backing them.
Also, the PTI issued a show-cause notice to former GB governor Raja Jalal Hussain Maqpoon, according to Dawn.com. The notice, dated Sept 5, said it had come to PTI’s notice that Mr Maqpoon had “conspired against the party and approached party members for defection”.
“In view of these reported activities, you are hereby called to explain yourself in writing within two days of this notice. If your reply is unsatisfactory or you do not respond, further action will be taken as per party policy and rules,” it added.
Backs strike in Balochistan
Meanwhile, acting on the direction of PTI founder Imran Khan, the PTI announced complete support for the wheel-jam and shutter-down strike in Balochistan on Monday against escalating lawlessness, rising terrorism, and the government’s failure to protect citizens.
The call for province-wide strike was given by a six-party opposition alliance comprising Balo­chistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), Pasht­unkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Awami National Party (ANP), National Party (NP), and Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen (MWM).
A statement from PTI’s central media department explained that the coalition had announced the joint protest against the recent attack at Shahwani Stadium on BNP-M rally, which claimed several precious lives and left many others injured. It emphasised that the strike was intended not only to mourn the victims of the tragedy but also to expose the government’s abject failure to provide security to its citizens.
The PTI warned that militancy and extremism were witnessing an alarming resurgence in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and other parts of the country due to government’s policies and priorities.
“PTI strongly believes that the people’s voice cannot be suppressed by terrorism, state oppression, or the use of coercive force. Our democratic struggle for peace, justice, and fundamental rights will not only continue but will be pursued with renewed determination and even greater resolve,” it stated.
On the other side, the PTI extended felicitations to the nation on Pakistan Air Force Day. It stated, “September 7 stands as a symbol of the unmatched bravery, sacrifice, and valour demonstrated by the Pakistan Air Force in the defence of our homeland.
On this day, we pay tribute to the martyrs who laid down their lives to safeguard the nation’s sovereignty.”

The practice now covers a wide range of animals, from dogs and cats to turtles, parrots and even goldfish.
Rising demand has invigorated the industry, drawing in new providers and expanding available services. Yet calls for better accessibility remain strong, as many owners still struggle to find nearby facilities to bid farewell to their closest companions.
A study by the KB Financial Research Institute in June found that 64.6pc of Ko­­reans who had lost pets held a funeral — either through a funeral home or a veterinarian — up sharply from 38.7pc in 2023.
The share opting for cremation, which costs at least 150,000 won ($108) and is pricier than veterinary disposal, also rose from 29.5pc to 49.5pc. The surge is partly explained by legal restrictions.
Under Korean law, animal bodies are classified as waste, which makes unauthorised burials illegal. For those who do not choose a funeral, the only legal option is to dispose of the remains in a designated garbage bag, an idea that many pet owners find unthinkable. To some, the emotional relief that funerals provide is a stronger reason.
“Of course, there were no other legal options. But a much bigger reason was that I could be with her sincerely until the very end, even if it meant spending hundreds of thousands of won,” Kim said. “The feeling of ‘this is really our fa­­r­ewell’ gave me a chance to settle my heart.”
Lee Woong-jong, an animal welfare professor at Yonam College, noted that the rise in pet funerals reflects a shift in public perception in Korea, as pets in the past were often treated like “toys.”
“For current Koreans, pets carry deep meaning. Losing them can cause serious emotional distress, sometimes leading to what is known as pet loss syndrome. Funerals help families bring a beautiful closure to their bond with their pets.”
