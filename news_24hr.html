MUZAFFARABAD/GILGIT: At least five pe­ople were killed in Azad Jammu and Kash­mir on Monday in different rain-related incidents as monsoon-induced floods ravaged multiple areas in the Ghizer district of Gilgit-Bal­tis­­tan, blocking roads and destroying infrastructure.
In Neelum Valley, a vehicle with tourists on board skidded off the “slippery road” and plummeted almost 250 feet down the ravine. Three people were killed on the spot, while the fourth succumbed to his injuries on the way to the hospital.
Neelum Deputy Commissioner Nadeem Ahmed Janjua said a Karachi-based couple along with their two-year-old daughter — who survived the accident — and a helper were coming back from Taobutt when they met the accident near Shundaas.
As a result, Zeeshan Shahid, 38, his wife Anmol Haroon, 32, driver Farooq, 35, and helper Atif died. The couple had travelled to Kel in their car but had rented the jeep for their trip to Taobutt. District Disaster Management Officer Akhtar Ayoub told Dawn that the couple’s funerals had been held and their bodies as well as the child and the car were being sent to Islamabad to be handed over to the family members, arriving there from Karachi.
University teacher swept away
In another incident, a faculty member at the University of Poonch, Dr Gul-i-Lala, 32, was swept away after she tried to cross a swollen stream in her Suzuki Cultus.
According to Registrar Dr Abdul Rauf, Dr Lala had left the Shamsabad campus after delivering a one-hour lecture in the morning and was heading home via Hajira Road.
Eyewitnesses said she was advised to turn back because a torrent was flowing across the road, whereupon she opted for an alternative route on the outskirts of Rawalakot. However, while attempting to cross a culvert where water from an otherwise small stream was rushing over the road, the accident occurred.
Her vehicle, swept away by the water, was retrieved about a hundred feet down the stream, but she did not survive.
Meanwhile, Poonch DC Sardar Umar Farooq told Dawn that rescue teams also evacuated 18 female students from a hostel whose ground floor had been submerged. Five residents trapped in their homes along Hajira Road were also rescued.
In the same district, three men collecting firewood in Karmal village of Rajdhani were stranded on a dry patch in the middle of River Poonch. However, they were rescued.
A flash flood in a water channel in Dhaman Pakhonar village of Sudhnoti district washed away four houses, two suspension bridges, and one RCC bridge, said Deputy Com­­missioner Mumtaz Kazmi. There were no casualties as the residents had already vacated their homes, but they were unable to save their belongings, he added. The DC said the road le­­ading to the village had also been destroyed at several points, but machinery would be deployed to reopen it.
Flash floods in GB
As water shortages and electricity outages continued in Gilgit, Danyor, and other flood-hit areas, flash floods damaged infrastructure in Asumber, Hatoon, and Ishkoman valleys in Ghizer. According to the local administration, the Government Boys High School in Asumber was affected, while in Hatoon, the flood blocked the Ghizer River near the Hasis village. The flood damaged the Ishkoman Road at various places, while a house was affected in Dilnati Ponyal.
On the other hand, the increasing water level in the Ghizer River forced the residents living near its banks to move to safer areas.
The Ghizer-Chitral Road remained closed due to the flood in the Gulapur area. The residents and affected people in Daen village remained disconnected as the only bridge linking the area to the rest of the region was recently damaged. Similarly, the flood-affec­ted areas in Ghizer, Ghanche, Skardu, Astore, Hunza and Diamer remained marooned.
The Karakoram Highway (KKH) in Gulmit-Gojal in Hunza was opened to traffic, as was the Hoper Valley road in Nagar. The traffic on the Baltistan Highway and Naltar Highway remained suspended, but people managed to cross the blocked roads in cases of emergency.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said Ghizer was the most-affected district as the mountainous region faced one of the worst floods that had killed 39 people, including tourists, since July. These disasters have caused damage to the tune of Rs30 billion, he added.
“At least two dozen people have been injured so far; 35 small and large bridges have been washed away; a dozen mosques and ‘Jamaat Khanas’ have been damaged, and more than half a dozen buildings of educational institutions have been damaged,” he said. About 350 houses were completely destroyed and at least 600 houses had sustained partial damage, he added.

Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi presides over a meeting of the National Judicial Policy-Making Committee.—APP

• Sets strict timelines for resolution of different categories of land and family disputes
• Forms a commission to address delayed orders in commercial, revenue, and fiscal cases
• Urges a mechanism to produce detainees in disappearance cases within 24 hours
ISLAMABAD: The National Judicial Policy-Making Committee (NJPMC) on Monday specified strict and swift timelines for disposing of different categories of court cases across the country, especially land disputes, family matters and juvenile punishment cases.
The committee in its 54th meeting, chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi, categorised cases and approved certain timeframe for the disposal of each. “These timelines would be considered as one of the key performance indicators in judges’ performance evaluation and would be in-built at the Dashboard,” the committee said.
To decide declaratory suit (land disputes), a 24-month deadline has been fixed. Similarly, declaratory suit (inheritance disputes) and recovery suit (public revenue/money matters) will have to be decided in 12 months. For cases of specific performance (contract enforcement), an 18-month deadline has been set. A timeframe of six months has been fixed for injunction suit (land disputes), rent cases, family suit (dissolution/dower/maintenance/guardianship) and execution petitions of family court decree; while for succession cases (uncontested) a deadline of two months has been set.
Other cases along with their respective timeframe include: execution petitions on banking court decree, execution petitions on civil court decree and criminal trial (punishment up to seven years) in 12 months; execution petitions on rent matters in three months; criminal trial (juvenile offenders) and labour cases in six months; criminal trial (punishment above seven years) in 18 months; and criminal trial (murder) in 24 months.
The committee deliberated on key policy issues, reviewed implementation of decisions from its 53rd meeting, and unanimously reiterated its resolve to strengthen institutional capacity, accelerate access to justice and ensure efficient and effective justice delivery.
Committee constituted
On strengthening the commercial litigation framework (CLC), the committee appreciated substantial progress by the high courts, acknowledging the CLC initiative as a major step towards a robust and efficient commercial litigation framework.
To address protracted litigation and injunctive orders in commercial, revenue and fiscal cases, a committee under Justice Shafi Siddiqui was constituted to formulate recommendations. The committee will examine AGP’s suggestions regarding issues arising out of Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and place recommendations in the next meeting.
Also in the meeting, Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan assured the committee that a comprehensive mechanism on enforced disappearances for ensuring production of detained persons before the magistrate concerned within 24 hours would be presented at the next sitting.
Judicial independence
The NJPMC commended high courts for formulating SOPs and emphasised adding stage-wise timelines from complaint filing to final action. It decided that all instances of extraneous influence should be reported within 24 hours and action finalised within 14 days.
SOPs should provide immediate redress measures to safeguard the dignity of the complainant judge. A reporting mechanism to the CJP was desired for information and intervention where necessary. High courts will notify SOPs and share them with the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP).
On model criminal trial courts, the committee expressed appreciation for progress by SHC and PHC, noting the efforts would enhance access to justice and timely delivery.
Regarding institutionalisation of court-annexed mediation, the committee acknowledged progress by the high courts and underscored the importance of pre-trial mediation.
The AGP assured updates on legislative intervention at federal and provincial levels about mandatory pre-trial mediation in the next meeting.
Other reforms
Agenda items concerning performance evaluation, standardised recruitment, establishment of a District Judiciary Policy Forum (DJPF), parity in terms and conditions of service and access to international exposure opportunities were taken jointly.
The NJPMC unanimously decided to include the LHC chief justice in the committee formulating recommendations on these matters, to be finalised before the next meeting.
The committee expressed satisfaction with progress on the professional excellence index, recognising it as a vital instrument for promoting professional standards and strengthening justice system effectiveness.
It desired high courts to establish accessible, user-friendly public forums at both high court and district court levels for information provision and complaint redressal.
On model civil courts, while appreciating the LHC’s efforts, the forum decided high courts may pilot the initiative for the oldest civil cases in chronological order.
High courts may determine the number of model civil courts in each district, keeping in view the target caseload. District and sessions judges may assign such cases to model civil courts under a time-bound trial regime.
On jail reforms and a national prison policy, the committee resolved to share reports of provincial sub-committees and the prison reform action plan with high courts for input. A national prison policy will be formulated and placed before the next meeting.
The forum was further sensitised to key issues to foster awareness and coordinated efforts, including suspension of sentence pending appeal under Section 426 of CrPC and repatriation of judicial officers of special courts and tribunals.
The LHC CJ assured that biometric verification at the time of institution of cases would be implemented, with progress to be placed before the committee in the next meeting.
The next meeting has been set for Oct 17.
LJCP and AJDF meeting
Separately, the CJP also chaired the 45th meeting of the LJCP, reaffirming its commitment to an accessible and equitable justice system for all citizens and emphasising unwavering dedication to judicial excellence and a fair and just society in Pakistan.
The commission reviewed implementation of decisions from its 44th meeting, particularly progress by the advisory committee for law reforms comprising the law secretary and eminent lawyers. It acknowledged the need for reforms in family laws and the CrPC, 1898, and applauded the committee’s work, expressing hope that, in consultation with stakeholders, it will suggest viable recommendations to improve service delivery in family dispute and criminal matters.
The commission approved the annual accounts of the Access to Justice Development Fund (AJDF) for FY 2024-25.
For institutional development and to enhance LJCP performance, it constituted a committee to review LJCP Employees Service Rules of 1992 and suggest reforms to enhance administrative efficiency and enable performance management.
Meanwhile, the AJDF governing body thanked the federal government for a grant of Rs2billion.
The contribution will be utilised for advancing women-centric facilities in courts, solarisation of judicial complexes, provision of clean drinking water and establishment of e-libraries in courts across the country, with a special focus on underdeveloped and remote districts.
The forum verified annual accounts of the fund for 2024-25 and approved significant projects and allocations aimed at strengthening the justice sector by focusing on litigant facilities.
The governing body approved projects of the High Court of Sindh and High Court of Balochistan amounting to over Rs631million, emphasising women-centric facilities within court premises to provide a safe, accessible and inclusive environment for female litigants.
Approval was also granted for projects of the Sindh, Lahore, Balochistan and Peshawar high courts under the Underdeveloped Regions Window amounting to Rs317m, including solarisation of courts to ensure uninterrupted power and the establishment of modern e-libraries in remote and underdeveloped districts.
The governing body sanctioned various training programs for the federal and provincial judicial academies.

The Spanish second seed snapped the world number one’s 26-match winning streak on hardcourts when his ailing rival signalled he could no longer continue while trailing 5-0 in the first set of the final.
“This is not the way that I want to win trophies, I just have to say sorry, I can understand how you must feel now,” Alcaraz told Sinner during the presentation ceremony after capturing his third Masters 1000 crown of the season following his success in Monte Carlo and Rome.
“As I said many times, you are a true champion and I am sure from these situations, you are going to come back even stronger, as you always do. That’s what true champions do.”

Sinner had been bidding to become the first man since Roger Federer in 2015 to win back-to-back Cincinnati titles but he looked uncomfortable early on in the sweltering conditions.
He called it quits after 23 minutes of play.
“I’m super, super sorry to disappoint you,” Sinner told the crowd. “Yesterday I didn’t feel great. I thought that I would improve during the night, but it came up worse.

“I tried to come out, tried to make it at least a small match, but I couldn’t handle more, so I’m very sorry.”

It was also unclear whether the Italian would be fit enough to partner Katerina Siniakova in the revamped mixed doubles event at Flushing Meadows which is due to take place on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Singles action at the hardcourt major begins on Sunday.
Monday’s clash had been expected to be a dress-rehearsal ahead of a potential final showdown between the world’s two best players in New York, with the duo having faced off in the title match at the last two majors.
Alcaraz came from two sets down and saved three championship points to triumph at Roland Garros, while Sinner emerged victorious at Wimbledon.
Monday’s result extended Alcaraz’s head-to-head record over Sinner to 95, including a 62 edge on hardcourts.
Swiatek downs Paolini to claim first Cincinnati Open title
Later in the evening, Iga Swiatek captured her first Cincinnati Open title by beating Jasmine Paolini 7-5 6-4, with the Pole third seed sending a powerful message ahead of the US Open.
The six-times Grand Slam winner did not drop a set on her way to the title and was clinical in the final, converting all six of her break points to clinch her 11th WTA 1000 crown and first since last year’s Italian Open.
She is now the second all-time winner in the WTA 1000 format history, trailing only Serena Williams (23).
“I want to thank my team. I dont know why I won tournaments that were like the last ones in terms of where I thought I would be playing well,” Swiatek said.
“Thank you for forcing me to become a better player and learning how to play on these faster surfaces. I’m shocked and super happy.”

Paolini made the brighter start, surging to a 3-0 lead and pushing Swiatek to the brink of a double break. Yet the Pole responded with a five-game run and, after squandering her first chance to serve out the opening set, closed it on her second attempt.
Swiatek carried her momentum into the second set, saving two break points at 4-3 before holding firm to move within one game of the title. She sealed victory at the first opportunity with a big serve, extending her perfect record against the Italian to 60.
The win ensures Wimbledon champion Swiatek will climb back to world number two, securing the second seed for the final major of the year at Flushing Meadows, where singles action begins on Sunday.
Swiatek is also set to team up with Norway’s Casper Ruud in the new US Open mixed doubles event.</p><small>2025-08-19 04:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/19091717de9b223.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931813/rebutting-rumours' target='_blank'><strong>Rebutting rumours</strong></a><br><p>WHEN rumours first began circulating that a change was being considered in the top tier of the civilian component of the ruling set-up, both Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and military spokesman Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had issued statements rubbishing them.
That ought to have put such idle talk to rest, but it seems that neither Mr Naqvi nor the DG ISPR was to be believed on the matter. Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was expected to address the same question during his recent sojourn in Brussels, both during a public interaction and in an interview with a senior journalist.
Like the others, he, too, dismissed talk that the prime minister and president would be replaced as “completely false”. When told that “both civil and military agencies” had been sharing this ‘news’, the chief dismissed it as “not possible”, expressing suspicion that this may be the work of those who “oppose both the government and the authorities and wish to create political anarchy”.
It is hoped that the government at least is resting a little easier. It is unfortunate that the army chief himself was expected to step into this conversation, considering that he has far more important things to take care of.
It is also concerning that there are mischief-makers around who are trying to drive a wedge between the authorities and the government. The country has experienced enough political anarchy over the last few years, and the ruling arrangement formalised after the Feb 8, 2024, general election was expected to be the counterweight to it.
Whether these rumours started because of the civilian leaders’ inability, perceived or otherwise, to deliver on this ‘mandate’ or something completely different has been difficult to pin down, mainly because the alliance between the government and the ‘authorities’ has otherwise proved to be a match made in heaven.
Now that the army chief himself has made it clear that he is interested in nothing more than serving as Pakistan’s ‘protector’, perhaps the political leadership should shift its focus back to its job.
The country has been experiencing a rare period of stability, but what it will make of it remains a big question. Despite repeated promises that an economic breakthrough is just around the corner, Pakistan’s teeming millions have yet to see any significant improvement in their personal lives.
Prices may have largely stabilised, but the public will soon start asking why the benefits of the ‘economic turnaround’ that the government keeps talking about are not visible in their own lives as well.
It is these expectations that are, in fact, the government’s biggest challenge. It must find it within itself to inspire and lead the public and guide it to a more prosperous future.

The Indian idea was laudable, only the argument was a tad self-regarding. If the talks ended on a positive note, assorted Indian analysts reasoned, the impugned oil trade with Russia would no longer draw Trump’s ire. Putin would have saved the day for New Delhi.
On a wing and a prayer, the Modi foreign policy has bodily lifted its model from international sports contests where the ousted team pulls out its pocket calculators to desperately speculate its chance of returning to the contest should some other team beat another team. China is also affected by Trump’s frowning on its Russian oil imports. But the Communist Party-backed Global Times headline seemed in no tearing hurry to eye Beijing-centred success or failure in the otherwise important US-Russia talks. All the paper said was: “Trump and Putin addressed a joint press conference.”
And that is more or less what we know did happen. Much else is speculative. It is evident, Prime Minister Modi’s foreign policy prefers to ride piggyback on future outcomes over which it exerts no control. This is not how it used to be. A vital difference has emerged between then and now.
Indira Gandhi took Soviet help to bridge military and economic gaps. Yet she censured Moscow when the ally invaded Afghanistan. Nehru had the best of relations with Britain and even made India a member of the Commonwealth for which he was criticised roundly by his leftist supporters. Majrooh Sultanpuri found himself writing some memorable songs for the blockbuster movie Andaz from prison where he was sent for penning an acerbic poem against Nehru’s Commonwealth membership. But even as a member of the Commonwealth Nehru stoked the anti-colonial fervour in Asia and Africa, which won him lifelong friendships in the Global South.

Why is it so difficult to instil a simple, inexpensive idea for diplomacy?

Nehru supported the rise of China as a major post-colonial power but was misled by a combination of historians and cartographers into laying claim on tracts of Tibet that China had refused to accept during British rule. Nehru paid the price for his decision, until his grandson travelled to shake hands with Deng Xiaoping in a memorable move in 1988. Even Atal Bihari Vajpayee decided for better or worse to accept the heavy cost of declaring India a nuclear power even though he slipped up by explaining to Bill Clinton that the bomb was aimed at China. Everyone did what they deemed good for the country, which can’t be said of Narendra Modi. He has been doing whatever he could to appease the US until Trump poured cold water on the enthusiasm.
And yes, Indira Gandhi waged a decisive war on Pakistan but bore no ill will towards its people. She had a landmark meeting with Z.A. Bhutto in Shimla. Likewise, Rajiv Gandhi and Benazir Bhutto had a widely cheered rendezvous in Pakistan. Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh came close to resolving the Kashmir issue and, importantly, they did so with the help and support of their people, not of a foreign prompter. That’s what is missing in the pocket calculator diplomacy today, the engagement of the people on both sides of the equation, be it with Pakistan, or Bangladesh or Sri Lanka. India’s military has a problem with Pakistan’s military. But it’s Pakistan’s people that are known to have shown the door to many dictators, military or civilian. Modi has sidelined people on both sides. Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s daughters were denied visas for the first time in India’s history. Now, Modi has announced an iron dome-like project to protect the country from enemy attacks. Many see it as a wasteful idea given the hammering a heavily guarded Israel took from Iran recently.
Why is it so difficult to instil a simple, inexpensive idea for diplomacy? Why not let the masses — as opposed to state-backed mobs — take the initiative to build inevitable excellent ties, and see the menace called terrorism vanish in a jiffy?
Many current foreign policy preferences are, of course, rooted in Modi’s ideological pursuit of Hindutva. Or more accurately, it’s about marrying big business with Hindutva and passing it off as national interest. Of course, other than pervasive corruption, this has led to little else, as can be gleaned from the criminal cases in the US involving a major tycoon.
Bureaucracies, too, play a role in the wrack and ruin of India’s fair name. Inured to the social costs that state policies incur, they formulate or conjure ‘national interest’ from personal expediencies or biases, which currently seem to be heavily tilted towards the West. Much has been said about Modi’s Mittyesque media, which cut a sorry figure in the recent military engagement with Pakistan. But what does one make of respected current and former diplomats? One such served in Islamabad as high commissioner. In his view, in the absence of a decisive military victory, India should periodically “mow the grass” in Pakistan, a phrase used by Israel for periodically raiding Gaza and killing Palestinians before the events of October 2023. Mow the grass in nuclear Pakistan?
India has experienced many economic woes, mostly caused by oil price fluctuations. When the prices went through the roof in 1990, and the USSR had all but disappeared, the country pawned gold reserves to stave off defaulting. People accepted it. V.P. Singh was prime minister when the oil crisis began. He announced rationing on petrol. People understood. There were regulations about using cars. People took it in their stride. Something has changed today. It’s more about guarding the interests of this or that business house refining Russian oil to ship it off to Europe. From the dominant Indian perspective, the Alaska summit was about Russian oil, sadly, not about saving the world from nuclear annihilation.

They sit silently, their heads bowed, a small splash of colour against the grey concrete. With their old-fashioned hand fans, they occupy a sheet of plastic in the middle of the road.
The nearby green areas, which once allowed Pakistan to bring its problems to Islamabad by holding protests there, is closed to these women. The earth and grass are far too comfortable for them to be allowed there. They have to sit on the road, close to a busy commercial area, but away from the business in the area, as traffic barriers create a boundary, separating them from life in the capital. They have been here for a month but have not managed to disturb the life of the city or the government. How can they when even the doors of the washrooms of the press club close by are closed to them? Those who should be the flag-bearers of freedom of information are now a part of a system which bears down on citizens rather than standing up for the oppressed.
So it’s not just the washrooms but also coverage which is denied. These protesters are ignored, blacked out. There was a time, when such a gathering would have galvanised enough opinion to put any government on the back foot. Not anymore. The women’s steadfastness in this heat and in these circumstances moves no one. Perhaps partly because most people do not even know they are here and partly because this government has no space to even pretend to care about human rights.
The protest has been rendered invisible.
But then the political suffering of women has been normalised in the abnormal times we live in — the women in Islamabad who are not even allowed to sit on grass lest it prove too comfortable, or Mahrang Baloch who has been imprisoned with little chance of any relief in the near future. In Lahore, Yasmin Rashid has been behind bars for two years, with little concern for anyone outside of her party (which can barely do more than pay lip service to the matter). Her age moves no one; neither do the elderly women sitting on the road in this heat in a corner of Islamabad, carrying pictures of their missing loved ones in their heavily wrinkled hands. Their endless wait is for closure as well as some compassion from those in charge.

Ask the government about anything untoward and they simply shrug it off.

But suffering and lack of compassion have been normalised in the abnormal times we live in. As has been the indifference of political parties, which can no longer even pretend to care. Not even those who continue to bask in the glory of a woman who was once the lone symbol of suffering and the target of the powerful ones.
This is not all that has been normalised.
Consider journalism. Arrests, FIRs, disappearances — temporary and permanent — were part of what journalists signed up for. What it meant was that only the brave ones would continue down certain paths (most opened the door and walked through to the compound where awards adorn one’s resumé). But despite this, we have seen a fair share of brave souls who continued to face the dangers. Here too, though, there is an effort to remind them that this may not prove enough.
In recent times, at least two journalists have spoken about how the bank accounts of family and even acquaintances have been blocked. Parents, siblings and even vendors who made the mistake of selling to pesky journalists have been affected. The only recourse left to them were the courts, which, too, are now enveloping themselves in the mantle of indifference. But the message is that collective punishment is the fate of those who will not heed more specific messages about falling in line. Or that the element of surprise will always be their fate. When blocked bank accounts did not prove enough, one of them was stopped from flying out of the country recently. Since then, a PTI politician’s daughter has also found her way to the list. Her father is neither in power nor in parliament and is perhaps not in a position to make any decision but still had to be sent a message. And for this, a university student was stopped from leaving the country, putting her education at risk.
In all of these random, seemingly disconnected incidents, there is a commonality — no one can be asked about them or even shamed. The government has moved beyond this — ask them about anything untoward and they simply shrug it off. There must be a reason, a valid reason, is the only answer. If it’s a journalist, he or she must have done something wrong to attract the ‘long arm of the law’. And if there is a story involving a politician from the opposition, the easiest response is to either hint at the former’s non-patriotic credentials or feign ignorance and move on.
Indifference has been normalised in these abnormal times.
And while some of us do express horror, grief and shock, it amounts to little; the second such incident is taken in its stride. It has already happened to others and if the previous incident was accepted, so should the new one. The shock and horror turns into acceptance.
But then, these are abnormal times, we tell ourselves. And they might not last and neither will these stories. However, this provides little comfort for I can remember when we first began to hear of ‘missing people’; when stories about the missing were read avidly because it was so new. Or when suicide bombings first happened in Pakistan. Then the times changed, leaders changed but we learnt to live with the missing and the suicide bombers. Times don’t last necessarily but the abnormal soon becomes normal.

The 21-year-old Ashab, already a two-time title winner this year, recovered from losing the first game to secure victory 8-11, 11-2, 11-2, 11-6 in a 40-minute match.
As many as 20 players competed in the Professional Squash Association (PSA) Challenger Tour event, which offered a total prize purse of $12,000. Irfan entered the tournament as the second seed.

He was among seven Pakistani players participating, joining Mohammad Asim Khan, Mohammad Huzaifa Ibrahim, Fawad Khalil, Mohammad Samiullah, Ahsan Ayaz and Farhan Zaman.
Samiullah, Farhan, Fawad and Ahsan were all eliminated in the first round. Huzaifa progressed to the second round before losing to Brazil’s Diego Gobbi.
Top seed Asim Khan delivered strong performances throughout the tournament, advancing to the semi-finals. However, his run ended on Saturday with a 11-9, 4-11, 11-7, 11-9 defeat against Kueh.
Ashab, who won the South Australian Open and RC Pro Series titles earlier this year, reached the final by overcoming third-seeded Gobbi in a gripping 53-minute semi-final clash, winning 11-7, 14-12, 4-11, 11-5.
The competition featured players from Pakistan, Egypt, Malaysia, America, Colombia, Mexico, South Africa and Bermuda.
This victory adds to the successful year for Pakistani squash as Noor Zaman claimed the Under-23 World Squash Championship title in April.
Furthermore, Pakistan secured multiple titles at the Australian Junior Open the same month, with Azan Ali claiming the Under-17 crown and Ahmad Ali Naz triumphing in the Under-11 category.
The girls were also successful, as sisters Mehwish and Mahnoor Ali bagged the Under-17 and Under-13 titles, respectively.
Sohail Adnan also clinched two titles this year as he won the British Junior Open Under-13 title in January. The 12-year-old Sohail followed it up with another triumph in the Asian Junior Squash Championship in the same category in July.

In many areas, the familiar hum of late-night traffic and crowds spilling from bars and restaurants was replaced by the steady crunch of boots as National Guard troops and police patrolled shuttered storefronts and darkened sidewalks.
Nearly a week after President Donald Trump ordered troops into Washington, the city seems like its still in shock. Roadblocks, searches, and soldiers on city streets are unusual here. While some parts of the city have long struggled with violent crime, drug trafficking, prostitution, and murders, these problems had mostly been confined to poorer neighborhoods.
Recent incidents in middle- and upper-middle-class areas, however, caught the president’s attention, reminding him of his election promise to “cleanse” America’s major cities.
Some nights ago, at Logan Circle, Guardsmen stopped cars, demanded IDs, and questioned drivers. Pedestrians were pulled aside. From a nearby porch, a white-haired woman shouted, “Get off our streets!” while her younger neighbor yelled, “Democracy, not kingdom!”
 
 

In Dupont Circle, several hundred protesters marched with drums and bells, holding handmade signs reading “Trump Must Go Now” and “No ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)! No National Guard!”
One woman carrying a candle said, “I grew up in Poland. I know what it feels like when soldiers replace police. This is not America.” A young man filmed troops on his phone. “We record everything,” he said, “otherwise no one will believe this is happening in Washington, D.C.”
President Trump paints a starkly different picture. At a recent rally, he said Washington had become a haven for “violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals.” To respond, he sent hundreds of National Guard troops from Ohio, West Virginia, and South Carolina to assist local law enforcement — and sought broader authority over the city’s police operations.
Supporters describe this as decisive action to protect residents. Critics warn it undermines local governance and risks intimidating residents. In the United States, the National Guard is usually deployed for emergencies, such as natural disasters or civil unrest, not for routine policing —making this intervention highly unusual.
Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, has strongly challenged Trump’s depiction of the city. “Yes, we saw a spike in crime in 2023,” she said, “but it has since come down sharply. The president’s claims about rampant crime do not reflect the reality of our city.”
Police data supports her position: homicides dropped 32 per cent between 2023 and 2024, reaching the lowest level since 2019. Violent crime overall is down 26pc so far in 2025, while robberies have fallen 28pc.
Bowser has also made visible gestures in support of racial justice. In 2020, she had a section of 16th Street near the White House painted with “Black Lives Matter” and renamed it Black Lives Matter Plaza, but this was undone when President Trump took over.
Divided, but restless
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are split along predictable partisan lines. Republicans support Trump, arguing extraordinary times require extraordinary measures. Democrats accuse him of trampling the rights of DC residents, 92pc of whom voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.
Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) criticised the deployment as a “total abuse of power” and a “manufactured emergency.”
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a warning that, regardless of the uniform, federal and military officials are bound by the U.S. Constitution and local law.
Quoting a Wall Street Journal report, the ACLU noted that troops “may be allowed to start carrying weapons in the coming days,” and said: “Sending heavily armed federal agents and National Guard troops from hundreds of miles away into our nation’s capital is unnecessary, inflammatory, and puts people’s rights at high risk of being violated.”
Last week, the DC government sued the Trump administration to block its order asserting federal authority over the city’s police department, citing the Home Rule Act.
Later, the attorney general issued a revised directive that removed the provision giving federal authorities full control over the DC police, instead specifying certain “services” they could perform.
Meanwhile, the streets tell their own story. Residents are unsettled, some angry, others resigned. Candlelight vigils have appeared in neighborhoods from Columbia Heights to Capitol Hill. At one vigil, soft chants rose into the humid night air: “Free D.C.! Free D.C.!”
Local journalists who have covered Washington for decades have witnessed protests large and small — anti-war marches, immigration rallies, women’s rights demonstrations. The city has always carried tension, but even to them this feels different.

The deportees are part of a group previously offered refuge in Germany but now caught between Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s tougher immigration policy and a wave of expulsions from Pakistan.
Hinterseher told reporters that Pakistani police re­­cently arrested “around 450” Afghans who were pre­viously accepted under the German scheme for peo­ple at risk from the Taliban. Of those, “211 peo­ple, according to our current information, have been deported to Afgha­nistan,” he added.
Another “245 people were allowed to leave camps” in Pakistan where they had been gathered prior to their scheduled deportation, he said.
“We are continuing to talk to Pakistan to facilitate the return of those who have already been deported.”
 
 

Last week, two German rights groups launched legal proceedings against two German ministers, accusing them of “abandonment and failure to render assistance” to those hoping for German visas under the scheme.
Germany set up the programme under former chancellor Olaf Scholz in the wake of the Taliban’s 2021 takeover, to help Afghans who had worked with German institutions and their families.
It also included people deemed particularly threatened by the Taliban, including journalists and human rights activists.
However, the program­­me has been put on hold as part of a stricter immigration policy brought in un­­der Merz, who took office in May, leaving some 2,000 Afghans stranded in Pakistan waiting for German visas.
A German interior ministry spokesman said that an individual review, potentially followed by security screening, was underway for each person in the admission programme.

The two countries signed a joint communique at the end of the visit of a high-level ministerial delegation of Pakistan, led by Minister for National Food Security and Research, Rana Tanveer Hussain, to Tehran.
The Pakistani minister succeeded in securing Iran’s agreement to import a major portion of its rice imports from Pakistan. Under the agreement, Iran’s government and private sector will now rely primarily on Pakistan for rice imports, opening a consistent and stable export market for Pakistani rice, a press release of the Ministry of National Food Security and Research said.
Mr Hussain also obtained firm assurances from Iran to resolve hurdles in mango exports, particularly delays in import permits and foreign exchange allocations.
 
 

Iran’s Minister for Agriculture, Gholamreza Nouri Ghezeljeh, said the current volume of agriculture goods’ trade between the two countries stand at around $1.4 billion, but the two countries have complementary strengths that can be used to secure each other’s needs across different seasons.
He said that Iran will expand exports of its dairy products, nuts, fruits and vegetables to Pakistan, while Pakistan will meet a portion of Tehran’s corn and rice imports and 60 per cent of its meat imports under the new plan.
Mr Nouri said the two sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in research on climate change and food security, and set up a joint agriculture committee that will meet every six months to monitor progress and resolve bottlenecks.
The Pakistani minister also secured consensus on a wide range of facilitation measures aimed at easing agriculture trade. These included faster customs clearance, establishment of warehouses and cold chain systems, and improvements in border infrastructure to ensure perishable commodities reach markets efficiently and in top quality.
 
 

The two countries also reaffirmed their commitment to move forward towards a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that will provide a long-term framework for expanding bilateral agriculture trade, he said.
The next session of the Iran–Pakistan Joint Economic Commission will be held in Tehran next month.

• PDMA official says terminology used to describe deluge causing widespread destruction in limited time
AS EXTREME weather events grow more frequent and intense in Pakistan, a troubling gap has emerged not just in the country’s response to these phenomena, but also in terms of institutional coordination and data credibility.
The recent catastrophic flooding in Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa, which was attributed to a cloudburst by the Prov­incial Disaster Manag­ement Authority (PDMA), has once again laid bare the disconnect bet­ween government agencies, as the Pakistan Meteo­rological Depa­rtment (PMD) quickly refuted the claim, asserting that no such meteorological phenomenon had occurred.
Although the declaration of a ‘cloudburst’ has made headlines — both at home and abroad — it seems to be a case of a convenient label being slapped on a tragic incident.
Weather experts have challenged the perception and the frequent use of the term ‘cloudburst’ by state institutions and the media.
PMD Director Dr Zaheer Ahmed Babar said that technically speaking, there had been no cloudburst incidents in the country, and attributed the widespread destruction in the country’s northern parts to heavy rains.
Definition of ‘cloudburst’
“In meteorology, a cloudburst [refers to] an enormous amount of precipitation in a short period of time in small area — more than 100 millimetres of rain in an hour that is sometimes accompanied by hail and thunder — which is capable of creating flood-like conditions,” he said.
According to the Associated Press, a cloudburst is usually characterised by more than 100mm of precipitation within an hour over a localized area of around 30 sq km.
“We can use the word cloudburst as a descriptive noun, but it is not fit to [describe] heavy rainfall. We have to look at multiple factors to judge whether an incident was simply heavy rain or a cloudburst,” he said.
He gave the example of heavy rain in Chakwal last month, when a cloudburst was held responsible for the widespread destruction.
However, when the Met Office checked the record of observatories in Chakwal, they found that less rain was recorded than had been reported in the media, and said that the use of the term ‘cloudburst’ was incorrect in that context.
At the time, it was PDMA Punjab that had termed the incident a ‘cloudburst’ based on their own readings. However, they subsequently acknowledged the error after the Met Office issued a clarification.
“The same problem occurred in India and other countries, which are using the term to refer to heavy and extreme rainfall,” Mr Babar said.
Meanwhile, PMD Deputy Director Anjum Nazir Zaigham also clarified to different news channels on Monday that the recent bout of flooding was the result of rising temperatures causing glacier melt, and river overflows.
However, a senior PDMA KP official defended terming the rains over Buner and other areas as a ‘cloudburst’ incident.
He argued that the areas which faced catastrophic floods neither had glaciers nor rivers. “Whatever happened took place in short span of time. It took between five to 10 minutes for massive boulders to come hurtling down the mountains,” the official said.
The PDMA official said that these areas had small perennial streams, which carried the floodwaters down to settled areas. Normal rains do not cause such massive floods, nor do they result in such catastrophic losses, he reasoned.
He also quoted locals and eyewitnesses as saying that the intense deluge caused flooding within minutes, which could not happen unless there was a massive downpour in a short span of time, and justified his department’s use of the ‘cloudburst’ term.
Gaps in disaster readiness
Experts warn that these discrepancies are not just bureaucratic squabbles — they reflect serious gaps in Pakistan’s climate readiness.
Former climate change minister Sherry Rehman told Dawn it was disconcerting to see the PMD and PDMAs squabbling over “what constitutes a cloudburst and what does not”, especially when one-third of the country is coping with the aftermath of a disaster.
The Met Department, she said, needed to coordinate with NDMA to express their predictions and plans with clarity, instead of creating confusion.
“These are no longer normal monsoons. That we can all see. It is important to coordinate responses for the public instead of working in unproductive silos,” she added.
 
 

Another critical weakness is the country’s lack of “instant observation” capabilities. In the words of former chief meteorologist, Dr Sardar Sarfaraz, data is the key to tackling climate change.
“Without the ability to monitor weather events in real time, we’re essentially blind to the threats forming over our heads,” he said.
He explained that Pakistan currently operates around 85 automatic weather stations and roughly 110 manual observatories across its vast territory of over 700,000 square kilometers.
“And according to international standards, there should be a weather observation point every 100km. The gaps in our observation network are substantial, and they must be addressed urgently. In the era of increasingly extreme weather, we can no longer afford to remain behind. Our capacity needs to grow—and fast,” he concluded.

• PTI’s counsel rejects AGP’s view, says parliament is sovereign and not subordinate to courts
• Senators alarmed by rising cases of gender-based violence in 2024; conviction rates below 1pc
ISLAMABAD: Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan on Monday called for keeping the doors open for judicial intervention in parliamentary proceedings.
Making a rare appearance before the Senate, some three weeks after being summoned for an explanation on the alleged interference of the judiciary in internal parliamentary processes, the AGP referred to Article 69 of the Constitution, under which the validity of any proceedings in parliament cannot be called in question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure.
However, he insisted that the bar was not absolute. “There is a lot of sanctity attached to it, but it is not absolute,” he remarked.
He also referred to April 4, 2022, judgement of the Supreme Court, which declared unconstitutional the ruling of the then-deputy speaker on the no-confidence motion against the then-prime minister Imran Khan.
He said the PPP had filed the petition, and he himself and Barrister Ali Zafar appeared before the court as counsel.
 
 

“Now in those circumstances it becomes very important to leave that door open, because sometimes matters could bring everything not just to a standstill but also produce consequences which may not have any resolution within the House. In this particular case, when the ruling came out, the assembly was dissolved. Where would the members have gone? Obviously, they had to go to the court, and the court did interfere,” Mr Awan said.
The Attorney General while talking about stay orders against proceedings of parliamentary committees, said a solution could be worked out. He further said that certain amendments in rules of procedure and conduct of business might be required.
The Attorney General’s remarks followed his meeting with former Senate deputy chairman Saleem Mandviwala who had raised the issue of judicial interference in the House last month. Mr Mandviwala told the House that he briefed the AGP on how the high courts were interfering in the proceedings of the House, issuing stay orders against proceedings of standing committees even before a decision has been taken.
‘No room for granting a stay’
PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar also noted that standing committees were extensions of the parliament and that under the Constitution there was no room for granting a stay against their proceedings.
He noted that there should not be an institutional clash and that a solution should be found.
Mr Zafar, however, said that the Attorney General had wrongly interpreted the Constitution. He said courts can intervene where something is not being done in accordance with clear constitutional provisions. He added that the internal proceedings of the House and the committees cannot be touched. “We are sovereign and not subordinate to the courts,” he remarked.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar fully endorsed the remarks by the PTI leader. He noted that the principles of the trichotomy of powers must be followed by all. He added that how the country is to be run is ultimately for parliament to decide.
Gender-based violence
Senators from both sides of the aisle also expressed alarm over increasing violence against women and low conviction rate. They were speaking on a motion seeking the House to discuss the alarming increase in cases of Gender Based Violence (GBV) in the country and failure of administrative and judicial machinery to administer justice to women.
PPP Vice-President Sherry Rehman, who moved the motion, cited the latest report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation. She said that in 2024 alone, a staggering 32,617 cases were reported across Pakistan. These included 5,339 incidents of rape, 24,439 cases of kidnapping and abduction, 2,238 cases of domestic violence, and 547 so-called honour killings.
She pointed out that despite the shocking scale of violence, justice remains elusive: the conviction rate for honour killings is less than 0.5 per cent, rape less than 0.5pc, kidnapping/abduction 0.1pc, and domestic violence 1.3pc (SSDO, 2024).

• NDMA chief says monsoon season to remain ‘precarious’ in August; more spells expected,
but respite will come in late September
• Federal cabinet will donate salaries to aid flood victims, says PM Shehbaz
SWABI: At least 17 people were killed on Monday in a heavy downpour that submerged houses, swept away people, and caused landslides in several parts of the Swabi district, besides claiming two lives in Nowshera district as well.
Swabi Deputy Commissioner Nasrullah Khan said 12 houses had been submerged in Dalori village due to a ‘cloudburst’ while landslides also occurred in the hilly terrain of the district. He said that the downpour and landslides wreaked havoc in the Gadoon Amazai mountainous belt, adding that flash floods inundated several houses and swept away many people in the area.
The DC could not confirm the death toll due to information constraints, giving rise to conflicting figures.
Provincial Irrigation Minister Aqibullah Khan, who visited flood-hit Dalori, said over 20 people had been killed in the downpour and at least 33 people were still missing. However, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority said 13 people, including two in Nowshera, were killed and 20 were injured in the torrential rain. Meanwhile, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Faizi said 11 deaths were confirmed in Swabi, while, as per locals, 17 to 18 people were missing.
It seems the death toll is likely to balloon, as a large number of people remained missing by the time this report went to press. Since Friday, the rainfall has claimed at least 341 lives across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as per the official figure.
Amjad Gul, a local, said that many houses had collapsed due to the ‘cloudburst’. Nine bodies have been pulled out, while the rest were still under the rubble, he said. “It is not an easy task to pull people out of the rubble in Dalori. There is a dire need for an excavator. It seems that many people have been buried under the rubble,” he said.
The Met Department did not confirm if it was a cloudburst in Swabi, nor did it issue any statement about how much it rained in the district.
In another Sar Koi Payan, four people were killed after a house collapsed, burying nine members of a family.  It was learned that the family had recently returned from Karachi and they were sitting in their newly built house, which suddenly collapsed in the rain. Local people pulled out the bodies from the debris and dispatched them to the Topi tehsil headquarters hospital.
 
 

Two Afghan refugees also lost their lives in a roof-collapse incident, while, in a separate incident, two people drowned in the floodwater of Karnal Sher Khan Kali nullah.
Due to the downpour, the rainwater entered houses in the district, forcing people to take refuge on the roofs and move to safer locations, while the inundation and landslides completely paralysed the routine life in the region.
Several vehicles were buried under debris due to ‘mountain sliding’ in Bada village in the worst-hit Gadoon Amazai belt. The electricity system completely collapsed, crops were destroyed, and roads could no longer be used by people.
‘Precarious’ August
Separately, National Disa­­ster Management Auth­o­rity (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider on Monday warned that monsoon conditions would remain precarious until the end of August, with normalisation expected by late September, state-run APP reported.
 
 

Speaking at a joint press briefing with Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, the NDMA chief stated that the ongoing monsoon spell was expected to subside by Friday. However, he warned that the country remained at risk of further torrential downpours, with two to three additional spells likely in the coming weeks. Last spells will be ended by September 10, he said, adding that the overall situation was expected to normalise by the end of September.
The NDMA chief revealed that the ongoing monsoon season had caused 670 deaths and over 1,000 injuries, with 80 to 90 individuals still missing. Search operations were underway, and if the missing are not found, they will be added to the official death toll, he added.
PM pledges support
On the other hand, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif pledged support to flood-hit areas, saying the federal cabinet would donate its one-month salary to aid the relief efforts. Presiding over a meeting to review ongoing relief efforts by the federal government in the flood-affected areas, he directed the federal institutions to intensify efforts to assist victims in various districts of KP.
“In this hour of calamity, there is no federal or provincial government; we must ensure the assistance and rehabilitation of affected people,” the PM said. He stressed that the federal government would also provide financial assistance to the victims under the Prime Minister’s relief package.
 






It was informed that the federal government, provincial governments, Pakistan Army, and other institutions had established 456 relief camps and conducted 400 rescue operations so far.
According to the preliminary estimates, damages to public and private property exceeded around Rs126 million. The NDMA presented a report on the provision of rations, tents, medicines, medical teams, and other essentials, with the prime minister directing an increase in the quantity of relief items.
“Efforts are being made at the national level to deal with the current situation and on the instructions of the prime minister, the NDMA is in touch with the provincial governments, Informa­tion Minister Attaullah Tarar said.
According to Mr Tarar, several meetings were held at the National Command and Control Centre before the monsoon, in which representatives of all provincial governments participated.“Data has been regularly provided by the NDMA to the relevant authorities through the early warning system,” he claimed.
Unicef support
Unicef announced on Monday that it has already dispatched essential medicines to affected areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan and stands ready to scale up support to the government’s coordinated response as needed to ensure the safety and well-being of children and families.
 
 

Unicef Representative in Pakistan, Pernille Ironside, in a statement, said that “Unicef is deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life and devastation caused by the recent flash floods in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families who have lost loved ones and to all communities affected by this disaster”.

Senators Maulana Abdul Wa­­say of JUI-F and Manzoor Kakar of BAP from Balochistan alleged the bill would deprive citizens of a livelihood as authorities plan crackdown on small petroleum related businesses with closures and heavy fines, open floodgates of corruption, thus further alienating the people of Balochistan while large tankers would keep flowing smuggled products across mainland.
PML-N Senator Sadia Abbasi also initially appeared unimpressed by the proposed bill and suggested a meeting with FBR and Customs authorities for the senators from Balochistan. She said there was no point in passing the bill while senators from Balochistan opposed it and recalled that a bill about federally administered tribal areas (Fata) was also passed in the past under US pressure. She said now everybody was saying it was pas­sed reluctantly under US pressure. She cautioned against rushing the legislation, urging wider consultation with the petroleum industry and provincial stakeholders. “This bill directly affe­cts common people in Baloch­is­tan. We must not pass it in haste,” she said.

Senators from Balochistan resist bill over ‘livelihood concerns’

Maulana Wasay said it was an open secret how large tankers of 65,000 litre petroleum products travelled from border to Punjab and who were their beneficiaries. He described the bill as economic devastation for poor families in Balochistan, where, he said, 5,000 to 6,000 small vehicles transporting fuel had already been impounded. “These vehicles are the livelihood of poor people. If this bill passes, what will they do?” he asked, warning that harsher enforcement would fuel resentment in an already volatile province.
Senator Kakar said the vehicles used in transportation of Iranian oil products were issued ‘tokens of movement’ and questioned secretary petroleum if he had the data about such tokens who expressed his ignorance. Mr Kakar said products coming from the border passed through 100 security posts and their carriers paid fixed amounts at every post. 
Power to seal filling stations
The petroleum division briefed the committee that the bill introduced six new clauses aimed at curbing rampant smuggling of petroleum products and empowered authorities to seal filling stations selling smuggled fuel, seize related equipment, and take action against vehicles involved in the trade and impose fines. 
The petroleum secretary requested the senators to pass the bill promising to address their concerns through the enabling rules. He said bill granted deputy commissioners magisterial powers to handle confiscated goods and penalise violators. He said the crackdown would primarily target large oil tankers carrying over 40,000 litres of smuggled fuel.
He said smuggling of petroleum products worth billions of rupees was draining the economy and undermining government revenues, especially after the increase in petroleum levy (about Rs81 per litre at present), which had increased the incentive for smuggling. “The real beneficiaries are not small vehicle owners but powerful smuggling networks.
He assured the senators that licenced vehicles would not be targeted and pledged to incorporate the committee’s recommendations within three days.

A statement issued on Monday by the central bank said Prism Plus is built on the ISO 20022 financial messaging standard, which supports structured and data-rich financial communication, enabling enhanced transparency, interoperability, and automation across the payment and settlement ecosystem.
The system includes new features for liquidity management, transaction queuing and prioritisation, and scheduling of future-dated payments.
Prism Plus will make Pakistan’s financial system faster, safer and more modern, according to the SBP.
It said efficient money transfer, better liquidity management of securities transactions and minimal risks in the system would be achieved with the introduction of Prism Plus.
The statement added that the launch event will be chaired by State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmed and will be attended by senior SBP officials, representatives of financial institutions and key stakeholders from the financial sector.
“This development is a significant milestone in the ongoing development of Pakistan’s financial infrastructure,” the SBP said.
This new system is a significant step towards modernising the way funds and government securities transactions are handled in the country’s financial structure.
The central bank added that the new system had two main components:

A faster Real-time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) system for large-value payments between different participants
A brand-new Central Securities Depository (CSD) that manages government securities, such as T-bills, PIBs, and other government securities.

The system has been developed in alignment with SBP’s Vision 2028, which aims to establish a modern, inclusive, and robust financial ecosystem.
Last month, Ahmed had said that the institution planned to launch a pilot for a digital currency and was finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets as the government ramped up efforts to modernise the country’s financial system.
In June, retail payment volumes rose by 12 per cent year-on-year to 2,408 million transactions in the third quarter of FY25, while the overall transaction value increased by 8pc to Rs164 trillion.
The SBP-operated payment systems — Raast and the Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) — played a critical role in enabling faster digital payments.
Raast processed 371m transactions worth Rs8.5tr during the quarter, bringing its cumulative total to over 1.5bn transactions valued at more than Rs34tr since launch. RTGS facilitated 1.5m large-value transactions amounting to Rs347tr during the period.</p><small>2025-08-18 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/18231935c905691.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931709/son-of-norwegian-princess-charged-with-four-rapes' target='_blank'><strong>Son of Norwegian princess charged with four rapes</strong></a><br><p>The 28-year-old son of Norway’s crown princess has been charged with raping four women and several acts of violence, and risks up to 10 years in prison, a prosecutor said on Monday.
Marius Borg Hoiby, who was born out of a relationship before Crown Princess Mette-Marit married Crown Prince Haakon, has been under investigation since his arrest on August 4 last year on suspicion of assaulting a girlfriend.
He is accused of raping four women while they were sleeping. In at least three of the cases, he met the women the same day and had consensual sex before the alleged rapes, public prosecutor Sturla Henriksbo told reporters.
Hoiby is also charged with filming their genitals without their knowledge.
 

State Attorney Sturla Henriksbo addresses the press to report on the decision on the indictment of Marius Borg Hoiby, son of Norwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit, in Oslo, Norway, August 18. — AFP

Henriksbo said investigators had video clips and photographs as evidence.
The four rapes allegedly took place in 2018, 2023 and 2024, the last one after the police investigation began.
Other charges against Hoiby include domestic abuse against a former partner and several counts of violence, disturbing the peace, vandalism and violations of restraining orders against another former partner.
The only victim identified by the prosecution was Hoiby’s ex-girlfriend, Nora Haukland, whom he is accused of physically and psychologically abusing in 2022 and 2023.
‘Clenched fist’
“The violence consisted, among other things, of him repeatedly hitting her in the face, including with a clenched fist, choking her, kicking her and grabbing her hard,” the prosecutor said.
“The maximum penalty for the offences in the indictment is up to 10 years in jail.
“These are very serious acts that can leave lasting scars and destroy lives.”
The palace remained tight-lipped after the announcement.
“It is for the courts to consider this matter and reach a decision,” spokeswoman Sara Svanemyr said in a comment emailed to AFP.
The prosecutor said that Hoiby, as a member of the royal family, would not be treated “more lightly or more severely” than anyone else in similar circumstances. Hoiby already admitted to assault and vandalism in the August 2024 incident.
In a public statement 10 days after his arrest, he said he had acted “under the influence of alcohol and cocaine after an argument”, having suffered from “mental troubles” and struggling “for a long time with substance abuse”.
A tall blond who cultivates a “bad boy” look with slicked back hair, earrings, rings and tattoos, Hoiby has been in the eye of a media storm since his arrest.
When the rape allegations emerged in November, he spent a week in custody — unprecedented for a member of Norway’s royal family. After his release, he reportedly went to rehab in London.
‘Gilded cage’
Hoiby is the child of a brief romance between his mother and Morten Borg, who has also been convicted of abuse and drug-related crimes. They were together at a time when the future princess was part of Norway’s house music scene, known for its abundance of hash and ecstasy.
He was propelled into the spotlight at the age of four when his mother married Norway’s crown prince, with whom she went on to have two more children.
Hoiby was raised by the royal couple alongside his step-siblings Princess Ingrid Alexandra and Prince Sverre Magnus, now aged 21 and 19, respectively. Unlike them, however, he has no official public role.
“He has been put in a virtually impossible position: one foot in, one foot out. He is not technically part of the royal household, but he grew up in it,” said Sigrid Hvidsten, royal commentator at the newspaper Dagbladet.
“He has lived in a grey zone, a kind of gilded cage,” she told AFP in December 2024.
According to media reports, he hung out with gang members, Hells Angels bikers and members of Oslo’s Albanian mafia. In 2023, police contacted him to have a cautionary talk after he was seen moving in the same circles as “notorious criminals”.
It emerged last year that Hoiby had already been arrested in 2017 for using cocaine at a music festival.</p><small>2025-08-18 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1823022780f782c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931702/trump-says-to-meet-putin-zelensky-if-everything-works-out' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says to meet Putin, Zelensky if ‘everything works out’</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that if his meeting with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky went well, he expected to hold a trilateral meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin with the goal of ending the Ukraine-Russia war.
Trump is pushing Ukraine to make major concessions following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last week, saying Kyiv must give up Crimea and abandon its Nato ambitions. Those are two of Moscow’s top demands.
But Zelensky, who huddled with the Europeans before they all went to the White House to meet Trump, urged Trump to bring “peace through strength” against Russia and stressed the need for United States security guarantees.
“We’re going to have a meeting. I think if everything works out well today, we’ll have a trilat (trilateral summit) and I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that,” said Trump, sitting alongside Zelensky at the White House.
“I just spoke to President Putin indirectly and we’re going to have a phone call right after these meetings today.”
 


Zelensky thanked Trump for hosting the talks, which will be expanded to include European leaders later in the day. “Thank you for [the] invitation and thank you very much for your efforts, personal efforts to stop killings and stop this war,” he said.
Fielding questions from reporters, Trump said that Washington will be involved in providing security guarantees as part of a peace agreement on ending Russia’s war.
European countries are “the first line of defence because they are there, they are Europe, we’re going to help them out also. We’ll be involved”, he stated.
However, the US president repeated his view that a ceasefire was not necessary to end the Russia-Ukraine war, echoing earlier comments that brought his position more in line with Putin.
“I don’t think you need a ceasefire,” Trump said. “I know that it might be good to have, but I can also understand strategically why one country or the other wouldn’t want it. You have a ceasefire and they rebuild and rebuild and rebuild and you know maybe they don’t want that.”

Trump welcomed Zelensky to the White House, saying, “We love them,” when asked what his message was to the people of Ukraine after shaking Zelensky’s hand.
He also complimented Zelensky on his smart black jacket, after the Ukrainian was criticised by right-wing media for failing to wear a suit during a visit in February that ended in a shouting match.
Earlier, European leaders began arriving at the White House ahead of the high-stakes talks, with Nato chief Mark Rutte, European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer being among the first to arrive.

Trump, 79, said it was a “big day at the White House” and appeared to be in a combative mood, churning out a string of social media posts.
“I know exactly what I’m doing,” the Republican said on his Truth Social network. “And I don’t need the advice of people who have been working on all of these conflicts for years, and were never able to do a thing to stop them.”
Trump will later meet separately with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Finland, as well as Rutte and von der Leyen.
‘Peace through strength’
The European leaders held a preparatory meeting with the Ukrainian president in Washington on Monday morning, while Zelensky also met Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg.
Zelensky described the talks at the White House as “very serious” — and sought to flatter Trump ahead of the meeting, by echoing his trademark “peace through strength” language.
“President Trump has that strength. We have to do everything right to make peace happen,” he said.
The Ukrainian leader added that they would have “time to speak about the architecture of security guarantees. This is, really, the most important”.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters on the plane to Washington: “We’ve got to make sure there is peace, that it is lasting peace, and that it is fair and that it is just.”
 






Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said before going to the White House that a “small window of dialogue is opening” and that she backed the security guarantees idea.
Reports had said Putin would be open to Western security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of any peace deal, but had ruled out Kyiv’s long-term ambition to join Nato.
 
 

Russia kept up its attacks on Ukraine ahead of the new talks, killing at least seven people, including two children, in dozens of drone and ballistic missile strikes overnight, Ukrainian officials said. Zelensky called the strikes an attempt to “humiliate diplomatic efforts”.
A Trump-Putin summit in Alaska last week failed to produce a ceasefire in the nearly three-and-a-half-year war that began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Afterwards, Trump dropped his previous insistence on a ceasefire in favour of seeking a complete peace deal, meaning negotiations could proceed while the war goes on. He also alarmed Kyiv and European capitals by repeating a number of Russian talking points.
Trump said on Sunday that Zelensky could end the war “almost immediately, if he wants to”, but that, for Ukraine, there was “no getting back” Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and “No going into Nato”.
‘Some concessions’
US media reports have said Putin would consider freezing much of the current frontline in Ukraine if Kyiv agreed to completely give up the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.
 
 

Trump envoy Steve Witkoff said Moscow had made “some concessions” on territory. But such a move is widely viewed as unacceptable for Ukraine, which still holds much of the resource-rich area.
Yevgeniy Sosnovsky, a photographer from the captured Ukrainian city of Mariupol, said he “cannot understand” how Ukraine would cede land already under its control.
“Ukraine cannot give up any territories, not even those occupied by Russia,” he told AFP.
Kyiv and European leaders have warned against making political and territorial concessions to Russia, whose assault on Ukraine has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.</p><small>2025-08-18 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/182218354ce582d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931704/hamas-accepts-new-gaza-truce-plan-group-official-says' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas accepts new Gaza truce plan, group official says</strong></a><br><p>Hamas has accepted a new ceasefire proposal for Gaza, a senior member of the group said on Monday, after a fresh diplomatic push to end more than 22 months of fighting.
Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by its offensive since October 2023, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.
Mediators Egypt and Qatar, backed by the United States, have struggled to secure a lasting truce in the conflict, which has triggered a dire humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. But after receiving a new proposal from mediators, Hamas said it was ready for talks.
“The movement has submitted its response, agreeing to the mediators’ new proposal. We pray to God to extinguish the fire of this war on our people,” senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said on Facebook.

Earlier, a Hamas source told AFP the group accepted the proposal “without requesting any amendments”.
Egypt said it and Qatar had sent the new proposal to Israel, adding “the ball is now in its court”. Israel has yet to respond.
A Palestinian source familiar with the talks said mediators were “expected to announce that an agreement has been reached and set a date for the resumption of talks”, adding that guarantees were offered to ensure implementation and pursue a permanent solution.
According to a report in Egyptian state-linked media Al-Qahera, the deal proposed an initial 60-day truce, partial hostage release, release of some Palestinian detainees and provisions to allow for the entry of aid.
The proposal comes more than a week after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans to expand operations into Gaza City and nearby refugee camps, which have sparked international outcry as well as domestic opposition.
‘Confronted and destroyed’
Out of 251 hostages taken during Hamas’s October 2023 attack that triggered the conflict, 49 are still held in Gaza, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.
Earlier, an Islamic Jihad source said “the remaining captives would be released in a second phase”, with negotiations for a broader settlement to follow. They added that “all factions are supportive” of the Egyptian and Qatari proposal.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: “We will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!! The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of success will be.”
 
 

Last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel “will agree to an agreement in which all the hostages are released at once and according to our conditions for ending the war”.
Meanwhile, in a now familiar scene in Gaza, AFP footage from the southern city of Khan Younis showed crowds of mourners kneeling over the shrouded bodies of their loved ones who were killed seeking aid the day before.
‘Beyond imagination’
Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, visiting the Rafah border crossing with Gaza on Monday, said Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani was visiting “to consolidate our existing common efforts in order to apply maximum pressure on the two sides to reach a deal as soon as possible”.

Alluding to the dire humanitarian conditions for the more than two million people living in the Gaza Strip, where UN agencies and aid groups have warned of famine, Abdelatty stressed the urgency of reaching an agreement.
“The current situation on the ground is beyond imagination,” he said.
Egypt said on Monday it was willing to join a potential international force deployed to Gaza, but only if backed by a UN Security Council resolution and accompanied by a “political horizon”.
‘Deliberate’ starvation
On the ground, Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 11 people across the territory on Monday, including six killed by Israeli fire in the south.
Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military said it was “not aware of any casualties as a result of IDF fire” in the southern areas reported by the civil defence.
Rights group Amnesty International, meanwhile, accused Israel of enacting a “deliberate policy” of starvation in Gaza and “systematically destroying the health, well-being and social fabric of Palestinian life”.
Israel, while heavily restricting aid allowed into Gaza, has repeatedly rejected claims of deliberate starvation.
 






Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Israel’s offensive has killed more than 62,004 Palestinians, most of them civilians.</p><small>2025-08-18 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/18184908e12dece.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931689/countrys-running-well-no-need-for-27th-amendment-fm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Country’s running well, no need for 27th Amendment: FM Dar</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday said that the country was “running well” and experiencing stability and economic improvement, adding that there was no need for a 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Even though the 26th Amendment remains mired in controversy, the power corridors in Islamabad had been abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to insiders, would further ‘fine-tune’ the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.
Speaking to reporters in London during a visit to the United Kingdom, the deputy PM said: “We are still digesting the 26th Constitutional Amendment, so there is no need for a 27th right now. The country is running well. There is stability and economic improvement.
“We are putting our full attention towards GDP growth and development. Under [Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership, all efforts are being made.”
Dar added that under the leadership of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017, Pakistan was “the 24th-biggest economy” and added that the government was working to bring the economy back to that point.
“We are headed that way very quickly, and we are getting ready to become part of the G20,” Dar said.
In June, amid speculation in legal circles about the government planning to bring in the 27th Amendment, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association had endorsed a possible amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges.
Sources had said certain contentious matters, such as a separate constitutional court, left unresolved in the 26th Amendment, would be taken up in the new amendment. Though speculations had been rife since then, there had been no official word regarding the 27th Amendment.
Dar meets British lawmakers of Pakistani origin
Separately, FM Dar had “productive meetings” with British lawmakers of Pakistani origin, according to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO).
The deputy PM arrived in the UK on Saturday ahead of diplomatic engagements with British and Commonwealth leadership from August 17-19. The FO said earlier this week that he would meet British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Pakistan Hamish Falconer.
In today’s statement, the FO said that Dar met with British members of parliament (MP) Mohammad Yasin, Tahir Ali, Imran Hussain, Ayoub Khan and Adnan Hussain.
“The deputy prime minister/foreign minister underscored the deep historical and cultural bonds between Pakistan and the United Kingdom, which are further strengthened by the vibrant Pakistani diaspora in the UK,” the statement read.
 






During the meetings, Dar highlighted the diaspora’s pivotal role as a bridge between Islamabad and London, fostering mutual understanding, cultural exchanges and robust people-to-people connections, the FO added.
Dar “emphasised Pakistan’s strong commitment to enhancing bilateral parliamentary exchanges with the United Kingdom”, the statement read.
“He noted that such engagements facilitate the sharing of democratic experiences, international best practices and core democratic values, which are vital for the growth and stability of democratic institutions in both countries.”
The FO said that the deputy PM appreciated the efforts of the MPs to bring greater attention to the issue of human rights violations in occupied Kashmir and commended them for raising awareness on the situation in the UK.
The FO said FM Dar also met UK Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan Hamish Falconer at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) in a “productive” meeting.
“During the meeting, both sides reviewed the full spectrum of bilateral relations and reaffirmed their shared commitment to deepening cooperation across political, economic, climate and people-to-people domains,” the FO stated.
 






Dar and Falconer also exchanged views on regional and global developments, while the deputy PM highlighted Pakistan’s commitment to economic reforms and shared Pakistan’s perspective on peace and stability in South Asia.
“He (Dar) underscored the importance of the just and peaceful resolution of [the] Jammu and Kashmir Dispute, in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions,” the statement read.
According to the FO, both sides appreciated the trajectory of UK-Pakistani relations and noted the importance of regular, high-level interactions to maintain ties and open up new avenues for cooperation.
The foreign minister also met Kashmiri community leaders.
 






The foreign minister also inaugurated two initiatives at the Pakistan High Commission in London: the Provision of Land Record Services and the One Window Passport Processing System.
 






The FO said the Land Record Services, developed through a collaboration between the Punjab Land Revenue Authority and itself, enabled British Pakistanis to remotely access and manage property records in Punjab without the need to travel to Pakistan with services such as online sale deeds, record of rights, mutation entries and document attestation, all secured by blockchain technology to ensure transparency and prevent fraud.
“A dedicated Land Services Desk at the Pakistan High Commission in London will support the pilot phase, with plans to expand to other Pakistani consulates in the United Kingdom.”
It added that the One Window Passport Processing System, implemented by the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports, streamlined passport application procedures by consolidating multiple steps into a single, efficient counter, reducing processing time to approximately 10 minutes per application and thus enhancing convenience, reducing congestion and ensuring greater transparency for British Pakistanis.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
A statement from the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at Islamabad’s NIH said the latest cases involve a six-year-old girl from Union Council Pattan in KP’s Kohistan district, and a 21-month-old girl from UC Matli-2 in Sindh’s Badin.
“With these detections, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 21, including 13 from KP, six from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” the statement noted.
Polio was a highly infectious and incurable disease that could cause lifelong paralysis.  The only effective protection against the debilitating virus is through the repeated administration of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under five during each campaign, alongside timely completion of all routine immunisations, the statement said.
It added that from September 1 to 7, a sub-national polio vaccination campaign will take place, targeting more than 28 million children under the age of five in 99 districts across all provinces and regions.
“The campaign in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will be conducted from 15 September. The goal is to ensure every child in these districts receives the vaccine to protect them from the lifelong consequences of polio,” it said.
It added that the campaign was part of the ongoing efforts to quickly strengthen immunity among children and close existing protection gaps.
“Parents and caregivers are strongly urged to ensure their children receive the polio vaccine during this and every campaign.”
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah expressed concern over the polio case in the province, according to a statement from the chief secretary’s spokesperson, Farhat Imtiaz Janwari.
The chief secretary contacted the Hyderabad commissioner and sought a detailed report within 24 hours, the statement said.
“Polio is an incurable disease. Prevention is possible only through timely vaccination,” the chief secretary said and highlighted the importance of completing the immunisation course on time.
“A nationwide anti-polio campaign will commence from September 1,” he said, urging parents to vaccinate their children.
“Parents can protect their children from lifelong disabilities by giving them polio drops,” he said.
The chief secretary emphasised that the success of the polio eradication campaign depended on the active role of parents, communities and local leadership.
Last week, poliovirus was found in 36 per cent of samples across 87 nationwide districts tested in July.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.

Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas. Under the influence of approaching monsoon currents, Karachi experienced hot and humid weather on Sunday and the Meteorological Depart­ment forecast rain with thunderstorms for today in the city.
Speaking at a press conference in Karachi, Ghani said: “There are chances of severe rains in Sindh, especially in Karachi, with chances of urban flooding … regarding that, whatever is humanely possible, which a person, government or institution can do, we have made those arrangements.”
 


He added that instructions were given earlier as well about rain preparations and that the Sindh chief minister had directed the same in a meeting today as well.
According to the Met Office, rainfall as of 8am at Surjani Town was recorded at 2.4 millimetres, 1.5mm in Gulshan-i-Maymar and Korangi and 1mm at Faisal airbase, while trace rainfall was recorded in Gulshan-i-Hadeed, University Road, Jinnah Terminal, North Karachi, Keamari, Nazimabad and old airport area.
An update by the department at 6:51pm said that light to moderate rain-wind/thundershower was expected in Karachi and the surrounding coastal areas in the next one to three hours.
According to a notice by the Sindh Provincial Disaster Management Authority, the Pakistan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) has forecast widespread rain and thunderstorms with few moderate to isolated heavy or very heavy falls in the province till August 22, with occasional gaps.
The rains are likely in Karachi, Hyderabad, Jacobabad, Shikarpur, Larkano, Kamber Shahdadkot, Ghotki, Sukkur, Kashmore, Naushahro Feroze, Dadu, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Khairpur, Shaheed Benazirabad, Jamshoro, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Umerkot, Thatta, Sujawal, Badin, Matiari and Tharparker from today.
Ghani added that local councils were told to mobilise their resources and make arrangements specifically for chronic problem areas so citizens face minimal difficulties during the rain.
He also requested people and opposition parties to avoid criticism at a time of calamity, but to focus on helping the people, adding, “later you can criticise whatever is lacking you see — but when there’s a difficulty, I think we should show solidarity”.
Last month, at least six people lost their lives in different incidents of roof collapse, electrocution and drowning during widespread rains in many districts of Sindh.
Sindh CM puts local bodies, administration on high alert
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah chaired an emergency meeting to oversee preparations for the monsoon rains expected to impact Karachi and other parts of the province.
A press release from his office said CM Shah put all the local bodies, administration and traffic police on high alert, and directed them to strengthen coordination between the relevant departments and organisations.
The meeting, held at CM House, was attended by Ghani, Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab, Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Agha Wasif, Finance Secretary Fayaz Jatoi, Local Government Secretary Waseem Shamshad, and others.
 






The chief minister focused on ensuring the city’s infrastructure was ready to handle the anticipated downpour, while the mayor briefed him on ongoing efforts to improve drainage systems at 44 nullahs and critical choking points across Karachi, with approximately 150 drains under the control of towns undergoing cleaning to facilitate the smooth flow of rainwater.
CM Shah directed Ghani and Wahab to take all necessary steps to minimise disruption and ensure the safety of citizens. Wahab told the chief minister that, in addition to drainage improvements, 120 suction vehicles from the water board were strategically positioned in low-lying areas to clear any accumulated water quickly.
He said the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) was also working closely with the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to secure additional machinery if needed, demonstrating a coordinated approach to disaster management.
Directing all relevant agencies to remain vigilant, the chief minister instructed local government bodies to maintain a fully mobilised presence during the rain spell. He emphasised the importance of proactive measures by the city administration and urged the traffic police to ensure smooth traffic flow, even in the event of heavy downpours.
“The provincial government is fully prepared to manage the rains, but constant vigilance and rapid response from all departments are crucial,” the Sindh chief minister asserted. “Our priority is to protect our citizens and minimise any potential damage caused by the monsoon.”
Residents were advised to stay informed about weather updates and take necessary precautions to ensure their safety during the anticipated rainfall.</p><small>2025-08-18 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619371-pml-ns-rana-sanaullah-to-contest-senate-seat-from-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N's Rana Sanaullah to contest for Senate seat from Punjab</strong></a><br><p>

Wang arrived in the Indian capital on Monday for a two-day visit during which he will hold the 24th round of border talks with Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and also meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“This (discussing border issues) is very important because the basis for any positive momentum in our ties is the ability to jointly maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas,” Jaishankar told Wang in his opening remarks.
It is also important for the two countries to pull back their troops amassed along their disputed border in the western Himalayas since a deadly border clash in 2020, Jaishankar said.
 






India’s foreign ministry said in a social media post that “important engagements of the India-China Special Representatives and on bilateral relations” were scheduled over the next two days.
 






Wang’s visit comes days before Modi travels to China — his first visit in seven years — to attend the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a regional political and security group which also includes Russia.
Relations between the Asian giants began to thaw in October after New Delhi and Beijing reached a milestone pact to lower military tensions on their Himalayan border following talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Modi in Russia.
The world’s two most populous nations are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia, and fought a deadly border clash in 2020.
But caught in global trade and geopolitical turbulence triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff war, the countries have moved to mend ties.
Restarting border trade across their icy and high-altitude Himalayan border is expected to feature high on Wang’s agenda. Its resumption would be significant for its symbolism, and follows agreements to return direct flights and issue tourist visas.</p><small>2025-08-18 14:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/18175235b8d0a8e.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931684/us-trade-adviser-navarro-says-indias-russian-crude-buying-must-stop' target='_blank'><strong>US trade adviser Navarro says India’s Russian crude buying must stop</strong></a><br><p>White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday said India’s purchases of Russian crude were funding Moscow’s war in Ukraine and had to stop.
New Delhi was “now cosying up to both Russia and China”, Navarro wrote in an opinion piece published in the Financial Times today.
“If India wants to be treated as a strategic partner of the United States, it needs to start acting like one.”
India’s Foreign Ministry has previously said the country is being unfairly singled out for buying Russian oil while the US and European Union continue to purchase goods from Russia.
US President Donald Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods earlier this month, citing New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil. The move will take total tariffs on imports from India to 50pc.
“India acts as a global clearinghouse for Russian oil, converting embargoed crude into high-value exports while giving Moscow the dollars it needs,” Navarro wrote.
The adviser also said India’s close ties with Russia and China made it risky to transfer cutting-edge US military capabilities to India.
Separately, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country’s top refiner, will continue to buy Russian oil depending on economics, the company’s head of finance Anuj Jain told an analyst meeting today.
Jain said his company’s Russian oil processing in the June quarter was about 24pc compared to an average 22pc in 2024/25.
He said purchases for the September quarter were continuing and the discounts on Russian oil were in the range of $1.50 per barrel to the Dubai benchmark.
Longtime rivals China and India are quietly and cautiously strengthening ties against the backdrop of Trump’s unpredictable approach to both.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the month, while Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit India from Monday for talks on the disputed border between the two countries.
A planned visit by US trade negotiators to New Delhi from August 25-29 has been called off, a source said over the weekend, delaying talks on a proposed trade agreement and dashing hopes of relief from additional US tariffs on Indian goods from August 27.</p><small>2025-08-18 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619359-houston-hosts-marka-e-haq-independence-day-festival' target='_blank'><strong>Houston hosts 'Marka-e-Haq', Independence Day festival</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan generates millions of tonnes of solid waste annually, but only a small fraction of sewage is treated. Inadequate sanitation in urban areas leads to recurring floods, waterborne illnesses and the resurgence of preventable diseases such as cholera, dengue and polio.
The chief minister is currently on a five-day visit to Japan. A statement from her office said CM Maryam issued the order during a visit to Japan’s largest wastewater treatment plant in Yokohama today.
 






“Japan’s modern technology and methods will be used for sewage and waste management in Punjab,” the statement quoted her as saying.
The statement added that she inspected the waste treatment systems of Asahi, Yokohama City, Kanagawa, Washimaku and Yodogawa.
According to the statement, the chief minister was given a detailed briefing on methods of collecting garbage and wastewater, along with waste disposal systems of Japanese cities.
 






She was apprised by the authorities that Yokohama was “the second largest city in Japan in terms of population” and that its Solid Waste and Wastewater Treatment Plant treated 1.5 million litres of wastewater daily.
“Yokohama Waste Treatment Plant is also operating several plants that generate energy from waste. This energy is used for heating systems for the local population,” the statement cited the Japanese authorities as saying, adding that the plant was an “ideal institution for disposal of waste using modern technology and methods”.
“Despite being an industrial city, Yokohama is at the top of [the] highest environmental standards,” they said.
The chief minister was told that waste was separated into reusable components through a “modern plant and automated system”.
She said that this environmental and urban development model would be implemented in Punjab.
The chief minister also attended a briefing on urban development at Yokohama’s Town Hall, where she participated in a discussion on bringing the construction quality of roads and buildings in Punjab “to the level of Japan”.
 






“City-to-city” cooperation was also agreed on in various sectors between Yokohama and the province of Punjab, according to posts by the PML-N.
 






Under her leadership, Punjab has emerged as a frontrunner in environmental governance. The province recently launched Pakistan’s first Environmental Protection Force, implemented a ban on single-use plastics and equipped over 1,500 construction sites with dust suppression systems in Lahore.</p><small>2025-08-18 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619344-rubio-says-us-keeping-eye-on-pakistan-india-after-trump-brokered-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Rubio says US keeping 'eye on Pakistan, India' after Trump-brokered ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>
