Hours-long clashes took place between PTI workers and the Islamabad police on March 18, 2023, when former prime minister Imran Khan arrived at the FJC to attend a hearing in the first Toshakhana case, in which he was later arrested in August that year and has been behind bars since then.
The same day, the Punjab police personnel had entered Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore, which had also been the venue of a chaotic stalemate between the cops and the PTI just days before.
ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over today’s hearing. Advocate Sardar Masroof Khan, Amna Ali and others appeared as the legal team for the PTI leaders, while Advocate Sardar Muhammad Razzaq was present as former Punjab chief minister Parvez Elahi’s counsel.
 
 

The judge issued a bailable arrest warrant for Qaiser, ordering that he be produced before the court.
The judge accepted the applications seeking exemption from appearance for Elahi, former finance minister Asad Umar and PTI’s Shibli Faraz, who was recently disqualified from his role as the Senate opposition leader.
Subsequently, the judge adjourned the proceedings till October 6.
The case, registered at the Counter-Terrorism Department police station under Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997, had also named Imran.
A letter had been written to the law ministry about the proceedings against the ex-premier and a response was awaited.
ATA case over Federal Judicial Complex violence
As of March 22, 2023, the Islamabad Police had arrested a total of 316 PTI supporters for allegedly attacking police officers and causing chaos outside the FJC.
 
 

The case had also invoked sections 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc), 395 (punishment for dacoity), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage to amount of one hundred rupees), 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The first information report (FIR) named 18 people involved in causing damage to the FJC, 22 others involved in causing damage in the FJC’s parking area and lighting up fires, and 19 others involved in allegedly injuring police officials. It also mentioned that stones, lighters and bottles filled with petrol were recovered from some of them.</p><small>2025-09-22 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/22133953a7909bd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943706/power-to-the-people-strongest-70-years-ago-the-apex-court-sealed-pakistans-fate-its-effects-still-echo-today' target='_blank'><strong>Power to the people strongest: 70 years ago, the apex court sealed Pakistan’s fate. Its effects still echo today</strong></a><br><p>It started with the judiciary. Or, at least, what the judiciary was capable of.
Just a few months before they finalised the Constitution on September 21 — that is, 71 years ago this week — Pakistan’s first parliament introduced a safety valve in the system. It was called writ jurisdiction.
The change didn’t require a lawyer to understand: the superior courts could now issue special orders called writs. These would direct the executive to protect fundamental rights, or restrain it from abusing its powers.
And the House knew a thing or two about such abuse: the year was 1954, and the law — and who got to pass it — was at the heart of democracy’s future. Khwaja Nazimuddin’s ministry had just fallen to the deep state, with battle lines drawn between them: at times dubbed the Bengal and Punjab groups (reductive), or federalists and centralisers (misleading).
Yet the real fight was between the elected and unelected: a forum group versus a fortress group. In fairness, it could well be said that the first was quite capable of excesses, just as the second was of sound decisions. What can’t be said, however, is that both were legitimate.
 
 

Ultimately, however, the judiciary would decide that question, the new amendment having boosted its standing. Writs, as Justice M. R. Kayani told college kids in Lahore, “are flowers of paradise, and the whole length and breadth of Pakistan is not wide enough to contain their perfume”.
Provided, of course, parliament stood by the judges. “It is the force of opinion which makes good laws,” said Justice Kayani, “and in this particular case, you must pray for the long life of the Bengali members who made the necessary noise.”

Flowers of paradise: the First Amendment
Those noises were originally made in the summer of 1954, when that year’s first amendment to the Government of India Act — Pakistan’s makeshift constitution — brought in writs.
At the centre of attention was legal genius A. K. Brohi, whose own allegiances were a matter of season: too savvy for forum or fortress, Brohi would, at various points in that pitched battle, lean with whoever was ahead.
 


Writs enabled justice, he told the assembly, “far more speedily than by resort to the ordinary procedure”. The high courts would thus become “custodians of the rights of the people”.
Even the opposition’s Dhirendra Nath Datta, of the tragic Pakistan National Congress, agreed. “… The way in which indiscriminate arrests have been made in my province … the morale of the people has been completely broken.” One wonders what Datta would make of terrorism FIRs against protesting lawyers today.
He nonetheless concluded, “I cannot but congratulate the government for introducing a bill like this, which is aimed at safeguarding the interests of the people from the executive zulm.”
The first amendment was so passed. Zulm, it was hoped, would be made that much harder.
Open to abuse: ‘transferring’ judges
Interestingly, there were also heated debates, over a half-century before Lahore’s Justice Sarfraz Dogar showed up in the Islamabad High Court, on whether or not to pass a law providing for judges being transferred from high court to high court.
Murmurs came from the forum group’s Abdur Rab Nishtar and Mahmud Husain, recently purged from the cabinet in Pakistan’s first coup in 1953 (their removals informed, as cables in London revealed, by hatreds jointly felt by Iskander Mirza and British mandarins).
Nishtar hoped they could “avoid” such a law altogether: in a federal system, there had to be an autonomous judiciary in all provinces. Otherwise, the law would “give opportunity to a gentleman outside a particular judicial unit to exercise administrative powers”, which might hurt his adopted high court.
Mahmud Husain, too, thought a law meant to secure judicial independence could go wrong if the executive started ping-ponging judges: “It may be under certain circumstances that this power is abused.” He suggested such transfer happen only if “the initiative is to come from the judiciary itself”, and on the recommendation of the chief justice of Pakistan.
Left unsaid was what would happen if the chief justice, as well as his judges, were also chosen by the executive — as the 26th Amendment trainwreck now allows.
Reasons to fight
With the power to issue writs in place, the Long Parliament finally took aim at the governor-general, a relentless old man backed by Iskander Mirza’s bureaucrats and Ayub Khan’s generals.
To be sure, the forum group’s humiliations at the hands of the fortress group had been bitter and many: martial law in Lahore, coups in Karachi, and emergency in Dhaka, all within a year.
But the solution, the members knew, could only be through a permanent political settlement — one their departed boss Muhammad Ali Jinnah had promised they would get to write. In sum, democracy, to be delivered via a Fifth Amendment.
Lesser motives varied. The late cabinet’s Nazimuddin and Mahmud Husain, had neither forgiven nor forgotten the governor-general’s purge; they now had their sights on a federal future.
Their rivals in the present cabinet, mostly loath to poke the bear that had selected them, had outliers like Brohi, who saw the advantage of shutting out the gloved hand for good.
Meanwhile, members from East Bengal, like the brash and bold Fazlur Rahman (not to be confused with today’s maulana), were sick of the Punjab gentry’s plans to fuse West Pakistan’s seats into one bloc. If the Bengalis were a majority of the people, then they had to be a majority in parliament.
Self-preservation also played a part: more thuggish members, like Qaiyum Khan, feared PRODA, the anti-corruption law of the time, as a stick the governor-general would soon beat them over the heads with.
Finally, the prime minister and leader of the house, Bogra, hadn’t been told anything by the rebels until right before. He would go along anyway.
 
 

Because passing the Constitution, it was thought, could cure such afflictions. In the words of one bemused British cable from that month, “The motives which inspire Pakistani politicians are so mixed that it is almost impossible to predict in advance what line they will take”.
All that could be said is “the fact that the new Constitution is now very close”.
September rebels: the governor-general defanged
In the wee hours of September 21, 1954, that new Constitution was given its final touches. By then, the only Leaguers left in the assembly were the Bill’s 29 supporters, 28 of whom were from outside the Punjab.
Part of the reason this fightback would merit such little coverage was its stodgy authors: League conservatives from East Bengal, Sindh, and today’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in direct opposition to Punjab one-uniters, Bengali nationalists, and the military establishment.
But their Bill was explosive: the Fifth Amendment, tabled by Sindh’s M. H. Gazdar, and hurried along by speaker Tamizuddin. The ayes rang out in 10 minutes: the establishment was rebuked, the governor-general’s powers to sack the centre scuppered, and the cabinet made dependent on the assembly’s confidence.
 

In the September vote, 29 ayes in just 10 minutes clipped the Governor-General’s powers and bound the cabinet to the assembly’s confidence.

The draft Constitution of 1954 also raised Bengali to a national language, entrusted judicial appointments to the country’s chief justice, and buried One Unit out of hand.
“One can only say to the country that the best has been done,” closed Brohi, adding that “posterity alone can be the sole and competent judge.” The Constitution was sent to the printers, to cheers from the press.
“Democracy in Pakistan has come alive,” Dawn said, hailing the “zeal, speed, and determination” of the assembly. After years of heartache, it had fulfilled its mission.
Others weren’t so enthused: upon hearing the news, London sweated that the forum crew would ditch the Western alliance; that they might reject the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (Seato) and even step out of the Commonwealth. Punjab’s landed gentry wept at having to concede the Bengalis their majority. And future field marshal Ayub likened the whole session to a murder in the night.
Soon enough, it was hard to find a power centre that wasn’t offended by the assembly. Nor did it help that the League, having repaired its fortunes, was now asking Fatima Jinnah to take over the party. By nearly all metrics, the fortress group was ending 1954 in the middle of its own personal nightmare.
 

Fatima Jinnah was asked to lead the Muslim League, just as Ayub Khan was moving to evict it from the assembly. Their rivalry would climax 11 years later, during the presidential election of 1965.

But it woke up soon enough: the governor-general, resting in the north, rushed back. The memoirs of generals Ayub and Musa roughly corroborate each other as to the fortress group’s tailspin over the next few weeks: in one surreal meeting at Ghulam’s residence on 23 October, the governor-general — lying prone on hardboard — screamed abuse at his guests, ordered Ayub to take over, and refused to give Bogra another chance.
 
 

A happy medium was worked out the next night: Ayub moved his soldiers, Mirza padlocked the assembly, and the new Constitution was stillborn 72 hours before its scheduled passage.
To little pushback, prime minister Bogra caved almost immediately to the coup. East Bengal’s two biggest leaders buckled soon after — the price of Suhrawardy and Fazlul Huq’s acquiescence turned out to be a ministry each. The rest of the press was smacked with censorship.
Foreign journals were instead treated to Iskander Mirza, who told them the electorate was bound to act “foolish”; democracy having “run riot during seven years in Pakistan”.
Tamizuddin, 70 years on
If there was resistance, it came from the speaker — heavily surveilled Tamizuddin Khan — who left for court in a burqa, and whose London barrister,  D. N. Pritt, flew into Karachi disguised as a surgeon. Tamizuddin couldn’t afford Pritt’s fees; they had to be covered by philanthropist and insurance magnate Roshan Ali Bhimjee.
This would be in stark contrast to the state’s treasure chest: Ghulam’s lawyer, Sir Ivor Jennings, would be paid seven times the chief justice’s annual compensation. Of course, Jennings’s case was also much tougher: the governor-general, acting as the shadow of an alien queen, had dissolved a sovereign assembly, seized power, and installed a regime of his own.
And while Ghulam had declared that the constitutional machinery had “broken down”, the opposite was true — it had whirred to life. The reason for sacking the assembly wasn’t that it had failed to come up with a Constitution. It was that it had succeeded.
 

Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad.

So the deep state tried another tack: that parliament had lost its representative character, having chugged on for so many years. Yet this would have been believable had it been shuttered after the ruling party’s thrashing at the polls in East Bengal in 1954. That it was left alive only proved the assembly was meant to finish its task.
Not least, whatever the sins of parliament, nothing in the law allowed for the governor-general to handpick a cabinet of his own — hence ministers Ayub and Mirza named as respondents in Tamizuddin’s petition.
Up against such strongmen, Tamizuddin hoped the court’s writs would act as no less than flowers from heaven. And they did: after several packed hearings, with citizens sitting on prayer mats in front of the domed Sindh Chief Court, the judges found for Tamizuddin by unanimous decision.
Not only was parliament sovereign, “I am unshaken in my belief,” held Justice M. Bukhsh Memon, “that the Governor-General had no power of any kind to dissolve the Constituent Assembly.”
The Munir court
Beaten on all fronts, Jennings switched strategies: in an unwinnable case, best to dodge the merits altogether. In its appeal before the Federal Court (now the Supreme Court), the state argued that the Sindh Chief Court never had the power to issue writs, because the law providing for such powers had never been assented to by the governor-general.
 

Chief Justice Munir.

And the governor-general’s assent was very much required, given Pakistan was still a dominion under the queen. It was a lawyer’s loophole; one that Justice Muhammad Munir had already closed in Khuhro vs Federation in 1950, holding that no such assent was required.
We now know Munir was all set to change his mind, and that he was in constant touch with Ghulam through coded messages, relayed via secretary.
 
 

Less discussed, however, is just how blatantly Ghulam and his lawyers signalled that an adverse verdict would never be honoured. Silky threats were framed in polite legalese: the governor-general felt it undesirable, his senior lawyer Diplock told Munir in open court, “to abrogate that other essential feature of the democratic constitution: the rule of force, to prevent the matter coming before the courts”.
Translation: The governor-general could have used naked coercion to stop you judges from hearing this case — but he hasn’t yet.
“My Lords,” Diplock carried on, “it may be, indeed it would have been his duty, had circumstances so necessitated, to take those steps without regard to the writ which had been issued, because salus populi suprema lex: to go as far as that — fortunately — it has not been necessary at present.”
Translation: The people’s safety comes first (salus populi suprema lex). That means he can ignore your orders, as and when you make that necessary.
And Ghulam’s continued control over the coercive apparatus weighed heavy on the chief justice, as he himself would admit years later.
Hence, in contravention of all law, precedent, and basic sense, the Munir court axed the assembly — Jinnah’s greatest hope. Most incredible of all, it never decided the core question: whether the assembly was dissolved rightly or wrongly.
In his farewell speech, Justice Munir said that had he gone another way in Tamizuddin, “I am quite sure that there would have been chaos in the country and a revolution would have been formally enacted, possibly by bloodshed.”
Yet such a decision only sped up the ‘revolution’ when it came — in 1958, led by Ayub — which the judge blessed at once. Brute strength is its own excuse.
Even so, it’s hard to overemphasise just how much Munir’s verdict in Tamizuddin altered Pakistan’s destiny. As scholar Allen McGrath writes, “One of the most important differences between Ghulam Muhammad’s Pakistan and the nation as it was under Jinnah, Liaquat, and Nazimuddin was that the Constituent Assembly no longer possessed the sovereign power of the state.”
And when Munir denied the existence of the assembly’s sovereignty, he destroyed the country’s existing constitutional basis. In essence, sovereign power in Pakistan would become a prize, to be seized by the strongest.
It still is.
Final frontiers
A smidge over 70 years to the day, the relationship between power and legitimacy remains as tenuous. The Supreme Court, too, finds itself having to face, in full view, the high courts’ ‘demolition’, to quote from the plea moved by five Islamabad judges.
“This petition,” they submit, “is a desperate measure of the last resort.”
And the choice is a stark one: that fidelity to the Constitution either demands hanging up their robes, “or to beseech the Supreme Court to answer some hard truths”.
Will that Court answer the call to its conscience the way it did the first time?</p><small>2025-09-22 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/220059347f690f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943714/buscaro-raises-2m-to-tackle-tricky-mobility-sector' target='_blank'><strong>BusCaro raises $2m to tackle tricky mobility sector</strong></a><br><p>Venture capital is starting to trickle back into Pakistan. In the latest round, mobility startup BusCaro raised $2 million last week, bringing its total funding to $3.5m.
The round was led by UAE-based Daman Investments, with participation from US/Saudi Cartography Capital, New York’s Epic Angest, UK’s Wahed Ventures, the Aga Khan Development Network’s Accelerate Prosperity, and a mix of angel investors.
BusCaro, which offers shared commute services, was born in late 2022 — a time that could not have been less propitious for mobility startups. The world was emerging from the pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war had triggered a global crisis, Pakistan was reeling from floods, and the local mobility sector was collapsing. Airlift and Swvl had folded, and Uber had exited Pakistan. What was once the hottest space had suddenly become a no-go zone.
That’s when Maha Shahzad, former general manager of Swvl, launched BusCaro — putting its first bus on the road just a day after Swvl shut down.
The journey since then has been anything but smooth. Ms Shahzad says she received over 400 rejections before securing the game-changing $160,000 in the first year of operations that set the fledgling startup on its current growth path. Today, BusCaro claims to process more than 900,000 monthly bookings and is on track to hit $8.6m in annual revenue by December. But scaling up has brought its own financial headaches.
The financing conundrum
“Equity financing is the least of my problems — and that’s true for most founders,” says Ms Shahzad. “Working capital is the main bottleneck.”
BusCaro operates an asset-light, tech-first model: it doesn’t own vehicles, operates out of co-working space Collabs, and has no land or collateral to borrow against. Its topline is too large to qualify as a small or medium enterprise, and even if it did, the Rs5m lending cap would be far too little. As a result, BusCaro is forced to turn towards venture for day-to-day financing.
“Startups raise equity to fuel high-octane growth. It’s ridiculous that we need to raise it for working capital,” Ms Shahzad says. Despite being fully incorporated, with a strong credit history, a portfolio of formal clients willing to provide guarantees, and credit lines from major fuel companies such as Total and Parco, BusCaro still struggles to raise financing against its invoices, underscoring the challenges faced by the tech-based private sector.
Getting the model right
So what is BusCaro doing differently, where others with deeper pockets failed?
The steep hike in petroleum prices, the economic downturn, and the drying up of global financing made it impossible to sustain business models like Airlift and Swvl’s, which prized growth over profitability by subsidising services. When the economic tides turned worldwide, venture capitalists were no longer handing out blank cheques for costly customer acquisition; instead, they required startups to prioritise early breakeven over just chasing revenue growth.
However, according to BusCaro, it secured positive unit economics from the outset — in simple terms, each ride cost less to provide than the revenue earned from fares. And while its fares are correlated to fuel prices, a shared commute remains cheaper than a solo ride.
Unlike its predecessors, BusCaro has not subsidised its per-seat fare. This balance was achieved by driving aggregation across two verticals: business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C).
On the B2B side, BusCaro partners with institutions. Sometimes, employers subsidise a percentage of the commute cost as an employee perk; in other cases, BusCaro provides the option of shared transport if enough employees aggregate demand.
For B2B2C, it works with facilitators like housing societies or co-working spaces to pool commuters at pick-up points. This approach slashes customer acquisition costs and creates positive unit economics. With 80 clients onboard, about 60pc of BusCaro’s business comes from B2B, and 40pc from B2B2C, including its parent-facing app.
That app has also opened up a niche market: school commutes. A couple of decades ago, school vans were everywhere; today, parents are left scrambling for reliable options. BusCaro’s app enables parents and schools to track rides in real-time, with manual check-in and check-out options for minors. It’s a problem, Ms Shahzad believes, that has significant potential — not just in Pakistan, but across the GCC, especially for working mothers.
Startup burn
Not that BusCaro is profitable. Currently, it burns about $15,000 a month, with a -2.8 per cent EBITDA [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation] — almost entirely due to additional tech spend. With Ms Shahzad mentioning the 36pc interest rate BusCaro has faced, the debt financing alone would add up to a hefty expense, pushing the bottom line deeper into the red — a problem that eventually led its previous cohort to their exit.
But demand is outpacing supply. “My pipeline is 5x to 6x more than what I can fulfil right now,” Ms Shahzad claims. And the logic seems simple: shared commute outside of public transport will always be the cheapest way to move people. However, for the bottom line to come out of the red, the company will need a topline growth of 28pc.
From non-air-conditioned 80-seater buses to air-conditioned Corollas, BusCaro offers options across price points, with an average blended fare of Rs130 per ride — more economical than most alternatives. It currently operates in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and nearby cities.
Safety has also been a differentiator, BusCaro claims. With nearly 19m bookings since its inception, BusCaro claims zero reported harassment cases. The nature of shared rides, where 70pc of passengers are women and children, inherently lowers the risk, although the company also vets its drivers.
While speaking to Dawn, Ms Shahzad has a simple piece of advice for startups struggling to raise capital: don’t get caught up in FOMO. “A few years ago, everyone was rushing into fintech. Now it’s AI. Instead, solve the boring problems on the ground — and do it while staying unit positive.”</p><small>2025-09-22 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624937-pm-shehbaz-directs-formulation-of-roadmap-to-boost-trade-investment' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz directs formulation of roadmap to boost trade, investment</strong></a><br><p>

India’s second win over Pakistan at the T20 tournament padded their head-to-head record in the format to 11-3 against Team Green, with one match tied.
Played against the backdrop of lingering tensions between the two nations in the wake of their military conflict in May, there were no handshakes between the players once again.
“According to me, if two teams play 15-20 matches and if it is 7-7 or 8-7, then that is called a rivalry,” Suryakumar told reporters.
“But 13-0, 10-1. I don’t know what the stats are. But this is not a rivalry anymore.”
Defending champions India dropped four catches during the match, and Suryakumar said they would address the issue ahead of their next Super Four fixture against Bangladesh on Wednesday in Dubai.
 
 

“The fielding coach has sent an email to the boys, who had butter fingers, to appear before him at his office,” the middle-order batter added.
“But this happens, it is a part of the game.

What was once a mostly barren landscape has now given way to expanding infrastructure with the distinctive stamp of industrialisation. This change, accelerated by the development of Pakistan’s largest lignite coal reserves, is often welcomed as a sign of national development and energy self-sufficiency. However, there are complications.
Though proponents of the Thar coal project highlight jobs, infrastructure, and energy security, the timing and model of this development call for scrutiny. Has this transformation shown any sign of long-term ecological foresight, or has it been hurried under the banner of ‘development at any cost’?
Evidence of environmental consequences of open-pit coal mining, saline water reservoirs, and poorly planned urban expansion are beginning to surface. And while the imagery of green patches and water bodies may suggest renewal, the reality is that much of it is artificial, seasonal, or environmentally unsustainable.
 
 

Between 2015 and 2023, satellite imagery shows an abrupt drop in barren land from 3,285 square kilometres to 2,190 square kilometres, with 969 square kilometres replaced by vegetation, 114 square kilometres of built-up areas, and mining areas spanning 32 square kilometres. On paper, this may imitate variation, but the surge in vegetation is mainly reliant on unpredictable rains. The built-up area has expanded ten times, driven by population growth and coalfield development.
The arrival of the artificial reservoir, Gorano Pond, has altered local hydrology. Mining areas, which were vague in 2014, now spread over 32 square kilometres, leaving marks on Tharparkar’s rich desert ecology. These figures, validated through NASA-USGS data, tell a story of fast, unbalanced variation, one driven further by extractive drive rather than sustainable planning.

The cost of coal has to be measured in not just megawatts but also in the damage to Thar’s land, air, groundwater, and the dignity of the people who have called it home for generations

The expansion of coal mining has led to the extensive shift of natural flora and fauna, resulting in the irreversible degradation of Thar ecosystems. Groundwater resources are being overextracted, with further risk of contamination from the disposal of saline wastewater posing long-term risks to freshwater aquifers.
Furthermore, coal dust pollution may become a rising health hazard for adjacent villages, contributing to lung illnesses and degrading air quality. Meanwhile, climate change, soil erosion and land degradation have compromised traditional grazing paths and farming, which many local people depend on for survival.
 
 

Maybe most damaging of all is the cultural disturbance, as the damage of inherited lands causes indigenous people to undergo obligatory relocation, thus eroding old traditions. The accurate cost of coal is not just measured in megawatts and megaprojects but in the damage to Thar’s land, air, groundwater, and the dignity of the people who have called it home for generations.
Pakistan is not without choices. India, facing similar challenges in coal mining regions, has invested in hybrid energy regions and reclamation of mined land. Even more, the UK and other countries have shown how empowered local governments and integrated environmental planning can mitigate such effects.
Thar, with its abundant solar potential, is well placed to lead a just energy transition. It is essential not to select between power generation and safeguarding. A balanced model, one that complements ecological thresholds and centres the expressions of Thari communities, is both probable and compulsory.
If the aim is sustainable development, a multi-pronged method must be immediately prioritised. Restoration of degraded land through indigenous reforestation and post-mining recovery plans is vital to restore ecological balance.
Groundwater governance must be reinforced by applying integrated groundwater monitoring systems and promoting rainwater harvesting to prevent both depletion and contamination. Future urban development should follow eco-sensitive infrastructure planning, incorporating green belts, safeguard zones, and renewable energy components to minimise environmental disruption.
 
 

Equally significant is the inclusion of local communities in the decision-making process through transparent, equitable compensation and participatory planning to protect their rights and livelihoods. Finally, a gradual shift toward clean energy can reduce the region’s dependency on coal and pave the way for a more resilient and sustainable energy future.
These are not optional to include but necessary bannisters for any responsible development in Thar due to the ecologically sensitive zone.  The story of Islamkot must not become yet another case study in myopic planning. With the right policies, inclusive governance, and a commitment to environmental responsibility, Thar can still become a model of sustainable energy development, one that powers the nation without darkening the future of its own land and people.

There has been a recent uptick in terror attacks in Pakistan over the past year. The CTD regularly carries out operations to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence.
During the three months, 14 terrorists were arrested in Lahore, 14 in Rawalpindi, seven each in Faisalabad and Bahawalpur, six each in Jhang and Sargodha, five in Sahiwal, four from Gujranwala and three each from Bahawalnagar and Gujrat, the statement read.
“Of the arrested terrorists, 55 belong to Fitna al Khawarij, five are from ISIS (Islamic State), and two each are from Al-Qaeda, Hizb-ut-Tahrir and Jeay Sindh,” the statement added.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khawarij to refer to terrorists of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to the CTD, items seized during the raids include 20.2 kilogrammes of explosive material, 85 detonators, 183 feet of safety fuse wire, 717 pamphlets belonging to a banned organisation, magazines, detonating cord, mobile phones and cash.
The CTD added that 87 criminal cases have been registered against the arrested suspects, and investigations are underway.
“The arrested individuals had been planning attacks on important buildings in several cities,” the statement read. “CTD Punjab remains vigilant and committed to the ‘Safe Punjab’ objective. We will spare no effort to bring terrorists and anti-state elements to justice.
“In related security activity during the current week, local police and security agencies carried out 13,521 combing operations, checked 552,692 people, arrested 1,131 suspicious persons, registered 1,061 FIRs (first information reports) and achieved 906 recoveries.
Earlier this week, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CTD neutralised three terrorists, including an Afghan national, during an IBO carried out in Khyber district.
Two of the three militants killed during the IBO were involved in a suicide bombing in Peshawar, which led to the deaths of a sub-inspector and a constable.
A statement issued by the CTD said that the department conducted the operation based on the reported presence of Fazal Noor, a commander of the banned militant group Islamic State Khorasan Province and his group members in the Ali Masjid area of the district.</p><small>2025-09-22 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/22104416c4ee171.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943856/fm-dar-reaches-new-york-to-attend-un-general-assembly-session-set-to-focus-on-palestine' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar reaches New York to attend UN General Assembly session set to focus on Palestine</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reached New York on Monday to attend the United Nations General Assembly’s (UNGA) 80th session, where the Palestine issue and Gaza are set to dominate the proceedings.
The high-level segment of the UNGA session is to be held from September 22 to 26, with Pakistan’s delegation to be led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, according to the Foreign Office (FO). At the UN, PM Shehbaz will call for the resolution of the occupied Kashmir and Palestine issues.
“On arrival, FM Dar was received by Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN, Ambassador Rizwan Saeed Shiekh, Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States and senior officials of the Mission,” the FO said on X.
 






“The DPM/FM will have a busy programme in New York. Besides accompanying the PM to his many engagements, the DPM/FM will represent Pakistan in numerous ministerial and high-level meetings and also hold over a dozen bilateral meetings with his counterparts,” the statement added.
As nearly 150 world leaders gather to mark the UN’s 80th anniversary, the global peace forum finds itself surrounded by protests and engulfed in wars.
From its inception, the unresolved question of Palestine has haunted the UN, testing both its credibility and its capacity to deliver peace.
 
 

The high-level international conference for the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution”, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, aims to revive support for a two-state solution.
In a break with convention, the UNGA last week voted to allow Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to address the event by video link, after the US denied him and his delegation visas to attend the meeting.
PM Shehbaz to call for resolution of Palestine, Kashmir issues
PM Shehbaz, in his address to the UNGA, will “urge the international community to resolve the situations of prolonged occupation and denial of the right to self-determination” for India-occupied Kashmir and Palestine, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.
The premier will also draw the attention of the global community towards the “grave crisis in Gaza and call for decisive action to end the suffering of the Palestinians”.
“He will also highlight Pakistan’s perspective on the regional security situation, as well as other issues of international concern, including climate change, terrorism, Islamophobia, and sustainable development,” the report added.
The FO said yesterday that PM Shehbaz will be among the attendees of a meeting of “select” Muslim leaders with United States President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA session in New York to exchange views on issues pertaining to regional and international peace and security.
 






“The prime minister will have bilateral meetings on the sidelines with several world leaders and senior UN officials for exchange of views on issues of mutual interest,” the FO’s statement added.
“He will also underline Pakistan’s resolve to work with all UN Member States to uphold the UN Charter, prevent conflict, foster peace and promote global prosperity in Pakistan’s current role as a member of the Security Council.”

• Tarbela reaches full conservation level of 1,550 feet; Mangla nearly filled to brim
• Chashma Barrage also attains record storage level of 649 feet; officials expect minimal water shortage in Rabi season; wheat to benefit most
ISLAMABAD: After many years, Pakistan will begin the upcoming Rabi season with healthy carryover water storage of more than 13 million acre feet (MAF) in reservoirs, which may partially offset agriculture output losses caused by floods in the outgoing Kharif season.
“We expect water situation in Rabi season to be normal after many years”, said an official, adding that any shortage “will be minimal, bearable and manageable”. He noted that, after many years, we are also hopeful of having a reasonable carryover into the next Kharif season.
While Tarbela Dam reached its peak conservation level of 1,550 feet last month and has remained there, Mangla Dam is struggling at 1,239.6 feet as of Sunday night against its maximum conservation level of 1,242 feet, as river Jhelum flows remained low throughout the Kharif season.
As a result, Mangla’s storage was reported at 7.1MAF on Sunday night, compared to its maximum storage capacity of 7.277MAF. Officials, however, were not very hopeful about filling Mangla Dam to its capacity, as conservation was building very slowly with only 18,800 cusecs of inflow. Almost half of this (around 9,000 cusecs) was being released to Upper Jhelum Canal for drinking water needs. Mangla would require another 100,000 cusecs to attain maximum conservation, which appeared unlikely in the remaining nine days of the season.
Mangla storage had peaked at 1,233.25 feet at the end of Kharif 2023 and 1,224 feet in 2024. This meant that the country’s largest reservoir could not go beyond 5.9MAF last year, while it has already crossed 7.1MAF this year.
On the other hand, Tarbela Dam peaked to 1,548 feet in 2023 and 1,549 feet in 2024, compared to 1,550 feet this year. Chasma Barrage also attained its peak storage capacity of 649 feet this year, compared to 645 feet in 2023 and 646 feet last year.
As such, total storage has already crossed 13.1MAF, almost 99pc of the peak capacity of 13.3MAF. Last year, the storage had touched 11.388MAF. At present, all rivers are flowing at normal levels, except for medium floods at Kotri Barrage and Ganda Singhwala in the Sutlej River.
Given the reasonable quantities of water still in the irrigation system after the floods, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) has not yet scheduled meetings of its technical and advisory committees, as the provinces have not sought fresh allocations for water discharges.
 
 

Normally, both committees meet in the last week of September when provinces place indents for the first 10 days of Rabi.
Officials, however, cautioned that heavy sand deposits have been reported across farmlands due to the prolonged standing floodwaters in Punjab’s plains — unlike the usual fertile deposits that accompany floods. They said it was too early to predict the condition of agricultural lands until these areas are cleared of standing water.
Meetings of Irsa’s technical and advisory committees will be called once the floodwaters recede. An official said Sindh province usually places indents for Rabi crops, but this has not been the case this year, as it is still dealing with the flood situation.
Around 24MAF of water has already flowed into the sea since the beginning of the Kharif season on April 1 — almost double the combined storage capacity of the two major reservoirs — Tarbela and Mangla.
The total water requirement for Rabi crops, under the Water Apportionment Accord of 1991, is about 37-38MAF with the carryover from Kharif, water availability is expected to be close to 35-36MAF, along with river flows over the next six months.  The 1991 Water Accord empowers Irsa to determine water availability in the country and allocate the provinces’ share twice a year — for Kharif and Rabi seasons. Rabi season runs from Oct 1 to March 31, with wheat being largest crop. Other Rabi crops include gram, lentil, tobacco, rapeseed, barley and mustard.

The Indus River meets the sea in the coastal districts of Thatta and Sujawal through various creeks.
Flash floods triggered by extreme weather events this year were initially reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, resulting in massive loss of life and property.
Then, after a long time, floods were seen in the eastern rivers: Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej. Chenab had a massive flow of close to 1.1 million cusecs in late August, spelling disaster in south Punjab. Till the third week of September, the Punjab government remained busy in flood fighting.
 
 

That economic and infrastructural losses would be worth billions in two provinces was a foregone conclusion. Flooding and breaches caused widespread damage to the agriculture sector of the largest province, besides population displacement.
After a decade, a flow involving over 600,000 cusecs discharge passed through Guddu and Sukkur. Back in 2015, Guddu had passed 735,246 cusecs of flow after receiving a discharge of 754,005 cusecs on August 3, 2015. Sukkur received an inflow of 703,656 cusecs on Aug 4, passing 660,276 cusecs discharge downstream.

Water regulators and farmers anticipate a comfortable 2025-26 Rabi season after flood hardships and lost crops in May

Kotri barrage, however, had an inflow of 626,193 cusecs and an outflow of 600,018 cusecs in Sept 2022 but only on account of flooding from Balochistan that ended up in Manchhar Lake. The lake was breached to let flows enter the Indus River. Kotri, however, is expected to pass a discharge of 400,000-450,000 cusecs now.
As far as Sindh, the tail-end province of the Indus River system, is concerned, regeneration of riverine forests, replenishing of groundwater aquifers, growth in mangroves (coastal forests) and a relatively better Rabi crop season is now likely in view of this flooding. Floodwaters have inundated most of the low-lying riverine area and at some locations touched both dykes of the river. Even highlands in katcha areas were submerged, leading to the evacuation of dwellers.
Water regulators and farmers anticipate a comfortable 2025-26 Rabi season that will start in October. Last year 20 per cent water shortage was predicted by the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) in Rabi season, but Irsa’s Director of Operations Khalid Idrees Rana seems complacent.
“We are entering the Rabi season with a carryover in two reservoirs. Tarbela Dam currently has a storage of 5.8 million acre feet (MAF) and Mangla Dam 7 MAF, so Mangla is considered to have more storage capacity than Tarbela,” he explained.
He optimistically expects to have 1 MAF carryover cumulatively in Tarbela and Mangla Dams by March 31, 2026, when the Kharif season will commence — if the winter rainfall system remains supportive — and if the link canals’ operation are not be needed early in the season to divert water from the Indus to the Jhelum-Chenab zone. He mentioned that currently Mangla flows were being used only for the Upper Jhelum Canal, which doesn’t have any other water source. Inflows at Mangla had dropped only in Sept 2019; otherwise, it invariably had 25,000 to 30,000 cusecs of inflows.
Sindh’s member in Irsa, Mohammad Ehsan Leghari, pointed out that if run-of-the-river flows came into effect, the situation would be better. “Soil in many areas has moisture, thus needs less water for winter cropping. Still, the Irsa Advisory Committee will be in a better position in October to assess water availability,” he said.
 
 

This Kharif season, initially, severe water shortage had hit Sindh, especially at the time of flowering and fruit setting of mangoes. Furthermore, it had negative implications for cotton, whose acreage dropped significantly as per the agriculture department’s figures.
“It appears to be all good news for Sindh in terms of floods that offer a chance to the river’s ecosystem to live, although most of its riverine forests have been eradicated,” remarked Sindh Abadgar Board president Mahmood Nawaz Shah. Still, he said, floods have regenerated aquifers and water bodies.
“I don’t rule out bumper Kharif crops in the current year due to better water availability and beneficial rainfall,” he said. He, however, also called for modernising the irrigation system and said floods were once again a stark reminder for decision makers to free natural waterways.
 
 

River flows — a finite source — have brought plenty of silt, in addition to water flows, not only to benefit riverine soil for regeneration of the forests but also for improving the biodiversity of the belt. An informal assessment done by Vice Chancellor Sindh Agriculture University (SAU) Tandojam Prof Dr Altaf Siyal estimated 9.4 MAF conveyance losses of water from April to date between Guddu and Kotri barrages.
“A major part, or 80pc, of this 9.4 MAF has gone into soil through seepage, thus recharging the groundwater aquifer,” he said. According to the break-up of his calculation, out of 9.4 MAF, 2.4 MAF was recorded between Guddu and Sukkur and 7 7MAF between Sukkur and Kotri. Conveyance losses are more between Guddu and Sukkur (230 cusecs per km) than between Sukkur and Kotri (110 cusecs per km).

But even by our twisted standards, there is a strange dejection in the air the moment you enter Korangi or cross Mausamiyat in the afternoon.
It’s not because you have to take University Road (whatever patches exist) for the latter, but because the scorching sun directly shines on you, with hardly any trees to protect and just… a lot of dust.
Yet surprisingly, among the major urban centres in the country, Karachi had the lowest average PM2.5 reading of 47.1 micrograms per cubic meter, while Lahore was ahead of the rest at 102.1 g/m³. Such relative performance is absolutely meaningless, though, and should not at all be comforting because all of Pakistan’s major six cities were well above the World Health Organisation-prescribed concentration of 2.5 g/m³. To sum up, even the best performer is 19x beyond the acceptable threshold.
 
 

Of course, this is all stale information, and the problem has existed for decades. In fact, Lahore’s pollution concentration was already 33 g/m³ by 1998. At least from an outsider’s perspective, it feels like the whole conversation came into the limelight when our consultants in Islamabad sniffed out new funding opportunities early on. Not long after, the government probably wanted in too, seeing large projects from global development partners, along with the opportunity to make sympathetic and scapegoating statements at the Conference of the Parties (COP).
Does the hyperbole lead to any meaningful change? That depends on how you measure success. If the creation of new policy frameworks or reports qualifies, then we have something to cherish. However, by a relatively stricter barometer of real, on-ground progress in terms of, say, lower emissions, better waste management etc, there is little to show for.

The choice between economic opportunity and respiratory health shouldn’t define a generation’s future, yet for now, it remains Pakistan’s harsh reality

While this is true for climate change at large, where no country seems capable of riding against the wave, air pollution in comparison is a much narrower problem with local solutions. When Beijing decided to tackle its air quality crisis, air quality in northern Chinese cities improved by 35 per cent between 2013 and 2017 through comprehensive action plans. No international treaties or grandiose statements on the nature of global inequality were needed.
 
 

In a way, it probably also makes funding more challenging for donors like thinking big while local resources are practically always limited. However, the World Bank’s approval of $300 million for the Punjab Clean Air Program (PCAP) in March represents a landmark event in this regard, which will support the provincial government’s “Smog Mitigation Action Plan (SMAP) in key sectors such as transport, agriculture, industry, energy, and municipal services.
“Key interventions include the investment of 5,000 super seeders to reduce the main issue of the excessive seasonal fog, crop residue burning, the introduction of 600 electric buses to foster a modal shift to public transport, the expansion of regulatory-grade air quality monitoring stations across Punjab, and the enhancement of fuel quality testing through the establishment of two new fuel testing laboratories,” as per the original press release.
Some of the interventions will obviously overlap with the broader fight against climate change. According to the World Bank, a co-benefit of the PCAP’s reduction in PM2.5 is an estimated cut of 35.6m metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the next 12 years.
While such interventions are quite needed, the resources, by and large, have to come from locally. China illustrates this example quite well, where the central and provincial governments (of Hebei) committed $2 billion between 2017 and 2019 for combating air pollution. This amount was four times what the World Bank had provided as a loan in 2016.
Here too, the governments — federal, provincial, and if we ever come to that, local — need to play the biggest role in not only creating the awareness for driving behavioural change but also ensuring the carrots and sticks are in place. Plus, it’s not like if they don’t dole out funds for this purpose, there wouldn’t be costs. According to a slightly dated World Bank study, total welfare losses from air pollution in the country are estimated at almost 6pc of the gross domestic product.
Even leaving aside the opportunity costs, there are direct consequences for the lack of action, which are reflected in the health expenditure, which stood at Rs924bn as reported by provincial and central authorities.
 
 

According to the demographic survey 2020, almost 7.5pc of deaths were attributable to asthma and respiratory diseases, primarily caused by air pollution. While it is hard to pinpoint numbers, a Pakistan Bureau of Statistics dataset shows that at least over 10pc of out-of-pocket expenses happen to be on diseases that are exacerbated by air pollution.
Till then, there would always remain a trade-off between breathing clean air and making a professional career. Don’t hold on to the idea of counting stars in the deep midnight. The choice between economic opportunity and respiratory health shouldn’t define a generation’s future, yet for now, it remains Pakistan’s harsh reality.

Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, September 22nd, 2025</p><small>2025-09-22 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68d076238d559.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943776/bangladesh-and-indias-new-strategic-dilemma' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh and India’s new strategic dilemma</strong></a><br><p>A new phase of distancing between Bangladesh and India has been brought on by recent changes in bilateral trade along their shared border. Although India has traditionally viewed Bangladesh as a significant ally in South Asia, its current steps appear more severe, even punitive. Its displeasure with Dhaka’s political shift has been demonstrated by Delhi’s employing a range of strategies, including sudden trade restrictions, public demonstrations, and heightened strategic posturing.
India appears to be unhappy about the collapse of the Awami League government and the emergence of an interim government led by Dr Muhammad Yunus, despite it being a domestic issue. Delhi now faces a less predictable opponent after years of supporting the previous government. Border pressure, a diplomatic freeze, and trade retaliation seem to be more reactive than proactive.
Since May 7, India’s border force is said to have pushed more than 1,600 individuals into Bangladesh, including Indian citizens and the displaced Rohingya. Such actions are against international norms. During a vulnerable time of political transition, these unannounced arrivals have placed strain on Bangladesh’s internal security and the local government. This has also led to public discontent and instability. When pressure is put on Bangladesh’s security forces to react, there is a greater chance that the situation may escalate. The tactic fits into what some argue is a broader pattern in India’s regional playbook that disseminates political concepts through strategic pressure.
The issue is exacerbated by India’s aggressive efforts to upgrade its infrastructure. Over the past decade, India has effectively encircled Bangladesh with an extensive network of rivers, trains, and roads, connecting the northeast to the mainland. India possesses significant logistical capabilities, thanks to projects such as the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit via Myanmar and transportation corridors through Bangladesh.

New Delhi is unhappy after Dhaka’s recent diplomatic engagements with Pakistan

Dr Yunus’s statement that “Bangladesh is their sole path to the sea” was viewed as a strategic issue in Delhi due to the “landlocked” nature of the northeastern Indian provinces. In response, India has resumed military preparations around key locations and reactivated the airbase in Kailashahar, Tripura. Delhi is even more uneasy about Bangladesh’s decision to revive Lalmonirhat airport, given its proximity to the Siliguri Corridor.
 
 

Critical supply networks for Bangladeshi exports, which primarily include processed foods, apparel, and home goods, have been impacted by India’s sudden restrictions. Order delays and stopped shipments are affecting small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly those that supply to northeastern India.
This move, which is sometimes interpreted as a response to Bangladesh’s ban on importing Indian yarn, highlights the significant trade imbalance. In FY2023-24, Bangladesh exported less than $1.6 billion worth of goods to India, but imported approximately $9 billion worth of goods from there. Indian traders are also facing shortages and higher prices in West Bengal and the northeast. Electricity is another weakness. Approximately 2,500MW, or 17 percent of Bangladesh’s total electricity supply, is sourced from imports from India. Any disruption in this may cause serious problems for the urban and industrial sectors in Bangladesh.
When evaluating India’s current position, it is essential to consider broader geopolitical developments. Delhi is now on the defensive due to the Modi government’s return with a smaller mandate and growing international criticism, particularly from the US, on issues of religious freedom and democratic backsliding.
 


Not to be overlooked are Dhaka’s recent diplomatic engagements with Pakistan and China. Proposals for a humanitarian channel/corridor to Myanmar’s Rakhine state and preliminary talks on infrastructure cooperation between the three countries have heightened Indian concerns. Delhi is concerned about a shift in the strategic centre of the Bay of Bengal as it may diminish India’s long-standing influence over the region.
Employed initially as a catchphrase supporting democratic rebirth, the term “New Bangladesh” has come to be seen by Indian observers as a rejection of India’s long-standing role in Bangladesh. The diplomatic situation has become more complex as a result of this shift in narrative.
Back-channel communication has deteriorated, and high-level visits have slowed. In response to Dhaka’s repeated requests for cooperation based on respect for each other’s sovereignty, India has, at best, been reticent.
Bangladesh and India have a complex and multifaceted connection. Bangladesh provides India with essential access to its northeast, and India remains Bangladesh’s most significant regional business partner. However, the relationship is unbalanced. Bangladesh’s heavy reliance on Indian energy, trade, and transportation puts it at risk. Given their proximity and shared history, Dhaka should treat Delhi strategically.
 
 

Can Bangladesh and India put aside temporary solutions and create a cooperative, long-term partnership? This important topic has been brought to light by the current tensions.
Dialogue must be the first step in resolving the problem. Bangladesh should initiate high-level talks with partners in both public and private sectors. For managing border and trade challenges, a collaborative fra­mework is essential. Count­ermeasures or retaliation would not work.
Dhaka must also increase its diplomatic, energy, and commercial alternatives. One way to reduce an excessive dependence on any one source country is to participate in the forums of ASEAN partners, such as SAFTA and BIMSTEC.
At the same time, accepting the new political realities in Dhaka without seeing them as threats is the best course of action for India. There are other ties between the two countries besides trade and treaties. Historical events, waterways, and cultural relations are all comparable. However, both sides now need to be mature enough to sustain this relationship. The current circumstance is a test of vision, strategy, and diplomacy. The choices made in Dhaka and Delhi will have an impact not only on their bilateral relationship but also on the larger South Asian regional order.
Instead of writing provocatively, let us write the next chapter cooperatively and practically.

Starmer’s “global talent task force” is working on ideas to attract the world’s best scientists, academics and digital experts to the UK in a bid to drive economic growth, the report said, citing people briefed on the discussions inside Number 10 and the Treasury.
The idea of cutting visa costs to zero is for people who have attended the world’s top five universities or have won prestigious prizes, an official told the newspaper.
According to the report, the reforms were being discussed in Number 10 and the Treasury before the Trump administration announced its decision to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas, which are widely used by US tech companies, from Sunday.
 
 

The US decision, however, has put “wind in the sails” to those pushing for changes to Britain’s high-end visa system, aiming to spur growth ahead of the November 26 Budget, a person involved in the UK discussions told FT.
Britain’s global talent visa application costs 766 pounds ($1,030), with partners and children paying the same fee.

Residents and Rescue 1122 officials said the incident occurred on the main Khar-Nawagai Road in the Khazana area within the jurisdiction of Lowi Sam police station.
They told Dawn that Mir Azam Khan, 45, was heading to his home in Khazana Dag area when unknown assailants opened fire on him, leaving him critically injured.
Amjad Khan, district emergency officer of Rescue 1122, said the injured was shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, Khar, where the doctors pronounced him dead upon arrival at the hospital’s emergency.
No one claimed responsibility for the incident.
Soon after the murder, several ANP leaders and workers also took to the social media to condemn the killing.
ANP local chapter president Gul Afzal Khan, deputy general secretary Sadiq Akbar Jan, provincial joint secretary Shah Naseer Khan, Sheikh Jan Zada, and party’s local MPA Mohammad Nisar Khan condemned the killing of Azam Khan, who was additional general secretary of ANP Khar tehsil.
The ANP leaders demanded the early arrest of those responsible for the incident.
Meanwhile, ANP provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain and general secretary Hussain Shah Yousafzai also condemned the killing and called his murder failure of the government to ensure safety and security of people.
In a post shared on ANP’s official Facebook page on Sunday evening, both the leaders expressed concerns and sorrow over the murder of Mr Khan.
They noted that the incident occurred near a police post.
They mentioned that earlier, Maulana Khan Zeb was also killed by unknown assailants in Bajaur, but the killers still remained at large, showing the government’s failure to maintain peace in the region.
“We urge the government to immediately arrest those involved in both the killings.“

At least 88 minors were among the initial count of 216 taken into custody on Sunday as police deployed water cannons and deafening sirens against crowds of mostly young, rock-throwing protesters.
Manila City Mayor Isko Morena said a 12-year-old boy was the youngest detained.
Thousands of Filipinos rallied in Manila on Sunday to vent their anger over a ballooning scandal involving bogus flood-control projects believed to have cost taxpayers billions of dollars.
 


The scandal has seen numerous lawmakers implicated and the leaders of both houses of Congress step down from their positions during an investigation.
But Sunday’s street battles, which saw multiple police vehicles set ablaze and the windows of a precinct headquarters shattered, threatened to overshadow demonstrations that had been filled with families, activists, clergy and politicians.
“So far, none of them are saying the reasons behind their actions or if somebody paid them to do it,“ regional police spokesperson Major Hazel Asilo told AFP.
“As soon as we know their affiliations, we can know if they were part of the protesters or if they were just causing trouble,” she added.
According to a statement released on Monday by the Department of Health, about 50 people were brought to a single Manila hospital following the clashes.
Another police spokesperson, Major Philipp Ines, said 93 officers had been injured on Sunday, while adding the number of arrested could yet rise as people were still being processed.
Rage over the so-called ghost infrastructure projects has been mounting in the Southeast Asian country since President Ferdinand Marcos put them centre stage in a July state of the nation address that followed weeks of deadly flooding.
 
 

The Department of Finance has estimated that the Philippine economy lost up to 118.5 billion pesos ($2bn) from 2023 to 2025 due to corruption in flood control projects.
Greenpeace has suggested the number is actually closer to $18bn.
The Philippines on Monday was expecting heavy flooding once more as Super Typhoon Ragasa bore down on the country’s northernmost provinces.

• Responsibility for Pakistan, Afghanistan shifted to WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region
• Report terms Pakistan’s claims of progress from 2021-23 ‘likely by-product of Covid prevention measures’
ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan reports 26 new polio cases this year, the global polio monitoring board has issued a stark warning that efforts to eradicate the disease are failing.
After 37 years and $22 billion invested, the world has reached an “inflection point” where, traditional methods offer diminishing returns, the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) on polio said in its latest report.
The ‘glass mountain’ of polio eradication has proven unclimbable through conventional methods, it says, calling for fresh thinking and unambiguous country ownership to achieve success.
In a letter to World Health Organisation Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, IMB Chair­man Sir Liam Donaldson said the report, titled ‘The Glass Mountain’ arrives at a critical juncture.
“The confluence of persistent viral transmission, unprecedented geopolitical disruption, and severe financial constraints has created conditions that fundamentally challenge the programme’s survival and success,” Mr Donaldson wrote.
He noted that early optimism in 2023 has been replaced by the “stark reality of resurgence,” as historical reservoirs of the virus — a reference to Pakistan and Afghanistan — have been reinfected.
The IMB, which works on behalf of international donor agencies, said that fresh thinking, institutional courage, strategic realism, and unambiguous country ownership were the only paths to success.
The board identified several “systemic intractable weaknesses” hobbling the programme, including “performance-blind funding mechanisms that provide resources regardless of outcomes; fragmented integration approaches that fail to leverage synergies with essential immunisation; lack of country ownership and transactional behaviour; and accountability systems that generate reports rather than consequences.”
To address these deep-rooted issues, a fundamental shift in strategy and accountability is proposed.
 
 

The IMB has suggested moving responsibility for stopping wild poliovirus in Pakistan and Afghanistan to the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional (EMRO) Ministerial Polio Subcommittee.
This, Mr Donaldson argued, could combat the persistent “perception that polio eradication is something ‘the West wants’ rather than a regional priority,” potentially reducing community hostility, boycotts, and security threats that have resulted in the deaths of polio workers and police officers, especially in Pakistan.
This proposal has now been formalised, as the polio oversight board adopted the 2026 GPEI Action Plan on Sunday.
In a post on X, Hanan Balkhy, the regional director for WHO-EMRO said the coming low transmission season offers the best chance to stop wild poliovirus in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Mr Donaldson’s letter also pointed to a dramatically altered geopolitical landscape, citing major disruptions to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
“The United States withdrawal from WHO, the dismantling of USAID, and the severe curtailment of CDC’s global health mandate represent the most significant disruption in GPEI history,” Sir Donaldson stated.
It also noted that since the report was finalised, there had been two serious monsoon-related floods in  different parts of Pakistan, an earthquake in Afghanistan, a child malnutrition crisis in  Borneo and a potential peace settlement in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, which have changed the operating landscape for polio.
Pakistan’s claims challenged
The report also challenges Pakistan’s recent claims of progress. While Islamabad asserts it had interrupted polio transmission from 2021 to 2023, the IMB said this was likely an inadvertent result of Covid restrictions, that were “hostile to poliovirus spread”, rather than an outcome of programmatic improvements.
The operating environment for polio is constantly shifting. After the IMB meeting and as  the report was being finalised, there were: two serious monsoon-related floods in  different parts of Pakistan, an earthquake in Afghanistan, a child malnutrition crisis in  Borno and a potential peace settlement in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
A Pakistani polio expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, agreed with the IMB’s assessment, highlighting an absence of accountability, innovation, and integration.
“Interestingly, as usual, government’s ownership despite PM’s intense engagement has been questioned,” the expert said. “This IMB report questions the money and time spent against the targets and in midst of virus circulation and resurfacing has questions the viability of the program.”
As a solution, the expert suggested “shifting the management and ownership in real sense to the government, restructuring the program, integrating with EPI and holding the chronic poor performers to account at the high level can address the issues”.

•  Says any project in Karachi should be executed through local agencies
KARACHI: The municipal leadership of Karachi has challenged the authority of the federal government by questioning the role of its Pakistan Infrastructure Development Company Ltd (PIDCL) in the urban development projects, insisting that all such initiatives in Karachi should fall under the city’s municipal jurisdiction.
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), backed by the PPP-led Sindh government, has halted the federally funded Rs6 billion project of the Green Line Bus extension, citing the PIDCL’s failure to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from municipal authorities before restarting the work.
After the abolition of the Pakistan Works Department, the federal government assigns uplift works to the PIDCL, established under the Companies Act, 2017, in different parts of the country.
The work on the Green Line extension was restarted more than nine years after its ground-breaking around two weeks ago.
However, the construction between the Numaish intersection and the Municipal Park near Jama Cloth Market was stopped by Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab last week, citing “procedural violations”.
KMC officials said that an NOC was not issued “in perpetuity”, and the PIDCL was required to secure a fresh approval for the work on the BRT extension phase.
In a statement, the mayor also presented a demand of rehabilitation of infrastructure, which was damaged during the construction work of the first phase of the project completed more than three years ago.
He said due to the negligence and mismanagement of “other institutions”, citizens of Karachi and the KMC continued to bear the brunt of criticism and inconvenience.
However, the situation is far more complex. In a conversation with Dawn, Karachi Mayor Wahab spoke openly, expressing his desire to completely exclude the PIDCL from the city’s infrastructure development works.
“Yes, absolutely,” he responded without hesitation when asked if he wished to “minus” the PIDCL from Karachi’s development projects.
“Any project in Karachi — regardless of whether it’s funded by the federal government — should be executed through local agencies,” Mayor Wahab asserted.
“If a project pertains to a town, then the respective of town administration should handle it. If it concerns the city as a whole, we [KMC] will take responsibility. We are the ones answerable to the people — they come to us with questions. Most of them don’t even know who the head of PIDCL is.”
The mayor said he had the full backing of the Sindh government in perusing this policy.
He added that he had even raised concerns over the slow progress of the Red Line BRT project, which is being executed by the provincial administration.
“But there’s a difference,” he explained. “I’m part of the advisory body overseeing the execution of the Red Line BRT. I raise questions in meetings, I demand explanations, and I get a clear picture of what’s happening. But when it comes to the PIDCL-led Green Line project, I’m completely in the dark — yet I’m still held accountable and face public criticism.”
As the city administration sticks firm to its demands, the federal government appears to be little impressed over the objections raised by the mayor on the extension of the Green Line BRT project. It has not formally responded to the KMC’s concerns despite passage of several days after suspension of the work.
A source privy to the situation said that the PIDCL officials made an immediate contact with the mayor when the work was stopped.
It was decided between the two sides that they would sit together on Friday last to sort out issues.
“But since then no meeting has been held,” said the sources. “The federal authorities now believe that the matter lies between the Karachi mayor and the contractor. As for the NOC, the PIDCL is already in possession of one issued by the KMC in October 2017, rendering the current argument over the NOC irrelevant,” they added.

For Pakistan, that is.
In launching his unprovoked attack on Pakistan and getting a bloody nose in return, he not only succeeded in puncturing India’s aura but also, crucially, showed the world that Pakistan’s military is very much capable of taking on a much larger adversary armed with the latest military tech from around the world. No one was more surprised by this than Pakistanis themselves.
Next, we should also thank Modi’s ally and ideological twin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who — deep in the throes of an unquenchable bloodlust and feeling absolutely invincible — conducted air strikes in the capital of Qatar, purportedly to assassinate Hamas leaders who were meeting there.
 
 

While he did not achieve his stated objectives, he has almost certainly succeeded in making the Gulf states consider exactly what a US defence shield is worth, when it is ineffective in curbing Israeli aggression.
It has also certainly caused those states to consider that Israel’s expansionist agenda encompasses the entire region and not ‘just’ Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. Here we see a perfect example of the application of the law of unintended consequences.

The pact reverses the drift between Islamabad and Riyadh.

This then starts a serious conversation about how to hedge against uncertainty in a world that is, and will remain, in serious strategic flux. And one way to do that is by means of bilateral, and perhaps even eventually multilateral and regional, security pacts.
The deal signed between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia can thus be correctly seen in that context, and while it is in many ways a culmination of the decades-long relationship between the two states and was certainly in the works for some time, I have little doubt that the Israeli attacks on Doha added a very real sense of urgency.
 
 

What this pact also does is to reverse what had been a clear drift between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. We would do well to recall that Pakistan had previously resisted Saudi entreaties to join in their war against Yemen, and the refusal to do so had indeed soured relations to a considerable extent. This period also saw Saudi Arabia, along with other Gulf states, move closer to India, to Pakistan’s detriment.
That this trend seems to be halting may also have to do with India’s very clear alliance with Israel — recently the Gaza genocide’s poster boy, Israeli minister Bezalel Smotrich, was in India to sign a bilateral treaty and Modi took over 24 hours to condemn the attacks on Doha, without once even naming Israel. While this does not entail any sort of actual break between the Gulf states and India, it should provoke a rethink.
 
 

Naturally there are some very real questions and concerns in Pakistan as to what this pact would actually entail. If India were to attack Pakistan again, would Saudi Arabia deploy its troops in defence of Pakistan?
To be frank, this is unlikely at best, and would not even be something Pakistan needs. What this pact will do, however, is raise the costs of any future aggression by India and complicate their strategic calculations. If the details of the pact are ambiguous, then that is by design.
Other voices in Pakistan are (habi­tually) asking whe­ther this means that the country will once again become embroiled in ‘some-one else’s war’ and concerns are being raised as to whe­ther the true target of this pact is Iran. Now, had this pact been signed a few years or even a few months ago, then this would have been a valid concern.
 
 

But with Iran no longer the existential threat it was considered to be by the Gulf states pre-Oct 7, 2023, and very clear signals of rapprochement between Riyadh and Tehran, this sort of thinking should be considered the concerns of a by­­gone era. It is worth noting that a few days before this pact was signed, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hosted Iran’s Ali Larijani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, in Riyadh.
As for the rest of the Gulf states, the pact provides a template for similar agreements. Qatar, given its close relations with Turkiye, could opt for a similar arrangement with Ankara, which then could also be extended to Pakistan.
Here, the real wild card is the UAE, which, with its destabilising tentacles spread as far afield as Libya and Sudan, will likely remain aloof, trusting in its close relations with Israel to keep the peace.

Speaking at a gathering of overseas Pakistanis in London, the prime minister said that Pakistan wanted to hold dialogue with India on contentious issues like Kashmir, terrorism, water and trade on the basis of equality.
The prime minister said that without the resolution of the Kashmir issue, which was the key to the regional peace, bilateral ties between the two countries could not be established.
“Anyone who is thinking otherwise is akin to living in a fool’s paradise,” he said, adding that Kashmiris would get their right to self-determination and freedom.

Expresses grief over 64,000 deaths, grave humanitarian situation in Gaza

“I have made this offer so many times in the past. We want to discuss Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism issues, not because of any weakness but on the basis of equal terms,” the prime minister said.
After visiting Saudi Arabia, PM Shehbaz made a stopover in London for four days and then he will proceed to the US on Monday to attend United Nations General Assembly conference.
He said that as the ceasefire between Pakistan and India had been achieved, Pakistan wanted peace, progress and prosperity and an end to unemployment and poverty.
Underlining the significance of unity and solidarity which led to triumph in the recent armed conflict with India, PM Shehbaz pledged to guide the country on the path of progress and prosperity.
The prime minister said that after India’s baseless allegations over Pah­algam incident, he had offered, during his visit to Kakul, a probe by an international committee into the incident in a fair, impartial and transparent manner, but India did not respond to his offer.
On May 6, aggression was unleashed against the innocent civilians and civilian assets were attacked inside Pakistan, leading to causalities, he said, adding that Pakistan in its right of defence, downed six enemy’s fighter jets in one go which made the enemy realise its precarious position.
 
 

Expressing his grief over 64,000 deaths and grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, he said the world had not witnessed such heart-wrenching scenes
The prime minister called upon the Islamic world and the international community to come forward and address the issue urgently.
He said that on the basis of hard work of overseas Pakistanis, in the previous year, the country received $38.5 billion in remittances, adding that without this contribution of overseas Pakistanis, the country’s economy could not move forward.
He said the country’s economic indicators were showing upward trends and at the diplomatic front, the country was strengthening its ties and position.
Speaking on the occasion, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar said that overseas Pakistanis were the country’s diplomats.
He said in the year 2022, when the incumbent government came to power, it was a difficult time as the country was at the verge of default, and the global rating agencies and institutions were setting dates in this regard.
He said the nation saluted the prime minister for his dynamic leadership that ensured economic turnaround.
Enumerating the downward trends in the inflation and interest rates, he resolved that the government was striving for the economic empowerment.
Referring to the Indian aggression, he said Pakistan defeated an enemy that boasted of its armed power and regional net security provider, adding that the myth was buried on May 10.
Referring to climate change impact, Mr Dar said that Pakistan was vulnerable to climate change and the government was devising projects so that in the coming years, the country could be able to cope with this challenge.
He said the government was also raising its voice for the equality and justice, because the climate change was a matter of justice, not only for Pakistan but for any country suffering from the emissions worldwide.

The UN headquarters, serene in the early morning, turns restless as the day advances.
The plaza outside has become a veritable Hyde Park, with anti-Israel activists rallying daily under the banner ‘Stop Starving Gaza’, while pro-Israel groups stage counter-protests nearby.
Pakistanis and Kashmiris are present too, protesting the possible execution of Yasin Malik. Ukrainians and victims of other conflicts join in, turning the forecourt into a chorus of grievances.
As nearly 150 world leaders gather to mark the UN’s 80th anniversary, the global peace forum finds itself surrounded by protests and engulfed in wars.
 
 

From its inception, the unresolved question of Palestine has haunted the UN, testing both its credibility and its capacity to deliver peace.
The high-level international conference for the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, aims to revive support for a two-state solution.
In a break with convention, the General Assembly has also voted to allow Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to address the event by video link, after the US denied him and his delegation visas to attend the meeting.
Washington has urged countries not to rush into recognizing Palestinian statehood and has warned of visa restrictions on the Palestinian delegation, and President Donald Trump will be closely watched when he addresses the General Assembly on Tuesday.

“The mother, the boy, the girl, and the baby in her womb — we found them all gone,” said Mosallam Al-Hadad, the dead woman’s father-in-law, saying his son had been seriously injured in the strike. “(He) was in a critical condition. We took him to the hospital, and his leg was amputated,” Hadad said.
Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 65,283 people and wounded 166,575 since October 2023. Thousands more are believed to be buried under the rubble. The strikes on besieged Palestinian territory also caused famine and displaced the territory’s population — in many cases multiple times.
On Sunday, a number of Pales­tinians were attacked by Israeli settlers in a village south of Hebron in the occupied West Bank, according to Al Jazeera Arabic, quoting local sources. The assault took place in the area of Khirbet Haribat al-Nabi in Masafer Yatta, a collection of Pale­stinian villages that have repeatedly been subjected to settler violence.

Senior doctor rejects Israeli military’s claim about Hamas sniper, saying his brother was visually impaired

Just a day ago, nearly 90 Palestinians were killed by Israeli strikes across the territory, most of them in Gaza City.
Hamas sniper?
The Israeli military claimed on Sunday it had killed a Hamas sniper in a strike the day before, but a senior Gaza doctor who is the man’s brother rejected the claim as “a lie and slander”, saying his sibling was visually impaired.
Mohammed Abu Salmiya, director of Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital, had been working in the emergency department on Saturday when his brother and sister-in-law’s bodies were brought in, telling AFP at the time that they were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza City. He rejected the Israeli military’s accusation about Hamas sniper as “a lie, slander and an unacceptable justification for targeting civilians with direct missile strikes”.
“My brother is a 57-year-old man who suffers from several illnesses such as high blood pressure and diabetes, and he has severe vision impairment — and they claim he was a sniper? This is pure fabrication,” he told AFP, noting his brother’s family had been displaced several times over the past two years.
In recent weeks, the Israeli military has launched a heavy air and ground assault on Gaza City, claiming that it was an effort aimed at eliminating Hamas from the territory’s largest urban hub.
 
 

On Sunday, witnesses said Israeli tanks were advancing towards the west through Tel Al-Hawa, a southeastern suburb.
The Israeli military estimates that over 450,000 people have left the city since the start of September. Hamas authorities dispute this, saying under 300,000 left and that nearly a million people remain des­pite ongoing shelling. The offensive has also alarmed many Israelis, as thousands rallied on Saturday night outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem, calling on him to end the war.

• NHA says four of six lanes damaged but denies complete washout
• NDMA reports 1,006 deaths; over 3m rescued in flood-hit areas
• Millions displaced, infrastructure in ruins
LAHORE: The Sutlej River continued to maintain a med­ium-level flood at Ganda Singh Wala and Sulemanki headworks on Sunday, with authorities monitoring its steady rise as waters inundated areas across Lodhran, Multan and Bahawalpur districts.
According to a Provincial Disaster Management Auth­ority (PDMA) report, the river flowed at 95,000 cusecs at Ganda Singh Wala and 82,000 cusecs at Sulemanki, with the latter volume expected to reach Jalalpur Pirwala within the next day or two, potentially raising water levels further in already affected regions.
Meanwhile, flood levels in the Chenab and Ravi rivers were reported as normal, with key readings showing 43,000 cusecs at Marala, 38,000 cusecs at Khanki Headworks, and 37,000 cusecs at Qadirabad on the Chenab, while the Ravi recorded flows of 7,000 cusecs at Jassar, 9,000 cusecs at Shahdara, and 28,000 cusecs at Head Sidhnai.
The Sutlej River water has been continuously rising since Sunday morning and inundating the flood-affected areas in Lodhran, Multan and Bahawalpur.
The water is passing from three to four breaches on the Noraja Bhutta embankment and rising around the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5) from Jhangra in the Bahawalpur district to Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil in the Multan district.
As the water level started receding in the Chenab River, the people from the western side of Jalalpur Pirwala had started returning to their villages.
In Alipur tehsil of Muzaffargarh district, the government was making efforts to fill the breaches on dykes and roads damaged by floods. A temporary bridge was constructed at Seetpur Road and opened for the public in Alipur. Repair work was also started to fill dykes in Kul Kanwal, Khairpur Saadat, basti Azeem Shah and Sultanpur-Khairpur Road.
 
 

The M5 motorway remained closed for a ninth consecutive day due to flood damage at six locations, with motorway police implementing diversions at Shah Shams and Uch Sharif interchanges.
Motorway police spokesperson confirmed that the M5 in Multan would remain closed for now due to flood-related damage.
He said that floodwaters have affected the motorway at six different locations and authorities were actively working to prevent further damage by filling cracks with stones.
National Highways and Motorway Police said traffic from Multan to Sukkur was being diverted from Shah Shams Interchange to G.T. Road, with re-entry at Uch Sharif, while vehicles from Sukkur to Multan were diverted from Uch Sharif to G.T. Road and allowed to rejoin at Sher Shah Interchange.
NHA General Manager Kashif Nawaz told Dawn that four of six lanes had been damaged at some points but denied reports of a complete washout. “Some interchanges are still underwater and traffic cannot be allowed until safety is ensured,” he added.
Multan Commissioner Amir Karim Khan inspected the old flood embankments of Jalalpur Pirwala and the affected motorway section, declaring the old embankments safe. At Noraja Bhutta, he identified four breaches and directed the Irrigation Department to expedite repairs to prevent ponding along the motorway.
The commissioner also visited relief camps, met affected families and instructed departments to improve facilities. He confirmed that floods had disrupted repair work on a damaged Sui gas pipeline.
The Multan district administration said emergency repairs of flood-hit roads and electricity infrastructure had begun.
Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said heavy machinery and special teams had been deployed to assess damages, restore link roads and drain water. A door-to-door survey would soon begin in affected areas, while medical teams were conducting disinfection and health interventions.
Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Hussain Pirzada said the government was taking all measures to protect Jalalpur Pirwala, with technical committees monitoring embankments.
Punjab Agriculture Sec­retary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo visited relief camps to review arrangements for livestock feed and urged owners to move cattle to dry areas, provide clean water and seek veterinary care.
Over 3m rescued
The National Disaster Mana­ge­ment Authority (NDMA) said on Sunday that more than 3.02 million people have been rescued in nearly 5,800 operations since June 26.
According to the latest figures, 3,020,130 individuals have been evacuated in 5,768 rescue operations carried out with the coordinated efforts of the NDMA, provincial authorities, the Pakistan Army and other agencies.
Punjab accounted for the largest share with 2.81m rescues in 4,749 operations, followed by Sindh with 184,011 in 753 operations. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 14,317 rescues, Gilgit-Baltistan 1,027, Azad Jammu and Kashmir 940, Islamabad 49, and Balochistan 19.
The NDMA said that at least 1,006 people lost their lives due to torrential rains and flash flooding, including 275 children, 568 men and 163 women.
KP recorded the highest number of fatalities with 504 deaths, while Punjab reported 304, Sindh 80, Balochistan 30, Gilgit-Baltistan 41, AJK 38 and Islamabad nine.

Twelve people have died in the past 24 hours while 740 new patients have been hospitalised with the mosquito-borne disease, the directorate general of health services said on Sunday. 
Dengue has killed at least 179 people and infected nearly 42,000 nationwide so far this year.
Children are increasingly crowding into hospital wards, many arriving with high fever, rashes, and dehydration. Some develop severe complications.

Changing weather patterns are worsening the outbreak, entomologists say

Entomologists say changing weather patterns are worsening the outbreak. The monsoon is stretching longer than usual, creating standing water almost everywhere, said Kabirul Bashar, a zoology professor at Jahangirnagar University. “This prolonged wet season is giving mosquitoes more time and space to breed, and it is intensifying the outbreak.”
Bangladesh’s rapid urbanisation, poor waste management, and stagnant water at construction sites have further expanded mosquito breeding grounds.
With hospitals under strain and infections climbing steadily, doctors fear the crisis will deepen in the coming weeks.
Children are more vulnerable to rapid fluid loss and shock, which makes severe dengue extremely dangerous for them, said physician ABM Abdullah, urging parents not to ignore early symptoms like a persistent fever or bleeding gums.
The worst year on record for Bangladesh was 2023, when dengue killed 1,705 people and infected more than 321,000. 
Experts fear that without stro­nger preventive measures such dea­dly cycles will continue.

In a statement from his office, CM Bugti said that the killing could not be condemned enough and hailed Baqi as a “dutiful, hardworking and capable officer who discharged his responsibilities with honesty and integrity”.
“The martyred Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Afzal sacrificed his life while fulfilling his responsibilities and will live on in the hearts of the people,” the statement read.
While paying tribute to the martyred AC and his son, he said that their deaths would not be in vain.
“[The CM] made it clear that the killers of innocent people and enemies of peace will never be able to escape their fate,” the statement read. “The sacrifices of the martyrs are a beacon [of] light in the journey of establishing peace and stability in Balochistan.”
The AC and his son were kidnapped in August by armed suspects while on a picnic in the Zezri area, Ziarat Deputy Commissioner Zakaullah Durrani said.
According to Durrani, Baqi and his son were taken to an unknown location after the suspects stopped the vehicle at gunpoint and ordered everyone to abandon it before setting it on fire. They released Afzal’s gunman, driver and other family members but forced the official and his son to go with them.
The DC said on August 13 that a search operation by security forces was active in the area for to recover AC Baqi and his son and that elders from different tribes were also contacted to use their influence to get the officer released.
According to Durrani, no organisation or group claimed responsibility. The local administration had announced a Rs50 million reward for providing information about the whereabouts of the kidnappers.</p><small>2025-09-21 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/212051007d8361f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943699/trump-vows-to-defend-poland-baltic-states-if-russia-escalates' target='_blank'><strong>Trump vows to defend Poland, Baltic states if Russia escalates</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Sunday said he would defend Poland and the Baltic states in case of an escalation from Russia, following Moscow’s incursion into Estonia’s airspace.
Asked whether he would help defend the EU members if Russia intensifies hostilities, Trump told reporters: “Yeah, I would. I would.” Estonia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday following Friday’s incursion.
Three Russian MiG-31 fighters violated Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland, triggering complaints of a dangerous new provocation from the European Union and Nato, but a denial from Moscow.
Italian F-35 fighters attached to Nato’s air defence support mission in the Baltic states, along with Swedish and Finnish aircraft, were scrambled to intercept the Russian jets and warn them off.
Asked whether he had been briefed on the situation in Estonia, Trump answered in the affirmative and added: “We don’t like it.” His statement came about two weeks after some 17 Russian drones violated Polish airspace, in an incident that Trump then sought to downplay.
“It could have been a mistake,” Trump told journalists on September 11.</p><small>2025-09-21 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/21192114d0a2b4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943686/uk-australia-and-canada-formally-recognise-palestinian-state' target='_blank'><strong>UK, Australia and Canada formally recognise Palestinian state</strong></a><br><p>Britain, Australia and Canada on Sunday recognised a Palestinian state in a seismic shift in decades of Western foreign policy, triggering swift Israeli anger.
Portugal was also to recognise Palestinian statehood later on Sunday, as Israel came under huge international pressure over the conflict in Gaza triggered almost two years ago by the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.
“Today, to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two-state solution, the United Kingdom formally recognises the State of Palestine,” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a message on X.
 






Britain and Canada became the first G7 countries to take the step, with France and other nations expected to follow at the annual UN General Assembly, which opens Monday in New York.
“Canada recognises the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the State of Palestine and the State of Israel,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote on X.
 






Meanwhile, Australia announced it “formally recognises the independent and sovereign State of Palestine”, according to a post on X by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
“In doing so, Australia recognises the legitimate and long-held aspirations of the people of Palestine to a state of their own,” Albanese said in a statement as his country joined other major Western nations in increasing pressure on Israel to end the conflict in Gaza.
“Today’s act of recognition reflects Australia’s longstanding commitment to a two-state solution, which has always been the only path to enduring peace and security for the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples.”
 






It is a watershed moment for Palestinians and their decades-long ambitions for statehood, with the most powerful Western nations having long argued it should only come as part of a negotiated peace deal with Israel.
 
 

Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said that Britain, Canada and Australia’s recognition of a Palestinian state was a necessary step toward lasting peace in the region.
Welcoming the move by the three countries, Abbas said, “It constitutes an important and necessary step toward achieving a just and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy,” according to a statement by his office.
Abbas also called for a ceasefire in Gaza.
“He emphasised that today’s priorities are achieving a ceasefire, allowing humanitarian aid to enter, securing the release of all hostages and prisoners, ensuring Israel’s complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, enabling the State of Palestine to assume full responsibilities, advancing recovery and reconstruction and halting settlement activity and settler violence, “the statement added.
A senior Hamas official hailed the three nations’ recognition of a Palestinian state, describing it as a victory for the rights of Palestinians.
“These developments represent a victory for Palestinian rights and the justice of our cause, and send a clear message: no matter how far the occupation goes in its crimes, it will never be able to erase our national rights,” Mahmud Mardawi told AFP.
But the move puts those countries at odds with the United States and Israel, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacting angrily and vowing to oppose it at the UN talks.
Calls for a Palestinian state “would endanger our existence and serve as [an] absurd reward for terrorism,” Netanyahu said on Sunday.
A growing number of longtime allies have shifted positions, as Israel has intensified its Gaza offensive, vowing to eliminate Hamas.
The Gaza Strip has suffered vast destruction, a spiralling death toll and a lack of food that has sparked a major humanitarian crisis since the start of the conflict, which has drawn an international outcry.
‘Special burden’
The UK government has come under increasing public pressure to act, with thousands rallying every month on the streets. A poll released by YouGov on Friday showed two-thirds of young Britons aged 18-25 supported Palestinian statehood.
Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy acknowledged at the UN in July that “Britain bears a special burden of responsibility to support the two-state solution”.
Over a century ago, the UK was pivotal in laying the groundwork for the creation of the state of Israel through the 1917 Balfour Declaration.
Three-quarters of UN members already recognise Palestinian statehood, with over 140 of the 193 having taken the step.
Starmer said in July that his Labour government intended to recognise a Palestinian State unless Israel took “substantive” steps, including reaching a ceasefire in Gaza, getting more aid into the territory and confirming it would not annex the West Bank.
 
 

Starmer has also repeatedly called on Hamas to release the remaining hostages they captured in the 2023 attack, and is expected to set out new sanctions on the Palestinian group.
Lammy told the BBC on Sunday that the Palestinian Authority — the civilian body that governs in areas of the West Bank — had been calling for the move for some time, “and I think a lot of that is wrapped up in hope”.
“Will this feed children? No, it won’t, that’s down to humanitarian aid. Will this free hostages? That must be down to a ceasefire.” But he said it was an attempt to “hold out for” a two-state solution.
Palestinian foreign minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin told AFP last week: “Recognition is not symbolic. It sends a very clear message to the Israelis on their illusions on continuing their occupation forever,” she said.
‘Worrying evolution’
Hamas’s 2023 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed at least 65,208 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.
Portugal said that it would also formally declare its recognition in New York on Sunday.
“By acting now, as the Portuguese government has decided, we’re keeping alive the possibility of having two states,” Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said.</p><small>2025-09-21 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/211744439207e34.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943679/afghan-govt-spokesperson-says-leaders-shouldnt-make-provocative-statements-stresses-need-for-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan govt spokesperson says leaders shouldn’t make ‘provocative’ statements, stresses need for talks</strong></a><br><p>The spokesperson for the Taliban government in Afghanistan Zabiullah Mujahid has said that leaders should refrain from making “provocative” statements and that his country could not be held responsible for attacks taking place in Pakistan.
Mujahid’s remarks come as Pakistan continues to raise alarm over terrorist outfits, particularly the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), using Afghan soil to carry out attacks across the border. Islamabad has repeatedly urged Kabul to choose between maintaining ties with its neighbour or harbouring terrorists, but Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations.
He made these remarks during an interview with Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies. According to Gul, the interview — conducted in the Pushto language — was recorded during his recent visit to Afghanistan’s Kandahar province.
 


During the interview, Gul sought proposals from Mujahid to address recurring problems, such as the issue of TTP or “the negative propaganda in the media that harms and poisons the relations” between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The spokesperson was also asked whether he felt the need for some sort of “joint mechanism” on such matters.
In his response, Mujahid emphasised that leaders should avoid making “provocative” statements. If statements having “threatening” undertones were issued, “we cannot stop” others, he asserted. The Taliban government spokesperson went on to say that “giving statements to the media, spoiling the environment and taking military action is unwise”.
Instead, he stressed that talks should be held. “There should be more visits, which would create trust on both sides,” Mujahid added.
He said his government was “unhappy with the current environment and propaganda that was happening presently” as it was not in the interest of either Pakistan or Afghanistan.
Mujahid also highlighted that attacks by militants and terrorists in Pakistan were not a recent occurrence. “It has been happening since 2003.”
“Then Pakistan should take steps to foil such attacks”, he said. “Islamabad should also share information with Kabul so that we can make efforts to counter these threats as well.”
But, at the same time, Mujahid added that Afghanistan could not be held responsible for bomb blasts in Bannu or any other area of Pakistan.
“Pakistan should ensure its own security,” he asserted, further recommending that Islamabad and Kabul should engage in talks to discuss the reasons behind the issue of terrorism.
“You should take us into confidence if you believe that you face threats from [an entity] in Afghanistan.”
Mujahid’s remarks follow a recent statement by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in which he issued a stern message to Kabul, saying that Afghanistan must decide whether it stands with Pakistan or the TTP. The premier’s statement had come after he attended the funeral of 12 soldiers in Bannu, who were martyred during an exchange of fire with terrorists in  South Waziristan.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks.
Gul also raised this issue during his conversation with Mujahid with respect to the strained ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“Pakistan seems to have drawn a red line as far as the TTP’s presence in Afghanistan is concerned,” Gul said, adding that this was seen as the main reason for growing tensions between the two countries. Gul asked Mujahid whether he agreed with this.
Mujahid, however, clearly stated that the TTP was Pakistan’s “internal issue”.
“Pakistan should find a solution to this problem,” he said, adding that Islamabad should not spoil its ties with Kabul over this matter.
He also assured that Afghanistan was making efforts to make sure that “no one uses its soil against any other country”.
“No armed person can go to Pakistan from Afghanistan […] The terrain in some areas is difficult, and some people may be able to take advantage of it.
“We should find a solution to this problem through negotiations and Afghanistan should not be blamed for it […] We do not want fighting, bloodshed and difficulties in Pakistan.”
Earlier in the interview, when asked what messages he and the Islamic Emirate had for those in Pakistan, he said he wanted to convey to leaders and officials that “Afghanistan wanted brotherly ties and that any issues between the two countries should be resolved through negotiations”.
“Levelling allegations and making threats spoil the environment, which further complicates matters,” he said.  The spokesperson also called for reforms in policy and urged religious scholars in Pakistan to play a role in maintaining good ties between the two countries.
Lastly, he said, he had a message for the people of Pakistan.
“My final message is for the people of Pakistan. Afghans do not want lawlessness in Pakistan. Afghanistan does not want difficulties in Pakistan […] Afghanistan wants normalisation of ties with Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-09-21 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624802-police-probe-killing-of-three-transgender-persons-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Police probe killing of three transgender persons in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>
