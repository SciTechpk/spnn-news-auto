In March, tribal leaders in Kurram district came to terms on an eight-month peace agreement ahead of Eidul Fitr. Violence stemming from decades-old land disputes had claimed at least 130 lives in the fragile district, with multiple efforts to establish peace between tribes. A ceasefire agreement was reached following months of conflict in January.
Kurram Deputy Commissioner (DC) Ashfaq Khan, who chaired the jirga, told Dawn.com that after a long law and order situation in the district, the efforts of the administration, security forces, police and tribal leaders brought positive results and “a peace agreement was signed between the local tribes of Lower Kurram and Sadda for a year.”
The jirga was held at Sadda FC Fort between prominent tribal chiefs of the Ahle Sunnat and Tori Bangash tribes, including the participation of the additional DC, officers of the Security Forces Police and assistant commissioners.
DC Khan said the tribal elders inked the agreement in the light of the Kohat agreement, and all conditions of that agreement were to be considered.
He said the tribal leaders declared the move a “milestone for regional stability” and hoped for progress and long-standing peace. They also applauded the security forces, police and administration’s role and acknowledged their efforts, he added.
The residents of Topki, Sameer, Gosar, Amal Kot, Gharbena, Sangena, Kandezar, Mengak, Tangay, Manda, Marokhel and the suburbs of Lower Kurram and from Sadda, Kochi, Sateen, Shasho, Darani, Per Qayum, Sakhi Ahmad Shah, Mala Kaly, Chakai Kaly, Jan Haji Kaly, Malak Mulajan Kaly, Arawaly, Marokhel, Lower Mandori and adjacent areas signed the agreement unanimously.
On the occasion, DC Khan said the establishment of peace in the Hussain and Jamil valleys of Kurram district was possible only with the cooperation of regional elders, and the immense sacrifices of the security forces for peace in the region were highly commendable. He added that more steps would be taken for peace.
At least 10,000 personnel of the army, police and other agencies performed security duty during Muharram in Kohat division, with the restive Kurram district handed over to the army due to a slew of sectarian killings in the past.</p><small>2025-07-23 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/231321025cbef82.png?r=142848' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926052/imrans-sons-meet-trump-aide-to-kick-off-us-campaign-to-free-father' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s sons meet Trump aide to kick off US campaign to free father</strong></a><br><p>Incarcerated PTI Founder Imran Khan’s sons met with United States President Donald Trump’s key aide Richard Grenell on Tuesday as they kicked off a campaign calling for their father’s release from prison.
Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 — called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan said Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the US before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
Grenell, US special presidential envoy for special missions — known for publicly calling for Imran’s release — posted on X that he had met with Sulaiman and Kasim in California, urging them to “stay strong”.
“There are millions of people around the world who are sick of political prosecutions. You are not alone.”
 






Imran’s sons also met with Dr Asif Mahmood, a Pakistani American physician who has been playing a key role in the PTI’s campaign to win over Americans.
Dr Mahmood, vice chairman of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), shared a picture showing he also met with Grenell, along with the ex-premier’s sons.
“Immense pride for [Kasim] and Sulaiman Khan for their bravery in fighting for their father, former prime minister Imran Khan’s freedom,” he said.
He also praised Grenell for “standing for justice and principle” and called for unity to free the PTI founder.
 






In December 2024, after Trump won the presidential elections, Grenell had made a series of statements and tweets over a few weeks, including a viral “Free Imran Khan!” post on X.
He sharply criticised the policies of ex-president Joe Biden’s administration toward Pakistan, particularly its handling of the country’s missile programme and Imran’s imprisonment. Subsequently, Pakistan’s political and diplomatic machinery in the US had also ramped up efforts to engage with the new Congress.
“Getting the ear and voice of Richard Grenell, a key Trump insider, was crucial,” Shuja Nawaz, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, had said in January.
 
 

Last week, during a congressional hearing on Pakistan, Republican Congressman Christopher H. Smith suggested that the US Congress may soon urge Trump’s administration to consider imposing sanctions on countries that suppress religious freedom and violate human rights.
Speakers at the hearing, also attended by PTI’s Zulfi Bukhari, discussed the rights situation in Pakistan. Democratic Congressman James McGovern stressed the need to engage and talk “about political prisoners, the future of Imran Khan … but also how you do it”.
Notably, there have been increased positive engagements between Washington and Islamabad, with an unprecedented meeting between Trump and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir in June and the US hailing the country as a “phenomenal partner” in counterterrorism.
 
 

Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran’s son, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said today while speaking on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ that the meeting would “practically have no result” even though it might net symbolic gains for the party.
He questioned what, if any, role Imran’s sons would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them and visas would be issued “in less than 24 hours”, provided they stayed within the law.
Previously, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had told Dawn.com that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.
Malik also said that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.
There were conflicting statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.</p><small>2025-07-23 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2318402460886dc.jpg?r=184032' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926067/pakistan-ready-for-meaningful-dialogue-with-india-pm-shehbaz-reiterates-in-talks-with-uk-envoy' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan ready for ‘meaningful dialogue’ with India, PM Shehbaz reiterates in talks with UK envoy</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday reiterated Pakistan’s willingness for a “meaningful dialogue” with India on all outstanding issues, state media Radio Pakistan reported.
The April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, sparking a military confrontation between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan as New Delhi blamed it on Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
Pakistan previously invited India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution.
During a meeting with British High Commissioner Jane Marriott today, PM Shehbaz appreciated the UK’s role in de-escalating tensions during the Pakistan-India standoff and reiterated that Pakistan was ready for a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues.
He welcomed the British government’s decision to resume PIA flights to the UK. He said, “This [decision] would go a long way in alleviating the hardships faced by the British-Pakistani community as well as enhancing people-to-people exchanges,” while appreciating the role of the high commissioner.
Both sides discussed the “positive trajectory” of bilateral relations. The prime minister said that the recently held trade talks between the two countries would lead to mutually beneficial opportunities for both sides. “Pakistan is also cooperating closely with the UK at the UN Security Council, where Pakistan currently holds the monthly Presidency,” he said.
Marriott briefed PM Shehbaz about her recent visit to London, where she had extensive consultations on enhancing bilateral ties.
She lauded the Pakistani government’s recent economic performance which brought about a significant improvement in key macroeconomic indicators. She also discussed the UK’s perspective on regional developments in South Asia and the Middle East.
 






Last week, UK’s government launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.
The announcement came just a day after the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
UN envoy hits back at India for cross-border terrorism claims
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s envoy to the UNSC, Ambassador Usman Jadoon, rejected Indian allegations of cross-border terrorism and asked India to change its behaviour, instead of resorting to its “tired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting”, during the UNSC debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes” on Tuesday.
The Indian envoy was reacting to Deputy PM Dar’s speech in New York during the reception hosted for Pakistan’s presidency of the UNSC, where the latter underscored the need for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.
“It is India which actively sponsors, aids and abets terrorism in my country and beyond,” Ambassador Jadoon, deputy permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the 15-member body on Tuesday evening, while responding to allegations made by India’s UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish.
“Rather than being blinded by hubris and a misplaced sense of impunity, and instead of resorting to its tired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting, India must introspect seriously, change its behaviour and comply with its international legal obligations on all counts,” he said, in the debate convened by Pakistan to promote pacific settlement of disputes between nations.
Ambassador Jadoon said that it was especially regrettable that the Indian ambassador targeted Pakistan yesterday, when earlier in the day, the council “spoke with a unanimous voice to reaffirm the purposes and principles of the UN charter and the imperative of peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for international law and effective implementation of the resolution of the security council”.
The Pakistani envoy pointed out that firstly, India was in illegal occupation of the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir.
“While claiming to abide by the UN charter, and purportedly the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes, India has been in violation of security council resolutions on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, and has refused to implement those resolutions, thereby denying the Kashmiri people the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination,” he said.
“India’s egregious violations of human rights which extend beyond the occupied territory of Jammu and Kashmir and encompass its appalling treatment of minorities has been widely reported by international human rights organisations,” Jadoon added.
He also said that India had “stooped to a new low” of unilaterally and illegally holding in abeyance the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, with the stated aim of depriving the people of Pakistan of water from the Indus river system.
“In gross violation of international law, India resorted to blatant aggression against my country between 7-10 May, targeting civilians, including women and children,” the ambassador said.
He highlighted Pakistan’s “befitting but measured response” in accordance with its right to self-defence, aimed exclusively at military targets, that resulted in the downing of six Indian aircraft that took part in the aggression, among other significant military losses.
“The hostilities came to an end owing to Pakistan’s position of strength and responsible approach, and facilitation of the US, as also highlighted in the statement of the US this morning, “ Jadoon told the delegates.
“It is ironic that India, which itself brought the Jammu and Kashmir dispute to the security council, refuses to implement the resolutions adopted by the council to peacefully resolve this dispute,” he added.
 






Obviously stung by the success of Pakistan’s signature event at the council, the Indian envoy had claimed that Pakistan was “steeped in fanaticism and terrorism”, and a “serial borrower from the International Monetary Fund”.
The debate will resume on July 24 to listen to the remaining speakers, after listening to scores of high-level representatives.</p><small>2025-07-23 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/23200831a8b83f8.jpg?r=200851' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926084/british-families-receive-wrong-remains-of-air-india-plane-crash-victims-report' target='_blank'><strong>British families receive ‘wrong remains’ of Air India plane crash victims: report</strong></a><br><p>Families in the United Kingdom have received the “wrong remains” of victims of an Air India plane crash last month, which left 260 people dead, according to a media report on Wednesday.
The families are suffering “fresh heartache because the remains of their loved ones were wrongly identified before being flown home”, British publication The Daily Mail reported.
It said relatives of one of the victims had to abandon “funeral plans after being informed that their coffin contained the body of an unknown passenger rather than their family member”.
In another case, the “commingled” remains of more than one person killed in the crash were mistakenly placed in the same casket, it added.
A lawyer representing several families and UK media said relatives of a British victim received a casket that contained mixed remains. The family of a separate victim received the remains of another person, according to James Healy-Pratt, who is representing 20 British families who lost loved ones in the disaster.
Healy-Pratt told the Press Association news agency that the return of victims’ remains had been marred by serious errors, which had been identified following a probe by a British coroner.
“In the first two caskets that were repatriated, in one of the caskets, there was co-mingling of DNA which did not relate to the deceased in that casket or the casket that accompanied it,” he said.
The lawyer added the coroner was then “able to determine that one particular loved one was not at all who the family thought they were”.
Miten Patel, whose mother Shobhana Patel died along with her husband in the disaster, told the BBC that “other remains” were found in her casket after her body was returned to Britain.
“People were tired and there was a lot of pressure. But there has to be a level of responsibility that you’re sending the right bodies to the UK,” he told the broadcaster.
The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it has been “working closely with the UK side from the moment these concerns and issues were brought to our attention”.
MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X today: “In the wake of the tragic crash, the concerned authorities had carried out identification of victims as per established protocols and technical requirements. All mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased.”
He added: “We are continuing to work with the UK authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue.”
 






The UK-bound plane slammed into several buildings on June 12 after crashing in western Gujarat state.
Among the passengers were 169 Indian nationals, 53 British nationals, seven Portuguese and a Canadian.
One passenger survived the crash after he jumped out of the plane.</p><small>2025-07-23 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615443-pakistans-death-toll-from-monsoon-devastation-tops-250' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's death toll from monsoon devastation tops 250</strong></a><br><p>

The non-binding opinion by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, is likely to determine the course of future climate action across the world.
“Greenhouse gas emissions are unequivocally caused by human activities which are not territorially limited,” Judge Yuji Iwasawa said. The reading of the opinion was ongoing and the court had not yet announced its conclusions.
Ahead of the ruling, supporters of climate action gathered outside the ICJ, chanting: “What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!”
Although it is non-binding, the deliberation of the 15 judges of the ICJ in The Hague will nevertheless carry legal and political weight and future climate cases would be unable to ignore it, legal experts say.
“It is so important, it could be one of the most consequential legal rulings of our times because of the scope of the issues that it touches, which run to the very heart of climate justice,” said Joie Chowdhury, senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law.
The two questions the UN General Assembly asked the judges to consider were: what are countries’ obligations under international law to protect the climate from greenhouse gas emissions; and what are the legal consequences for countries that harm the climate system?
 
 

In two weeks of hearings last December at the ICJ, wealthy countries of the Global North told the judges that existing climate treaties, including the 2015 Paris Agreement, which are largely non-binding, should be the basis for deciding their responsibilities.
Developing nations and small island states argued for stronger measures, in some cases legally binding, to curb emissions and for the biggest emitters of climate-warming greenhouse gases to provide financial aid.
Paris Agreement
In 2015, at the conclusion of UN talks in Paris, more than 190 countries committed to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The agreement has failed to curb the growth of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Late last year, in the most recent Emissions Gap Report, which takes stock of countries’ promises to tackle climate change compared with what is needed, the UN said that current climate policies will result in global warming of more than 3°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.
As campaigners seek to hold companies and governments to account, climate‑related litigation has intensified, with nearly 3,000 cases filed across almost 60 countries, according to June figures from London’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.
So far, the results have been mixed.
A German court in May threw out a case between a Peruvian farmer and German energy giant RWE, but his lawyers and environmentalists said the case, which dragged on for a decade, was still a victory for climate cases that could spur similar lawsuits.
Earlier this month, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which holds jurisdiction over 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries, said in another advisory opinion that its members must cooperate to tackle climate change.
Campaigners say Wednesday’s court opinion should be a turning point, even if the ruling itself is advisory.
 
 

The ruling could also make it easier for states to hold other states to account over climate issues like pollution or emissions.
“The court can affirm that climate inaction, especially by major emitters, is not merely a policy failure but a breach of international law,” said Fijian Vishal Prasad, one of the law students who lobbied the government of Vanuatu in the South Pacific Ocean to bring the case to the ICJ.
Although it is theoretically possible to ignore an ICJ ruling, lawyers say countries are typically reluctant to do so.
“This opinion is applying binding international law, which countries have already committed to,” Chowdhury said.</p><small>2025-07-23 15:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2319454084ad39e.jpg?r=194551' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926083/pakistan-and-bangladesh-agree-on-visa-free-entry-for-diplomats-pledge-stronger-security-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and Bangladesh agree on visa-free entry for diplomats, pledge stronger security cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Bangladesh on Wednesday agreed in principle to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports, along with a pledge to stronger security cooperation.
The two countries were once one nation but split following a bloody civil war, which saw the territory previously referred to as ‘East Pakistan’ seceding to form the independent nation of Bangladesh. In the years since the split between Pakistan and Bangladesh, Dhaka’s leaders — especially the ousted regime of Sheikh Hasina — stayed firmly in the Indian camp, preferring to maintain close ties with New Delhi and keeping Islamabad at arm’s length.
However, ever since a popular uprising that saw Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, with the deposed premier fleeing to her old ally India, there has been a thaw in ties between the two capitals, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
In May, Bangladesh High Commissioner to Pakistan Iqbal Hussain Khan said that the visa regime between Pakistan and Bangladesh was being eased for the business community to foster economic growth in the region.
Today’s development came during a visit of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Bangladesh, where he met Home Minister retired Lieutenant General Jahangir Alam Chowdhury in Dhaka.
Naqvi was presented with a guard of honour before the two sides began discussions.
During the meeting, the two ministers held wide-ranging talks on bilateral issues and matters of mutual interest, with a particular focus on strengthening cooperation in internal security and law enforcement.
“Significant progress on visa-free entry for diplomatic and official passports during the meeting. Pakistan and Bangladesh make a principled decision to provide visa-free entry facility for diplomatic and official passports,” said a statement from the interior ministry.
 






Both sides expressed a strong desire to deepen collaboration in key areas, including counter-terrorism, combatting drug trafficking and preventing human smuggling.
The ministers also discussed plans to exchange training programmes between police academies, aiming to improve professional capacity and technical expertise.
Chowdhury thanked Naqvi for offering support in police training and described the visit as an “important milestone” in advancing ties between the two countries.
“I wholeheartedly welcome my brother upon his arrival in Dhaka. Your visit is of great importance for the promotion of Pakistan-Bangladesh relations,” he said.
To follow up on the decisions taken during the meeting, both sides agreed to form a joint committee with Interior Secretary Khurram Agha leading the Pakistani side in this coordination effort.
The committee will oversee implementation of the agreed initiatives and explore further avenues for cooperation.
As part of the growing partnership, a high-level delegation from Bangladesh is expected to visit Islamabad soon to study the Safe City Project and tour the National Police Academy.</p><small>2025-07-23 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/231834312e365a2.png?r=183628' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926068/fm-dar-urges-cooperative-diplomacy-over-confrontation-amid-growing-global-turbulence' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar urges cooperative diplomacy over confrontation amid growing global turbulence</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called for an inclusive dialogue and cooperative diplomacy over confrontation amid growing turbulence across the world during his United States visit on Wednesday.
Dar arrived in New York on Monday to attend “high-level signature events” of Pakistan’s United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency, including a conference on Palestine.
Addressing a reception today hosted by Pakistan’s Mission in New York on the occasion of Pakistan’s UNSC presidency, Dar stressed: “We believe that global peace and security can only be achieved through multilateralism, peaceful settlement of disputes, inclusive dialogue, and respect for international law.”
The deputy PM pointed out: “At the core of Pakistan’s foreign policy is our firm commitment to multilateralism and the United Nations.
“The purposes and principles enshrined in the UN Charter, especially peaceful settlement of disputes and non-use or threat of force are foundational to the UN. They are indispensable for a just international order,” he added.
 






The deputy PM asserted that Pakistan’s leadership has been guided by “these very principles in both deliberations and concrete actions taken during its tenure”.
“This is a time of growing turbulence in the world, where the costs of unresolved disputes, long-running conflicts, unilateral actions, and disregard for international law are being felt in every region of the world,” Dar noted.
Dar’s remarks came as Pakistan holds the presidency of the UNSC this month. Pakistan assumed the UNSC presidency for July, marking its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.
The UNSC unanimously adopted Pakistan-sponsored Resolution 2788 yesterday, calling for the strengthening of international mechanisms to settle disputes through peaceful means.
Dar also announced Pakistan was seeking a seat at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for the 2026-2028 term, with the Asia-Pacific Group endorsing its candidacy. Pakistan last held the membership from 2020 to 2023.
“Our engagement with the Human Rights Council is guided by the values of truth, tolerance, mutual respect, consensus-building, and engagement,” he said, expressing the hope for broad international support.
 
 

Speaking to diplomats, UN officials and representatives of member states at the Pakistan Mission, Dar outlined three priorities that Pakistan will focus on during its UNSC presidency.
He described the peaceful settlement of disputes, a core principle of the UN Charter, as “too often sidelined” and highlighted the need to bring it back to the centre of the council’s work.
He stressed the importance of revitalising “We see multilateralism not as a slogan, but as a necessity,” Dar said.
“The Security Council must be seen not only as a chamber of reaction but as a forum of prevention, problem-solving, and principled leadership,” he asserted.
He then detailed Pakistan’s third priority — enhancing cooperation between the UN and regional organisations, particularly the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
Dar stated that a UNSC briefing with the OIC was scheduled for July 24, highlighting the 57-member body’s vital role in global peacebuilding.
 
 

Reaffirming Pakistan’s active diplomatic engagement, the deputy PM said the country remained committed to working with partners around the world to advance the shared goals of peace, development, and human rights.
“Pakistan is a leading voice in the global climate and development discourse — from the General Assembly to the UN Ecosoc (Economic and Social Council) and elsewhere,” he noted.
He highlighted Pakistan’s leadership in global climate and development discourse and reiterated its support for strengthening the UN’s three pillars: peace and security, development, and human rights.
Concluding his address, Dar urged the global community to rise above divisions. “In a world facing deepening divides and mounting challenges, we must choose cooperation over confrontation, and diplomacy over force.
“Pakistan stands ready to work with all of you to advance these common goals,” he affirmed.</p><small>2025-07-23 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2318300414a731a.png?r=192459' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926080/balochistan-couple-murder-quetta-atc-extends-tribal-leaders-physical-remand-by-10-days' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan couple murder: Quetta ATC extends tribal leader’s physical remand by 10 days</strong></a><br><p>A Quetta anti-terrorism court on Wednesday extended the physical remand of tribal leader Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai, one of the main suspects in the ‘honour’ killing of a man and a woman, for 10 more days.
The viral video of the murder showed a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists said it was an ‘honour’ killing incident. Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Sunday that he had directed the provincial police to take immediate action, following which one suspect was apprehended.
Sardar Satakzai is one of the main suspects in the case and was presented before the Quetta ATC on Monday before being handed over to the Serious Crimes Investigation Wing  (SCIW) on a two-day physical remand on the judge’s order upon the police’s request.
He was presented in the ATC today before Judge Muhammad Mubeen, who accepted the police request and granted Satakzai’s physical remand for another 10 days, handing him over to the SCIW.
Separately, a video statement of the woman’s mother emerged today in which she defended the incident and said it occurred as per local custom and tradition. She said the decision was taken by a jurga and Satakzai had no role in it, calling for his release.
The Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) strongly condemned the mother’s statement, declaring it contrary to Islamic teachings, as well as the Constitution and law.
The PUC said the remarks suggested that the murder was committed with the consent of the parents, a revelation it termed “deeply disturbing and unacceptable”.
The PUC declared that it was the responsibility of the state, law enforcement agencies, the Balochistan government and the provincial judiciary to take firm action against all those facilitating the perpetrators.
It categorically rejected the parents’ justification, stating that it violated Islamic principles and the Constitution.
Terming the incident both condemnable and tragic, the PUC called for a comprehensive investigation and stressed that justice must be served without delay or negligence. It urged the state to fulfil its constitutional and moral duty by ensuring that all those responsible were brought to justice.
 






PUC Chairman Tahir Ashrafi further said that the parents did not have the right to forgive the killers or kill their own children.
 






In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p><small>2025-07-23 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/23141321e899e9a.jpg?r=141326' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926056/19-year-old-girl-dies-in-coma-after-alleged-marital-rape-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>19-year-old girl dies in coma after alleged marital rape: Karachi police</strong></a><br><p>A 19-year-old girl in Karachi’s Lyari succumbed to her injuries after an alleged marital rape at the hands of her husband, police said on Wednesday.
Earlier this month, the newlywed girl was admitted to Civil Hospital Karachi in critical condition after allegedly enduring “brutal sexual violence” from her husband, who was arrested by the police.
The victim was in a coma and her physical examination findings were “consistent with sexual violence”, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed had stated.
“The rape victim, 19, passed away at the trauma centre of the Civil Hospital Karachi at 10:45am today,” Syed said today.
She was admitted to the trauma centre in a “critical condition”, having undergone a surgical procedure at another hospital, she added.
“Her initial findings were positive for sexual violence,” she said.
The police surgeon told Dawn.com that the hospital informed police and family to conduct a post-mortem examination of the body and was waiting for their response.
Baghdadi police Station House Officer Majid Alvi also confirmed her death to Dawn.com.
He said that the girl got married on June 15. “Two days later, the husband subjected her to sodomy” and assaulted her with a metal pipe, leading to deterioration of her health condition.
The brother of the victim had registered a first information report (FIR) at the Baghdadi Police Station on July 5 under Sections 324 (attempt to commit murder) and 376-B (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
“On the third day of her marriage, my sister was subjected to brutal sexual violence allegedly by her husband. She remained admitted at a private hospital in the city and was later taken to Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre of Civil Hospital Karachi in a critical condition the other day,” the FIR read.
In the FIR, the complainant said his 19-year-old sister married the suspect on June 15. Her health condition deteriorated on June 30, compelling the family to bring her back home. She informed the parents that on July 17, her husband subjected her to an “unnatural sexual act”.
He said that the husband also sexually assaulted her with a foreign object. Subsequently, the husband subjected her to sexual violence, leading to bleeding. As per the FIR, the suspect threatened his wife with “dire consequences” if she disclosed anything to anyone.
 
 

Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
In May, two sisters were subjected to a sexual assault in their home in North Karachi, police and doctors had said.
In April, in a rare verdict, an additional district and sessions judge in Gujranwala handed down 10-year rigorous imprisonment to a man for subjecting his wife to an unnatural sexual offence.</p><small>2025-07-23 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/23175339da02829.jpg?r=181345' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926053/swat-student-death-case-authorities-seal-madressah-police-return-students-to-families' target='_blank'><strong>Swat student death case: Authorities seal madressah, police return students to families</strong></a><br><p>Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Omar on Wednesday said that authorities sealed the madressah in Swat, where a student was killed earlier this week, and returned its other students to their parents.
A young student was allegedly beaten to death by his madressah teachers on Monday evening in Swat’s Chaliyar village, according to the police. He was rushed to the nearest hospital by students and teachers, but doctors declared him dead upon arrival.
Addressing a press conference in his office accompanied by Superintendent of Police (Investigation) Badshah Hazrat Khan, DPO Omar said: “When we came to know of this incident, we also thought to check with the other students studying in the madressah if there was any other case such as this or not. We sent our team to this madressah and when statements were taken from the children, it was found out that some others had been subjected to violence as well.”
Omar said police detained all madressah staff upon receiving this information with nine more taken into custody and a case registered on the police’s complaint under the Child Protection Act.
“Around 160 to 170 students were retrieved and we returned them safely to their families after contacting them and the madressah was sealed.”
He said investigations into any possible sexual assault were under way with samples taken, adding that the relevant section would be added to the first information report (FIR) on any confirmation.
DPO Omar said there were four suspects nominated in the FIR and two were subsequently arrested, with teams formed to trace and arrest the others.
“They will not be able to escape the law. We will arrest them as soon as possible,” he said of the absconding suspects.
He said the police took action immediately upon being alerted of the incident and the case was registered.
Omar said the items used to allegedly beat and bind the student were also recovered.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Khateeb Maulana Tayyab Qureshi strongly condemned the incident in a statement, saying that “the death of a student at the hands of a madressah teacher is the height of brutality.
“The elements involved in the incident should be severely punished. Such so-called reciters and teachers are a stain on the name of madressahs. The public should avoid admitting children to unregistered madressahs.”
He said the condemnation of the incident by the Wifaq-ul-Madaris was a positive development
“We will never allow brutality under the guise of religious education. Islam does not allow us to beat children. A teacher is not allowed to beat, regardless of their field. The government should take retribution from the teacher involved in the beating.”
Talking to Dawn.com, he reiterated his strong condemnation, saying no amount would be enough.
He demanded exemplary punishments for the culprits who were becoming a basis to defame religion and madressahs so that no one ever dared to commit such crimes, especially in regards to students and children.
Qureshi said students were the responsibility of madressahs to be taken care of, adding that such violence and treatment harmed students’ psyche and health. He also hailed the sealing of the madressah and the return of the students to their families.
He also appealed to ulema to ensure that violence and physical beatings did not occur at seminaries, saying that the law and religion did not allow it.
Under the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act 2010 and its 2018 regulations, corporal punishment is a punishable offence, violation of which can result in up to six months of imprisonment or a Rs50,000 fine, or both.
In May this year, the KP Private Schools Regulatory Authority, through a notification, strictly prohibited corporal punishment in all private schools across the province after receiving complaints.
Violations, however, continue to prevail. According to a recent report by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission, children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuses, including 14 incidents of corporal punishment.
In April, a seminary teacher in Kasur was arrested for allegedly beating a student with a hot iron for not memorising his lesson at Bangla Kambovan.</p><small>2025-07-23 14:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615417-pakistani-passport-ranked-fourth-least-powerful-in-the-world' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani passport ranked fourth least powerful in the world</strong></a><br><p>

Bannu Police spokesperson Aamir Khan told Dawn.com: “Terrorists attacked a Frontier Constabulary checkpoint situated in the border area of Takhti Khel Wazir in Bannu.
“As a result of the attack, six personnel of the FC were injured, but the immediate response of the constabulary forced the terrorists to flee.”
Over a week ago, President Asif Ali Zardari promulgated an ordinance empowering the federal government to transform the FC, a border security force, into the Federal Constabulary.
 
 

Aamir added that the injured constables have been taken to the Combined Military Hospital in Bannu for treatment.
“Police teams have been sent to the area and have begun a search operation to track down the terrorists,” he said.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.
Attacks increased after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu this month.
A day ago, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was martyred when terrorists attacked him in the district while he was returning home from duty.
On July 21, over a dozen terrorists attacked a police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu. However, the cops responded effectively and thwarted their nefarious plan to take over the building. The police also thwarted a sabotage bid by defusing explosives in the Ghoriwala town of Bannu. An official said the explosives were seized during an intelligence-based operation in the area.
On July 19, two police officials, including an officer, were injured when terrorists carried out a quadcopter attack on Bannu’s Miryan police station.</p><small>2025-07-23 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615411-imran-khans-sons-meet-trump-aide-grenell-amid-plans-to-join-pti-protest' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's sons meet Trump aide Richard Grenell ahead of PTI protest</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on X, the state minister said the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — designated as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations and the United States — was operating its WhatsApp channels and sending bulk messages to “proliferate its violent/hateful ideology, to spread its harmful narratives, and for glorification of its terror activities”.
The state minister requested the international community and WhatsApp to “cooperate to help us fight this menace”.
“These accounts must be blocked and necessary algorithms created to auto-detect and auto-suspend such handles/numbers,” he added.
 






On Sept 1, 2010, the US designated the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation, while the UN imposed sanctions on the entity on July 29, 2011 due to its affiliation with al-Qaeda. The sanctions include asset freezes, travel bans, and arms embargoes.
Founded in 2007, the TTP has staged a large number of attacks across Pakistan, leading to a ban on the group on August 24, 2008. It remains on the National Counter Terrorism Authority’s (Nacta) list of proscribed organisations.
According to data from the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), during the height of its insurgency in 2009, the group carried out 2,586 terrorist attacks and 3,021 fatalities.  A large-scale military offensive launched in 2014 dealt a massive blow to the command and control structure of the group, dramatically reducing insurgent violence throughout Pakistan. Sporadic attacks targeting security forces, however, continued.
After holding several rounds of talks with the group, former prime minister Imran Khan’s government announced on November 8, 2022, that the group had agreed to a complete ceasefire. In November that year, however, the TTP called off the ceasefire, vowing to increase attacks on police and security personnel.
 
 

With the resurgence of the group, the country has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, mainly conducted by the TTP.
In July last year, the government designated the group as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan. In Islamic history, the term refers to the period of conflict and discord caused by the Khawarij, an early Islamic sect known for their extreme interpretations of Islam and their rebellion against established authority.
Pakistan ranks second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
In December last year, the Pakistan Army said it conducted 59,775 operations against terrorists.</p><small>2025-07-23 12:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/23172903a6d746a.png?r=173050' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926063/trump-announces-massive-japan-trade-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Trump announces ‘massive’ Japan trade deal</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump has announced a “massive” trade deal with Japan, as China said it will send its vice premier to US trade talks next week to secure its own agreement ahead of a looming deadline.
In an attempt to slash his country’s colossal trade deficit, the US president has vowed to hit dozens of countries with punitive “reciprocal” tariffs if they do not hammer out a pact with Washington by August 1.
The Japan agreement, along with another pact with the Philippines also announced on Tuesday, means Trump has now secured five agreements since his administration promised in April “90 deals in 90 days”.
The others are with Britain, Vietnam and Indonesia, which the White House said Tuesday would ease critical mineral export restrictions.
Negotiations are still ongoing with much larger US trading partners China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union.
Representatives from China and the United States will meet next week in the Swedish capital Stockholm to try and hammer out a deal before an August 12 deadline agreed in May.
As the clock ticks down, China said today it will seek to “strengthen cooperation” with Washington at the talks, and confirmed vice premier He Lifeng would attend.
Japan deal
“We just completed a massive Deal with Japan, perhaps the largest Deal ever made,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday.
He said that under the deal, “Japan will invest, at my direction, $550 billion dollars into the United States, which will receive [90 per cent] of the Profits”.
He did not provide further details on the unusual investment plan, but said it “will create hundreds of thousands of jobs”.
Japanese exports to the United States were already subject to a 10 per cent tariff, which would have risen to 25pc on August 1 without a deal.
 
 

Duties of 25pc on Japanese autos — an industry accounting for eight per cent of Japanese jobs — were also already in place, plus 50pc on steel and aluminium.
Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said that the autos levy had now been cut to 15pc, sending Japanese car stocks soaring, with Toyota and Mitsubishi up around 14pc each. The Nikkei rose 3.5pc.
“We are the first (country) in the world to reduce tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, with no limits on volume,” he told reporters.
“By protecting what needs to be protected, we continued the negotiations with an aim to reach an agreement that meets the national interest of both Japan and the United States,” Ishiba added.
Rice imports
However, Japan’s trade envoy Ryosei Akazawa, who secured the deal on his eighth visit to Washington, said the 50pc tariffs on steel and aluminium would remain.
Akazawa also said increased defence spending by Japan — something Trump has pressed for — was not part of the agreement.
Trump said on Tuesday Japan has also agreed to “open their country to trade, including cars and trucks, rice and certain other agricultural products, and other things”.
Rice imports are a sensitive issue in Japan, and Ishiba’s government — which lost its upper house majority in elections on Sunday — had previously ruled out any concessions.
Japan currently imports 770,000 tons of rice tariff-free under its World Trade Organisation commitments, and Ishiba said it would import more US grain within this.
Ishiba said on Wednesday that the deal does not “sacrifice” Japan’s agricultural sector.
 
 

Tatsuo Yasunaga, the chair of Japan Foreign Trade Council, welcomed the trade deal announcement but said the business community needed to see details to assess its impact.
“I highly commend the fact that this major milestone has been achieved and dispelled the uncertainty that private companies had been concerned about,” Yasunaga said.
Naomi Omura, an 80-year-old voter, said it was “disappointing that Japan cannot act more strongly” towards the US.
Tetsuo Momiyama, 81, said that Ishiba “is finished … It’s good timing for him to go”.
Reports claimed on Wednesday that he aims to step down soon following the election debacle.
Eyes on the prize
Other major US trading partners are watching closely as the end of the month approaches.
The Philippines’ deal also announced on Tuesday only saw levies cut by one percentage point, to 19pc, after Trump hosted President Ferdinand Marcos. China on Wednesday said it supported “equal dialogue” following the announcement of the Japan-US deal.
Beijing and Washington imposed escalating, tit-for-tat levies on each other’s exports earlier this year, reaching triple-digit levels.
But in talks in Geneva in May, they agreed to lower them temporarily until August 12.</p><small>2025-07-23 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/231359034a6e734.png?r=140539' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926057/india-to-resume-issuing-tourist-visas-to-chinese-citizens' target='_blank'><strong>India to resume issuing tourist visas to Chinese citizens</strong></a><br><p>India will resume issuing tourist visas to Chinese citizens from July 24 this year, its embassy in China said on Wednesday, the first time in five years as both countries move to repair their rocky relationship.
Tensions between the two countries escalated following a 2020 military clash along their disputed Himalayan border. In response, India imposed restrictions on Chinese investments, banned hundreds of popular Chinese apps and cut passenger routes.
China suspended visas to Indian citizens and other foreigners around the same time due to the Covid-19 pandemic but lifted those restrictions in 2022, when it resumed issuing visas for students and business travellers.
Tourist visas for Indian nationals remained restricted until March this year, when both countries agreed to resume direct air service.
 
 

Relations have gradually improved, with several high-level meetings taking place last year, including talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Russia in October.
China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Wednesday that Beijing had noted the positive move.
“China is ready to maintain communication and consultation with India and constantly improve the level of personal exchanges between the two countries,” he said.
India and China share a 3,800-kilometre border that has been disputed since the 1950s. The two countries fought a brief but brutal border war in 1962 and negotiations to settle the dispute have made slow progress.
In July, India’s foreign minister told his Chinese counterpart that both countries must resolve border friction, pull back troops and avoid “restrictive trade measures” to normalise their relationship.</p><small>2025-07-23 12:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615408-pakistan-committed-to-working-with-global-partners-for-shared-goals-of-peace-dpm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan committed to working with global partners for shared goals of peace: DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>

Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities.
The monsoon death toll since the end of June surged to 234, according to the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA). Heavy rains triggered flash floods in several districts of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan, damaging homes and increasing water levels in rivers and streams.
Over the last 48 hours, Swat has recorded the highest toll as six children and one woman died owing to flash floods and a house collapsing, while a woman and child were injured, the KP PDMA report said.
Three people died in Buner, which experienced heavy rain with thunder and lightning. A woman and her child died in a thunder strike, while an eight-year-old boy was swept away. “The dead body has been recovered by the locals,” the PDMA said.
Incidents caused by heavy rains in Bajaur claimed the lives of a man and a child. The victims were brothers, aged 21 and five.
“Their mother was successfully rescued while the bodies of both brothers were recovered,” the PDMA quoted the Bajaur Deputy Commissioner’s Office as saying.
Per the report, a woman also died in Upper Kohistan, while a child was injured in Torghar as heavy rains caused a roof to collapse. A total of 19 houses had been damaged due to the heavy downpour, out of which two were completely destroyed and 17 sustained partial damage.
“The current spell of heavy rains is likely to continue intermittently until July 25,” the report said.
“The PDMA has already sent a letter to all district administrations to take precautionary measures in view of the weather situation, and has directed that relief activities be intensified in affected districts to provide immediate relief to all victims,” it said.
The authority directed that all tourists be apprised of the weather and to take precautionary measures.
“The public should contact the free helpline 1700 for any untoward incident, weather situation updates and information,” the report added.
On Monday, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur directed the district administration to remain on high alert after forecasts indicated more monsoon rains in the province.
He instructed all relevant departments to take precautionary measures to deal with potential risks such as floods and landslides.
A day earlier, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warned of a heightened risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as over 200 stranded tourists were rescued from GB’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region.
All tourists stranded on Babusar Highway rescued
All tourists who were stranded on the Babusar Highway have been rescued and are currently in Chilas city, according to Gilgit-Baltistan spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.
He said the search operation for those who were missing is still ongoing.
“The Karakoram Highway has been closed again at one or two points, which has left thousands of travellers stranded at various places across the highway,” Faraq said.
He noted that local private hotel owners, as well as the government, have arranged for free accommodation for tourists.“
Work is underway to restore the Silk Road up to Bisham, Faraq said.
He added that GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan would visit the affected area of ​​Babusar Highway today to personally review the damage caused by flooding and see the problems faced by tourists.
The spokesperson also said that the chief minister will issue important orders regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation of the victims.</p><small>2025-07-23 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615392-atc-extends-remand-of-tribal-chief-in-balochistans-honour-killing-case' target='_blank'><strong>ATC extends remand of tribal chief in Balochistan's 'honour killing' case</strong></a><br><p>

In recent years, another deeply troubling issue has pushed its way into the spotlight — a rise in gender-based violence and ‘honour’ killings.
While such violence has long haunted the province, the proliferation of smartphones, internet access, and social media have made it increasingly difficult to keep these crimes hidden. Over the weekend, one such incident sparked nationwide outrage: a harrowing video emerged online, showing a woman and a man being killed by a group of men in the outskirts of Quetta — reportedly in the name of honour.
At a press conference on Monday evening, while sharing details of the so-called honour-based killing, Balochistan’s Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti disputed reports that the victims were a newly married couple. “The woman and man weren’t married. The woman had five children, and the man, aged around 45 to 50, also had four or five children,” he said, suggesting that the two may have been involved in an extramarital affair.
What’s ironic here is that, over a month after the gruesome murders, when the chief minister held a press conference to share details of the case, he did not share any information regarding the perpetrators or the police investigations into the actual crime. He instead chose to focus on the marital status of the victims, insinuating — without providing any evidence — that they were engaged in an extramarital affair. The fact that the issue at hand was the murders, not the victims’ marital fidelity, seemed to be lost on the chief minister.
Although he stressed that these details did not justify the killings, his comments were seen by some as reinforcing the kind of narratives that often accompany honour-based violence. “It is a murder, a crime, no matter what anyone has done. No one has the right to kill a person this ruthlessly and make videos,” Bugti said.
The footage had earlier sparked widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, forcing the Balochistan government to take immediate action. By Sunday evening, CM Bugti had announced on X that 11 suspects had been arrested, with more arrests expected in the coming days.
 


But this wasn’t an isolated incident of violence against a woman.
Just this March, a young woman was abducted in Khuzdar, ostensibly for turning down a marriage proposal — allegedly with the backing of “influential persons”. The incident sparked public outcry, triggering protests and an uproar in Balochistan’s provincial assembly. For four days, the RCD Highway, which connects Quetta to Karachi, was temporarily closed. The woman was eventually recovered, but the public outrage took longer to die down.
Balochistan may have laws on paper, such as the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act 2014, but implementation remains a serious challenge. The recurring nature of such crimes shows how the state’s writ often runs second to centuries-old tribal justice systems. It also raises questions about the government’s ability, or will, to protect women.
The state seems to only spring into action when a case goes viral, suggesting that justice for women in Balochistan — and the rest of the country — depends less on law, and more on public outrage.
A history of violence against women
While so-called honour killings are tragically common in Pakistan, some cases stand out for their sheer brutality and the impunity that cloaks them. One of the most chilling incidents emerged in 2008, when five women were buried alive in the village of Babakot in Usta Mohammad. The horror of the act sent shockwaves across the country and beyond — not just because of how horrifying it was, but also due to allegations of the complicity of state officials and tribal leaders.
According to The Guardian, government vehicles were reportedly used to abduct the five women, and that the killings were allegedly overseen by a tribal chief — the brother of Sadiq Umrani, a provincial minister at the time from the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). For his part, Umrani denied the allegations, claiming that his family had nothing to do with the incident and accusing his rivals of propaganda. Nevertheless, Umrani remains a sitting member of the Balochistan Assembly and continues to be affiliated with the PPP.
The case stirred even greater controversy when, during a session of the National Assembly, Senator Israrullah Zehri defended the killings, declaring them to be in line with “tribal traditions.”
“These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them,” he said, drawing support from several male lawmakers, some of whom even criticised the woman senator who had dared to raise the issue. Despite widespread condemnation, not a single perpetrator was ever brought to justice.
Activists argue that the prevalence of such heinous crimes largely stems from the state’s failure to act. “The state sees these crimes as tribal or cultural matters and avoids intervention,” says Sadia Baloch, a human rights defender who documents gender-based violence in Nasirabad and Jhal Magsi. “Families, fearing stigma or retaliation, often choose not to report them.”
Another driving factor, Sadia adds, is the deep-rooted influence of tribal chieftains, many of whom are politically connected and shielded from prosecution.
Imrana Imdad, a psychologist offering mental health support to survivors of gender-based violence, has been tracking honour-based crimes across the Makran coast and Lasbela. She says that these crimes are frequently backed by tribal elites who benefit from political power and state protection.
“In most honour killing cases, the culprits are tied to someone in power — a minister, tribal elder, politician or government official. Such figures frequently enjoy state protection, making it nearly impossible to bring them to justice,” says Imdad.
In January 2020, a Quetta sessions court — and later the Supreme Court — rejected then-senator Sarfraz Bugti’s bail in a case involving the alleged abduction of a minor girl and ordered his arrest. For his part, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind rejected allegations linking Sarfaraz Bugti — who is now chief minister — to the case, stating that the latter had been cleared by the court. The CM’s supporters say this was a family matter within the Bugti tribe that was deliberately politicised and turned into propaganda to malign him.
In October 2021, a tribal jirga in Kalat ordered the hanging of a man and woman for allegedly defying “honour.” Once again, the executions sparked outrage and once again, no arrests followed.
Then in February 2023, the discovery of three mutilated bodies — among them an 18-year-old woman — dumped in a well in Barkhan district shook the nation. The victims were believed to be members of Khan Muhammad Marri’s family. Marri accused then-Minister of Communications and Works, Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran, of keeping his relatives in illegal detention and orchestrating their murder. Khetran was arrested but was later released on bail. He, too, currently serves in the provincial cabinet.
 
 

“The involvement of such powerful figures makes the rate of prosecution and punishment in honour killing and gender-based violence cases extremely low,” lamented Imdad. She added that while public outrage and media coverage can sometimes force authorities to act, once the noise fades, so does any hope for justice. “When people forget and move on, the families are pressured into forgiving the perpetrators, and charges are quietly dropped,” she says.
Sadia also pointed to Pakistan’s Qisas and Diyat laws — which allow families to pardon offenders — as a serious obstacle to justice.
One such example came earlier this year. In January, a man who had recently returned from the US murdered his 13-year-old daughter in Quetta over a TikTok video he deemed “objectionable.” The girl held American citizenship. The father was only arrested after public pressure mounted.
“Why must there be a media storm or diplomatic pressure before the state acts?” asks Sadia. “Why can’t the government protect women and girls as a matter of principle, not performance?”
A disturbing reality — in numbers
Each year, approximately 1,000 people — the majority of them women — are killed in honour killings across Pakistan, according to human rights organisations. These murders are typically committed by family members who claim to be defending their family’s honour.
According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), at least 392 women were killed in the name of honour between January and November 2024. Punjab reported the highest toll at 168, followed by Sindh (151), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (52), Balochistan (19), and Islamabad (2). But activists believe that these figures are only the tip of the iceberg — the few cases that reached the media or police.
“The real numbers, especially in Balochistan, are far higher,” adds psychologist Imdad. “Many cases go unreported due to the influence of tribal chieftains, government officials, or individuals connected to political power.”
What has alarmed rights defenders most is the recurring pattern of impunity — particularly when those implicated include politically influential tribal or government figures. This influence often ensures that cases go unreported, underreported, or are quietly buried.
The recent killings on the outskirts of Quetta only drew public and official attention after a video of the incident went viral on social media. Yet, according to the FIR, the incident is believed to have occurred over a month ago. For weeks, there was no police investigation, no public statement, and no political response. It was only once the graphic evidence went public that the chief minister announced a series of arrests.
On July 18, Dawn.com reported another alleged honour killing — this time in Jaffarabad. But unlike the Quetta incident, there was no viral video, no public outrage and no official action. The story, like so many others, went unnoticed.
Even in the Quetta case, the delayed response has reignited uncomfortable questions: why does the state only act when violence against women is caught on camera and amplified on social media? What happens to the countless cases that never make it online?
Strong traditions, elite power, and a culture of impunity
Much of the violence faced by women in Balochistan stems from a combination of outdated tribal structures and the influence of powerful elites. At the heart of this violence are customary practices aimed at maintaining female subjugation — practices that former National Assembly member Israrullah Zehri once described as “centuries-old traditions” that he would “continue to defend.”
From honour killings and child marriages to the exchange of women to settle tribal disputes, such norms remain deeply entrenched within Balochistan’s tribal framework and are routinely shielded by the province’s political powerbrokers.
Efforts to dismantle this oppressive structure have historically been met with resistance. During the 1970s, prominent Baloch nationalist Nawab Khair Bakhsh Marri introduced a resolution in the provincial assembly to abolish the tribal chieftaincy system altogether. Then-Chief Minister Sardar Attaullah Mengal backed the move, arguing that the tribal hierarchy was incompatible with justice and democratic governance. However, the decision required federal approval and was sent to the government of then-Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The proposal was never acted upon. Marri’s push for reform was one of the factors that led to growing political and administrative tensions between Baloch nationalists and the Bhutto government.
In cases of honour killings, what makes the situation even more disturbing is the alleged complicity of some of the province’s most powerful political stalwarts. Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, incumbent minister for Public Health Engineering Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran, and senior PPP leader Sadiq Umrani have all faced serious allegations ranging from illegal detention and abduction to complicity in honour killings.
“The involvement of such powerful tribal leaders with strong connection to government not only hampers efforts to combat gender-based violence and honour killings in Balochistan, but also encourages others, as there is no accountability,” says Sadia, the local human rights defender.
These are not isolated events; they form part of a long-standing pattern in which perpetrators, especially those with tribal or political clout, act with near-total impunity, while state institutions remain either paralysed or complicit — until a horrific video surfaces on social media.

Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured by him before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court had already been upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The 47-page review petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed by Advocate Khawaja Haris on behalf of Zahir under Article 188 of the Constitution (review of judgments or orders by SC). The state and Noor’s father, Shaukat Ali Muqadam, were made the respondents.
 
 

The petition contended that the issue of Zahir’s alleged “unsoundness of
mind or mental capacity” that was raised before the SC in an application had not been addressed and was “given short shrift”.
It further said that “hype created on social media […] constantly created hatred towards the petitioner throughout the investigation and the trial (and even at appeal stage)”, which breached Zahir’s right to fair trial and due process.
“In [the] process of hurry, mistakes were made in the investigation and during trial,” the petition quoted a verdict from another case.
On the rape charges, the review plea argued that it was “apparent from the record that there is no evidence on the record in proof of this allegation”.
The SC had commuted Zahir’s death sentence on the rape charge to life imprisonment, as decided by the trial court, but did not acquit him of it. While he was acquitted of the 10-year sentence for kidnapping, a one-year term was handed down for wrongful confinement under Section 342 of the Pakistan Penal Code, according to the SC verdict.
Zahir’s review plea argued that the video recordings based on which the SC upheld the death sentence had not been proved during the trial and were not provided to any of the accused.
It said the apex court ruling was extensively based on video recordings stored in a digital video recorder (DVR) and on clips that the prosecution said were transferred from the DVR to a hard disk, providing the “most essential link in the chain of circumstances” on which the SC gave its verdict.
“Portions of these so-called recordings, on the basis whereof the inference of ‘last seen’ has been drawn against the petitioner, were never played during the trial, rather, only hearsay evidence thereof was led by the prosecution,” the plea stated.
The SC, in its detailed verdict, had stressed the significance of digital evidence by declaring that footage can be admissible as primary evidence under the “silent witness theory” — a rule of evidence that allows for photog­r­a­­phic video or other recorded evidence to be admitted as substantive proof of what it depicts, without the need for an eyewitness’s testimony.
 
 

Justice Muhammad Hashim Kakar, who led the three-member bench, observed that the silent witness theory of authentication had developed in almost all jurisdictions over the last 25 years to allow photos to substantively “speak for themselves”.
The SC had also noted that Zahir neglected to provide any explanation for the victim’s presence at his residence and the ensuing recovery of her body from the premises.
Zahir is also contemplating filing a mercy petition before President Asif Ali Zardari, with a letter by jail authorities seeking the formation of a medical board so its opinion could be included in the plea. A presidential pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution could provide Zahir pardon or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.
SC verdict
A three-member bench, led by Justice Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi, heard Zahir’s appeal against his death sentence.
The bench upheld Zahir’s death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302(b) (premeditated murder) of the PPC.
However, it converted the IHC’s decision of a second death penalty over rape charges into a life sentence. The high court had turned Zahir’s 25 years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 376 of the PPC into a death sentence.
 
 

While the 10-year jail term for kidnapping in order to murder under Section 364 of the PPC was overturned, Zahir was handed one year of imprisonment for wrongfully confining Noor.
The apex court maintained the earlier orders to Zahir to pay Rs0.5 million to Noor’s legal heir.
The appeals of two co-accused — watchman Mohammad Iftikhar and gardener Jan Mohammad — against their 10-year sentences were also taken up by the SC.
The watchman and gardener’s sentences were reduced, with the bench deciding their detention so far was sufficient and allowing them to be released.</p><small>2025-07-23 08:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615368-noor-mukadam-murder-zahir-jaffer-files-review-plea-in-sc-against-death-sentence' target='_blank'><strong>Noor Mukadam murder: Zahir Jaffer files review plea in SC against death sentence</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi as the head of the ACC was expected to leave for Dhaka on Tuesday night to head the said meeting.
The ACC meeting is considered important, particularly in the backdrop of the the Asia Cup, scheduled to be held in India in the month of September.
According to reports, no official of the BCCI will visit Bangladesh to attend the ACC meeting. There are also media reports that Sri Lanka, Oman and Afghanistan may also not attend.
Though the Asia Cup is an impo­rtant continental event, due to strained political relations between India and Pakis­tan, particularly after the military encounter between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May this year, the fate of the said competition is hanging in the balance.
On its part, the BCCI has said that the political relations between India and Bangladesh are not normal. Therefore, the ACC meeting should be shifted from there to any other venue. But the ACC did not change the venue.
Whether Pakistan visit India for the Asia Cup or a hybrid model will be followed — which was adopted for the ICC events — is yet to be decided.
Under the hybrid model, both India and Pakistan agreed to play their respective matches of ICC events — like the World Cups and the Champions Trophy — on neutral venues.

The HRCP held a press conference to highlight the human rights situation in Punjab as recorded in its report, State of Human Rights in 2024, launched earlier.
While voter registration and total votes cast was reportedly increased in the 2024 general elections, the turnout declined. Women’s representation in the assemblies more than doubled, but the Punjab Assembly remained plagued by disruptions, a tendency to ignore input from the opposition, and hurried legislation. Assembly proceedings in 2024 were dominated by chaos. Women MPAs staged a walkout over inappropriate gestures in the House and the allocation of reserved seats for women and minorities faced legal setbacks.
 






The Punjab Defamation Act 2024, hurriedly approved in June, was widely criticised by human rights networks for stifling free speech. The law was subsequently challenged in the Lahore High Court as unconstitutional.
The Punjab authorities imposed road closures to prevent PTI protests in Islamabad, infringing on the right to movement for both political activists and ordinary citizens.
Continued persecution of religious minorities persisted, including a Christian man in Sargodha who was lynched by a violent mob, following accusations of blasphemy. The Ahmadiyya community withdrew from the electoral process entirely, citing systemic discrimination and lack of safety.
The report notes with alarm that nine people from Punjab were killed on the Quetta-Taftan highway as well as seven Punjabi labourers in an alleged militant attack in Panjgur, Balochistan.
Punjab continued to account for the highest number of child abuse cases in the country. Between January and June 2024 alone, the province reported 78pc of the 1,630 cases nationwide, alongside 2,506 incidents of sexual abuse, 2,189 kidnappings, 457 cases of child trafficking, and 455 instances of physical abuse. The death of 11-year-old Ayesha, a domestic worker in Faisalabad, and similar incidents in Sargodha and Lahore exposed the violence faced by underage working children in private homes.
Reports of sexual violence against women with mental disabilities, domestic abuse resulting in fatalities, including pregnant women, and honour killings continued throughout the year.
In a case involving an alleged rape at a private college in Lahore, HRCP noted that there was no conclusive evidence that the incident had occurred. A ruling by the Lahore High Court declared the age-based gender distinction in the Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929 unconstitutional; however, broader legislative reform remained stalled.
The report notes that workers’ rights and environmental conditions were also neglected. Sanitation workers continued to face hazardous working conditions.
Meanwhile, the provincial government failed to address dangerously high smog levels, with Lahore and Multan recording unprecedented air pollution levels in November.

• Sindh Chamber of Agriculture vows to move court or go for some other crops
HYDERABAD: Sindh Chamber of Agriculture (SCA) has announced that it will challenge the 45pc agricultural income tax in court. It described the tax as ‘unconstitutional, illegal and unethical’, and asked its members and farmers across Sindh to boycott wheat cultivation this year.
The decision was taken at meeting of the chamber held here on Tuesday under the chairmanship of its patron-in-chief, Dr Syed Nadeem Qamar.
The meeting rejected the tax and claimed that it was imposed under directives of the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF).
The farmers who attended the meeting argued that they were not receiving fair prices for their produce and, as such, there was no justification for the imposition of such a tax.
The meeting asked farmers across Sindh not to pay the tax, and warned that if government resorted to arrest them for on this disobedience, millions of other farmers would also court arrest. “We are ready to face imprisonment, but will not pay the agricultural income tax,” farmers’ leaders at the meeting declared.
The participants announced a complete boycott of agricultural income tax and asked the government for the exemptions similar to those given to industrialists.
The SCA told farmers to boycott wheat cultivation for the 2025-26 season on the ground that they were not getting adequate support prices.
The farmers vowed to go for growing alternative crops, such as mustard, nigella (kalonji), sunflower and other oilseeds instead. They said that due to very low wheat prices, they could not even recover the cost of production, and this year will be marked as a ‘boycott year’ for wheat cultivation.
Decline in cotton production
The chamber expressed its deep concern over 40pc decline in cotton production, estimating that the yield would not exceed four million bales. It said farmers were receiving only Rs6,500 per maund for cotton although the Sindh agriculture minister had promised Rs11,000 per ma­und which did not materialise.
SCA demanded withdrawal of the 18pc local tax on cotton and imposition of a 25pc tax on imported cotton to discourage imports this promoting local production. It expressed its concern over rising cost of agricultural inputs, citing a Rs22 per liter increase in diesel prices and Rs600 per bag increase in DAP fertiliser over the last 15 days.
It said that skyrocketing prices of essential agricultural inputs were crippling farmers, especially since they were not receiving fair prices for their produce. These developments, it warned, indicated a deliberate destruction of agricultural sector. It demanded immediate rollback of increased prices of diesel, fertilisers, seeds, pesticides and other agricultural inputs.
The chamber urged farmers to contact their respective mukhtiarkars (administrative officers) and related officials to get themselves registered for the Benazir Hari Card. It demanded that the subsidy of Rs10,000 per acre, currently available to sunflower and canola crops, be extended to mustard and rapeseed crops as well.
The meeting was attended by Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority Chairman Kabool Khatian, general secretary Zahid Bhurgari, Nabi Bux Sathio, Shahnawaz Khan Jamali, Asghar Khan Noonari, Murad Ali Khan Nizamani, Sikander Ali Sariwal, Bilal Khan Laghari, Abdul Karim Talpur and others.

A passing-out ceremony was held here on Tuesday in which Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz handed over the flag to the CNF.
She also met the CNF personnel and inspected vehicles and equipment.
CNF DG Brig Mazhar Iqbal gave briefing about the formation and work of the force to the CM.
Some 866 personnel have been recruited in the first phase in the CNF. It has been made functional in all divisions. In the first phase, CNF stations and regional directorates have been established in each division of Punjab. In the second phase, the scope of CNF will be expanded to the district level.
 






The CM was informed that the CNF officers and personnel were given 12 weeks of professional training at the Anti Narcotics Force (ANF) Academy, Rawalpindi.
Speaking on the occasion, CM Maryam said the future of Punjab was bright with the formation of the CNF. With the establishment of the CNF, she said the menace of drugs would soon be eradicated from Punjab.
“When I assumed the office, I received requests from the parents to protect their children from the menace of drugs. It is highly regrettable that drugs are being transported to every street, neighbourhood, universities and schools,” she said.
She said the CNF had become functional in all  divisions of Punjab. Some 12,000 applications were received for the recruitment in Punjab CNF, out of which 850 soldiers and officers have been selected.
She said: “Just as every disease cannot be cured with a single pill, similarly crime cannot be eradicated with a single force. There was a dire need for the establishment of a specialised department to solve the problems of a large chunk of population. Whenever any problem arises in Punjab, the commissioners and deputy commissioners are called upon to redress the grievance at the earliest, as a result they leave all their other administrative work and focus their attention towards achieving the assigned task.”

Area SHO Sadaruddin Mirani told Dawn that three-year-old Husain Ali had been kidnapped from Sector A-17 and the family had lodged an FIR (731/25) under Section 363 (punishment for kidnapping) of the Pakistan Penal Code against unknown persons around two and a half months ago.
The officer said, on Monday an uncle of the child had gone to offer prayer at a mosque in Sector A-16 of Shah Latif Town where he found his missing nephew begging outside the mosque along with a man. The uncle and area residents caught the man, who was beaten and handed over to police. He was identified as Shaharyar.
During grilling, the held suspect told the police that his in-laws had given him the child. On the information extracted from the suspect, the police also arrested the couple.
According to media reports, the child had been kidnapped when he was returning home from a local shop in Shah Latif Town. The family had been desperately searching everywhere for the missing child.
Area residents told the media that several children had been abducted from their area, and they strongly suspected that an organised kidnapping gang might be behind the disappearances.

Exports registered notable growth to Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka, largely attributed to recent shifts in the regional political landscape. However, trade relations with these countries have remained strained in recent years, primarily due to challenges stemming from restrictive government policies.
Despite the uptick in exports, the overall trade gap with regional partners widened, driven predominantly by increased imports from China, India, and Bangladesh during the months under review.
In FY24, the trade deficit with these countries was $9.506bn, up 49pc from $6.382bn in the preceding year.
Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw a hefty growth in July-June FY25. Still, exports to other countries, especially China, continued to decline during the period, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
The value of Pakistan’s exports to nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — rose 1.49pc to $4.401bn in July-June FY25 from $4.336bn over the same period last year.
Contrary to this, imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Further analysis showed that imports from China grew by 20.79pc to $16.312bn in FY25 from $13.504bn over the same period last year. In FY24, imports from China totalled $13.506bn, up by 39.78pc from $9.662bn over the previous year. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, with partial contributions from India and Bangladesh.
Pakistan’s exports to China dipped 8.6pc to $2.476bn in FY25 from $2.709bn over the same months in the preceding fiscal year.
Imports from India increased pc to $220.58m in FY25 from $206.89m over the last year. In FY24, imports from India rose 6.62pc to $206.89m — up from $190.04m in the same period last year. Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $1.43m in FY25. Exports to India totalled $3.669m in FY24 against $0.329m in the same period the previous year.
Exports to Afghanistan increased 38.68pc to $773.89m in FY25 from $558.03m last year. Imports stood at $25.89m against $11.96 in FY24, a growth of 116.47pc. Pakistan’s main exports to Afghanistan include sugar in the current fiscal year. In the past four months, Pakistan has exported more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar, mostly to Afghanistan.
No data is available as most trade with Iran is conducted via informal channels. However, Pakistan has opted for barter trade amid the thriving smuggling of Iranian petroleum products and LPG via a porous border of Balochistan.
Exports to Bangladesh increased by 19.08pc to $787.35m in FY25 from $661.19m. Imports grew 38.47pc to $78.31m in FY from $56.55m over the last year. The increase resulted after the toppling of the Hasina government in Dhaka. Pakistan has started exporting rice to Bangladesh in the current fiscal year.
Exports to Sri Lanka dropped 4.14pc to $376.61m in FY25 from $392.89m over the last year. This decline in exports to Sri Lanka occurred following the recession in economic activity.

“The confidence of Chinese companies in the Pakistani economy is extremely important for our economic future,” Prime Minister Shehbaz said while chairing a meeting on Tuesday regarding security arrangements for Chinese citizens in Pakistan.
The prime minister acknowledged that multiple measures were being taken to enhance the security of Chinese nationals across the country, including in Islamabad.
 






He said that the Safe City projects were an excellent example of this increasing capacity. He added that Safe City projects were being built across the country as per the international standards.

Unveils plan to overhaul police training, align it with military academy standards

“China is our friendly country,” said the prime minister stressing that the protection of Chinese brothers was the top priority of the government. He said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was a highly important joint project between the two countries which had now entered its second phase, where business-to-business cooperation will be prioritized between the two countries.
In light of the development of CPEC, the protection of Chinese nationals in Pakistan had gained even greater importance, he said, while issuing directives that measures be taken on a priority basis at all airports to facilitate their arrival and departure.
 
 

During the meeting, the prime minister was briefed on the progress of special security arrangements for Chinese nationals across the country.
Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi informed the PM about the security arrangements being implemented nationwide. It was said special security arrangements for Chinese nationals had been enforced in light of potential terror threats.
The federal government and all provinces were working in full cooperation on this matter, while safe city projects were under construction across the country, it was highlighted.
Chinese nationals were also being provided with security escort facilities for travel, the PM was told.
The meeting was further informed that all new housing projects would be equipped with cameras that meet Safe City standards.
Training facility inaugurated
Earlier, the PM visited the National Po­­l­ice Academy (NPA) and Islamabad Safe City Capital Command and Control Centre.
Addressing the 52nd Commons Batch of Assistant Superintendents of Police (ASPs), the PM announced plans to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of the institution, aligning it with the standards of the Pakistan Military Academy.
He also inaugurated the ‘Raising the Standard: NPA Tactical Firing Range and Elite Police Training Facility’, a state-of-the-art complex designed to provide han­ds-on tactical training to police officers.
Besides, the PM performed the groundbreaking ceremony of the new ASP Hostel, aimed at providing modern residential facilities for trainee officers.
He outlined a bold vision for the academy’s revival, announcing the launch of a Master’s degree programme for trainees and the establishment of a 25-acre state-of-the-art campus where a training school, with a modern firing range, would be built. “Collaboration with international partners, including China and the United Nations, is planned to upgrade training standards,” he added.
In his address, PM Shehbaz praised law enforcement agencies along with security forces for their commitment to eradicate terrorism from the country. He urged police force to uphold justice and ensure safety and protection of the life and properties of the people.
He praised the leadership of police institutions, including trainers and course commanders, and encouraged enhancement of the Gilgit-Baltistan quota. “We aim to equip our officers not only with weapons but also with modern technology and critical thinking. From hostels to classrooms, the entire structure will be refurbished,” he said.
