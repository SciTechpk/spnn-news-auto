“I believe there is a broad consensus that we have made significant inroads and achieved considerable progress in terms of macroeconomic stability,” he said while addressing a joint news conference on economic reforms.
He was accompanied by Power Minister Awais Leghari, Information Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali.
Aurangzeb said the government had achieved macroeconomic stability, as evidenced by external validation: three leading international rating agencies upgraded Pakistan after a gap of three years. “These agencies are now aligned not only on where we stand but also on our positive outlook,” he added.
He said the successful completion of the second International Monetary Fund (IMF) review and the subsequent staff-level agreement in Washington reaffirmed that the country’s economic trajectory was on the right path.
When the exchange rate stabilises, foreign exchange reserves rise, inflation declines, and the policy rate comes down, the benefits are evident for industries, the minister remarked, adding that investors had repatriated more than $4 million in profits and dividends.
Aurangzeb said investor confidence was crucial for attracting new foreign direct investment (FDI). “Until our existing investors are satisfied, we cannot talk about further FDI,” he said, adding that the government had moved in the right direction toward stability.
Highlighting the next phase of economic management, the finance minister said Pakistan must now focus on avoiding historical boom-and-bust cycles and move toward sustained and inclusive growth.
Pakistan today stands at a unique confluence of economic stability and favourable geopolitical tailwinds, he said, pointing to stronger trade and investment opportunities with China, the United States, and Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
He stressed that structural reforms were indispensable for achieving sustainable growth.
The minister said the government’s reform agenda covered key areas, including taxation, energy, restructuring of state-owned enterprises, privatisation, rightsizing of the federal government, digital transformation, debt management, and pension reforms.
These are the areas consistently highlighted by analysts, think tanks, and our bilateral and multilateral partners, he added.
Increase in tax collection
Meanwhile, FBR Chairman Langrial said the tax-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio increased over the last year by 1.49 per cent, crediting effective measures by the government for the collections.
“The rate of submission of individual tax returns has increased,” he said. “FBR is implementing the tax measures approved in the budget; it has the support of all institutions.”
Power Minister Leghari, while giving an update on the reforms in the power division, said the electricity prices have been reduced by Rs10.5 over the last 18 months. He said the reduction for the industrial units has been to the tune of Rs16 per unit.
“We are also set to operationalise the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM) in January or February next year to facilitate the electricity trading market,” he said.
Describing the move as the biggest reform in the power sector, he said “this will free the government from the business of purchasing power and the consumers will get better prices of electricity in future,” according to Radio Pakistan.
Leghari said the government has also reduced the circular debt, with a plan to clear the circular debt of Rs1.2 trillion without putting extra burden on the consumers in the next six years.

Separately, the PPP also issued a similar statement that quoted Bilawal as saying that the proposal included setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates and the matter of transfer of judges. It also included the end of protection for the provincial share under the National Finance Commission and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces, the statement further quoted Bilawal as saying.
 






He added that the proposed amendment also included a provision about the return of the subjects of education and population planning to the federation and a point about ending the stalemate regarding appointments to the Election Commission of Pakistan.
Bilawal said a session of the PPP’s central executive committee (CEC) had been called after President Zardari’s return from Doha on November 6 for deciding the party policy on the matter.
A subsequent post by the PPP said the CEC session would be held at Bilawal House in Karachi, where overall political situation in the country would also be discussed.
 






The government had last year passed a 26th Constitutional Amendment. It was passed by parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
Even though the 26th Amendment remains mired in controversy and faces challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad are abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to the insiders, will further “fine-tune” the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.
In August, however, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar had said during a press conference that the country was “running well” and experiencing stability and economic improvement, adding that there was no need for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Bilawal had also previously dismissed talk of any potential legislation regarding a 27th Amendment as “baseless rumours”.
But, the ruling coalition now seems to be steering in a different direction.
The matter of the proposed legislation had reportedly come up during an Oct 27 meeting between Bilawal and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. The two leaders had met to discuss the prevailing political situation and formulate a joint strategy on key national issues.
JUI-F sources said that the focus of the discussion was to formulate a collective strategy related to new legislation and develop parliamentary cooperation between the PPP and the JUI-F. They claimed that Bilawal had stressed during the meeting the importance of the role of opposition parties in the upcoming legislation.
Meanwhile, opposition PTI has been criticising the proposed amendment.
In June, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) had also endorsed the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges. Speaking at a press conference, IHCBA President Syed Wajid Hussain Gilani had stated that the legal fraternity welcomed the 27th Amendment, which followed the precedent set by the 26th Constitution Amendment.</p><small>2025-11-03 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/03114526a009b6c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952901/powerful-63-magnitude-quake-in-afghanistan-kills-20-injures-over-300-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Powerful 6.3-magnitude quake in Afghanistan kills 20, injures over 300: ministry</strong></a><br><p>A strong earthquake killed at least 20 people in northern Afghanistan, authorities said on Monday, just months after another deadly tremor that left the country reeling.
The 6.3-magnitude quake struck overnight at a depth of 28 kilometres with the epicentre near the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
More than 20 people were killed and around 320 were injured in the provinces of Balkh and Samangan, health ministry spokesman Sharafat Zaman told journalists on Monday morning, stressing that this was a preliminary toll.
He did not provide a province-wide breakdown of the casualties.
 






Expressing sorrow over the “tragic loss of lives in northern Afghanistan after the deadly earthquake near Mazar-e-Sharif”, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X that Pakistan “stands in solidarity with our Afghan brothers and sisters in this difficult hour”.
“Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and prayers for the swift recovery of the injured,” he said.
 






Residents of Mazar-i-Sharif, one of Afghanistan’s largest northern cities, scrambled into the streets due to fears their homes would collapse, an AFP correspondent observed.
The city’s famed Blue Mosque, a 15th-century landmark known for its vibrant tiles, was also damaged, an AFP journalist witnessed.
Pieces of the structure, particularly from one of its minarets, broke off and lay scattered across the mosque’s grounds, one of the country’s few remaining tourist spots.

Correspondents in the capital Kabul, around 420km to the south, also said they felt shaking.
Power supply company DABS said imported electricity lines from Uzbekistan had been cut off due to the earthquake, leaving parts of nine provinces without power, Tolo News reported.
 






The Afghan Taliban defence ministry said parts of Balkh and Samangan provinces were the most affected, resulting in fatalities among a number of citizens.
Military Rescue and emergency assistance teams reached the area immediately and began operations to rescue people, transport the injured, and assist affected families, it said in a statement.
 






The USGS issued an orange alert in its PAGER system, which is an automated system that produces information on the impact of earthquakes, and indicated that “significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread”.
Videos of rescue efforts being carried out to save people trapped under rubble and images of fallen debris in buildings were shared on the social media platform X.
One video showed rescuers pulling what appeared to be dead bodies from rubble. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage and the images.
Active faults
Earthquakes are common in Afghanistan, particularly along the Hindu Kush mountain range, near where the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates meet.
Many homes in the predominantly rural country — devastated by decades of war — are shoddily built.
It often takes hours or days to travel by steep roads and paths to remote villages, which are often cut off from help during disasters or poor weather.
Poor communication networks and infrastructure in mountainous Afghanistan have hampered disaster responses in the past, preventing authorities for hours or even days from reaching far-flung villages to assess the extent of the damage.
It is the latest natural disaster for the Taliban government, which has faced three major deadly earthquakes since taking over Afghanistan in 2021, even as the foreign aid that formed the backbone of the country’s economy has dramatically dropped.
 
 

In August, a shallow 6.0-magnitude quake in the country’s east wiped out mountainside villages and killed more than 2,200 people.
Large tremors in western Herat, near the Iranian border, in 2023, and in eastern Nangarhar province in 2022 killed hundreds and destroyed thousands of homes.
The United Nations and aid agencies have warned that hunger is rising among the Afghan population.
The isolated country is suffering from a humanitarian crisis compounded by drought, economic restrictions on the banking sector, and the pushback of millions of Afghan citizens from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan.

Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi had resigned from the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) over a criminal inquiry into the leaking of a video that allegedly showed soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza conflict. She said that she was stepping down because she had approved the video’s leak in August last year.
In a report on Sunday, the Times of Israel said that Tomer-Yerushalmi was reported missing by her family, which prompted a search by authorities.
“The large search, involving police, rescue forces, and the military, was carried out after she was unreachable for several hours, and her car was later found at Hatzuk Beach near Tel Aviv. Hebrew media outlets reported that she had left a letter at home, which some characterised as a ‘suicide note’,” the publication said.
However, Tomer-Yerushalmi made contact with her husband a few hours later and was found along a beach in the nearby city of Herzliya. She was reportedly taken for a health checkup before being arrested in connection with the video leak, the report added.
The Times of Israel reported that the ex-IDF legal chief had been on leave since a criminal investigation was launched by police last week into the leaking of the surveillance video.
 
 

In a separate report, the publication said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed fury about the video leak, declaring it the “most serious public-relations attack” against Tel Aviv to date.
The incident “caused enormous reputational damage to Israel, to the IDF, and to our soldiers”, he was quoted as saying.
“It is perhaps the most serious public relations attack Israel has experienced since its founding — I cannot recall one so concentrated and intense,” Netanyahu said. “This requires an independent and impartial inquiry, and I expect that such an investigation will indeed take place.”
Video leak
The abuse investigation led to criminal charges against five soldiers and stirred an uproar. The inquiry drew condemnation from right-wing politicians and prompted protesters to storm two military compounds after investigators sought troops for questioning in the case.
A week after the break-in at the bases, a security camera video showing the moments of the alleged abuse was leaked to an Israeli television channel.
It showed soldiers taking a prisoner aside and crowding around while holding a dog and blocking visibility of their actions with their riot gear.
Tomer-Yerushalmi defended her action as an attempt to fend off propaganda against the military’s legal department entrusted with upholding the rule of law, and which she said had been subjected to smears throughout the Gaza conflict.

The FO had stated a day earlier that the foreign minister would be undertaking a one-day visit to Türkiye to attend the Coordination Meeting of Arab-Islamic Foreign Ministers to discuss the Gaza ceasefire deal.
The FO posted on social media today that Dar had reached Türkiye to participate in a meeting hosted by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan “to discuss the recent developments in Gaza”.
It added that upon arrival, FM Dar was received by Ambassador Ahmet Cemil Miroğlu, Director General of Protocol, as well as officials of the Pakistan Embassy.
 






The talks are to begin at around 11am GMT (4pm Pakistan time) at an Istanbul hotel, with a news conference due several hours later, AFP reported.
Hamas and Israel had signed a ceasefire agreement on October 9, agreeing to free the Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. Pakistan was one of the eight Arab and Muslim countries to work with Trump on the plan.
However, despite signing the deal, Tel Aviv has already resumed its attacks on Gaza.
Today’s meeting is expected to bring together the foreign ministers of Türkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan — the same countries that met with Trump on Sept 23 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
AFP, citing Turkish foreign ministry sources, reported that Ankara is set to urge the dignitaries to support plans for Palestinians to take control of Gaza’s security and governance.
 
 

Fidan is expected to “emphasise the importance of coordinated action by Muslim countries for the ceasefire to evolve into a lasting peace”, a Turkish foreign ministry source was quoted as saying by Reuters.
Meanwhile, according to FO’s statement yesterday, Pakistan will emphasise the need for the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territory, especially Gaza.
It will also call for the provision of unfettered humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians and the reconstruction of Gaza, while reiterating the need for an “independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine” based on pre-1967 borders.
Seems Hamas ‘determined’ to stick to truce: Erdogan
Hamas is “determined” to stick to the truce, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said today, adding it was crucial that Muslim nations play a leading role in Gaza’s reconstruction.
“It seems that Hamas is quite determined to adhere to the agreement,” Erdogan told delegates from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) gathered in Istanbul for their annual economic summit.
He stressed it was “essential” that the OIC “play a leading role in the reconstruction of Gaza”.
“At this point, we need to deliver more humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza and then begin reconstruction efforts. […] The Israeli government is doing everything in its power to prevent this,” Erdogan said.
 






On the eve of the meeting, FM Fidan welcomed a Hamas delegation led by its lead negotiator Khalil al-Hayya.
“We must end the massacre in Gaza. A ceasefire in itself is not enough,” Fidan said, arguing for the two-state solution to the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“We should recognise that Gaza should be governed by the Palestinians, and act with caution,” he added.

Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan confirmed the details to Dawn, adding that the incident took place on Miranshah road, which connects Bannu and North Waziristan.
“Armed men open fire at the vehicle of North Waziristan’s DPO,” RPO Khan said. “The DPO remained unhurt,” he added.
He further said the injured police personnel were taken to the Bannu District Headquarters Hospital.
 
 

“The unidentified attackers have hidden in nearby areas and a search operation is underway [to trace them],” the Bannu RPO said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The past few months have seen an escalation in attacks on law enforcement agencies, with police forces in KP being targeted repeatedly.
Yesterday, a station house officer and two other cops were injured in a blast caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) in KP’s Hangu district. Last week, terrorists kidnapped a police official from Bannu’s Havaid Adda area.
 
 

Separately, the Bannu police on Friday also claimed to have recovered Constable Noor Zaman, who had been kidnapped by terrorists in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali town. The cop was on his way to attend the last rites of his brother, Constable Javed Khan, who had been martyred in a gun attack in Bannu.
Faced with the heightened militancy, security forces have also intensified counter-terrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.
Militants in Pakistan suffered their heaviest losses in 10 years during the month of October as security forces intensified operations against them, according to a report by the think-tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p><small>2025-11-03 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/031212330679f3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952912/they-do-not-talk-about-it-trump-claims-pakistan-among-countries-testing-nuclear-weapons' target='_blank'><strong>‘They do not talk about it’: Trump claims Pakistan among countries testing nuclear weapons</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump has included Pakistan among countries that he claims are “testing nuclear weapons”, saying that he did not want the US to be the only country that does not do so.
“North Korea has been testing. Pakistan has been testing. […] But they don’t go and tell you about it,” he said in an interview on CBS News programme ‘60 Minutes’, where he was asked about his recent directives to the Pentagon to resume testing nuclear weapons. He also named Russia and China as testing nuclear weapons.
In a recent social media post, Trump had instructed the US Department of War to resume testing nuclear weapons “immediately”. Confusion has surrounded Trump’s order that the US begin testing, particularly if he meant conducting the country’s first nuclear explosion since 1992.
When the matter was brought up during the interview, Trump said: “Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. I think we should do something about denuclearisation. And I did actually discuss that with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Xi.
“We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world a 150 times. Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot,” he said.
At this point, he was interrupted by the interviewer, who asked, “So why do we have to test our nuclear weapons?”
“Well, because you have to see how they work,” replied Trump. “Testing is because Russia announced that they are gonna do a test. If you notice, North Korea is testing constantly, other countries are testing. We are the only country that doesn’t test, I don’t want to be the only country that doesn’t test.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

He was then asked to clarify whether he was saying that the US would start detonating nuclear weapons after more than 30 years.
He replied, “I am saying that we are going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do.”
But the only country that was testing nuclear weapons was North Korea, the interviewer pointed out. Russia and China have not carried out such tests since 1990 and 1996, respectively.
To that, Trump said Russia and China, too, were testing nuclear weapons. “You just don’t know about it.”
When the interviewer pointed out that Russia’s recent test was that of a delivery system for nuclear weapons, which was essentially a missile, Trump asserted: “Russia is testing, and China is testing, but they don’t talk about it.”
He added: “We are an open society. We are different, we talk about it. We have to talk about it. Because, otherwise, you people are going to report. They don’t have reporters who can be writing about it. We do.
“We are gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea has been testing. Pakistan has been testing. […] But they don’t go and tell you about it. And as powerful as they are — you know it’s a big world, you don’t necessarily know where they are testing. They test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening with the test. You feel a little bit of a vibration.
“They test, and we don’t test. We have to test. And Russia did make a, you know, little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China does test, and we are gonna test also.”
Trump went on to say: “This just doesn’t make sense. You know, you make nuclear weapons and then you don’t test. How are you gonna do that? How are you gonna know if they work? We have to do that.”
Dawn has reached out to the Foreign Office for a comment on Trump’s assertion that Pakistan is among the countries that are testing nuclear weapons.
During the conversation on ‘60 Minutes’, the interviewer also remarked that “apparently, we don’t need to test our nuclear weapons because they are the best in the world, according to experts I have spoken to”.
To that, Trump replied: “According to me, we have the best. And I was the one that renovated them and built them during a four-year period, and I hated to do that. Because the destructive capability is something you don’t even want to talk about. But if other people are gonna have them, we are gonna have to have them.
“And if we have them, we have to test them. Otherwise, you don’t really know how they are gonna work. And we don’t want to ever use them.”
‘Responsible nuclear-weapons state’
Asked about Trump’s comments on Monday, China’s foreign ministry denied conducting nuclear weapons tests.
As a “responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always … upheld a self-defence nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing”, spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press conference in Beijing.
She added that China hoped the US would “take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability”.

The event is being held from today to November 6 (Thursday) at Karachi’s Expo Centre, and will see the participation of 45 countries, including Pakistan. It has been organised under the overall responsibility of the Pakistan Navy and with the support and patronage of federal and provincial departments.
Addressing PIMEC, Iqbal highlighted that Pakistan had a unique geography as the regions of South Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa converged here, which positioned the country as a “natural maritime bridge between the East and the West”.
However, despite these advantages, the maritime sector contributed less than 1pc to Pakistan’s GDP, compared to 4-7pc in several other maritime nations, he lamented.
 


The planning minister pointed out that Pakistan had a coastline of over 1,000 kilometres, an exclusive economic zone of nearly 290,000 square kilometres, and “vast offshore potential” in renewable energy, fisheries and mineral resources.
Noting that the government’s Uraan Pakistan plan aimed to transform Pakistan into a $1tr economy by 2035, Iqbal underscored the importance of the 5Es framework — exports; e-Pakis­tan; equity and empo­werment; environment, and climate change; and energy and infrastructure.
He further said the government had identified “eight key drivers of export-led growth” — agriculture and food processing, manufacturing and industry, information technology and digital services, mines and minerals, manpower and skills export, creative and cultural industries, services sector and tourism, and blue economy.
“In this age of interconnectedness, the oceans have re-emerged as the highways of global commerce, energy and communication, and these nations that harness them wisely are shaping the future of economic power,” Iqbal said.
“The world’s prosperity literally sails on the seas,” the minister noted. Citing the United Nations Trade and Development (Unctad), he highlighted that over 80 per cent of the global trade by volume, and 70pc by value, is carried by sea.
He further said that the global blue economy contributes more than $2.5 trillion annually to the world’s GDP and sustains over 350 million jobs across shipping, ports, fisheries, coastal tourism and other areas.
 
 

During his address, Iqbal termed the spirit of the modern blue economy as seeking God’s “bounty through trade, innovation and exploration while being grateful and responsible stewards of his creation”.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also attended today’s inaugural ceremony.
Terming PIMEC a “great opportunity”, CM Shah said in a statement that the event brings together national and international maritime business leaders, as well as opens new investment doors.
“Sindh government is committed to promoting maritime trade, strengthening ties all over the world,” he asserted.
 






PIMEC’s 2025 edition features 150 local and 28 global exhibitors.

Ghazala Hashmi, a Democrat, Muslim and South Asian-American, is leading the race for lieutenant governor, while Zohran Mamdani, also a Democrat, heads into New York City’s mayoral contest with commanding support.
With less than 24 hours to go before the polls open, community leaders are urging Pakistani Americans and other Muslim voters to turn out in force for Tuesday’s elections.
 
 

New York City is seeing unprecedented early voting this year. According to the City Board of Elections, 584,105 ballots had been cast by Saturday evening, compared with only 109,000 at the same point in the 2021 mayoral election.
Young voters under 50 make up about 69 per cent of these early ballots, and Emerson College polling shows overwhelming support for Mamdani among this group. Older voters remain more evenly divided, but the energy and turnout among younger voters could prove decisive on Election Day.
Mamdani, aged 34, stands poised to become not only the youngest mayor in more than a century but also the city’s first Muslim and South Asian leader.

His campaign — centred on freezing rent increases, making buses free, and investing in publicly owned grocery stores — has energised younger voters and working-class neighbourhoods. Analysts note that his rise has already captured national attention, prompting commentary from US President Donald Trump.
“Some people are saying he’s here illegally,” Trump said, while also calling Mamdani “a communist” and warning, “Well then, we’ll have to arrest him.”
At another rally, he declared: “This guy … wants to destroy New York. … I love New York and we’re not gonna let him do that.”
Trump reiterated that label during an interview with CBS, saying Mamdani was a “communist, not socialist”. Asked about comparisons made between the two, the US president said, “I think I’m a much better-looking person than him.”
 


Mamdani’s team has said Trump’s remarks are attempts to intimidate a rising generation of progressive politicians.
Mamdani himself has spoken about the broader stakes: “In the words of Nelson Mandela, ‘It always seems impossible until it is done.’ My friends, we have done it. I will be your Democratic nominee for the mayor of New York City.”
Observers describe Mamdani’s rapid ascent — from state assemblyman to frontrunner for one of the most powerful municipal offices in the country — as a potential national inflection point for progressive politics. His campaign has energised young voters and activists across the country, with his ideas and platform generating attention in political circles well beyond New York.
 






Virginia’s early voting has also been strong, although the focus is more on turnout than ideology. By Saturday, more than 1.6 million ballots had been cast statewide, representing roughly 40pc of the projected total turnout. This is a marked increase from the 1.1m early votes recorded at the same point in 2021.
Young voters under 40 make up nearly 35pc of early voters and appear to be favouring Democratic candidates, including Hashmi and Abigail Spanberger.

At a brunch hosted by Pakistani-American supporters of the Republican Party in Springfield, Virginia’s Secretary of Commerce Juan Pablo Segura urged Muslim and South Asian voters to support Republican candidates, citing shared conservative social values.
“Go out and vote,” Segura told the gathering. “Join the political process if you want to be counted … Do not complain if you do not vote.”
Mansoor Qureshi, Chairman of the Civic Committee on the Governor’s Asian Advisory Board, highlighted the potential influence of these communities.
“With more than 450,000 registered voters, South Asian and Muslim communities in Virginia can significantly shape election outcomes,” he said, noting that previous close races, including Governor Glenn Youngkin’s 60,000-vote margin and Lt Governor Winsome Sears’s 50,000-vote win, could easily have been affected by small shifts in participation.
Hashmi, who made history as Virginia’s first Muslim woman senator, has avoided emphasising religion in her campaign. Instead, she focuses on her record as an educator and policymaker. Her campaign literature highlights equity, educational opportunity, and expanding prospects for working-class families rather than the identity of her faith.
She told supporters: “This is about ensuring opportunity and equity for every Virginian. We want to build a future where everyone, regardless of background, has a fair shot.”
The contests in New York and Virginia together illustrate a broader shift in American politics: Muslim and South Asian Americans are emerging as strong candidates, coalition-builders, and decisive voting blocs. In New York, their support is powering a progressive insurgency; in Virginia, their turnout could influence statewide partisan balance. Across both states, participation, identity, and representation are increasingly intertwined.
The conversation at the Republican lunch focused on the outcome of the two elections. Participants argued that if Mamdani wins in New York, the consequences could ripple across the national Democratic Party, reinforcing activist-led platforms and challenging centrist models. And this, they said, would further galvanise the Republican base.
If Hashmi prevails and the community turns out as leaders hope in Virginia, it will reaffirm that coalition-building among Muslim and South Asian Americans is central to modern electoral arithmetic.
The participants acknowledged that US politics may hinge on two simultaneous shifts: the emergence of a new kind of candidate, and the awakening of a community that was sidelined after 9/11.</p><small>2025-11-03 07:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/030722081b27fe5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952877/self-rule-for-gaza-tops-istanbul-moot-agenda-today' target='_blank'><strong>‘Self-rule for Gaza’ tops Istanbul moot agenda today</strong></a><br><p>• Summit of Muslim bloc foreign ministers will ‘come down hard on Israel’ over ceasefire violations
• Pakistan to demand complete Israeli withdrawal, unfettered provision of aid to Palestinians
ISLAMABAD: Turkiye is expected to push for ensuring the security and administration of Gaza by Palestinians, as Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar joins his counterparts from the eight-nation Muslim bloc, suing for peace in the besieged Palestinian territory, for a summit in Istanbul today (Monday).
The Coordination Meeting of Arab-Islamic Foreign Ministers is expected to take up the Gaza ceasefire deal, piloted by US President Donald Trump.
However, the truce, which left thorny issues like the disarmament of Hamas and a timeline for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza unresolved, has been tested by unilateral Israeli bombardment since coming into force.
The Istanbul meeting is expected to bring together the foreign ministers of Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan — the same countries that met with US President Donald Trump on Sept 23, on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
At the foreign ministers’ meeting, Turkiye’s Hakan Fidan is expected to “emphasise the importance of coordinated action by Muslim countries for the ceasefire to evolve into a lasting peace,” Reuters quoted a Turkish foreign ministry source as saying on Sunday.
The source said Mr Fidan is set to tell the meeting that Israel is “making excuses” to end the ceasefire and emphasise the need for the international community to “take a resolute stance against Israel’s provocative actions”.
He was also set to say that humanitarian aid entering Gaza is insufficient and Israel has not fulfilled its obligations in this regard.
According to TRT World, Mr Fidan is anticipated to stress the need to swiftly implement arrangements that would allow Palestinians to assume responsibility for Gaza’s security and administration, while safeguarding their legitimate rights and upholding the vision of a two-state solution.
He will also highlight the importance of maintaining consultations and close coordination on steps to be taken within UN platforms, the sources added.
Relations between Turkiye and Israel have hit new lows during the Gaza war, with President Tayyip Erdogan harshly criticising Israel’s attacks. It was Turkiye that helped persuade Hamas to accept Trump’s peace plan, and Ankara has expressed willingness to take part in the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), proposed to monitor ceasefire implementation in Gaza.
However, Israel has made it clear that it won’t accept the presence of Turkish armed forces in Gaza. Other nations part of troop contribution talks include Jordan, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan.
Top-level consultations are said to be underway over the question of sending Pakistani troops for the proposed ISF, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon.
However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the United Nations umbrella.
On Saturday, the Jordanian and German foreign ministers had called for a UN mandate for the proposed ISF, saying it would “need a clear basis in international law”.
Pakistan’s stance
During the Istanbul meeting, Pakistan will emphasise the need for the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territory, especially Gaza, as well as the provision of unfettered humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians and the reconstruction of Gaza, a statement from the Foreign Office said.
 






Pakistan has remained engaged with the peace initiative that led to the signing of the Gaza Peace Agreement in Sharm El-Sheikh, the FO said.
“Pakistan will also reiterate the need for collective efforts aimed at achieving an independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders, in accordance with relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative,” the FO added.
Pakistan has been, and will continue to be, committed to efforts to restore peace, justice, and dignity to the Palestinian people, as well as to ensure the realisation of their right to self-determination, the statement said.

After suffering heartbreak in the final of the 2005 and 2017 editions of the 50-overs showpiece, India beat South Africa by 52 runs to secure their first title in front of 40,000 delirious home fans at Navi Mumbai’s DY Patil Stadium.
Three defeats in a row earlier in the tournament had nearly derailed India’s campaign before they bounced back to storm into the semi-finals, where they pulled off a record chase to eliminate seven-times champions Australia.
‘Dream big and chase those dreams’
“The team showed exceptional teamwork and tenacity throughout the tournament. Congratulations to our players,” Prime Minister Modi said on social media.
“This historic win will motivate future champions to take up sports.”
 






The Indian cricket board announced the team would receive a reward of 510 million Indian rupees ($5.8 million) for their title triumph, a victory which the Indian Express newspaper termed “Herstoric” on its front page.
Harmanpreet said it could be a turning point for the women’s game in the cricket-mad country.
“We have been talking about this for many years weve been playing good cricket, but we had to win one big tournament,” the batter said.
“Without that, we couldnt talk about change. At the end of the day, fans and the audience want to see their favourite team win.
“It’s not that we weren’t playing good cricket, but we were waiting badly for this moment, and today we got a chance to live it.”
The fairytale triumph of the Indian men’s team at the 1983 World Cup is considered the catalyst for the country’s rise to becoming a powerhouse of the game, both on and off the pitch, and batting great Sachin Tendulkar said Sunday’s win was “a defining moment in the journey of Indian womens cricket”.
“1983 inspired an entire generation to dream big and chase those dreams,” he wrote on social media.
“Today, our womens cricket team has done something truly special. They have inspired countless young girls across the country to pick up a bat and ball, take the field and believe that they too can lift that trophy one day …”
 






Mithali Raj, who led India to the 2017 women’s final, said the victory for Harmanpreet’s side had made her dreams come true.
“Ive seen this dream for over two decades, to watch the Indian women lift that World Cup trophy,” she wrote on X.
“Tonight, that dream finally came true. From the heartbreak of 2005 to the fight of 2017, every tear, every sacrifice, every young girl who picked up a bat believing we belong here, it all led to this moment.”

A deal under which Islamabad will take delivery of eight Hangor-class submarines by 2028 is “progressing smoothly,” Admiral Ashraf told the Global Times in an interview published on Sunday, adding that the successful launch of the second and third submarines in China earlier this year was a major milestone for naval collaboration between the two countries.
Admiral Ashraf further said that the project was not only significant for the advancement of the Pakistan Navy’s submarine force capabilities, but would also contribute toward self-reliance through transfer of technology and skill development at Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works, according to the report.
He said that the Type 054A/P frigates marked another major achievement in China-Pakistan naval cooperation. The publication reported that such multirole frigates were already in service with the Pakistan Navy, quoting Admiral Ashraf as saying that they are “among the most advanced surface combatants”.
Admiral Ashraf also told the Global Times that these Chinese-made frigates had greatly strengthened the navy’s multi-mission capability, particularly in air defence, anti-submarine warfare and maritime surveillance.
“These platforms are playing a key role in ensuring maritime security in the North Arabian Sea and the broader Indian Ocean region, which is critical for global economy,” he was quoted as saying.
The update on the Chinese submarine deal follows the Pakistan Air Force using Chinese-made J-10 fighter jets in May to shoot down an Indian Air Force Rafale aircraft, made by France.
The altercation between the nuclear-armed neighbours surprised many in the military community and raised questions over the superiority of Western hardware over Chinese alternatives.
 
 

Under the terms of the submarine agreement — reportedly worth up to $5 billion — the first four diesel-electric attack submarines will be built in China, with the remaining vessels assembled in Pakistan to improve the nation’s technical capabilities.
Pakistan has already launched three of the submarines into China’s Yangtze River from a shipyard in the central province of Hubei.
“Chinese-origin platforms and equipment have been reliable, technologically advanced and well-suited to Pakistan Navy’s operational requirements,” Admiral Ashraf told the Global Times, adding that the navy’s experience with them had been positive, both in terms of performance and technical support.
“As modern warfare evolves, emerging technologies such as unmanned systems, artificial intelligence and advanced electronic warfare systems are becoming increasingly important. The Pakistan Navy is focusing on these technologies and exploring collaboration with China,” Ashraf was quoted as saying.
Islamabad has long been Beijing’s top arms customer, and over the 2020-2024 period bought over 60 per cent of China’s weapons exports, data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.
On the topic of China-Pakistan naval cooperation in the future, Admiral Ashraf said the Pakistan Navy’s partnership with China was built on deep-rooted friendship, mutual respect, trust and shared strategic interests.
“In the coming decade, we expect this relationship to grow, encompassing not only shipbuilding and training, but also enhanced interoperability, research, technology sharing and industrial collaboration,“ he was quoted as saying.
“There is immense potential for cooperation in advanced technologies, unmanned systems, marine scientific research and maritime industry development. Together, we aim to ensure a secure and stable maritime environment that supports regional peace and prosperity,” he further said, adding that China has been a “trusted partner in the Pakistan Navy’s modernisation journey”.
He further said that the introduction of advanced frigates and submarines had significantly enhanced the Pakistan Navy’s operational reach, multi-domain war fighting capabilities, and deterrence posture, the publication reported.
He said that these platforms, along with joint training and exercises with China, had deepened the two sides’ professional synergy and strengthened interoperability at sea, noting that “this cooperation goes beyond hardware; it reflects a shared strategic outlook, mutual trust, and a long-standing partnership”.</p><small>2025-11-03 05:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631848-pimec-2025-traffic-plan-which-routes-to-avoid-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>PIMEC 2025 traffic plan: Which routes to avoid in Karachi?</strong></a><br><p>

Police said that the baby, who was later sold to someone in Punjab, had been recovered and returned to his parents, while the health facility had been sealed.
On Nov 1, Sarang Khan, the newborn child’s father, lodged a case with Memon Goth police under sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act 2018 and 34 Section of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Memon Goth police officer Fayaz Jokhio told Dawn on Sunday that the baby boy had been recovered from Lahore. “Raids are being held to arrest the nominated suspects,” he added.
In the FIR, Mr Khan told the police he was a resident of a village in Nooriabad and a labourer by trade. His wife (Maheen) was pregnant and she left for her parents’ home after developing some differences with him around three to four months ago.
She was taken to a private clinic in Murad Memon Goth on October 5 by her mother Mrs Shahnaz to deliver the baby.
After the medical check-up, a doctor suggested an operation and asked them to make the required payment.
When Mrs Shahnaz said that they were poor and did not have the money to bear the cost of the operation, the doctor allegedly told them of a woman who would “help the poor and adopt their children”, while also paying for medical expenses.
The complainant claimed that his wife and mother-in-law agreed to this proposal, and the baby boy was handed over to the woman, who turned out to be another employee at the same medical facility.
The complainant claimed that his wife and his mother-in-law kept the incident from him, adding that he came to know through relatives that he was blessed with a male child, but he had been given up for adoption at the hospital.

This recommendation is part of the ECP’s post-election review annexed with its statutory annual report laid before the National Assembly in September.
GE-2024 was challenged by opposition parties who alleged that ROs had manipulated the results. The ECP had appointed 144 DROs and 266 and 593 ROs for the national and provincial assembly constituencies, respectively, mostly drawn from the district management group. The ECP, however, believes that ROs from the judiciary have a better understanding of the laws and rules and hence can undertake poll activities more smoothly than executive ROs, who also command the district administrative machinery — necessary for the smooth conduct of any election.
 
 

Many candidates blamed ROs in their constituencies for manipulating results (Forms 47 and 48) while expressing confidence in the results (Form 45) prepared at polling stations. Some alleged that the ROs were under pressure from the establishment, while others claimed that a ‘winning’ Form 48 was sold to the highest bidder. However, no allegation of foul play could be proved in court, nor does the ECP appear to have initiated an inquiry.
It is against this backdrop that the ECP’s recommendation becomes significant — almost a vindication of the allegations that executive officers did not perform their duties in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. In fact, the report itself suggests that despite comprehensive training, “first-time ROs faced certain difficulties in performing the electoral activities”, indicating that the law and rules might not have been enforced as intended. The nature of these “difficulties” needs further elaboration to ensure they did not “materially affect” the result of any constituency. The ECP may also wish to clarify the number of first-time ROs and correlate the alleged irregularities with the constituencies of their appointments.
But it was not just the naïveté of “first-time ROs” that concerned the ECP; it was also their inaccessibility to perform poll duties. While the election law is explicit that any official appointed or deputed to perform election duties “shall be deemed to be under the control, superintendence, and discipline of the Commission…,” these executive officials were not easily accessible to the ECP. “…DROs and ROs, being administrative officers, remained involved in performing their principal duties and were not easily accessible for electoral duties,” reads the report.

The conduct of judicial officers in Pakistan has not always been above board.

Their inaccessibility is a serious offence and falls within the purview of another provision of the law, whose violation empowers the ECP to take strict punitive measures. If DROs and ROs were not easily accessible for poll duties, they breached Section 55 (3)(e), which bars any official on election duty from disobeying or avoiding compliance with any instruction issued by the ECP. Such inaccessibility goes beyond mere avoidance; it reflects disregard for the direct superintendence of a constitutional entity. Whether the ECP used its powers to penalise the “inaccessible” officials isn’t known.
 
 

Instead of invoking its punitive powers to improve enforcement, the ECP has now asked parliament to amend Elections Act, 2017, by adding a provision to sub-section 1(c) of Section 50 binding the chief justices of the high courts to provide judicial officers for appointment as DROs and ROs when requested by the ECP. The binding clause has likely been proposed because the chief justices had refused a similar request by the ECP for GE-2024.
However, Pakistan’s electoral history shows that the conduct of judicial officers has not always been above board. The PTI, for instance, alleged foul play by ROs drawn from the lower judiciary during GE-2013. Although a subsequent judicial commission led by the then Supreme Court chief justice ruled out allegations of rigging, it acknowledged “shortcomings of the ECP” in conducting the elections, including a disconnect between the ECP and ROs, implying that the latter may have acted independently. The ECP itself noted this in an April 2013 press release after several political parties raised concerns about how ROs were conducting candidate scrutiny.
The recommendation also raises a constitutional question. Article 220 binds only the executive authorities in the federation and provinces to assist the ECP in the discharge of its functions. Meanwhile, Article 175(3) provides for the separation of the judiciary from the executive. Binding chief justices to comply with the ECP’s requests may then need a constitutional amendment. Moreover, appointing judicial officers as DROs and ROs creates an institutional conflict of interest, as poll petitions are heard — under the existing law — by judges of the same high courts whose chief justices would be involved in appointing the lower court judges serving as DROs and ROs.
Interestingly, the ECP has again taken an evasive position in its report, reasoning why it should not take direct responsibility for conducting poll processes at the constituency level. It may not have enough officials to fill all RO positions, but it can certainly appoint DROs from among its own ranks. The ECP should assume direct supervision of electoral processes by appointing district election commissioners as DROs and seek legal reforms to strengthen this position. In their capacity as DROs, DECs can continue to “coordinate multifarious electoral activities and provide technical assistance” to ROs — the very justification the ECP has given for not appointing them to roles directly related to the conduct of polls.
There is ample evidence that the quality of elections managed directly by ECP officials as DROs and ROs is far better than those managed by ‘borrowed’ officers. Such oversight at the district level is crucial to keeping ROs — whether drawn from the executive or the judiciary — in line and ensuring that elections are conducted in accordance with the law and rules. The ECP can best serve its constitutional mandate only when it assumes micro-level supervision of the entire electoral process and uses its punitive powers to ensure full compliance by all officials. Judicial officers are not the panacea for democratic disorder, which remains rooted in the public’s distrust of the electoral process.

Powerful states and regional powers are using coercive power to try to bend other states to their will. The threat or the use of force has become an option of first resort for them and the principal means of ‘resolving’ disputes. Attacks by stronger countries on the sovereignty of their adversaries or weaker states have become all too frequent. Some of these aggressive actions are disingenuously called pre-emptive wars. Israel’s war on Gaza, its attacks on Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Qatar, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, US bombardment of Iran and India’s military action against Pakistan all testify to the increasing use of force and violation of international law.
This new era of escalation and growing insecurity has renewed thinking among countries about nuclear weapons. Iran and Ukraine were attacked by nuclear powers. An NPT-member state, Iran was bombed by two nuclear-weapon states. This has encouraged more countries to see nuclear weapons as a guarantor of security. The lesson security-challenged countries may have drawn from recent events is that without nuclear weapons they are more vulnerable to external aggression and attacks on their sovereignty.
The annual 2025 SIPRI report highlights the potential for more countries to consider developing or hosting nuclear weapons. This at a time when the nuclear arsenals of nuclear-weapon states are being enlarged and upgraded and arms control efforts have come to a halt. President Donald Trump’s recent announcement that the US will resume nuclear testing seems a response to Russia’s claim to have tested a long-range, nuclear-powered cruise missile. But it is a dangerous move that will further erode a fraying nonproliferation regime. In the annual resolution on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted by the UN General Assembly’s First Committee last week, the US was the only country to vote ‘no’ — for the first time.
 
 

A newly published book by Serhii Plokhy is a timely assessment of the nuclear issue and why countries have sought the bomb. The Nuclear Age: An Epic Race for Arms, Power and Survival is a tour de force of the history of nuclear weapons development and the geopolitics behind it, focusing on what motivated countries to acquire them. It is a cautionary tale about the perils of weapons that can annihilate all humanity. Plokhy writes that since the American acquisition of the bomb, the nuclear arms race never really ceased except in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the US and Soviet Union agreed on disarmament measures and several countries were persuaded or forced to give up their nuclear programmes. That lull ended in 1998 with nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan. Israel acquired a nuclear weapons capability decades earlier, in the late 1960s/ early ’70s with significant French and some British help. By 2006, North Korea also joined the nuclear club. Meanwhile, Iran continued its nuclear programme.

If fear is a key motivation to go nuclear more countries may be encouraged by today’s turbulent world.

With nuclear-weapon states upgrading their arsenals and no arms limitation efforts to restrain them, Plokhy argues the world is in a more dangerous place than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis because an uncontrolled arms race raises the chances of nuclear war, by accident or otherwise. He says a new threat emerged with Russia’s attack on Ukraine’s nuclear installations and Russian leaders threatening to use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear state. Although he doesn’t mention this, Israel and America’s attack on Iran’s nuclear sites takes that threat to another level.
Plokhy is concerned with drawing lessons from the first nuclear arms race that can help stop or control the next one. The crux of his book lies in assessing why some countries built the bomb while others gave up trying to acquire one. This is a question long discussed in the rich literature on the subject with motivating factors ascribed to prestige, security, power projection, domestic politics and leaders’ ambitions. Plokhy’s core argument is that whatever the combination of motives, the fear factor is decisive — “fear of nuclear attack by another state or of superior conventional forces possessed by an adversary”. Thus states’ “concerns about their security, represented by the emotion of fear, is paramount for understanding why they go nuclear”. Fear, he says, can generate different reactions, some irrational, others grounded in actual security threats.
Fear has produced paradoxical effects in nuclear history, both fuelling the arms race and making it more manageable and predictable. Fear of the nuclear balance of terror among adversaries led to arms control and reduction agreements during the Cold War. What worries the author is that in today’s unregulated global nuclear environment, fear can ignite a more dangerous phase of the arms race. He offers prudent advice. “We have to relearn how to manage our fear, recall how dangerous nuclear brinkmanship can be and recognise how important it is not to become a victim of nuclear blackmail and encourage the adventurism of nuclear rivals.”
What about the factors behind South Asia’s nuclear trajectory? Pakistan’s pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability was unambiguously security-driven. Two key developments shaped the decision. First, the Indian intervention in Pakistan’s dismemberment and military defeat in 1971. The second turning point was India’s 1974 nuclear explosion. The never-again thinking that followed 1971 — and fear of more Indian aggression — led to the strategic conclusion that Pakistan could only rely on itself for its security. Feroze Khan, author of the seminal book about Pakistan’s nuclear quest, Eating Grass, explains that “Pakistan’s humiliation [in 1971] laid the foundation for a shift in the once peaceful nature of the nuclear programme” to one aimed at acquiring the bomb.
 
 

India’s motivation to go nuclear was driven less by security and more by its quest for great-power status and prestige, as George Perkovich and others have also pointed out. Khan says it was also about competition with China, which motivated both India’s 1974 and 1998 tests. The 1962 Sino-Indian conflict acted as added incentive.
Given the current global turbulence and surge in regional rivalries, Plokhy’s book ends with a stark warning. The world may see 40 additional nuclear-armed countries which would dramatically increase the threat of intentional or accidental use of nuclear weapons. A sobering thought for a deeply troubled world.

A source in the Prime Minister’s Office told Dawn that the findings had been submitted to the premier in a sealed envelope, who is likely to decide the fate of the probe in “a day or so”.
In August, the PM had suspended eight senior Nat­ional Highway Authority (NHA) officials and for­med a committee to probe irregularities in the award of the contract, including ghost tendering, by the authority.
The inquiry committee included retired federal secretary Muhammad Mushtaq Ahmed as its convener, the commerce division secretary; retired NHA member Mukhtar Ahmed Durrani, retired chief engineer Akbar Ali, and a planning commission member.
The committee was asked to review NHA’s current practices related to blacklisting contractors; examine whether the NHA undertook due diligence during the opening of technical bids of Carec Tranche-III project; assess whether the NHA conducted the grievance redressal in the instant process in a transparent and judicious manner; evaluate all stages in the award of the project so far to ascertain unnecessary delays, if any; suggest a way forward on the current process; and review any other matter ancillary to the above.

Panel tasked with probing NHA’s current practices related to blacklisting contractors, evaluating award of project

The PMO source said nobody except the inquiry committee was aware of their decision.
The Economic Affairs Division committee, however, had recently questioned how the PM’s inquiry committee would reach a decision, given that the National Highway Authority had failed to provide relevant documents to the Senate committee for the past four months.
The Carec Tranche-III project has also come under scrutiny in five standing committees of the Senate and the National Assembly and the Public Procu­rement Regulatory Authority (PPRA).
In September, the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs Division recommended blacklisting a joint venture of three firms, which were awarded a project by the National Highway Authority in violation of the rules.
The Senate panel meeting also recommended sending a letter to the donor Asian Development Bank to apprise them that the bids were “technically invalid and were manipulated due to the mala fide intention of the NHA officials and contractors”.
Carec is an Asian Development Bank-supported initiative which was created in 1997 to encourage economic cooperation among countries in the Central Asian region. Tranche I, II and III road projects are underway or have been completed. Tranche-III has four lots as Lot-1 (58km road from Rajanpur to Jampur), Lot-2 (64km from Jampur to DG Khan), Lot-3 (112km from DG Khan to Tibbi Qaisrani), and Lot-4 (96km from Tibbi Qaisrani to DI Khan).

Party leaders formally filed a representation against the bill, which has been sent to the president, prime minister, Punjab governor, chief minister and other senior officials.
PTI leader Ijaz Shafi said on Sunday the bill would be challenged in the LHC, along with a request for a stay order. He said objections have been prepared with the assistance of lawyers.
The representation has been submitted by Sheikh Imtiaz Mahmood, Ijaz Shafi, Muneer Ahmad and Mian Shabbir Ismail.
According to the text of the representation, several provisions of the bill are in conflict with Articles 17, 32 and 140-A of the Constitution.
PTI leaders have expressed strong reservations about the non-party-based, one-vote, multi-member union council model, saying that the non-party system would weaken the role of political parties and place administrative officers in control rather than elected local representatives, undermining local government powers.
They said the centralisation of financial powers goes against the spirit of local autonomy, while the authority to appoint administrators for an indefinite period is unconstitutional.
They demanded the restoration of direct elections for union council chairmen, the establishment of a fixed five-year tenure and a clear election schedule for local governments and strict restrictions on executive interference and administrators’ powers.
The bill was passed in mid-October.

• Oman urges Tehran and Washington to resume stalled nuclear talks
TEHRAN: Iran said on Sunday that it would rebuild nuclear sites damaged by Israeli and US strikes “stronger than bef­ore”, as mediator Oman urged Tehran and Washi­ngton to revive stalled diplomacy.
US President Donald Trump has said the strikes obliterated Iran’s nuclear programme, but the full extent of the actual damage remains unknown.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a visit to the country’s nuclear organisation, said Tehran “will build (the destroyed sites) stronger than before”.
“By destroying buildings… we will not be set back,” he said in a video posted to his official website, adding that Iranian scientists still had the necessary nuclear know-how.
Pezeshkian did not elaborate. In similar remarks in February before the strikes, he said Tehran would rebuild its sites if they came under attack.
Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran in June, kicking off a 12-day war that saw it target nuclear and military facilities — as well as residential areas — and kill many top scientists.
Iran retaliated with ballistic missile barrages aimed at Israeli cities.
Iranian Foreign Mini­ster Abbas Araghchi said in July, after the United States announced a halt in fighting, that the damage in Iran was “serious and severe”.
Pezeshkian’s comments came as Oman, Iran’s traditional intermediary, urged the two countries on Saturday to resume talks.
“We want to return to the negotiations between Iran [and] the United Sta­tes,” Omani Foreign Mini­ster Badr Albusaidi said at the IISS Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain.
Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said Sunday that Tehran “has received messages” on resuming diplomacy, without providing further details.
Oman hosted five rounds of US-Iran talks this year. Just three days before the sixth round, Israel launched its strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Iran has since faced the return of UN sanctions after Britain, Germany and France triggered the “snapback” mechanism over Tehran’s alleged non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.

According to a police official, Saqib, a team was conducting a search operation in Paracha grav­yard near the Karbogha area when the remote-controlled explosion occur­red, leaving SHO Imran­uddin, Head Constable Jihad Ali and Abid Ali injured.
All three were later provided treatment  Hangu’s district headquarters hospital.
The attack followed a threat alert issued on Fri­day by the federal interior ministry in Islamabad. The alert had cautioned that a  motorcycle lad­en with explosives might be used to strike a police checkpoint or security officials between the Hangu and Orakzai districts.
The alert had urged concerned authorities to heighten security in the area.
IED expert killed
Meanwhile, security forces eliminated Abu Dujana, an Afghan national identified as a specialist bombmaker, during an intelligence-led raid in Tank district’s Lali Khel area.
The operation, which saw two or three militants escape despite sustaining injuries, yielded a significant cache of weaponry including a 30kg IED, which was promptly neutralised, and a suicide vest, grenades, small arms and ammunition, according to sources.
Kalat bridge bomb defused
Separately in Balochistan, locals helped avert potential disaster by alerting authorities to explosives planted beneath a bridge in Kalat district’s Johan area.
Security forces rushed to the site and defused the 10-kilogram device, which a senior levies official described as “locally manufactured” and intended to destroy critical infrastructure in the Johan sub-tehsil.
He added that a further investigation is underway.

• Qaiser says party ‘willing to talk to anyone’ if fair polls assured
• Ismail says no ‘minus-Imran formula’
LAHORE/ISLAM­ABAD: Even as its founder remains locked up, and the party continues to lose ground, some former PTI members seem to have taken it upon themselves to end the isolation faced by their erstwhile party, proposing talks with the government and other parties to bring down political temperatures and pave the way for Imran Khan’s release.
Only a day ago, a number of ex-PTI leaders, including former information minister Fawad Chaudhry and ex-Sindh governor Imran Ismail, had called on party vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a Lahore hospital, ostensibly to seek his blessing for their campaign — an offer Mr Qureshi did not endorse, as per his lawyer.
On Sunday, Mr Chaudhry doubled down on his quest to revive the fortunes of the PTI, even as senior party leaders like Asad Qaiser maintained that both the party and its founder “will not compromise on their principles” even if they engage in a dialogue.
Speaking to Dawn, Fawad Chaudhry acknowledged that he and his colleagues did not have a mandate to engage with the government on behalf of the PTI. However, as a concerned citizen, he said he wanted the volatile political climate to stabilise.
According to the ex-PTI leader, his group will meet the National Assembly speaker and the Senate chairman next week to ask them to play a role in defusing political tensions.
He claimed that most seasoned PTI politicians and more than 15 MPAs had approached him to express their agreement that a government-PTI engagement was “highly necessary”. He urged the government to take the first step towards de-escalation by offering relief to imprisoned senior PTI leaders.
“If the government gives relief to the incarcerated Lahore and Gujranwala leaders, then these leaders could engage with the jailed Khan and lead a process of engagement,” he explained. “Imran Khan’s mandate is with the party leaders, who have been in jails for the past two years,” he acknowledged, referring to people like Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Dr Yasmin Rashid.
“If the government does not leave any stake for the opposition in the system, the opposition will be left with no option but to hold long marches, resign from assemblies and resort to other modes of protest,” he rued.
It may be noted that the government and opposition held a series of talks in the recent past, which did not prove fruitful.
“Until the three major players —Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari – and the establishment engage with the incarcerated seasoned politicians, no political engagement will be possible in a volatile situation,” he added.
Speaking about his “meeting” with Mr Qureshi and Ejaz Chaudhry, he said he planned to take these leaders on board in light of their letters from jail in which they had urged the party chief for dialogue to break the political deadlock. The incarcerated leaders had written a letter to their jailed chief to consider a dialogue with other political parties instead of insisting on only talking to the military establishment.
Downplaying overtures
On the other hand, former NA speaker and PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser played down the recent overtures by his former party colleagues, saying they would be prepared to talk only if the “stolen mandate” was returned to the “true representatives”.
“The fact is that we have been suggesting for years that the PTI is ready to talk to everyone only if justice is provided to the party without creating any hurdles,” Mr Qaiser told Dawn.
“We just want the court cases to be decided on merit. We are willing to talk with anyone about deciding the modalities of the next election and assurances that the next election will be free and fair,” he said.
When asked if it was correct that some party leaders wanted to “streamline” the issues with the establishment, but were reluctant due to Imran Khan, Mr Qaiser said that some individuals may have their personal opinions, but it was not the party policy. “During party meetings, it is categorically stated that there will not be any compromise on principles,” he said.
However, Fawad Chaudhry said the PTI leadership had failed to create any breakthrough to get Imran Khan out of jail during the past two years. He claimed that he had told Mr Khan that many politicians in the party had vested interests attached to his imprisonment and they would make no efforts to help him get out of jail.
No ‘minus formula’
His colleague Imran Ismail dispelled the impression that they were working on a ‘minus Imran formula’ and termed their outreach campaign an “effort to move Pakistan’s politics away from confrontation”.
“We privately consulted a number of PTI stalwarts. Almost all admitted that confrontation has failed and that reconciliation is the only way forward,” he said in a lengthy statement posted on X (formerly Twitter).
 






“When we met Chaudhry Ejaz in Kot Lakhpat Jail and Shah Mehmood Qureshi at PKLI, both — while firmly standing with Khan — agreed that the stalemate must end. They sought normal political breathing space, not surrender,” he said.
He said if any PTI leader believed that “continuing agitation and confrontation is the right path, he should come forward and convince the rest of us who think otherwise”.

• Calls for deeper reforms to cut energy, input costs
ISLAMABAD: The World Bank has asked Pakistan to improve its skewed preferential trade agreements with 10 bilateral partners, ensure a market-determined and flexible exchange rate and push deeper reforms to lower energy and other input costs to turbocharge over three decades of declining exports for sustainable economic growth.
In a policy advice to the government, the bank observed that nearly all countries that have achieved rapid and durable growth have done so by tapping into global markets, but Pakistan has struggled to follow this path.
“Exports have declined from 16 per cent of GDP in the 1990s to just around 10pc in 2024, with the export basket still concentrated in low-value textile and agricultural products,” it said, adding that economic upturns had been fuelled instead by debt and remittance-financed consumption, rather than export dynamism.
 
 

The Washington-based lending agency has asked Pakistan to maintain a flexible exchange rate to ensure export competitiveness and complement tariff reform.
“Allow the emergence of a deep and liquid interbank market without SBP [State Bank of Pakistan] intermediation and encourage greater participation from a diverse range of market players, including exporters, importers and foreign investors,” it said.
It also demanded the publication of detailed data on interbank market transactions, including volumes and participants and phase out ad hoc interventions by the central bank, allowing the exchange rate to reflect genuine supply and demand.
It noted that as growth accelerates and is fuelled by higher imports, foreign exchange reserves are strained, particularly when the exchange rate is tightly managed, triggering recurrent balance-of-payment crises. This cycle of boom and bust has undermined investor confidence, constrained private investment and eroded the foundations of long-term sustainable growth.
 
 

Underlying this weak export performance are deep-seated productivity and competitiveness challenges, it said. Distor­tionary policies, such as high tariff barriers, increased input costs and consumer prices, driving up production costs and encouraging firms to focus on protected local markets.
Simultaneously, excessive and redundant red tape and regulation, and a heavy state presence in the economy (including more than 200 state-owned enterprises at the federal level) have undermined efficiency, deterred investment, and distorted resource allocation, as exporters face major constraints on  access to finance.
On top of that, the costs of customs management and logistics are high, and government-supported measures to assist firms in accessing foreign export markets have often been insufficient, including in negotiating trade deals, establishing a system to support
export market compliance, and promoting Pakistan’s exports abroad.
Therefore, fundamental constraints to firm productivity remain unaddressed, including the exorbitant cost of electricity and limited access to core digital infrastructure.
“In combination, these challenges have led to missing exports of close to $60 billion,” the World Bank said and advised a large set of reforms, including deepening preferential free trade agreements for expanding markets.
The bank said free or preferential agreements with other countries serve as a critical lever for strengthening competitiveness and market access by reducing barriers and addressing trade facilitation issues, such as customs procedures, standards and investment integration, thereby creating an enabling environment for exporters to expand and diversify.
But these agreements, in the case of Pakistan, remained underutilised, leading to missed opportunities. “Pakistan remains party to only 10 trade agreements, most of which are shallow and limited to tariff liberalisation on a narrow set of goods,” it said. The China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement covers a larger share of areas, including tariffs, investment and trade facilitation, while agreements with Malaysia, Sri Lanka and the South Asian Free Trade Agreement remain partial in scope,” the bank pointed out. This leaves Pakistan behind its aspirational peers, which leverage a greater number and depth of agreements to embed themselves in global value chains and attract investment. “Deepening existing trade agreements and expanding coverage under those agreements to services, non-tariff measures and investment will be key,” it said.
The World Bank asked the government to enhance the capacity of the negotiation unit through targeted training, ensure regular consultations with exporters and industry to align agreements with business opportunities and establish mechanisms to monitor implementation and performance of trade agreements.
It also suggested active exploration of avenues to upgrade existing shallow preferential trade agreements towards deeper agreements covering services, investment and digital trade, including those with non-traditional export markets in regions with export potential, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.
The bank welcomed recent tariff reforms but said they needed to be complemented by a flexible exchange rate, full operationalisation of the EXIM Bank of Pakistan, stronger trade facilitation and broader structural reforms to boost export competitiveness. The World Bank called for capacity building of the National Tariff Commission to monitor, evaluate and implement anti-dumping and countervailing measures to protect against unfair trade practices and focus on trade negotiation efforts on further tariff reductions with key and emerging trade partners.

• PM reiterates commitment to providing safe environment for newsmen
• PTI sees ‘crackdown’ on media as ‘darkest chapter’ in country’s history                
ISLAMABAD: Amid a surge in crimes against journalists, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) has called on the federal and provincial governments to take concrete measures to ensure the safety and security of journalists.
The call came as PM Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his government’s commitment to protecting press freedom and ensuring a safe environment for journalists.
“There can be no real press freedom without accountability for attacks against members of the media,” PFUJ President Afzal Butt and Secretary General Arshad Ansari said in a statement on the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists.
They noted with concern that crimes against journalists had witnessed a sharp surge, jumping nearly 60pc over the past year, with 142 cases documented between Nov 2024 and Sept 2025.
This creates “a climate of fear and intimidation that undermines press freedom and the public’s right to information,” the statement said, while demanding that the government ensure the safety and security of journalists; investigate and prosecute crimes against them in a timely manner’, ensure justice and reparations; and, create a safe and enabling environment for the press. 
In his message on #EndIm­punity day, PM Shehbaz paid tribute to all journalists who have endured hardships in the pursuit of truth and justice, and expressed solidarity with the families of those writers, journalists, and media workers who lost their lives in the line of duty.
“We will take all necessary measures to guarantee effective investigation of crimes against jou­­rnalists, deliver justice, and ens­ure legal action against the perpetrators,” he further emphasised.
He said a free, informed, and responsible press is vital to democracy, enabling public access to facts and truth. Acts of violence or threats against journalists, he noted, are attacks on freedom of expression. 
The prime minister also urged the global community, media organisations, and civil society to help protect journalists and uphold press freedom.
‘Attempt to muzzle dissent’
Meanwhile, pointing to recent reports indicating that Punjab and Islamabad had become the most dangerous places for journalists in the country, the opposition PTI described it as a deliberate and systematic campaign to muzzle dissent, criminalise journalism, and suppress the truth.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram warned that the ongoing crackdown on journalists and the press represented “one of the most repressive chapters in Pakistan’s democratic history”.
He said the alarming rise in attacks, arrests, and legal cases against journalists underlined the regime’s growing intolerance for truth. The PTI leader also expressed his anguish over the murder of senior journalist Arshad Sharif, whose killers remain unpunished, despite the lapse of several years.

Shafali Verma and Deepti Sharma starred with both bat and ball to propel India to the title in front of a jubilant home crowd at Mumbai’s DY Patil Stadium.
Hosts India posted 298-7 and then bowled South Africa out for 246 in 45.3 overs with spinner Sharma taking five wickets after earlier contributing a vital run-a-ball 58 in the middle order.
Opener Verma top-scored with 87 as India posted a challenging total after they were put in to bat in a final delayed two hours by rain.
 






South Africa skipper Laura Wolvaardt hit a valiant 101 but her departure off Sharma raised the noise at the 45,000-capacity stadium, which had turned into a sea of blue.
Sharma took down Nadine de Klerk, for 18, for the final wicket as India celebrated with the thousands of supporters inside the ground and millions outside in the cricket-mad nation.
“We wanted to break this barrier,” Kaur said.
“And our next plan is to make this a habit. We were waiting for it, now this moment has come. So many big occasions are coming, and we want to keep improving. This is not the end, just the beginning.”
 






The Indian women triumphed at the third attempt after finishing runners-up in 2005 and 2017.
India toiled in the league phase and suffered three successive defeats but clinched the last semi-final spot, before knocking out record seven-time champions and heavy favourites Australia.
For South Africa, it was a third straight loss in a World Cup final after they finished runners-up in back-to-back editions of the T20 showpiece in 2023 and 2024.
South Africa made their first ODI World Cup final despite starting the competition with a 10-wicket thrashing by England after being bundled out for 69.
Verma’s golden arm
The Proteas had their revenge when they beat England in the semi-final with Wolvaardt scoring 169.
“I could not be prouder of this team for the campaign we had,” said Wolvaardt, who led the tournament batting charts with 571 runs at an average of over 71.
“Brilliant cricket throughout but outplayed today (by India). Unfortunate to be on the losing side but we will definitely grow from this.”
Sharma struck key blows with her off-spin in the final, including the wicket of Annerie Dercksen, who hit 35 in a 61-run partnership with Wolvaardt that gave South Africa hope.
But it was Sharma’s double-wicket over to dismiss Wolvaardt and then Chloe Tryon, for nine, that took India to the brink of victory.
 






Kaur’s ploy of giving the ball to Verma, a part-time off-spinner, in the 20th over proved key as the youngster removed Sune Luus.
Verma dislodged Marizanne Kapp in the next over to plunge South Africa into deeper trouble but Wolvaardt kept South Africa in the game until her departure in the 42nd over.
Kaur said the decision to hand Verma, who was named player of the match, the ball proved to be the “turning point” of the game.
Verma, who was brought into the team for the semi-final after fellow opener Pratika Rawal went down injured, gave India a fast start with the bat.
She put on 104 runs with Smriti Mandhana (45) to lay solid foundations at a venue that has produced big runs, including India’s record chase of 339 in the semi-final against Australia.
 






Sharma then added valuable runs with her 18th ODI fifty to crank up the pressure on South Africa despite three wickets for Ayabonga Khaka.
Sharma took a tournament-best 22 wickets, also chipping in with 215 runs as a batter, and was named the best player of the World Cup.</p><small>2025-11-02 21:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631808-misunderstanding-kmc-says-resolution-against-heavy-e-challans-was-never-approved' target='_blank'><strong>'Misunderstanding': KMC says resolution against heavy e-challans never approved</strong></a><br><p>

A second round of discussions between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban delegations had began in Istanbul on October 25, following days of border hostilities, but Islamabad’s long-standing concern over terror attacks emanating from Kabul remained a major point of contention, resulting in a stalemate. A breakthrough came after Turkiye and Qatar salvaged the dialogue process for the second time in less than a week, following Pakistan’s announcement on Oct 29 that the talks had “failed” and that its negotiators were preparing to return home.
The talks produced a three-point understanding — the continuation of the ceasefire, the establishment of a monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace, and penalties for violations. The operational details of that mechanism are expected to be finalised when the “principals”, senior representatives from both sides, meet again in Istanbul on November 6.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the information minister responded to a question about the monitoring mechanism discussed in Istanbul, stating that a review would be taken of activities during the past few days and modalities on a joint mechanism would be discussed.
“The onus is on the Afghan regime because their soil is being used for terrorism in Pakistan by Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan,” he explained. “For Pakistan, this will be an additional forum to provide evidence and the Afghan Taliban regime has to take action. If they do not take action, they will receive punishment.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
When asked if Pakistan would respond to terrorist attacks by striking targets in Afghanistan after the mechanism is in place, Tarar said it would depend on the situation.
“If the situation is very serious and if Pakistan has the right to respond within international law and the UN Charter, then it depends on the situation that arises,” he responded.
“Once the mechanism is established, there is joint verification and evidence is produced, then any party violating the agreement will be punished. But it depends on the situation,” he added. “Now the Afghan Taliban have no room to make excuses like they used to do. Now that third parties are involved, they will have to take action.”
In response to a question about Afghanistan’s offer to hand over terror suspects to Pakistan, Tarar explained that Pakistan’s government had declined the offer and questioned why the Afghan Taliban administration was issuing such statements following the talks.
“The matter is clear: Pakistan has previously demanded that any terrorists who pose a threat to Pakistan be controlled or arrested,” he said. “However, the Afghan side says they are Pakistani nationals and they will be handed over … I believe these new claims are twisting facts. We immediately proposed a handover through a border post; it is a long-standing position.
“I don’t understand why they have to give these statements and complicate the situation.”
Tarar also called the Afghan Taliban government a “fractured regime” which does not have complete control of Afghanistan.
“There are fragments and not every faction is under control. There is unity of thought between the civilian and military leadership [in Pakistan] and they (the Afghan Taliban) should stop levelling allegations at us. This is propaganda, to which we gave a befitting response.”
Border skirmishes and talks
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Türkiye and Qatar have deep ties with Pakistan, while Qatar also played a major role in the negotiations between the Afghan Taliban and Nato forces.</p><small>2025-11-02 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02225229dcfa17e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952753/anp-backed-lawyers-bag-most-seats-in-kp-bar-council-elections-provisional-results' target='_blank'><strong>ANP-backed lawyers bag most seats in KP Bar Council elections: provisional results</strong></a><br><p>Lawyers backed by the Awami National Party (ANP) have won at least 12 of the 28 seats of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council, outperforming other groups in polls held across the province on Saturday, according to provisional results.
The unofficial results released on Sunday revealed that three candidates of Malgari Wakilan (MW), which is affiliated with the ANP, two of the PTI’s lawyers wing and an independent candidate were elected on six of the seven seats of Peshawar.

Those who were declared successful in Peshawar included Khizar Hayat Khazana, Fazal-i-Wahid and Babar Khan Yousafzai of MW, Ali Zaman and Sophia Noreen of the Insaf Lawyers Forum (ILF) and an independent candidate, Muhammad Saeed.
As for the winner for the seventh seat, initially Rafiq Mohmand of MW was reported as successful, but later reports also emerged about the victory of a female candidate, Khushnood Zakirullah.
The official result of the elections will be announced on November 4.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel, who is also chairman of the KP Bar Council, was the returning officer for the polls.
According to unofficial results for other cities, independent candidate Fida Afridi bagged the bar council seat in Nowshera, Zarbadshah of MW and Asfandyar of Islamic Lawyers Forum won in Mardan and Syed Mubashir Shah of MW emerged victorious in Swabi.

Following the arrest of former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan on May 9, 2023 from the Islamabad High Court’s premises, riots erupted across the country that went on for at least 24 hours. Public properties and military installations were also vadalised during the riots, including the Radio Pakistan building in KP’s provincial capital.
The announcement that the KP government would be forming a commission to probe the vandalism of the building was made by Meena Khan during a press conference alongside Adviser to the KP chief minister Shafiullah Jan in Peshawar today.
“Since it is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in our jurisdiction, our first cabinet will form an inquiry commission to probe what happened at the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar,” Meena Khan said.
“This commission will probe who was behind what happened to [the] Radio Pakistan [building] and the CCTV footage will be analysed. We will see who opened the doors and also why that footage has not emerged yet.”
 






The provincial minister also spoke about a video showing KP CM Sohail Afridi, allegedly outside the Corps Commander House in Lahore during the riots, clarifying that the chief minister was in Peshawar at the time.
He said Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan spoke about the video during a press conference yesterday.
“They claimed he was in front of the building […], but they must understand that Sohail Afridi sahib was in Peshawar at the time,” he stated. “They cannot find any evidence [to back up their allegations] so they are resorting to lying.
“May 9 is a trap to pressure the PTI and Imran Khan. They are using it as an excuse against KP CM Sohail Afridi sahib; we condemn this.”
 


Jan also criticised Wali for showing the video during a press conference in Nowshera a day prior. He claimed the video was “edited”.
Fielding questions, Meena Khan said that the video was recorded during the Zaman Park standoff in March 2023, when police attempted to enter the Lahore compound to arrest the PTI founder.
“The video shown is not from May 9,” he emphasised, adding that the video had been edited and distorted. “The video is on Sohail Afridi sahib’s social media pages; anyone can check and see that the video is from two months before May 9. You can see the use of water cannons against our workers.”
Jan said that the PTI would respond to the “lies” spread by Wali, adding that “anyone who uses a false video will be given a befitting response”.</p><small>2025-11-02 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631796-russia-rolls-out-scholarship-programme-for-pakistani-students' target='_blank'><strong>Russia rolls out scholarship programme for Pakistani students</strong></a><br><p>

The statement issued on Sunday said that the president would attend the Second World Summit for Social Development in Qatari capital Doha from November 4–6, being held under the auspices of the United Nations General Assembly.
On the summit’s sidelines, the statement added, the “president will hold important meetings with global and regional leaders, including the leadership of Qatar, as well as heads of major multilateral forums such as the United Nations and other international organisations”.
Meanwhile, the summit “will bring together world leaders and policymakers to discuss ways of advancing social development, promoting decent work and employment opportunities as well as strengthening inclusive safety nets”.
“President Zardari will underscore Pakistan’s commitment to inclusive growth and social protection, with the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) at the centre of efforts to reduce poverty and build resilience among vulnerable groups,” the statement said.
It added that “Pakistan’s readiness to pilot a Doha-aligned Social Protection and Jobs Compact (2026–28) aimed at expanding coverage to informal workers, persons with disabilities, and children, while promoting decent work and green employment, will also be highlighted”.
The initiative aligns national plans with the Doha Political Declaration and global commitments on social protection and financing for development, it further stated.
It said the president would underline Pakistan’s intent to work closely with development partners and multilateral institutions to mobilise financing for social protection and green employment through mechanisms such as the Social Development Goals Stimulus, debt-for-social or climate swaps, and South–South cooperation under China’s Global Development Initiative.
President Zardari would also reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to translating the outcomes of the Doha Summit into concrete actions that strengthen social protection systems and support sustainable, inclusive economic growth, the statement added.</p><small>2025-11-02 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631755-ied-attack-on-hangu-police-convoy-injures-sho-two-other-officers' target='_blank'><strong>IED attack on Hangu police convoy injures SHO, two other officers</strong></a><br><p>
