The PM is visiting Saudi Arabia at the invitation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and will lead a high-level Pakistani delegation during the trip.
The delegation includes Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and PM’s aides Tariq Fatemi and Bilal Bin Saqib, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
The invitation for the conference, signed by the crown prince, was given to PM Shehbaz in August by Ambassador of the King­dom of Saudi Arabia Naw­af bin Said Al-Malky.
The FII9 will convene global leaders, investors, policymakers, and innovators to explore the theme, “The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth”. Thematic discussions will address global challenges and opportunities, focusing on key topics such as innovation, sustainability, economic inclusion, and geopolitical shifts.
The Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement yesterday that during his visit, the PM would engage with the Saudi leadership to explore avenues for enhanced cooperation in the trade, investment, energy, and human resource sectors.
“The discussions will also cover regional and global issues of mutual interest and concern,” it added.
On the sidelines of the summit, the PM will also interact with leaders from other participating countries and heads of international organisations.
The FO said these exchanges would highlight Pakistan’s investment potential and its readiness to pursue collaborations in sustainable development, in line with the “Think, Exchange, and Act” model.</p><small>2025-10-27 12:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/271548481ba4ee1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951570/govt-hails-nepras-move-to-slash-kes-tariff-says-it-will-reduce-additional-burden-on-taxpayers' target='_blank'><strong>Govt hails Nepra’s move to slash KE’s tariff, says it will ‘reduce additional burden on taxpayers’</strong></a><br><p>The government on Monday hailed the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (Nepra) recent decision to slash K-Electric’s multi-year tariff, saying it will reduce the “additional burden on taxpayers” and that the move was not against the interests of Karachi’s power consumers.
Last week, Nepra reduced KE’s multi-year tariff for the fiscal year 2023-24 by Rs7.6 per unit, from Rs39.97 to Rs32.37. KE warned that the move will have “far-reaching consequences for its stakeholders, including consumers”.
Shares of KE, Pakistan’s only privatised and foreign-owned electricity utility,  plunged on the stock exchange following the tariff cut, as investors sold heavily. According to a Dawn report, KE’s foreign owners are threatening to take the government to an international litigation forum. Analysts have warned that the tariff revision and regulatory uncertainty could hurt the company’s finances.
In a subsequent statement today, the Ministry of Energy’s Power Division termed those opinions a “malicious campaign”.
 
 

It said certain elements were unfortunately presenting the Nepra decision in a “distorted and misleading manner, attempting to create the false impression that the decision is against the interests of electricity consumers in Karachi”.
“The reality is exactly the opposite,” the Power Division asserted.
The Power Division spokesperson clarified that Nepra’s review in this matter was primarily related to KE’s administrative and operational affairs.
The statement read: “As a result of Nepra’s decision, the additional burden on taxpayers will be reduced, and K-Electric will be incentivised to cut losses instead of passing them on.
“Previously, due to inefficiencies, K-Electric was effectively compensated with billions of rupees in subsidies, financed through the national budget. This revised determination will help reduce that unnecessary annual fiscal burden.”
 






The Power Division highlighted that the regulator’s review “removes the unfair disparity” that existed between KE and public-sector distribution companies (Discos). “K-Electric must now undertake administrative reforms and demonstrate operational improvement to control its inefficiencies.”
The statement assured citizens: “There is no risk of load-shedding in Karachi arising from the retirement of loss-making or idle generation plants, because cheaper and sufficient electricity is already available in the national grid, and the infrastructure to deliver this power to Karachi consumers is in place.”
In its statement, the Power Division highlighted that before the Nepra review decision, KE had the ability to pass on “non-recovered dues to the public, effectively converting its inefficiencies into an additional burden on taxpayers”.
 
 

“Under the new framework, this will no longer be permissible. Only those receivables which K-Electric can prove — with evidence — to be genuinely unrecoverable despite all reasonable efforts will be considered by Nepra.
“K-Electric will no longer be able to unilaterally include arbitrary amounts in the per-unit cost of electricity for Karachi consumers without proof. Is this not a protective measure in favour of consumers?” the Power Division said.
Today, K-Electric Limited’s share value rose by 3.38 per cent compared to yesterday to stand at Rs5.81, Pakistan Stock Exchange’s data portal showed, marking the first increase since October 16 when it was Rs7.70.
KE consumers will continue to benefit from subsidies
The Power Division spokesperson explained that KE was currently drawing approximately 2,000 megawatts of electricity from the national grid, and “may draw even more in the future”. “This power sourced from the national grid is cheaper than the electricity generated by K-Electric’s own plants.”
The spokesperson noted that KE consumers were already being charged the same per-unit tariff that applies to consumers in other parts of the country. “Now, if K-Electric’s own internal costs are rationalised and reduced, will that become a reason to increase the per-unit tariff for consumers — or will it help maintain uniform national rates for Karachi consumers as well?
“Is that not a positive outcome for the people of Karachi?” the spokesperson rhetorically asked.
According to the Power Division, KE “consumers — like all other electricity consumers in Pakistan — will continue to benefit from subsidies, because uniform national tariffs remain in place”.
 
 

“However, this subsidy will no longer be allowed to turn into profit for K-Electric merely due to inefficiency or failure to reduce its losses. Preventing public-sector subsidy from being converted into private gain is a national responsibility.”
The Power Division noted that KE was a private-sector entity and therefore was expected to “demonstrate performance superior” to that of public-sector Discos.
However, compared to KE, the Discos of Islamabad (Iesco), Faisalabad (Fesco) and Gujranwala (Gepco) were “ahead in critical areas, including recovery of dues, reduction of line losses, and quality of service to consumers”, the statement added.
The multi-year tariff cut
On May 27, Nepra had approved KE’s request to incorporate unrecovered bills into its consumer tariff. It set KE’s base tariff at Rs39.97 per unit for FY2023-24, which was almost 40pc higher than even the national average tariff of about Rs28 per unit in 2025-26 for the 10 public sector Discos in the country.
The next day, the Power Division announced its decision to challenge the Nepra determinations for being against the interests of the government, consumers and taxpayers.
 
 

Last week, on a set of review motions filed by the Ministry of Energy and others concerning KE’s multi-year tariff (MYT) determinations for the control period of FY2024-30, Nepra reduced the utility’s tariff by Rs7.6 per unit, effectively overturning its own May determination made after more than two years of public hearings.
KE criticised the Nepra move, saying it was “not sustainable for the company and will have far-reaching consequences for its stakeholders, including consumers”.
However, the utility clarified that the Nepra announcement by the regulator did not apply to customers and, therefore, there would be no change or reduction in monthly bills for power consumers.

Battlefield is one of those games that, once you play it, it’ll sit in your memory for ages. Few games on the market offer the experience the first-person shooter (FPS) franchise is known for: combined arms warfare — infantry and ground vehicles, naval vessels and aircraft — combined with very destructible in-game environments.
Between 2010 and 2020, Battlefield was the primary competitor to the now wayward juggernaut that is Call of Duty. If you wanted a high-budget military shooter, it was a pick between these two. I remember Battlefield 3 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 well from 2011, and how the former’s multiplayer experience blew the latter’s out of the water.
Sadly, Battlefield lost its way in 2021 when EA released the abysmal Battlefield 2042. I remember playing the open beta shortly before its launch four years ago and I was greeted by more bugs than in a rainforest. Screen flickering, players’ parachutes not closing and thus giving away their position and another bug where bullets would not hit their targets. You read that correctly. Bullets not hitting their targets in a shooting game.
Fortunately, I did not play the full game at launch, but it still left a bad taste in my mouth as a fan of the series. The lack of competition from the Battlefield series rendered Activision, Call of Duty’s publisher, complacent and caused the series to stagnate in quality.
This year, EA and the studios behind Battlefield took these issues seriously and tried to craft an experience akin to the older games, which are beloved to this day. They succeeded.

Battlefield 6 is truly an explosive return to form for the once floundering franchise. The series’ signature environmental destruction, high graphical fidelity and incredible sound design return, along with highly refined gameplay, which I dare say is the best in its class.
Though not perfect, the game ticks the boxes for me and other gamers looking for a new multiplayer military shooter — fast-paced, immersive and intense gameplay where some level of team coordination is possible and memorable moments can be created all the time.
Intel coming in
One thing I must note is that, unlike most other high-budget AAA games, Battlefield (BF) Studios and a coalition of development teams — comprising DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive — were unusually transparent throughout the game’s production.
Their social media feeds were awash with posts containing in-game footage long before release. While it looked promising, gamers were sceptical, as we live in an age where buying a AAA game for $70 (at least Rs20,000 at launch) can mean you receive a product that is riddled with glitches and bugs, which the developers (halfheartedly) promise to fix. Glitches that make gameplay frustrating, or even affect the system you are playing on. We gamers have become very discerning with what we spend our money on.
Players were even incorporated into the development process to test the game through the Battlefield Labs programme. They were given access to various builds of the game during development to test the game and provide feedback.
“It is a space for play and exploration; an environment where we can test concepts and mechanics with our players before we release them publicly. Our community is at the heart of Battlefield; their feedback is crucial in helping us know what to prioritise, what to improve and what feels like an authentic Battlefield experience,” the studio says on their website.
Moreover, players’ complaints about other franchises, particularly Call of Duty’s skill-based matchmaking and ridiculous cosmetic character skins from cartoons like ‘Beavis and Butthead’ and ‘American Dad’, were taken on board.
Skill-based matchmaking is a system where players are put in matches against each other based on performance rather than on their Internet connection. If you play well in a couple of games, you can get matched against players of a far higher skill level and with a worse Internet connection, making the experience feel like a punishment for good players.
The press reported in the months leading up to release that there would be skill-based matchmaking, but the game would offer a server browser for players to get around it. Also, any cosmetic items would be congruent with the more grounded setting of the game.
During the beta in August, complaints were promptly resolved. I remember thinking about reporting the lack of an in-game compass, but the very next day, BF Studios announced that they had added it to the game.

Presentation
In its presentation, Battlefield 6 makes an incredible first impression. The graphics are of an extremely high fidelity, with very detailed environments and objects. Buildings have realistic-looking exteriors and interiors rendered with a great amount of detail. Interiors on some of the maps look like they have been lived in and used, adding realism to the levels.
On the maps set in New York City in particular, I liked how realistic they looked — on Empire State, a cafe looked like what I’d imagine a cafe in Brooklyn would look like: small and cosy and a nice place to sit in if it weren’t in a war zone. Moreover, on the same map, there is a museum exhibit with some nicely detailed sculptures that look like an actual gallery. You rarely feel like you’re fighting in an empty space here, unless you find yourself in a construction site in the game.
The same goes for the weapons and character models — guns bear small details such as serial numbers, markings and signs of wear around the edges and where the player character would grip them. This applies to the grip, the charging handle, the magazine well and any of the controls on the weapons. Weapon attachments are equally detailed.

The same applies to vehicles, which bear a remarkable amount of detail in terms of markings and wear and tear, especially for vehicles belonging to the game’s Nato faction.
Character uniforms have been rendered with magazine pouches, chemlights, ropes and other gear a soldier would typically carry, again in great detail. Faces in the pre-rendered cutscenes look photorealistic.

However, the character models during in-engine cutscenes in campaign mode can look a little off at times. In a cutscene during one of the campaign missions set in Gibraltar, the 3D model for the character Carter looked strange — the textures on his face were flat and there was no visible detail, looking more like a two-dimensional image than a physical 3D model of a human face. It might have been the lighting, but it just being there pulled me out of the immersion somewhat.
Despite that, in terms of graphics and visuals, the game is a match for its contemporaries and right at home in this generation. It’s also quite stable, with few framerate drops, despite multiple explosions and other effects being triggered on screen at once.

In terms of sound design, BF Studios should be given an award for their work. With headphones on, you’ll get the full effect, as not only does a gun sound beefy and powerful when firing, but you will also be able to hear the crack of the bullet breaking the sound barrier and echoing through the environment. Spent cartridge casings will audibly clatter along the ground or whatever surface you are on.
I observed that this detail was present in every weapon in the game, not just rifles, but also with pistols. The muffled din and cracks of distant gunfire add to the atmosphere as the player runs from objective to objective.
Moreover, the sound of cocking a weapon is also well realised. Inserting a magazine and pulling back a weapon’s charging handle sounds like a real gun. This is good for immersion, as the player will feel more like they are using an actual firearm.
Similarly, vehicles sound incredible, particularly the fighter jets. That roar as they fly overhead or only a few metres off the ground is phenomenal, and the cannon sounds powerful, making dogfights all the more spectacular.
When booting up the game and hopping in for the first time, you’ll be met with incredible graphics and well-executed sound design. Sure, this is an expected standard of games released with current-generation hardware; nevertheless, it’s always welcome as it’s your first point of contact with the game.
Multiplayer
After the disastrous 2042, Battlefield fans now have an experience that is tactical, explosive and fast, but more importantly, they have one that is genuinely fun. Battlefield 6, like older titles in the franchise, is just a blast to play.
The gunplay is excellent; shots feel like they are hitting something and the audio cue for getting a headshot makes it feel more impactful. It’s also incredibly satisfying when you and your team rush to a match objective area with the game’s arsenal of weapons and gadgets, clear it out and then repel an assault by the enemy team. When you throw vehicles into the mix, the priority shifts to destroying them, forcing players to think on their feet to resolve this issue.
What I just described was the experience of playing 2013’s Battlefield 4 or 2015’s Battlefield 1 — this is not a criticism. Those games mastered this formula and offered players an experience that, despite being chaotic with destructible environments, forced players to think tactically and capture objectives, working as a team with one goal. Battlefield 6 does all of those things, so it stands out not only as one of the best games in the series but as an extremely solid game in general, like its aforementioned forebears.
The gunplay in Battlefield 6 has been refined from previous entries. Combined with the weapon sound design and the PlayStation 5 controller’s adaptive triggers, there is resistance when pulling them to fire a weapon. Bullets feel like they hit something and it is intensely satisfying landing a headshot on an enemy player; more so when they are 150 metres away or more in the game.
I’m really enjoying my experience so far.
One of the best new mechanics added to the game is being able to drag teammates behind cover and revive them, which can not only get a friendly player back on their feet but it ensures you are less exposed to enemy fire. This is something that needs to be in more games, such as when playing Warzone with friends. If one of them goes down in the open, there is no way to drag them to safety. They can crawl, but its very slow and you’re both exposed to enemy players. The speed you drag downed teammates at is fast, and you need to think about whether or not there is cover nearby to complete the revive.
However, while you can move teammates out of fire, you are stuck in an animation with a timer before your character administers an injection to the downed player. I have not found a way to administer this manually. This would make things far easier, especially if you are not playing the support class, which has a defibrillator as part of its equipment. Despite this oversight, its a great addition and one I reckon will be copied in other games going forward. Starting with Call of Duty in 2026.
If backed against the wall, blow it up
With current generation graphics technology, the game’s signature environmental destruction is better than ever. Facades of buildings will collapse, with the game’s Frostbite engine rendering chunks of concrete, rock and floorboards with surprising detail. Those chunks fall in very smooth animations and all of this happens at a stable framerate. It can create some truly cinematic moments for the player, both here and in single player. You could climb to the top of a building and bring down a helicopter, only for it to fall into a building which collapses in a cascade of concrete and steel. I shot down that helicopter, and it felt like an action movie.
Destroying buildings serves a tactical purpose as well: if an enemy player is holed up in a building, taking potshots at you and your team, rather than storm the building, bring it down on their head.
Granted, it’s a little too easy to make this happen — two shots with a rocket launcher are enough to bring down the facade of a two-storey building in the game. Not only is it immersion-breaking, but it also makes the cover of a building’s interior a risk for the player to use. But it’s a risk worth taking in my opinion, especially for the cinematic appeal of watching the screen shake and the floor crumble as your character plummets to the level below.

Fire when ready
The skill gap is adequate and the game feels grounded in some semblance of realism. While the gunplay is satisfying, as mentioned earlier, it requires skill to master. When engaging a moving target, you need to lead your shots by anticipating where your target is moving and firing just ahead of them. This varies with weaponry, distance and even what you’re firing at.
It’s not a unique mechanic, but it’s present to a greater extent here than in Call of Duty, which is the game’s main competition.
When using a sniper rifle at long distances, you not only need to lead your shots, but also take into account how much your bullets will drop and their travel time. While this may be difficult, the satisfaction of learning this system and mastering it is completely worth it. It’s also a good test of your knowledge of the maps and positioning (the enemy’s and yours).
Vehicles are a good example of this, especially if you’re targeting aircraft with an unguided rocket launcher. Since they move faster, you need to predict where they will move and shoot accordingly, taking the time in which your RPG will launch and travel to its target into account. I’ve done this several times now and audibly yelled out in excitement.
It feels heavy, less so than Call of Duty with the game’s movement mechanics, where players can slide along the ground and jump around like a rocket-propelled kangaroo.
You run like you’re weighed down with equipment, which you are, considering that you can equip a primary weapon like an assault rifle or sniper rifle, a sidearm, two operator gadgets, one grenade and a melee weapon. BF Studios has made running feel heavy; you feel like it is taking time to reach one of the objectives in-game. This is more noticeable on larger maps like Operation Firestorm or New Sobek City, while on smaller maps like Manhattan Bridge, because of the more cramped environment, you can cover distances very quickly.
The lay of the land
Battlefield has historically had larger multiplayer maps (levels) than its contemporaries to accommodate both a large number of players (64 total) and vehicles within the same match. The game does have smaller maps for infantry-focused matches, but these are not simplified maps like in Call of Duty, which are restricted to three lanes for players to move through and a maximum of one storey for vertical combat.
All maps have a variety of angles of engagement, angles of approach and verticality — you can engage people both on the ground and atop buildings at varying heights. There are also more than three defined lanes for players to move through, with main roads, back alleys and connected interiors for them to move through to reach their objective. This makes the environment very engaging to deal with. IT’s confusing at first, but within a few games, you start to learn the maps and where to move. In doing so, you also learn the best ways to move without getting engaged or attacked by the enemy.
With the bigger maps — Operation Firestorm, Mirak Valley and Liberation Peak — there are extremely long sightlines for snipers, as well as smaller areas for players to engage in close-quarters. Coupled with all available vehicles in the game, this offers experiences that are epic in scale, chaotic and good fun, more so if grouped up with friends. Buildings will fall apart, you’ll be dodging sniper and tank fire while trying to run and hold one of the objectives on the map. You might eschew using a loud, heavy vehicle to proceed on foot and minimise your presence to avoid drawing unwanted attention. It’s one of those experiences you have to play once in your life.

Granted, being shot by a sniper you could not see because they either blended into the environment too well or were hundreds of metres away is frustrating, but that prompts you to move through cover, find alternative routes or directly engage them; all of these help you become a better player.
The maps here are gorgeous, with the player fighting with backdrops like the pyramids of Giza, mountains in Tajikistan or the Manhattan Bridge. It feels like you’re engaged in a war happening on multiple continents. There are not that many in the game right now, but with Season One launching on October 28 and more content on the way, I am looking forward to what the studio will come up with next.
A touch of class
BF Studios also brought back the series’ renowned class system, where players will choose a character specialised in performing certain tasks and filling specific roles. The assault class focuses on breaching buildings and heading straight for objectives; engineers (my favourite) focus on destroying enemy vehicles and repairing friendly ones; support players focus on supplying teammates with ammo and reviving downed players; and recon is the default sniper class, who can tag enemies for your team just by aiming at them and can “paint” enemy vehicles with a laser designator for easier targeting by man-portable anti vehicle weapons, tanks or aircraft.
Unlike 2042, Battlefield 6 does not have an operator system, where certain class abilities are tied to specific characters from the game’s lore. Instead, you can customise individual loadouts depending on the role you wish to play. For my engineer class, I have separate loadouts for anti-tank and anti-aircraft gameplay. This offers a lot more freedom to the player and allows them to take a play style they like and hone it, becoming a valuable asset for a team.
Similarly, each class has two training paths, offering the player active and passive bonuses such as a faster reload speed for class-specific weapons, more damage against armoured vehicles than other classes and reducing the noise made by the player’s footsteps. Having these options offers players a more diverse set of equipment to work with, allowing them to perform certain roles within a squad.

Some players will pick classes without considering the needs of the team; however, this is less of a problem with the game and more of an issue with people who play it.
I should note that all of the above is better experienced with a group of friends, as they are more likely to pay attention to playing the game and you can experience some of the “Battlefield moments” together. The other night, a friend and I were roleplaying as a sniper-spotter team: he would take shots at targets while I would use the laser designator (which doubles as a pair of binoculars) to call out targets, locations and distances. It felt like we were playing the opening scene of the 2007 movie Shooter, where one man snipes and the other spots targets.
Alternatively, it could be you and a squad of friends travelling around in a helicopter as gunners, or as a pilot and wingman taking to the skies. My four-man squad at one point began clearing rooms in a fully coordinated manoeuvre, like an actual tactical team. We role-played as soldiers over the voice chat as well, with callsigns and everything. It was genuinely good fun.
Not fast, very furious
Vehicular combat, a critical part of the series, is ever-present here. There’s a small variety of them present: infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), main battle tanks, mobile anti-aircraft tanks, jeeps, attack and transport helicopters and fighter and attack jets. Having a friendly tank move on an objective truly is a force multiplier, as a charge by a vehicle surrounded by infantry will overwhelm an enemy position. IFVs and tanks can also blow apart buildings in spectacular fashion.
Controls for driving ground vehicles are intuitive and simple, except for the jeeps; tanks, IFVs and mobile anti-air guns are driven by pushing the left thumbstick on your controller. The vehicles are mostly responsive to the players’ inputs, but when trying to reverse after crashing into a wall, it’s awkward to control, especially when your vehicle turret is facing in a different direction. Although is also more likely a skill issue than a problem with the game.
Heavier vehicles like tanks can crush map objects like barricades and cars by driving over them, not only making the player feel powerful when driving, but also clearing a path for other players.
However, even though you are certainly more powerful in a vehicle, you’re not invincible. Tanks and IFVs can be destroyed easily by enemy engineers hiding in the environment, landmines, which are VERY easy to miss, and other enemy ground and air vehicles.
Not only is the player challenged by infantry combat, but they are also challenged with handling a vehicle and using it effectively. These vehicles take up to 90 seconds to reappear once destroyed, so you need to make your time in them count. It’s certainly fun to drive a main battle tank around, but more so when you learn how to operate these through practice and can use them to do some serious damage to the enemy team.
Ground vehicles are solid and I enjoy driving the IFV in particular due to his higher speed and capacity for targeting infantry (its literally in its name). When surrounded by friendly Engineers who repair your vehicle, battling other players who are on foot or in ground vehicles is a blast. Much like the tank I blew up the other night.
Highway to the danger zone
While the ground vehicles are powerful and feel good to control, aircraft are equally powerful, but the controls are VERY awkward, especially for helicopters.
Flying the fighter and attack jets is a truly fun experience: you take off from a runway and either dogfight with enemy jets or choppers, or you can strafe enemies along the ground. Shooting down a plane in a dogfight is satisfying and rewarding, given the skill required to chase an enemy aircraft and timing its movement with that of your plane’s nose.
However, by default, jets are controlled using the thumbsticks for throttle, pitch (whether your plane’s nose goes up or down), yaw (lateral movement) and roll (rolling from side to side), which can be somewhat awkward to control if you’re a completely new player to the series and are just jumping in. I had to change my control scheme for jets after watching a YouTube tutorial to find a suitable alternative. This has helped, as I can now stay airborne and shoot down enemies, instead of doing just one of those things.
The helicopters are MUCH, much worse. The default controls are the same: throttle, pitch, yaw and roll are mapped to the thumbsticks, but there is one big difference: helicopters do not fly like aeroplanes.
Increasing the throttle will make a chopper ascend; pitching the nose down while you do this will enable you to move forward. But if you apply too much control in either direction, the vehicle will nosedive or spin out of control. This is far before even engaging enemies; it can happen upon takeoff. There are built-in assists for the helicopters, but in my experience, these make everything worse. Since they are such a pain to control, it’s incredibly off-putting, considering how effective they are for combatting infantry and destroying enemy vehicles.
Should you go and buy it (which you absolutely should), watch a tutorial on how to use the air vehicles and rewind the section on helicopters. TheTacticalBrit made the one I used. Thank me later.
Not a perfect experience
This is a truly incredible experience and very much worth paying the full price of admission, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out a couple of issues.
The biggest complaint I have is the pace of progression in multiplayer: the rate at which you unlock things in the game. It took me a week to reach the in-game level of 22, even when playing at least three hours at a time. I still have yet to unlock a vast majority of equipment and weapon attachments two weeks after release. This is not counting items unlocked through completing challenges or the game’s “assignments” — a series of challenges where you can unlock new equipment for your class and new weapons.
For someone who has the time to sink into the game, like a student or someone who otherwise has the time on their hands, this is not going to be a problem. But for a working professional with barely any time to play, it is going to feel very slow to unlock and use all of the equipment the game has to offer, leaving a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out). They’ll see other players running about with higher-level gear and feel like they’re missing out. How do I know this? Because I am that working professional with very little time to play, who has experienced FOMO by seeing teammates and enemies toting high-level weapons.
BF Studios released a patch to speed up the progression — according to the developers, experience points (XP) gained from match completion and the daily bonus have been increased by 10 per cent and 40pc respectively.
“The XP needed to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks is being reduced, so you’ll start earning useful attachments almost twice as fast,” they added in a post on Reddit.
However, even with these changes, I feel that the progression is still a little bit too slow. However, I also feel that Battlefield 6 will have a longer lifespan than its competition, with years of developer support and content ahead. So the progression does not have to be as fast as Call of Duty, which releases a new game every year.
Connectivity is also an issue. One of my friends was kicked from the server and could not rejoin our game despite multiple attempts to re-invite him. There have also been several instances where players in your in-game party (or group) will not join matches even if you do. This forces the party to back out and start searching for a game all over again; at best, this is a minor inconvenience, at worst, it’s an inconvenience a billion-dollar company should have fixed during development.
One glitch that recurred during the two weeks I spent playing this game was that the scoreboards would either be stuck at zero or 1,000, with absolutely no change throughout the game. This has occurred not just when playing in a group with friends but also with random players online, who, in fact, also commented on this using the in-game chat.
Again, this is an issue that should have been resolved during development. I should not have to ask my friends or type a message into the in-game chat to ask what the score is. Hopefully, this will be resolved by the time Season One swings around later this week.
Additionally, when respawning (restarting after death), for some reason, the cursor on the in-game map will dart off to the side, which can be really frustrating when you want to get back into the match after your character gets killed. I also don’t believe it’s something that difficult to fix.
Despite these problems, the multiplayer experience is absolutely worth full price. It’s a refreshing return to what made the series great in the first place and has embraced its identity proudly. It’s got a wide variety of mechanics and equipment for players to engage with, combined with a grounded setting and a solid mix of infantry and vehicular combat. Put simply, every time I finish a game, I immediately want to play another one. And another and a few more after that. Because it’s genuinely good fun.
Campaign
Battlefield has historically failed to handle single-player campaigns well. Except the Bad Company spin-offs, the stories are dry and uninteresting with bland characters, but punctuated with set pieces and scripted events that look incredible.
Battlefield 6 is no exception. From the streets of Cairo to the Strait of Gibraltar, it’s a truly globetrotting adventure, much like what we used to get in the era of the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. Short, linear and explosive single player modes.
By the standards of that time, this campaign would be considered quite good, but for a $70 game today, it falls quite flat. If you want to have fun, you need to enjoy it in the same way as the Fast and Furious movies: turn your brain off and enjoy the ride, but when you start asking questions, the plot starts to fall apart.
The vibe I got from this campaign was similar to old Call of Duty campaigns from before 2014, when they actually used to be quite grounded and quite realistic. It was a fairly simple experience — go here, blow up this enemy artillery here, the stakes now rise, repeat — yet they would find ways to make it exciting through set pieces like watching the Eiffel Tower get blown up, chasing terrorists through the London Underground or stopping the invasion of the US.
Those games did not have very open levels, and you were more or less directed down a single path. An objective marker would assign you a task, along with voice lines from a supporting character, and you would be on your way. Simple.
Much like those games, Battlefield 6 offers linear levels — though they are slightly more open due to a bigger play area, but you’re still headed down a defined direction — and similar objectives: go from point A to point B and either blow something up, collect something or defend your position. Rinse, shoot, repeat. Once again, dead simple.
Another negative I’ve come across is that this game needs to be always online. And this is a problem because I’d be playing single player and because my Internet connection was lost, it basically stopped the game with an error message saying it is attempting to reconnect. If it doesn’t connect, I guess I can’t play then. This is becoming a very annoying trend in high-budget AAA games where you need an internet connection for any and all modes, even if you’re just playing single player.
For a multiplayer game is this is understandable, but I’m not even playing multiplayer at the moment. I’m just playing the campaign, with nobody else joining me and no need to have a constant Internet connection. At the end of the day, it’s unnecessary.
It gets worse the further you go
I won’t spoil the story here, but what I will say is that it’s pretty generic — a big group of bad guys threatening the West with some sort of superweapon. We’ve seen this done to death now.
The premise sounds interesting, though: in 2028, Nato is on the brink of collapse after the assassination of its Secretary General. The assassination is claimed by a private military company called Pax Armata. I’m fond of these sorts of stories, how a non-state actor is able to take on the power of a nation-state, particularly if it’s a private company. It gets interesting as more and more information is fed to the audience about the bad guys, revealing what they have been truly planning and how it can create high stakes.
However, Pax comes out of nowhere as they’ve never made any appearances in the series previously. They have somehow been able to launch attacks in most of continental Europe without explanation. At the start of the campaign, they just appear out of thin air.
Early on, this raises a lot of questions, such as what even is Pax Armata? Where do these guys get their funding from? Why have they not appeared in any other games in the series?
Some of these questions are answered at the end. Without spoiling it, Pax’s origins lie with one of the friendly characters. But there’s no buildup in how this is explained: no incriminating intel found in the missions, nor any shifty behaviour from the aforementioned character. It’s all revealed in a series of cutscenes right at the end.
A dagger with a blunt edge
In this campaign, you play as a member of Dagger 1-3, a four-member team from the US Marine Raiders unit. The squad is made up of four characters: Staff Sergeant Cliff Lopez and three playable characters: Gunnery Sergeant Dylan Murphy, Master Sergeant Haz Carter and Staff Sergeant Simone “Gecko” Espina. The squad is later joined by the mysterious Lucas Hemlock, who the developers clearly created by drawing inspiration from the character Ghost from Call of Duty’s Modern Warfare series.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The characters serve as your introduction to the multiplayer class system. For example, Murphy is an engineer who can use anti-tank weapons, and Gecko is a sniper, so she’s the recon class. Their roles are expanded through the squad orders the player can issue: recon (Gecko) will tag enemies in the environment with red marks; support (Lopez) will toss a smoke grenade to obscure enemy vision, while the engineer (Murphy) can attack a target with heavy weapons and assault (Carter) can throw a grenade at a designated target
If this was supposed to tutorialise each class’s role, it did not work. You can pick up any weapon and use any gadget or piece of equipment as any character, stripping each class of what makes it unique.
Moreover, the four main characters are just not captivating, except for Lopez, who serves as Dagger 1-3’s comic relief and, for some reason, is not one of the playable characters. The rest are just generic military tough guys. I had to look up their names for this review, that’s how little I remembered them.
There’s also no real villain until the aforementioned last couple of cutscenes. The one the game gives you is a stereotypical madman, right up until the heavy-handed twist at the end.
Standout moments
The first Gibraltar mission is visually spectacular. You begin with a halo jump before transitioning to providing sniper support for a British special forces team. When you’re on the ground, this is something that really reminds me of all Call of Duty campaigns: just spectacle mixed in with hard-hitting gameplay.

There’s another standout mission in the form of a night raid in Cairo. You have to approach a mansion under the cover of darkness without alerting enemy forces or bystanders. The aesthetic, tinted green by night vision goggles, is very cool. The level then transitions to a close-quarters battle in a house where you can find a shotgun with incendiary rounds. As you make your escape, the level ends with your team getting chased by Pax and having to go one-on-one with an attack helicopter. Along with the two Gibraltar missions and the mission ‘No Sleep’, these have to be my favourite moments from the campaign.
Overall, I was not impressed by the single-player mode, but then I was not expecting much. Battlefield has always played second fiddle to Call of Duty when it comes to single-player modes, so this was not a surprise.
Still, I would not pay for this campaign at full price. It’s not only short but leaves you feeling a bit unfulfilled. But then, if you’re buying Battlefield, it’s for the multiplayer and not the campaign. If there’s any reason to play it, it’s to unlock all of the cosmetic items that can be used in multiplayer.
The verdict
7/7 — stop reading this and go buy it
Battlefield 6 is a return to form for a franchise that many had thought had gone the way of the dodo. EA and BF Studios have provided a high-budget and explosive entry to the series, which takes what it’s known for — destructible levels, precise gunplay and memorable moments in multiplayer — and refines and perfects it. Gameplay feels familiar as a fan of the series, with it bringing back memories of Battlefield 4 all the way back in 2013, but the destructible environments and hard-hitting gunplay, coupled with the ability to helm military vehicles, will also appeal to new players. Though it is a bit of a learning curve for them, it’s one worth sticking with.
There are some issues with connection, rejoining games and with the user interface, but once you’re in game, these slowly fade from memory as you chase down an objective surrounded by teammates with tanks rolling alongside and fighter planes roaring overhead. It’s cinematic and epic, more so than its competitors.
The combined arms experience has returned and is well and truly ready to reclaim its crown as the king of military shooters. Go and buy it.

“The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent in its meeting held on October 27, 2025,” the SBP announced in a post on social media platform X.
 






A monetary policy statement, issued shortly after the announcement on X, said the MPC noted during the meeting that headline inflation “rose significantly” to 5.6pc in September, whereas core inflation remained unchanged at 7.3pc.
Regarding the rise in headline inflation, the statement said, “This largely reflected the expected flood-induced increase in food prices; an uptick in energy prices; and sticky core inflation”.
The MPC observed that, unlike previous flood episodes, the recent surge in food prices appeared to be milder than anticipated earlier, the statement said, adding that this was reflected by the “recent slowdown in price increases of major food items in high frequency SPI (sensitive price index) data, such as wheat and allied products, sugar, and perishable items”.
“Nonetheless, the Committee expects inflation to exceed the upper bound of the target range for a few months in H2-FY26, before reverting to the target range in FY27. This outlook is subject to risks from volatile global commodity
prices; magnitude and timing of future energy price adjustments; and uncertainty around prices of wheat and allied products and perishable food items.”
Moreover, “the MPC assessed that the impact of the recent floods on the broader economy appears to be somewhat lower than anticipated at the time of its previous meeting. The crop losses are likely to be contained, whereas supply disruptions turned out to be minimal”, the statement added.
It said that economic activity had gained further momentum, as depicted by “robust growth in high-frequency economic indicators”.
Based on these developments, the overall macroeconomic outlook had improved from the previous assessment, the statement said, adding that at the same time, the MPC noted “uncertainties around this outlook arising from volatile global commodity prices; challenging export prospects amidst the evolving tariff dynamics; and potential domestic food supply frictions”.
“In this backdrop, and given the still-unfolding impact of the earlier reduction in the policy rate, the MPC viewed today’s decision as appropriate to maintain the ongoing price stability.”
Moreover, the MPC noted some “key developments” since its last meeting. Outlining these developments, the statement firstly highlighted that real GDP growth in FY25 had been revised by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics to 3pc from the previous estimate of 2.7pc.
“Second, initial estimates of major kharif crops by the Federal Committee on Agriculture remained close to last year’s production, despite the recent floods.
“Third, despite the repayment of a $500 million Eurobond, SBP’s foreign exchange reserves continued to increase.
“Fourth, Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) on the EFF (Extended Fund Facility) and the RSF (Resilience and  Sustainable Facility) reviews.
“Fifth, inflation expectations of both consumers and businesses eased in the latest SBP-IBA sentiment surveys.
“Lastly, global commodity price movements depicted mixed trends, with oil prices displaying heightened volatility.”
In light of these developments, the MPC viewed the real policy rate to be “adequately positive to stabilise inflation within the target range of 5–7pc” over the medium term, the statement said.
It added that the MPC also reiterated the “important role of the continued build-up in external and fiscal buffers to absorb future shocks and in facilitating the ongoing pickup in economic activity, without adding excessive pressures on inflation and the external account”.
Moreover, the MPC also emphasised the importance of continuing the “coordinated and prudent monetary and fiscal policies”, and undertaking the required structural reforms to ensure ongoing progress towards sustainable economic growth.
The policy rate has remained unchanged at 11 per cent since May, even as trade and industry continue to press for a substantial reduction to support economic activity.
Most analysts and researchers had expected the central bank to keep the policy rate unchanged. Bankers and market experts cited two major reasons for maintaining the status quo — the recent floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab that damaged crops and infrastructure, and rising inflationary pressures.
Fears of higher inflation have discouraged the central bank from considering a rate cut despite weak growth and a wide gap between inflation and the real interest rate.
SBP data shows that private-sector credit demand remains subdued, with businesses largely avoiding new borrowing even after the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Economic growth has remained sluggish over the past three years, deepening social and fiscal challenges. Nearly 97 million people are estimated to be living below the poverty line.
The government continues to struggle to revive growth and attract both domestic and foreign investment, particularly in manufacturing and agriculture. Industry leaders argue that high borrowing costs and an onerous tax regime have hurt competitiveness more than market pressures at home or abroad.

“I’d be allowed to do that,” Trump said, in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One.
But he added: “I wouldn’t do that. I think it’s too cute. Yeah, I would rule that out because it’s too cute. I think the people wouldn’t like that. It’s too cute. It’s not — it wouldn’t be right.”
 


The remarks were Trump’s latest on the subject, which he has teased in public remarks and with “Trump 2028” hats he hands out at the White House.
No one may be elected to the US presidency a third time, according to the 22nd amendment of the US constitution.
Some have suggested that one way around this prohibition would be for Trump to stand as vice president, while another candidate stood for president and resigned, letting Trump again assume the presidency. Opponents have disputed whether this would be legal.
Referring to the possibility of a third term, Trump said: “I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever.”
When pressed by a reporter whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean you’ll have to tell me.”
Referring to Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump also said they are great people who could run for the office.
“I think if they ever formed a group, it’d be unstoppable,” he said. “I really do. I believe that.”</p><small>2025-10-27 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/271640203357cf5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951569/meta-ai-launches-urdu-version-for-users-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Meta AI launches Urdu version for users in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>American multinational technology company Meta has officially launched Meta AI in Urdu for users in Pakistan, intending to accelerate the process of digital transformation in the country, a press release from the company said on Monday.
The announcement was made during an event titled “Future in Focus: AI and Innovation”, held in collaboration with the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication (MoITT), the release said. Meta also announced the start of an experimental programme for AI education and government digital transformation in Pakistan.
“These initiatives aim to accelerate the process of digital transformation in the country,” the release said. “Pakistani users will now be able to interact with Meta AI not only in English but also in Urdu.”
Speaking at the event, Federal Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja said, “Under the Prime Minister’s Digital Nation Vision, Pakistan is moving toward a future where technology empowers every citizen.
“Our partnership with Meta reflects this commitment, promoting AI education, digital transformation, and innovation within government and educational institutions. The inclusion of Urdu in Meta AI marks a milestone that makes technology more inclusive and accessible, ensuring no one is left behind in this digital transformation journey,” she said.
Meta’s Director of Public Policy for South and Central Asia, Sarim Aziz, added:
“We aim to support public sector and educational institutions in driving digital transformation through effective use of AI. We are also delighted that Meta AI is now available in Urdu, giving the local community new opportunities to connect with technology in their own language.”
According to the release, Meta has also introduced a localised edition of the guide “Transforming Public Sector Innovation in Asia Pacific with Llama”, developed in collaboration with Deloitte.
Prepared with the support of the ministry, the guide explains how Meta’s open-source AI model, Llama, can enhance government operations, improve public services, and strengthen data sovereignty. The document highlights best practices and successful examples from various Asia-Pacific countries, including Pakistan.
Similarly, Meta said it has launched the AI Literacy Programme in partnership with the Higher Education Commission (HEC), National Computing Education Accreditation Council (NCEAC), MoITT, and atomcamp.
“Under this programme, 350 non-computer science university teachers across Pakistan will be trained in basic AI skills so they can prepare students to meet the demands of the modern digital era,” the release added.
Meta also announced the Government Digital Transformation Xperience (GDTX) 2025 program, which aims to provide Pakistan’s public institutions with Meta’s technologies, solutions, and best practices. The programme, according to Meta, will bring together experts from the public and private sectors to exchange strategies and experiences for effective digital transformation.</p><small>2025-10-27 11:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/271436496b48eac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951564/us-says-israeli-strike-on-gaza-didnt-violate-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>US says Israeli strike on Gaza didn’t violate ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Monday that Washington does not view yesterday’s strike carried out by Israel in Gaza as a violation of a US-backed ceasefire, terming it an act of “self-defence”.
Israel claimed it struck a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group on Saturday, accusing the individual of planning to attack Israeli troops. However, Islamic Jihad denied it was planning an attack.
Speaking aboard US President Donald Trump’s plane during a trip to Asia, Rubio said: “We don’t view that as a violation of the ceasefire.”
The US top diplomat added that Israel has not surrendered its right to self-defence as part of the agreement brokered by Washington, Egypt and Qatar that saw Hamas release the remaining living hostages held in Gaza this month.
“They have the right if there’s an imminent threat to Israel, and all the mediators agree with that,” Rubio insisted.
 
 

Rubio said the ceasefire in Gaza, which remains in force between Israel and Hamas just over two years since the conflict began, was based on obligations on both sides, reiterating that Hamas needs to speed up the return of the remains of hostages who died in captivity.
Israel’s Saturday strike came shortly after Rubio departed Israel after a visit aimed at shoring up the ceasefire.</p><small>2025-10-27 11:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2715121315eff19.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951563/export-led-growth-necessary-for-economic-stability-state-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Export-led growth necessary for economic stability: state minister</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said on Monday that export-led growth was essential to stabilise the economy, as he presented a screenshot of the country’s improving financial situation achieved through the efforts of the government.
During a media talk in Islamabad, Kayani expounded on the improvement in Pakistan’s economy over the last 1.5 years, highlighting that the target of primary balance had been achieved.
He said the country saw a 26 per cent increase in tax collection during the last fiscal year despite modest gross domestic product (GDP) growth and a low inflation rate.
“We also increased the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR’s) tax-to-GDP ratio and decreased the inflation from 33pc to 4.5pc,” Kayani mentioned. The ratio, he specified, saw a 1.4pc increase, going from 8.8pc to around 10.2 to 10.3pc.
“We posted the first current account surplus in 14 years, which is also the largest current account surplus in 22 years,” he said, adding that foreign exchange reserves were one of the most important parts of the economy.
“When the current account is in surplus, our foreign exchange reserves are stabilised,” Kayani explained, pointing out that the policy rate had been halved, going from 22pc to 11pc, as a result of controlling inflation.
The minister said the target of the primary balance had been achieved despite no mini budget last year.
Acknowledging the privatisation of First Women Bank Ltd (FWBL) earlier this month, Kayani said progress in the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was expected soon.
On October 18, FWBL was acquired by Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Company, which Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed as a milestone in Pakistan-UAE economic ties, saying the deal would pave the way for more joint ventures and partnerships across diverse sectors.
Moreover, the government has also been making efforts to sell the struggling national flag carrier PIA, which has accumulated over $2.5 billion in losses in roughly a decade. In June, it received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm.
State minister Kayani said PM Shehbaz also believed the country needed private sector-led growth, adding that the government had to play its role with respect to policy-making and facilitation.
Pakistan faced a prolonged economic crisis over the last few years, marked by critically low foreign exchange reserves, an acute balance-of-payment crisis, and the looming risk of default in 2023. The crisis was averted after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released a crucial loan tranche, while support from friendly countries, including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, also played a key role.
After averting default, Pakistan undertook tough IMF-prescribed reforms to stabilise its economy and bolster macroeconomic indicators. This year, global credit rating agencies like Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P Global raised Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating.
Last week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said he was hopeful Pakistan could manage to achieve GDP growth of close to 3.5pc during the ongoing fiscal year despite the impact of recent floods.
Aurangzeb also stated that the country’s foreign exchange reserves were presently sufficient to cover approximately two and a half months of imports, with projections indicating this could increase to three months by the close of the current fiscal year.
Earlier this month, Pakistan repaid its $500 million Eurobond on schedule, with the government saying the timely servicing reflects fiscal discipline, stronger reserves, improved ratings, and a more sustainable debt profile.</p><small>2025-10-27 11:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/271143347401427.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951553/7-levies-personnel-among-8-injured-in-blast-targeting-kech-dcs-convoy-in-turbat-police' target='_blank'><strong>7 Levies personnel among 8 injured in blast targeting Kech DC’s convoy in Turbat: police</strong></a><br><p>Eight people, including seven Levies Force personnel, were injured in a bomb blast targeting the convoy of Kech Deputy Commissioner (DC) Major (retd) Bashir Barech in Balochistan’s Turbat on Monday, according to police.
Kech Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Captain (retd) Zohaib Mohsin told Dawn.com that a remote-controlled bomb was used in the attack that took place at Press Club road.
“The bomb, which was planted in a motorcycle, was triggered using a remote control when the DC’s convoy was passing by the area,” he said, adding that five Levies personnel and a passerby were injured in the incident.
He later told Dawn.com that the number of the injured had increased to eight, including seven Levies personnel.
The Kech DC remained safe as he was in a bulletproof vehicle, he added. He was travelling from his home to office and his car was only partially damaged in the incident, the SSP said.
“The blast was so intense that four of the vehicles parked nearby and closely located buildings were also damaged,” SSP Mohsin added.
Police and Frontier Corps personnel had reached the site of the incident and were further investigating the matter, he said.
Pakistan has witnessed an increase in terrorist attacks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The increase followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s move to end a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while addressing the Balochistan Workshop in Islamabad, regretted the resurgence of terrorism in Balochistan and other regions, calling for a serious look at “the reasons that led to the unrest”.
One of the recent incidents of terrorism in the province took place on October 9, when a bomb exploded on a railway track near Dera Murad Jamali. The track connects Balochistan to the rest of the country.
A railway employee was killed in the incident while train services were suspended following the fourth incident of such nature in a month.
This incident followed a blast in the provincial capital of Quetta on September 30. At least 10 people were martyred and 32 injured in the incident when a bomb blast had ripped through a busy street near Quetta’s FC headquarters.
A week prior to that, women and chil­dren were among 12 people injured wh­en the Quetta-bound Jaf­far Express was targeted in a bomb blast in the Spizend area of Balochistan’s Mas­tung district.
In another explosion near a taxi stand in the Pak-Afghan border area of ​​Chaman on September 18, at least five people were killed and one was injured.
Similarly, at least five people were killed and 29 injured in a blast at a rally of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium on September 2.</p><small>2025-10-27 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630737-pakistan-afghanistan-hold-third-round-of-talks-in-istanbul' target='_blank'><strong>At Istanbul talks, Pakistan urges Afghan Taliban to halt backing of terrorists</strong></a><br><p>

The development comes as the Punjab government has faced criticism by the KP and Sindh governments for choking wheat flow to the two provinces. However, a day earlier, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari insisted that there was no ban on the inter-provincial movement of wheat, terming the “ongoing propaganda in this regard baseless and contrary to facts”.
In a post on social media platform X today, the KP governor said he had written to the premier, urging his “immediate intervention to lift the unconstitutional restrictions” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to the province.
“Such limitations not only affect the province’s food security but also go against the spirit of cooperative federalism enshrined in our Constitution,” he said.
He expressed his confidence that the matter would be resolved promptly “under the prime minister’s leadership”.
 






The letter, which Kundi also posted on X, termed the restrictions a “serious concern”, pointing out that KP was a “wheat-deficient province and depends substantially on inter-provincial inflows to meet its essential food requirements”.
It said that the restrictions were against Article 151 of the Constitution, which guaranteed freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse among the provinces.
“Any disruption in supply risks creating artificial shortages, price escalation and public hardship,” he said.
“It has further been observed that these limitations are unintentionally encouraging illegal and informal transportation of wheat through alternate means and routes, which is resulting in uncontrollable supply distortions in the open market. This diversion is causing [a] rapid escalation in wheat and flour prices, directly burdening the general public and potentially triggering unwarranted public resentment,” he said.
Kundi requested PM Shehbaz’s “kind and immediate intervention in this matter and direction to the concerned authorities” to withdraw the restrictions in order to ensure the “uninterrupted and legally protected movement of wheat” into KP.
“I remain confident that, under your leadership, the constitutional rights of the people of KP will be safeguarded effectively and without delay,” he said.
Kundi seeks restoration of daily int’l flights from Peshawar
Separately, the KP governor wrote to Defence Minister Khawaja Asif requesting him to restore daily flights between Peshawar and Karachi, as well as international ones, “particularly to the Gulf and Middle Eastern countries”.
“The suspension of these (international) flights has caused considerable hardship for overseas Pakistanis, entrepreneurs and their families,” Kundi said in a later post on X, noting that a “large expatriate population” from KP was employed in the Middle East.
Kundi further said a “single private airline is operating with absolute monopoly” on the route between Peshawar and Karachi, inconveniencing people and traders due to exorbitant fares and limited seat availability.
The governor requested Asif to issue directions to restore the flight services, adding, “I also earnestly hope and pray that our National Flag Bearer airline will once again ascend to command the skies of the world as it gloriously did during the golden decades of the 1960s and 1970s.”
 






KP’s grievances
In the aftermath of the recent floods, the Punjab government had begun tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by KP amid soaring prices and wheat shortage.
The restrictions have also drawn sharp criticism from flour millers who argue that it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement.
While Punjab officials have de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement.
On Sept 7, Kundi had regretted the reports that Punjab had banned the movement of wheat to other provinces. He had issued another condemnation of the reported ban the very next day in a post on social media platform X.
“The arbitrary ban imposed on August 31, 2025, by the Government of Punjab on the supply of wheat and flour to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a blatant violation of Article 151 of the Constitution and a serious breach of national unity,” Kundi had said on X.
The Constitution’s Article 151 states that “trade, commerce and intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be free”, but empowers the parliament to “impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one province and another or within any part of Pakistan as may be required in the public interest”.
The KP governor had further said: “As a result, the price of a 20kg bag of flour has soared to approximately Rs 1,200 in Punjab and up to Rs 2,800 in KP — an unbearable burden on families already struggling with inflation.
“On behalf of the people of KP, I strongly condemn this discriminatory act and urge Chief Minister Punjab [Maryam Nawaz] to not only condemn but also immediately withdraw this verbal ban.”
Meanwhile, on Sept 7, the KP Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution, denouncing the Punjab government’s “restrictions” on wheat supply amid claims about a 68 per cent hike in flour prices across the province.
Subsequently, the government had approved a national wheat policy earlier this month. According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, stakeholders were told during a briefing about the policy that there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat.
Then, in a letter dated October 23, the KP government had asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs were disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province.
KP’s food secretary, in a letter to his Punjab counterpart, said that lifting the ban was critical to res­t­oring a smooth supply chain, stabilising market prices, and safeguarding his province’s food security.
The letter said KP, a wheat-deficient province, depended on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its requirements — roughly 14,500 tonnes per day.
“The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,” it read.
While KP acknowledged Punjab’s recent permit-based allocation of 2,000 tonnes of flour for transport to KP, it termed the quota “insufficient” relative to actual requirements.
KP lamented that despite repeated communications from its chief secretary, food secretary and director of food to Punjab, the ban continued to remain in force.
“This situation is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 151(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which guarantees freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country,” the letter said.
The letter added that the issue was raised at a high-level meeting, chaired by PM Shehbaz, on October 17 regarding the Interim Wheat Policy 2025.
“The KP Flour Mills Association has repeatedly conveyed grave concerns over the rapidly depleting wheat stocks, cautioning that the non-availability of wheat and flour may arise in the coming days if the restrictions persist,” it said.
Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed.
 
 

Last week, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had again condemned Punjab’s “ban” on wheat and flour transport to the province, calling it a violation of the Constitution and “an attack on the rights” of the people of the province.
Chairing a meeting, he directed the food department’s high-ups to write a letter to the Punjab government demanding immediate removal of all restrictions to ensure free movement of wheat and its flour across the provincial borders, according to a statement from the chief minister’s secretariat. Afridi said that hiding behind political differences to deprive citizens of necessities was unacceptable.
Officials told the meeting that KP consumes about 5.3 million tonnes of wheat and flour annually, of which only 1.5m tonnes are produced locally, while the remainder is sourced from Punjab and other provinces.</p><small>2025-10-27 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630725-pakistan-bangladesh-vow-to-expand-military-to-military-engagements' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Bangladesh vow to expand military-to-military engagements</strong></a><br><p>

The first crash involved an MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter, which “went down in the waters of the South China Sea while conducting routine operations from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz,” according to a statement from the US Navy’s Pacific Fleet.
 






All three crew members aboard the helicopter were recovered by search and rescue teams, the statement said.
A half-hour later, according to the Navy, a Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet crashed into the South China Sea, also “while conducting routine operations” from the USS Nimitz.
 






The Navy’s statement said both crew members aboard ejected themselves from the vessel and were safely recovered.
“All personnel involved are safe and in stable condition,” the US Navy said. “The cause of both incidents is currently under investigation.”
 






The crashes come as US President Donald Trump is in the region, on his first visit to Asia of his second term, and as Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth prepares to also begin a multi-country Asian tour.
Earlier this year, two US warplanes fell off the US Navy’s Harry S Truman aircraft carrier while operating in the Middle East.</p><small>2025-10-27 09:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630729-pakistan-to-close-airspace-for-three-hours-during-next-two-days' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to close airspace for three hours during next two days</strong></a><br><p>

Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh toppled Sheikh Hasina’s government in August last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
According to the press release by the ISPR, during an official visit to Bangladesh, Gen Mirza held separate meetings with Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Mohammad Nazmul Hassan, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan and Principal Staff Officer (PSO) of the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen S.M. Kamrul Hassan.
“Both sides expressed optimism about improving defence and security collaboration and reaffirmed their commitment to expanding military-to-military engagements and related initiatives,” the military’s media wing said.
It added that both sides held detailed discussions on the evolving global and regional environment and security situation and recognised the importance of strengthening bilateral defence and security cooperation.
The statement added that Gen Mirza reaffirmed Pakistan’s appreciation for its “longstanding fraternal ties” with Bangladesh and expressed “resolve to further deepen these relations on the basis of sovereign equality and mutual respect”.
 


The ISPR added that CJCSC has also visited the School of Infantry and Tactics in Sylhet, where he interacted with faculty and students. “The civil-military leadership of Bangladesh appreciated the high professional standards of Pakistan Armed Forces and their achievements and sacrifices in [the] fight against terrorism,” it said.
Upon arrival at Senakunjo, a smartly turned-out military contingent had presented a guard of honour to Gen Mirza, who laid a wreath at Shikha Anirban, the ISPR added.
In January, PSO Lt Gen Hassan had met Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, where the two stressed the need for an “enduring partnership” between their countries to “remain resilient against external influences”.</p><small>2025-10-27 08:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68fe9d6ac37e6.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951470/preparations-underway-to-relocate-rano-to-iwmb-rehab' target='_blank'><strong>Preparations underway to relocate Rano to IWMB rehab</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: In compliance with the recent orders of Sindh High Court (SHC), preparations are underway to relocate female brown bear Rano from Karachi Zoo to a bear rehabilitation centre operating under the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB).
According to sources, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has recently approved Rano’s shifting to the IWMB’s rehab as well as the release of Rs2.5 million funds required for the task, which would be carried out in two stages.
 
 

In the first phase, the female brown bear would be transferred to the rehab and in the second, she would be relocated to her natural range in Gilgit-Baltistan — a key recommendation of the Sindh Wildlife Department (SWD) presented during the case’s second hearing that got the court’s nod.
The sources said the hearings also saw the SWD raising objections to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) suggestion of inviting the international animal welfare organisation Four Paws for Rano’s transfer to Isla­mabad. The court, they said, agreed with the SWD’s proposal to do the job.

CM approves funds to eventually shift female brown bear to her natural habitat in Gilgit-Baltistan region

A recent official letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, states, “Considering that Islamabad doesn’t fall within the natural climatic range of the species, and subject of the consent of the Forest and Wildlife Department, Government of Gilgit-Baltistan, the animal shall be subsequently relocated to its natural range in Gilgit-Baltistan with coordination of Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Gover­nment of Pakistan.”
It further adds: “Since the species has remained in captivity for an extended period, its natural survival instincts have diminished; hence it’s deemed unfit for release into the wild. A properly sized and secured enclosure at a suitable site within the Gilgit-Baltistan region is required.
 
 

“Members of civil society and welfare organisations are encouraged to contribute towards the construction of such an enclosure on land provided by the concerned department. The committee notified shall take steps in this regard in consultation with the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Government of Pakistan,” it says.
The members of the committee notified by the government to facilitate Rano’s relocation include World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan president Nadeem Khalid, Azhar Khan representing the Field Sports and Conservation Society, founder of the Pakistan Animal Welfare Society Mahera Omer, certified wildlife healer Ariana Noor Magsi, journalist Naziha Syed, Deputy Director of Karachi zoo Abida Rias, Karachi zoo vet Dr Amir Ismail Rizvi and Yusra Sami Askari (member of Sindh Council of Conservation of Wildlife).
 
 

“In recent years, the department has successfully transferred over a dozen bears to the sanctuary in Balk­assar (Punjab) after rescuing them from illegal confinement and abuse,” shared Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar, part of the committee and the focal person for coordination in Rano’s relocation.
The department, he emphasised, would take care of all aspects of animal welfare to ensure Rano’s smooth relocation. “We are looking at it as a high-priority task and right now are busy finalising transport arrangements.”
It might be recalled that the SHC has ordered the KMC to relocate brown bear Rano, a critically endangered species in zoo captivity since 2017, to the sanctuary managed by the IWMB within two days.
The SHC also ruled that the transfer of the female Himalayan bear must take place through air cargo under the supervision of a senior official of the wildlife department and directed the KMC to extend cooperation and ensure the shifting.
The orders came on a petition raising concern over Rano’s condition.

On July 31, Faraz, along with PTI’s Omar Ayub and other lawmakers, was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment by a Faisalabad anti-terrorism court for his involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots. Subsequently, he was disqualified as the Senate opposition leader under Article 63(1h) (disqualification from parliament due to conviction) of the Constitution.
After being denied relief by the Peshawar High Court (PHC), Ayub and Faraz approached the SC on October 4 against the former’s order under Article 185(3) of the Constitution (appellate jurisdiction).
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the CB took up four appeals — two each by Ayub and Faraz — for hearing today, according to the cause list. The bench also included Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Shakeel Ahmad.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared as the counsel for Ayub and Faraz. He informed the bench that Ayub wanted to withdraw his appeals as his wife would contest the Haripur (NA-18) by-elections for the seat he vacated.
Gohar further said that Ayub also wanted to withdraw the appeal against his denotification as the NA opposition leader, noting that Mehmood Khan Achakzai had been nominated for the role.
 
 

Meanwhile, Faraz also wanted to withdraw his appeal against the Senate chairman’s notification removing him from the opposition leader role, but wanted to proceed ahead with the plea challenging the ECP’s notification disqualifying him, Gohar told the bench.
The lawyer noted that by-elections on the vacant Senate seats were scheduled for October 30 (Thursday). Five candidates, including two PTI-backed ones, are contesting the by-polls to fill the general seat of the Upper House from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“It is our request that notices be issued on Shibli Faraz’s petition against the election commission’s notification,” Gohar said.
Subsequently, the CB issued a notice to the ECP on Faraz’s appeal and adjourned the hearing till October 29 (Wednesday), a day before the by-polls.
‘Will face our opponents’ in by-elections: Omar Ayub
Polling on the NA-18 seat left vacant due to Ayub’s disqualification will be held on November 23, the ECP has said.
In a post on X today, Ayub said: “We will face our opponents in the NA-18 Haripur By-Election scheduled to be held on 23rd November, 2025. NA-18 Haripur belongs to PM Imran Khan and PTI.”
 






Ayub and Faraz had challenged their disqualifications before the PHC, which initially allowed them interim relief by restraining the ECP from taking any action against the PTI leaders.
However, the PHC earlier this month denied the duo, as well as then-MNA Abdul Latif Chitrali, any relief. It ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court and adjourned the petitions for an indefinite period, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats.
The court recalled multiple stay orders issued earlier, wherein the ECP, the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker were directed not to proceed further on their impugned notifications.</p><small>2025-10-27 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/271213085818550.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951554/indian-minister-says-australian-players-touched-inappropriately-during-wwc-will-learn-lesson-stay-cautious-in-future' target='_blank'><strong>Indian minister says Australian players touched inappropriately during WWC will ‘learn lesson’, stay cautious in future</strong></a><br><p>A senior BJP leader and regional minister has said that two Australian cricketers who were inappropriately touched by a man last week during the Women’s World Cup would “learn a lesson” from the incident and stay cautious in the future, according to Indian media.
The incident in question took place in the central Indian city of Indore on Thursday morning when the two players left their hotel to go to a cafe, a day after Australia’s six-wicket victory over England in the group stage of the World Cup, when they were allegedly approached by a motorcyclist. The two players were not identified by Indian police or Cricket Australia, which confirmed the incident, and one man has been arrested in connection with the case.
NDTV reported on Sunday that senior BJP leader and Madhya Pradesh minister Kailash Vijayvargiya had stated that the incident was “a lesson for everyone.”
“Sometimes, players don’t realise their popularity. Players are very popular, so they should be careful,” Vijayvargiya said. “This incident has happened; it’s a lesson for everyone. It’s a lesson for us and for the players as well.”
“While there was a security lapse, it was also the players’ responsibility to inform local authorities before going out. They didn’t inform anyone, they didn’t tell anyone,” he said in remarks to the Indian publication.
“But they will learn a lesson from this incident and stay cautious in the future.”
The minister further said that “whenever any player goes anywhere, even when we go out, we always inform at least one local person.
“I think this will remind the players that in the future, if we leave our venue, we should inform our security or local administration before leaving, as there is a huge craze for cricket players,” he said.
Earlier, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajesh Dandotiya, told Indian news agency ANI that the security officers of the women’s Australian cricket team had filed a complaint that two members of the team faced inappropriate behaviour.
“A FIR (first information report) was registered, and the accused was identified and arrested following an intensive strategic operation,” Dandotiya said.
He has been charged under sections 74 and 78 of the criminal code that deal with assault or using criminal force against a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty and stalking, respectively. “We are examining if there were any shortfalls in the security protocols,” Dandotiya added.
Violence against women remains a chronic issue in the world’s most populous country, where an average of nearly 90 rapes a day were reported in 2022.
Dandotiya said the 30-year-old man who was arrested has a criminal record.
Meanwhile, Cricket Australia said that the matter was reported by team security to police, who were handling the matter.
Board of Control for Cricket in India Secretary Devajit Saikia said it was a “deeply regrettable and isolated incident.
“We appreciate the swift and effective action taken by the Madhya Pradesh Police in apprehending the accused. The law will take its due course to ensure justice is served,” Saikia said.
“We will also review our existing safety protocols and strengthen them further, if necessary, to ensure such incidents are not repeated.”
The Times of India newspaper also reported earlier that the team’s security manager received a distress message from one of the cricketers that said “… there is a guy following us trying to grab us”.
Team officials were informed and went to their location to assist the players, the paper said. A police patrol then escorted the players safely back to the team’s hotel.</p><small>2025-10-27 08:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630707-lahore-tops-world-pollution-index-again-amid-smog' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore tops world pollution index again amid smog</strong></a><br><p>

Few details were released, but Rubio’s meeting with Jaishankar is the highest-level contact since the US imposed sanctions last week on Russian oil companies, a key source of India’s crude supplies.
Jaishankar posted a photograph on social media showing him smiling and shaking hands with Rubio, saying he “appreciated the discussion on our bilateral ties as well as regional and global issues”.
 






The meeting took place on the sidelines of the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Malaysia, which US President Donald Trump attended in person and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed by video link.
Modi had backtracked from his proposed visit to Kuala Lumpur to attend the Asean summit, with Malaysia’s PM Anwar Ibrahim saying that his Indian counterpart had cited the “ongoing Deepavali celebrations” as the reason for the change in plans.
Relations between Washington and New Delhi plummeted in August after Trump raised tariffs to 50 per cent, with US officials accusing India of fuelling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil.
 


Trump, who spoke to Modi last week by telephone, has claimed that the Indian leader has agreed to cut Russian oil imports — something New Delhi has not commented on.
A White House official said New Delhi had halved its purchases of Russian oil, but Indian sources said no immediate reduction had been seen.
Last month, the US added a “one-time” $100,000 fee to H-1B skilled worker visas, with India accounting for around three-quarters of the annual recipients.
India had said the Trump administration’s move was likely to have humanitarian consequences, warning of potential disruptions for families affected by the policy.
Ties with Pakistan not at expense of friendship with India: Rubio
Yesterday, Rubio said the US sees an opportunity to expand its strategic relationship with Pakistan and that the recent strengthening of ties between the two countries does not come at the expense of Washington’s relationship with New Delhi.
“They really haven’t,“ he said, when asked whether India had raised any concerns about the “stronger relationship” between the US and Pakistan.
“I mean, we know they’re concerned for obvious reasons because of the tensions that have existed between Pakistan and India historically. But, I think they have to understand, we have to have relations with a lot of different countries,” he told a press briefing.
 
 

He continued, “We see an opportunity to expand our strategic relationship with Pakistan, and I think we’ve made — that’s our job, is to try to figure out how many countries we can find how we can work with on things of common interest.
“So, I think the Indians are very mature when it comes to diplomacy and things of that nature. Look, they have some relationships with countries that we don’t have relationships with. So, it’s part of a mature, pragmatic foreign policy. I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India, which is deep, historic, and important.”</p><small>2025-10-27 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/27103137532efcd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951548/argentinas-milei-vows-more-reforms-after-stunning-election-win' target='_blank'><strong>Argentina’s Milei vows more reforms after stunning election win</strong></a><br><p>Argentine President Javier Milei hailed his party’s runaway victory in Sunday’s midterm elections as a “turning point” for the country and vowed to charge ahead with his agenda of shrinking the state and deregulating the economy.
Milei’s small La Libertad Avanza (LLA) party rebounded from a series of setbacks to win 40.84 per cent of the votes cast for members of Congress, far outpacing the opposition in an election closely watched by jittery investors.
“Today we reached a turning point, today begins the construction of a great Argentina,” the 55-year-old president told supporters at a victory party in Buenos Aires.
He promised to continue on the reform path with what he predicted would be “the most reformist Congress in Argentina’s history”.
US President Donald Trump, a close ally, congratulated Milei and said his Argentine counterpart was doing a “wonderful job!”
Half of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies and one-third of the Senate seats were up for grabs on Sunday.
Milei said LLA had more than tripled its seat count, winning 101 seats in the lower house Chamber of Deputies, up from 37, and 20 seats in the Senate, up from six.
Forward, not backwards
The centre-left Peronist movement, in power for much of Argentina’s post-war history, trailed in second place with 31.64pc.
“Far more Argentines want to move forward than go backwards,” Milei said on the demise of the opposition.
The elections were the first national test of Milei’s support since he won office two years ago on a promise to revive the long-ailing Argentine economy through a series of painful reforms.
The run-up to the vote was marked by a run on the national currency, the peso, that forced Milei to seek a bailout from Trump.
Washington promised an unprecedented $40 billion package of aid, but the assistance came with a warning from Trump to Argentines that he would not “be generous” if the election did not go Milei’s way.
 
 

“Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,” the US president said on Monday.
At the LLA election party, hundreds of Milei’s supporters celebrated the results with cheers, hugs, chants and even tears.
“I’m very happy and excited; I didn’t expect such a large number,” Facundo Campos, a 38-year-old marketing consultant, told AFP, comparing the joy to the “last goal of the last World Cup won by Argentina!”
Maria Jesus Galan, a 45-year-old health official, said while there “some room for improvement” in Milei’s government, “it has a great future”.
Turnout at four-decade low
Ahead of the election, several Milei voters had spoken to AFP about their disappointment with his leadership, particularly the corruption scandals involving members of his inner circle.
But they remained viscerally opposed to the Peronist movement, whose figurehead, former president Cristina Kirchner, is under house arrest after being convicted of corruption.
At 67.9pc, turnout was the lowest in a national election in four decades, reflecting disillusionment with the entire political class.
The most surprising results were in Buenos Aires province, a Peronist stronghold, where LLA clawed its way back from a defeat by the Peronists in last month’s local elections to a toss-up.
Adriana Cotoneo, a 69-year-old pensioner voting in Buenos Aires, told AFP she backed Milei’s party “not because I believe it’s the best option, but because I’m clear about who I want to be gone.”
Former TV pundit Milei has cut tens of thousands of public sector jobs, frozen public works, cut spending on health, education and pensions, and led a major deregulation drive since taking office in December 2023.
His reforms were blamed for initially plunging millions of Argentines deeper into poverty. They did, however, slow inflation by two-thirds — to the relief of many —although at the expense of faltering economic growth, consumption and manufacturing.
 
 

Investors began dumping the Argentine peso last month amid concerns over the economy and support for Milei, but Trump stepped in to shore up his closest Latin American ally.
The US Treasury has intervened several times in the market in recent weeks, buying up pesos to help keep it afloat.
Ahead of the election, expectations were high that the government could depreciate or devalue the peso, widely seen as too strong, immediately after the vote.
But questioned about the possibility on Sunday, Economy Minister Luis Caputo replied with an emphatic: “No.”
“Monday is just another day, nothing changes to the economic program or the band system,” he said, referring to the peso-dollar exchange rate band set by the government in April.</p><small>2025-10-27 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2708334066a571d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951497/govt-to-defer-gas-import-plans-as-demand-eases-lng-glut-extends' target='_blank'><strong>Govt to defer gas import plans as demand eases, LNG glut extends</strong></a><br><p>• UK-based firm projects 3pc fall in national gas demand during 2025-40
• Urges reforms as circular debt rises due to price distortions, market imbalances
ISLAMABAD: Despite population projections of 325 million over the next 15 years and rising overall energy needs, Pakistan may have to put off gas import options owing to declining demand until 2040 and the surplus of liquefied natural gas (LNG) going beyond 2031.
Sources told Dawn that an “all-of-government” approach is under consideration to slow-pedal both pipeline imports — from Turkmenistan and Iran — and readjust LNG supply schedules, while pushing through structural reforms to underpin sustainable growth.
The rethink follows a study by UK-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which projects a three per cent decline in national gas demand during 2025-40 under a business-as-usual scenario, even as total gas availability — including take-or-pay LNG — rises into the early 2030s.
The total gas supply, including that of LNG contracts, has been estimated to peak at five billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) by 2031 from around 3.8bcfd today, up 31pc.
Demand, on the other hand, is projected to decline by 3.8pc by 2031 and 2.5pc in the subsequent nine years, with a cumulative average of 3pc between now and 2040. This takes into account more than a 12pc fall in the power sector’s gas needs and 2.8pc and 4pc growth in industrial and domestic needs, according to the study reviewed by Dawn.
“A clear pathway to address the structural market issues and towards greater market liberalisation is required as circular debt continues to escalate due to price distortions, inefficient resource allocation and market imbalances,” suggested the consulting firm, pointing out that addressing the root cause of the problem was to fix structural issues that have contributed to the issue of circular debt and to evolve the sector to Pakistan’s needs.
 
 

The reform areas would include constraints to investments for fresh exploration and production, weighted average costing of all gas sources, power sector gas offtake issues, forced curtailment of domestic fields, runaway gas losses, limited gas storage and increasing solarisation.
One of the key takeaways from the study is that Pakistan will not require as much LNG as originally anticipated, even in the near to mid-term, hence the need to develop an LNG import strategy to determine measures to deal with existing contractual arrangements, “assessing all options on the table”.
The low demand and higher import contracts are already taking a heavy toll on exploration and development activities in the country, with long-term adverse consequences — gas import costs in any shape are more than double the local production.
On the other hand, the report anticipated a new wave of LNG supply, indicating pricing cuts as the US and Qatar account for more than half of global LNG supply over the next decade, but Pakistan hardly benefits.
“The new wave of LNG supply will start putting pressure on prices from 2026, with the expectation of long-term prices being set by marginal US LNG cargoes,” it said. Simultaneously, LNG demand will be rising by 3pc over the 2025-40 period from over 400 million tonnes per annum to 675 mpta, mainly due to LNG demand growth in the Asia Pacific.
At present, fossil fuels account for about 88pc of total end-use consumption in Pakistan, of which gas and oil account for around 42pc and 29pc, respectively.
By 2040, while still dominant, consumption of fossil fuels is estimated to decline to about 84pc, with gas share coming down to 30pc and share of oil going up to 34pc, mainly owing to growing demand in the transportation sector.
Primary energy demand is expected to grow from about 88 million tonnes of oil equivalent now to over 99 million tonnes by 2030.
The power sector remains the key problem. Pakistan is going through a paradigm shift, both in terms of a reduction in demand (especially power and captive power plants) and the premise of greater availability of domestic supply.
“Full alignment and commitment of the plan for gas offtake from the power sector is crucial as it will shape how Pakistan’s overall gas demand will evolve,” the report said, but warned that challenges of the exploration and production sector will need to be addressed to realise forecasted supplies, as the LNG glut has forced closure of local gas fields.
It noted that while the country had made progress towards macroeconomic stabilisation, further reforms were required to sustain economic growth as the population was expected to reach 325 million by 2040, at a steady growth of 2pc and a young demographic, maintaining its position among the top five most populous countries.
Between 2025-40, economic activity is expected to grow with a long-term GDP compound annual growth rate of 3.7pc. Economic activity is expected to continue recovering, as the economy benefits from the availability of imported inputs, easing domestic supply chain disruptions and lower inflation,” it said.
The study forecast the industrial production achieving an annual growth rate of 4pc over the next 15 years. It also noted that while Pakistan’s growing population offered potential demographic dividend, the country faced significant challenges in harnessing this potential due to existing resource constraints, infrastructure deficits and employment issues. The population growth will nevertheless increase energy demand in residential sectors for heating and cooking and power generation to meet rising electricity needs and transportation.

According to official sources, the abducted officials, both from Punjab, were working on the Diamer-Bhasha Dam project.
Police said that on Saturday, their off-day, the officials went to the Gabar area of Thore to buy walnuts, accompanied by six local colleagues. Upon reaching the area, they were intercepted and abducted by militants, who took them into the nearby mountainous region.
An official, requesting anonymity, told Dawn that the area was a known haven for militants.
In August, two Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts personnel were  martyred and another injured when terrorists opened fire on a checkpoint  along the Karakoram Highway (KKH) near Thore.
The official said that local religious leaders had been engaged to negotiate with the abductors for the safe release of the officials.
So far, three rounds of talks have been held, though the militants have made certain demands, which the source declined to disclose.
Jirga held
Meanwhile, local residents of the Thore valley, where the two men resided, held a jirga on Sunday to condemn the abduction and demand strong action against the militants. A large number of people participated in the gathering, which unanimously passed a resolution declaring that the abduction had nothing to do with the people of Thore.
The resolution stated that the incident was an individual act, strongly condemned by the local community. It urged the government and administration not to harass innocent residents, but to arrest those involved and punish them according to the law.
“The government should take strict action against these terrorists so that no one dares to commit such an act in the future,” the resolution said.
It further clarified that the terrorists involved in the abduction have no connection with the people of Thore.

Newsom has made some moves this year to test the waters for a potential presidential run and has gained prominence within his party in confronting Republican President Donald Trump on a range of issues.
“I’m looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment,” Newsom said on the CBS News programme Sunday Morning.
Asked if he was considering a run, Newsom said,  “Yeah, I’d be lying (if I said) otherwise.” Under the US Constitution, Trump is prohibited from running for a third term but has floated the idea regardless, saying earlier this year, “there are methods which you could do it.”
Newsom has pushed California to the forefront of Democratic efforts to redraw congressional maps to counterbalance similar efforts by Republican-led states as the two parties fight for control of the US House of Representatives, a chamber where Republicans now hold a narrow majority, in the 2026 elections.

A swarm of investigators had been mobilised to track down the thieves who robbed the world-renowned museum in broad daylight on Oct 19, making off with jewellery worth an estimated $102 million in just a few minutes.
Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said they had “carried out arrests on Saturday evening”.
“One of the men arrested was about to leave the country” from Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport, Beccuau said.
A source close to the case told AFP the man was about to board a plane for Algeria.
The second man had been detained not long afterward in the Paris region, media reports said.
The two men were taken into police custody on suspicion of organised theft and criminal conspiracy. They could be held up to 96 hours.
Beccuau deplored the public revelation of the arrests, first revealed in media reports, warning they “can only hinder the efforts of the 100 investigators mobilised” in the hunt for the jewels and the perpetrators.
Interior Minister Laurent Nunez also called for confidentiality while congratulating the investigators “who have worked tirelessly”, in a post on X (formerly Twitter).
 






In the heist last Sunday, the robbers clambered up the extendable ladder of a stolen movers’ truck and, using cutting equipment, broke into a first-floor gallery that houses royal gems. They dropped a diamond- and emerald-studded crown as they fled down the ladder and onto scooters, but managed to steal eight other pieces, include an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon Bonaparte gave his wife.

• Official figure shows 1,083 dengue cases across the province in 2025
KARACHI: Keeping in view a big difference between the number of dengue cases reported by the provincial government and the situation on the ground, the Sindh health minister has clarified that official data includes only cases reported from government hospitals.
While the number of cases in Karachi and Hyderabad has increased alarmingly over the past few weeks, the Sindh health department stated in its latest report on Sunday that the total number of confirmed cases has reached 1,083 in 2025.
 
 

However, figures collected recently from the Indus Hospital, Liaquat National Hospital, the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital and Research Centre and the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre showed over 4,000 confirmed cases only in Karachi alone. Hyderabad is also facing an alarming situation, where many deaths had been reported. However, the health department has confirmed only two deaths — one in Karachi and another in Hyderabad.
The government has been facing strong criticism over this disparity, with a senior Pakistan Medical Association office-bearer had said that official figures did not represent the ground reality.
Against this backdrop, Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho said in a statement that “if a patient undergoes testing at a private laboratory, that report is not included in our official data”.
She said that the health department maintained “complete records of all confirmed dengue cases received from government hospitals”.
The minister emphasised that the figures released by the health department are verified and authentic.
She urged the public not to believe unverified information or rumours circulating on social media, adding that “data of all patients admitted to hospitals or treated in outpatient departments (OPDs) is properly maintained by the department”.
Govt confirms 439 cases in October
In the report, the health department said that 439 new cases have been reported so far in October, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in 2025 to 1,083.
Karachi Division remains the most affected, with 188 cases reported this month, followed by Hyderabad Division with 154 cases, Mirpu­rkhas 83, Sukkur 10, Shaheed Benazirabad 3, and Larkana Division with one case.
The health minister stated that the Sindh government was working seriously to curb dengue across the province. “Anti-dengue measures, including fumigation, spraying and drainage improvement, have been intensified in all districts.”
 
 

She said deputy commissioners and district health officers had been instructed to ensure that no stagnant water remains, as it serves as a breeding ground for mosquitoes.
She added that equal attention was being given to both urban and rural areas, and separate dengue units have been established in all government hospitals where free treatment and testing facilities are being provided.

• PM Shehbaz forms panel for talks with PPP; PML-N regional president rules out plan to join AJK set-up
ISLAMABAD: The PPP see­med to be in a comfortable position to take the helm in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) after as many as 10 lawmakers from the AJK Legislative Assembly joined the party.
The PPP now appears to be ready to install its own man to lead the regional government in light of the imminent exit of the incumbent prime minister, Anwarul Haq, through a no-confidence motion or resignation.
The plan to form the regional government was approved by President Asif Ali Zardari, who met the AJK lawmakers on Saturday, and the decision seemingly led to lawmakers from the ‘forward bloc’ joining the PPP, a coalition partner of the PML-N in the Centre.
If things go according to the PPP’s plan, AJK will have its fourth premier in the four-and-a-half years of the assembly.
After his meeting with the AJK lawmakers, President Zardari also spoke with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to take him into confidence over his party’s decision and strategy to form a government in Azad Kashmir.
The premier subsequently formed a three-member committee, comprising Ahsan Iqbal, Rana Sanaullah, and Amir Muqam, to discuss matters regarding the change of government in Kashmir. The PML-N team in talks with the PPP is expected to seek a say in administrative and financial matters in Azad Kashmir.
On the other hand, the regional leadership of the PML-N said it would not become part of the upcoming government, citing previous failed experiments of the coalition government. AJK PML-N President Shah Ghulam Qadir told Dawn that they would sit on the opposition benches.
 
 

In light of a possible vote against the AJK PM, he said the PML-N had not even promised to vote against Mr Haq if a no-confidence motion against him was tabled in the house. “The experiment of the coalition government has failed and we have decided to sit on opposition benches,” he remarked.
A PPP insider, however, said the party could send the AJK premier packing even without the support of the PML-N, which has nine members in the house. He said the party had the support of at least 30 members in the house — more than the required 27 to oust the AJK PM. He said Sardar Atiq of the Muslim Conference and Hasan Ibrahim of the Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party will also support the no-trust motion against PM Haq.
Lawmakers join PPP
In their separate meetings with Faryal Talpur, who heads the PPP’s women wing and the AJK political affairs wing, at Zardari House in Islamabad, Ch Yasir Sultan, (minister) Sardar Muhammad Hussain, (minister) Ch Muhammad Ikhlaq, (minister) Ch Arshad Hussain, (minister), and Ch Muhammad Rasheed (minister) announced their decision to join the PPP.
Similarly, AJK Minister for Higher Education Zafar Iqbal Malik also met Ms Talpur and formally announced his decision to join the PPP.
Another group of ministers from AJK, including Faheem Akhtar Rabbani, Muhammad Asim Sharif, Ch Muhammad Akbar, and Abdul Majid Khan, met Faryal Talpur to announce their decision to join the PPP. Senior PPP leader Ch. Muhammad Riaz was present at all these meetings.
Numbers game
The AJK Legislative Assembly has 52 members and to achieve a simple majority, a party requires the support of 27 members. Presently, the PPP has 17 seats, the PML-N nine, the PTI four, and the Muslim Conference and Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party each have one member. The PPP’s ranks swelled to 27 after ten more lawmakers from the forward bloc joined it on Sunday. The new entrants announced their decision a day after Mr Zardari met his party lawmakers from AJK and reaffirmed his commitment to the politics of reconciliation and tolerance. The Saturday meeting had reviewed governance challenges in AJK, the evolving political landscape, and the party’s strategy for forming a new government in the region.
Sources said President Zardari briefed the AJK parliamentary party on the decision to take charge of the AJK government, calling it an “extraordinary and challenging step” for the PPP. “The PPP is assuming responsibility in difficult circumstances, but I am confident the party will deliver in AJK just as it has in the past,” Mr Zardari was quoted as saying.
Sources said Ch Yaseen is likely to be nominated for the coveted slot. However, President Asif Zardari is expected to finalise the party’s nominee for the AJK premiership after further consultations.
With almost six months remaining in the assembly’s term, this will be the fourth prime minister in AJK in as many years. In August 2021, the PTI picked Abdul Qayyum Niazi as the premier after he was named for the slot by then-PM Imran Khan.
Mr Niazi secured 35 votes against the joint opposition candidate Latif Akbar, who bagged only 15 votes, in the 53-seat house. After nine months, Mr Niazi resigned from the position and was replaced by PTI regional president Sardar Tanveer Ilyas.
In April 2023, Mr Ilyas was disqualified by the full court bench of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) High Court from being a member of the legislative assembly for contempt. He was then replaced by Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, who is likely to be replaced by a PPP candidate after spending over two years in power.

• Supply may dip next year as flood impacts on Punjab’s cultivation manifest
KARACHI: After a sharp rise in tomato prices, reaching Rs600–700 per kilogramme, rates are now declining due to steady imports from Iran — further influenced by limited local supplies from Swat and Sindh.
But if things remain the same, the country is likely to face a shortage of tomatoes in the spring season next year, potentially triggering another cycle of price hikes.
According to traders, floods and heavy rains in Punjab have reportedly washed away the tomato crop. However, they ruled out any serious impact on the Sindh crop, as markets in Karachi have begun seeing arrivals of the new crop from the province, although the majority consists of unripe tomatoes.
Traders are seen offering Iranian tomatoes at Rs200 per kg in Karachi, providing some breathing space to the consumers, who paid up to Rs560 per kg last week in the city.
Local tomato crops in all provinces are produced throughout the year. However, there are often instances of supply imbalances in certain provinces when a crop season ends. At times, only one province produces enough tomatoes to supply the other three. In such cases, the only option to bridge the demand-supply gap is to import tomatoes from Iran and Afghanistan.
The closure of the Pak-Afghan border for over two weeks, combined with years-long suspension of trade with India, has left Iran as the only viable option to meet domestic demand.
However, he added that the supply of tomatoes will decline from March to April next year.
‘Supply to dip’
Syed Khaliq Shah of the Ravi Sabzi Mandi Lahore said the supply of new tomatoes from some areas of Sindh was under way in the last few days, but consumers will see improved supplies during November to February.
He explained that crops in Punjab usually find their way to the market in the middle of the year but the recent rains and floods have destroyed tomatoes.
“The supply of new crops from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will get start from May to August followed by new crops from Balochistan after March. However, negligible arrivals have started from some areas of Balochistan like Quetta.”
Mr Shah said rains had damaged the crop in Swat, causing a drop in the arrival of trucks to 20-30 daily in Punjab instead of 150-200 vehicles on normal days.
He added that Iran’s tomatoes (a pack of 8-9kgs) is available at Rs1,000-1,500 in Lahore against Rs2,500-4,000 a few days ago. While Swat’s tomatoes in a 15-16kg pack are priced at Rs2,500-4,000 compared to Rs 4,500-6,000.
Punjab is currently dependent on tomato shipments from Swat and Iran, with around 70–90 trucks from Iran arriving in the province daily. The journey from Iran takes five to six days, whereas tomatoes from Afghanistan arrive in just two days.
Waheed Ahmed, patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Fruits and Vegetables Dealers, Merchants, Exporters, and Importers Association, said the rains and floods have severely damaged the tomato crop in Punjab, as well as in parts of Balochistan and Sindh. Additionally, supplies from Afghanistan have been suspended due to the tense border situation between the two neighbouring countries.
In a crisis situation, he recalled that a significant quantity of tomatoes used to be imported from India, but these imports were discontinued after a disease emerged in 2016–2017. At the same time, excessive imports from neighbouring countries discouraged local farmers from cultivating more tomatoes.
Given the dollar shortage and low transportation costs, importing tomatoes from neighbouring countries such as India, Iran, and Afghanistan could help stabilise prices, rather than letting local rates collapse. There is also potential to source tomatoes from Commonwealth countries, depending on the border situation and the availability of a smooth supply chain, he added.
“The government can reduce or eliminate duties and taxes on tomato imports to prevent further crises,” he suggested, recalling that Pakistan had previously imported onions from its neighbours to bridge supply gaps caused by limited local production.
Mohammad Rafiq Gujjar, chairman of the Masha Khor Welfare Association at Karachi’s Sabzi Mandi, said that September and October are always crucial months, as the local tomato crop is not yet ready and demand is met through imports. “Unfortunately, floods have caused significant damage in Punjab, while the Sindh crop appears relatively safe due to the low intensity of floodwaters reaching the region from Punjab,” he added.

• Pakistani officials share photo, documentary evidence of terror groups operating from Afghan territory
• Amid mixed signals from Taliban power centres in Kabul & Kandahar, Islamabad refuses suggestion to directly negotiate with TTP
ISLAMABAD: Stalemate persisted on Sunday at the Pakistan-Afghanistan talks in Istanbul, with the Afghan Taliban delegation appearing reluctant to take verifiable action against sanctuaries of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and other militant groups operating from Afghan soil.
This was the second day of the dialogue, which stretched into Sunday after both sides failed to find common ground on the issue of ending terrorist safe havens in Afghanistan.
After nearly nine hours of intense discussions late into the night, Pakistani security officials said their delegation had presented its “final position” to the Afghan side, insisting that the Taliban regime must take “concrete and verifiable steps to eliminate cross-border terrorism from and inside Afghanistan”.
“Pakistan has made it clear that the ongoing patronage of terrorists by the Afghan Taliban is unacceptable,” the senior security official said.
Taliban responses to Pakistani assertions about terrorism emanating from Afghan soil were rejected as “illogical and opposite to ground realities”.
In a thinly veiled reference to India, which has recently deepened ties with Kabul, the security official said the Taliban delegation “appeared to be following someone else’s agenda”.
This stance seemed to be vindicated when, in the midst of the Istanbul process, Indian forces apparently violated the cea­sefire in the Leepa Sector of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. While there was no official word on losses, locals reported an intense exchange of fire on Sunday evening.
The official cautioned that this position of the Taliban “was not in the interest of Afghanistan, Pakistan, or the region”.
The source added that any further progress in the talks would depend on the “positive attitude of the Afghan Taliban”.
Earlier in the day, the Afghan delegation presented a written response to Pakistan’s demands submitted the previous day, after which Pakistan shared its counter-response.
A second session subsequently began after midday, in the presence of senior Turkish and Qatari mediators.
There was initial optimism following the exchange of documents and the start of a second session that had not been planned earlier. However, after protracted negotiations, the optimism faded as the Taliban delegation refused to provide any written assurances.
The Afghan representatives, who were receiving directions from Kabul and Kandahar, appeared to lack the mandate to make decisions, officials said. Their reluctance to provide written commitments was interpreted by the Pakistani side as a sign of unwillingness to act against the TTP and other militant groups with hideouts in Afghanistan.
During the two days of talks, Pakistan presented photographic and documentary evidence of TTP, BLA, and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory, including details of their leadership and movements. The Pakistani delegation also shared photographs and Afghan identity documents of infiltrators captured during recent border incidents, insiders said.
At one stage, the Afghan Taliban offered to bring the TTP to the table for direct talks with Pakistani authorities. Islamabad, however, categorically refused, reiterating that it would not negotiate with a terrorist group and that it was the Taliban’s responsibility to end their patronage of the TTP.
Echoing Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s earlier remarks, Pakistani negotiators told the Afghan side that Islamabad was ready to pay any price to neutralise the threat emanating from Afghan soil for the safety of its people. They cautioned that the Afghan population would suffer because of the Taliban regime’s continued intransigence.
 
 

Pakistan’s core demand throughout the talks remained decisive action against terrorist proxies operating from Afghanistan.
While the dialogue continued in Istanbul, Pakistan’s military reported major infiltration attempts across the Pak-Afghan border, further casting doubt on the Taliban’s intentions.
The two attempts, occurring in Kurram and North Waziristan, were framed by ISPR as occurring “while delegations of Pakistan and Afghanistan are engaged in talks in Türkiye”.
“This casts doubts on the intentions of the Interim Afghan government regarding its commitment to addressing terrorism emanating from its soil,” the military noted.
The two-day talks followed the Oct 19 Doha ceasefire, mediated by Qatar, which ended a week of deadly border clashes. Türkiye hosted the current round as part of its expanded mediation role, while Qatar acted as guarantor of the truce and facilitator of dialogue.
The Pakistani delegation comprised senior security and intelligence officials, including representatives from the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the Directorate of Military Operations, and the Foreign Office.
The Afghan side was led by Deputy Interior Minister Mawlawi Rahmatullah Najeeb and included senior Taliban figures such as Anas Haqqani, Suhail Shaheen, Noorur Rahman Nusrat, and Abdul Qahar Balkhi.
Diplomatic sources said mediators were attempting to keep both sides engaged to prevent a complete breakdown in communication.

Both leaders issued separate messages on the occasion of Kashmir Black Day, which is being observed today (Monday) to mark the day Indian forces entered Srinagar in 1947.
President Zardari urged the United Nations, global human rights organisations, and the international community to hold India accountable for its grave and systematic human rights violations in Indian-held Kashmir.
The president said that lasting peace and stability in South Asia are contingent upon a just and durable resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
On its part, Pakistan will continue its unwavering moral, diplomatic, and political support to the people of Indian-held Kashmir, who continue to endure oppression on a daily basis. We stand united with our Kashmiri brethren in their struggle for justice, peace, and self-determination, the president said in his message.
Echoing similar views, PM Shehbaz emphasised that lasting peace and stability in South Asia would remain elusive without a just and peaceful settlement of the Kashmir issue.
“Every year, Oct 27 marks the darkest day in the history of Kashmir... Ever since that fateful day, India has continued to deny the Kashmiri people their inalienable right to self-determination, as enshrined in numerous resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.”
For nearly eight decades, the people of Indian-held Jammu and Kashmir have endured enormous hardship and oppression. We salute their indomitable spirit, courage, and resilience in the face of fear and persecution, he added.
Since August 5, 2019, India has further intensified its illegal and unilateral actions aimed at altering the demography and political status of held-Kashmir, the PM said.
‘Dark chapter in history’
Meanwhile, Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani said that Oct 27 marked a dark chapter in history when India forcibly occupied Jammu and Kashmir, violating international law and human rights. 
In his message on Kashmir Black Day, he said the 1947 landing of Indian forces in Srinagar defied the will of the Kashmiri people and began a long era of oppression. 
Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs Amir Muqam condemned Indian atrocities in held Kashmir and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for Kashmiris’ right to self-determination. 
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman also said that October 27, 1947, remains one of the darkest chapters in the history of South Asia.

LAHORE: The government has decided to revive the Islamabad–Tehran–Istanbul (ITI) freight train from Dec­e­mber 31, subject to the finalis­a­tion of ongoing discussions reg­a­rding tradable goods and the resolution of administrative, log­istical, and operational issues.
The government is also set to sign an agreement soon to connect Pakistan with Kazakhstan through a rail network via Chaman, according to Federal Minister for Railways Muh­a­mmad Hanif Abbasi.
“We wanted to revive the ITI train earlier, but it was delayed because of the war in the region involving Israel. Now, we plan to resume ITI train operations from December, depending on the finalisation of trade arrangements — what will be exported and imported between Turkiye and Pakistan. The trade ministers are working on it,” Mr Abb­asi told journalists at a press conference at the Pakistan Railways (PR) Headquarters on Sunday.
“There are some other issues as well, which will also be add­ressed. However, our main focus is to resume the ITI train service from December 31,” he added.
The ITI train service was revived on December 21, 2021, after nearly a decade, with trains reaching Turkiye in Jan­u­ary 2022. It operated until Aug­ust that year, with goods transfe­rred to wagons compatible with Iranian and Turkish rail gauges.
The ITI operation was suspended again due to various administrative and operational issues. Although the government planned to revive it in 2023, the effort was hindered by the devastating floods that year, despite the restoration of the rail link between Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan in April 2023.
Additionally, the main Turkish freight forwarder associated with the ITI operations refused to work with Pakistani freight companies due to delayed payments, but later agreed to resume operations directly with Pakistan Railways, the concerned PR officials showed little interest in resolving key issues. This delay hampered efforts to strengthen bilateral trade with Turkiye.
Major issues included a lack of service quality — such as delays in departures and arrivals, inefficient loading and unloading, slow customs clearance, and weak security measures. The high tariff and freight charges were also considered unaffordable for the business community. Consequently, operations slowed significantly in July 2022 and came to a complete halt in August after floods in Balochistan and Sindh submerged railway tracks and caused the collapse of the 140-year-old Hirok Bridge, the only link connecting Quetta with Dozan and beyond.
Speaking about regional connectivity, the minister said that an agreement with Uzbekistan had already been signed, while another with Kazakhstan would soon follow. “We have a rail track up to Chaman, from where we can access Kazakhstan, other Central Asian states, Russia, and eventually Europe,” he said.
Mr Abbasi revealed that the rehabilitation of the 500-kilometre Rohri–Karachi track is being planned with Asian Deve­l­o­pment Bank funding. Inve­stments are also being arranged for the Rohri–Peshawar section. “The groundbreaking for the Rohri–Karachi track rehabilitation is expected to take place in July next year,” he added.
He said the Karachi Railway Station had been modernised and expanded to double the size of the Lahore Station. The upgraded Shalimar Express is expected to be launched on November 7, followed by the Awam, Allama Iqbal, and Rehman Baba Express trains in the coming months.
Mr Abbasi said PR had earned an additional Rs4.5bn through the outsourcing of lugg­age vans and express cargo trains.
