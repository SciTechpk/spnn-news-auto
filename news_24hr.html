The Trump administration said late last month that it would abolish a tax exemption on small packages entering the US from August 29.
The move has sparked a flurry of announcements from postal services, including in France, Britain, Germany, Italy, India, Australia and Japan, that most US-bound packages would no longer be accepted.
The United Nations’ Universal Postal Union (UPU) said it had already been advised by 25 member countries that their postal operators “have suspended their outbound postal services to the US, citing uncertainties specifically related to transit services”.
It said the suspensions would remain in place until there was more clarity on how US authorities planned to implement the announced measures.
The UPU did not provide a list of postal services it had heard from.
‘Considerable operational changes’
The organisation, which was established in 1874 and counts 192 member states, warned that the new US measures would “entail considerable operational changes for postal operators around the world”.
From Friday, the UPU said the measures would require postal carriers delivering packages to the US “to collect customs duties from senders in advance”, on behalf of the US Customs and Border Protection agency.
India’s communications ministry said at the weekend that Trump’s executive order issued last month required transport carriers or other “qualified parties” approved by US authorities to collect and remit the tariff duties.
But “several critical processes relating to the designation of ‘qualified parties’ and mechanisms for duty collection and remittance remain undefined,” it said in a statement.
Under the new US measures, individual customers will still be able to send documents and items worth up to $100 as presents to the country without being taxed.
But anything above that value is expected to be hit with the same tariff rates applied to other imports from the sending country.
That means 15 per cent for countries in the European Union and 50pc for India.
And Germany’s postal service DHL warned last week that even exempted items would be subject to extra checks to prevent the service from being used for commercial goods.
‘Sustainable solutions’
The UPU stressed that it was “taking all possible measures to prepare its member countries for the impacts [the new measures] may have on their postal flows”.
UPU chief Masahiko Metoki had sent a letter to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday to convey member countries’ concern regarding the operational disruptions, it said.
Pointing to the short implementation timeline and voicing particular concern over the impact on the delivery of e-commerce items, the union said it was “working with the relevant US authorities to ensure that information on the operational requirements of the measures is communicated effectively to other member countries”.
In parallel, it said it was working with “relevant postal stakeholders” to help find sustainable solutions, including one initiative aimed at developing a system to facilitate duty collection and remittance across its network.</p><small>2025-08-26 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26203658b5b209b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937384/pakistan-iran-army-chiefs-affirm-readiness-to-eradicating-terrorism-for-secure-borders' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Iran army chiefs affirm readiness to eradicating terrorism for secure borders</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and his Iranian counterpart, Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, affirmed their readiness on Tuesday to eradicate terrorism for securing the borders of both countries.
Pakistan and Iran, earlier this month, agreed that peace and prosperity in their border regions hinged on effectively combatting terrorism. The nearly 900-kilometre border between the two countries has long faced security threats from proscribed groups, such as Jaish al-Adl and the Balochistan Liberation Army. Persistent issues, including terrorism, smuggling, and mutual accusations of harbouring militants, have periodically strained ties.
A statement issued by the Iranian embassy said Field Marshal Munir and Gen Mousavi, the chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, held a telephonic conversation today.
“The two sides are ready to eradicate terrorism to secure common borderlines,” it read.
 






A statement carried by Iranian state news agency IRNA said Gen Mousavi mentioned that Iran was prepared to eradicate terrorism and secure its borders with Pakistan, pointing to growing cross-border movements of terrorist groups and calling for joint efforts to eliminate terrorism.
It added that Field Mashal Munir echoed the call for securing common borders, saying the two sides must “jointly turn the Pakistan-Iran border into a border of friendship, brotherhood, and economic development”.
“Field Marshal Munir expressed his gratitude for Mousavi’s sympathy for the Pakistani nation and expressed his condolences for the families of the victims of the recent terrorist attack in Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan Province.”
Gen Mosavi also expressed his sympathy with the flood-affected victims in Pakistan, saying that “Iran would proudly provide any assistance within its power to dear brothers in Pakistan”.
He further expressed his satisfaction over bilateral ties, saying both countries were interacting and cooperating at various levels, particularly commending Pakistan’s stance and support for Iran during the 12-day war with Israel.
In his visit earlier this month,  Iranian Presi­dent Masoud Pezeshkian had said that development of economic and trade ties would be achieved through peace, stability and tranquillity.
“Given the threats from terrorist groups in border areas, both sides emphasised the need to increase cooperation to ensure border security and safeguard the peace and well-being of citizens in border cities,” the Iranian president had added.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had acknowledged that security was paramount for progress in bilateral relations. “There will be zero tolerance for all forms of terrorism. If anyone falls victim to terrorism in Iran, it is the same as someone being affected by terrorism in Pakistan,” he had said.
“For peace and development in our region, and along our hundreds of kilometres-long shared border, we must cooperate against terrorism and take effective steps to eliminate the scourge of terrorism once and for all,” the PM had added.
While the two leaders voiced their commitment to deepening cooperation, specific operational details were reportedly discussed in President Pezeshkian’s meeting with Field Marshal Munir.</p><small>2025-08-26 18:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26202643291465c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937383/main-suspect-in-raiwind-murder-video-case-arrested-handed-over-to-ccd-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>Main suspect in Raiwind murder video case arrested, handed over to CCD: lawyer</strong></a><br><p>The main suspect in the torture of two brothers by some street vendors in Raiwind has been arrested and handed over to the Crime Control Department (CCD), the lawyer of their father said on Tuesday.
The incident went viral on social media when a video clip showed some street vendors subjecting both brothers to severe torture on a road in the Raiwind area a few days back. They were lying in a pool of blood, and the suspected attackers, holding clubs in their hands, were spotted torturing them at a public place with many onlookers and passersby standing around. One brother died of severe torture marks at the spot, while the other succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.
A first information report (FIR) of the incident was filed on the complaint of the victims’ father on August 22 at the Raiwind City Police Station under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
It said the incident occurred on August 21 at 5:45pm when the brothers were returning home and stopped to buy some fruit. “Due to a dispute over money, the owner of the fruit cart … and his brother … began beating my sons and called some other people,” the complainant said.
He said he managed to free his sons after reaching the scene, accompanied by other people, adding that the suspects fled while uttering threats. The complainant urged action against the suspects.
The lawyer for the father, lawyer Ahmed Ali Awan, told Dawn.com today: “The main suspect has been handed over to CCD. He was arrested by the police today.”
He added that the second suspect was still in police custody and raids were underway to arrest the other suspects.
In June, Karachi police arrested a main suspect along with his two employees over charges of beating a citizen after a video of the incident went viral on social media, prompting authorities to take notice of it.</p><small>2025-08-26 18:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2613413557cd01e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937340/ndma-issues-high-flood-alert-for-ravi-as-india-releases-water' target='_blank'><strong>NDMA issues high-flood alert for Ravi as India releases water</strong></a><br><p>The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Tuesday issued a high-flood alert for the Ravi River after India released additional water into the tributary.
A devastating monsoon season marked by record rainfall, glacier melt, and widespread flooding has exposed Pakistan’s extreme vulnerability to climate change. The “high flood” warnings this week have put Punjab on high alert and prompted mass evacuations in various places.
In a high flood alert posted at 5:40pm, the NDMA said: “Heavy rainfall expected in the upper regions of Ravi over the next 48 hours. The Indian dam Thein is 97 per cent full, and its spillways may be opened at any time. Due to potential discharge, a high-level flood is expected in the Ravi River. High-level flow is also expected in Pir Panjal, Bain, Basantar and Deek.”
The NDMA cautioned citizens to stay away from rivers, drains and low-lying areas, along with avoiding unnecessary travel.
It also issued instructions to agencies and emergency services to remain on high alert.
 






A statement from the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said India had opened all gates of the Thein Dam on the Ravi River and 210,000 cusecs of water were entering Pakistan from Kot Ninan.
“In the next 24 hours, the water flow at Kot Ninan will increase further. In the next 48 hours, very high level of flood will pass through Jasar Shahdara and Head Baloki,” it said, adding that the Lahore commissioner and deputy commissioners of other districts had been alerted.
The PDMA spokesperson said the water level in the Ravi River was continuously increasing, adding that there was a high level of flood at Jasar with 142,000 cusecs of water continuously entering and a low level of flood at Shahdara at 56,000 cusecs of water.
The spokesperson said the PDMA had instructed the administration of the districts adjacent to the Ravi River to take emergency measures and instructions were issued for the immediate evacuation of citizens in the river’s basin.
Meanwhile, an update from Kasur Division Signaller Ghulam Mustafa at 8pm said there was a “very high flood” in the Sutlej River with the flow at 208,973 cusecs and rising.
Earlier today, state-run APP reported that nearly 150,000 people have so far been relocated to safer areas from flood-prone regions, adding that it followed early warnings and alerts issued by NDMA regarding rising water levels and potential flooding.
The PDMA initiated “large-scale evacuation operations” in vulnerable places following the swelling of the Sutlej River, the report said.
“Emergency response teams were deployed, and all concerned departments were placed on high alert to safeguard public life and property,” it added.
The data provided by the NDMA showed evacuations included 89,868 residents from Bahawalnagar, 14,140 from Kasur, 2,063 from Okara, 873 from Pakpattan, 361 from Bahawalpur, and 165 from Vehari, according to the APP.
It further said that around 40,000 people had moved to safer locations soon after the initial alerts.
A day earlier, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz issued orders to evacuate the people living in areas around rivers and low-lying regions, while the Ministry of Climate Change predicted heavy rains in Gujranwala, Gujrat, and Lahore divisions “with a high risk of both riverine and urban flooding”.
 
 

An alert by Punjab PDMA on Monday reported “high flood level” in the Sutlej River at 10am, urging district administrations across Punjab to maintain a “high level of preparedness and mitigation of the disaster”.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) also issued a flood warning for the Chenab River and Ravi River yesterday, stating that the intensity of rainfall over the eastern rivers was “likely to increase significantly”.
In light of a flood alert by India, more than 24,000 people had been relocated from the low-lying areas of the Indus, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers since Saturday, according to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad.</p><small>2025-08-26 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26162512ba39807.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937371/9-ttp-terrorists-killed-so-far-in-joint-operation-in-kps-upper-dir-police' target='_blank'><strong>9 TTP terrorists killed so far in joint operation in KP’s Upper Dir: police</strong></a><br><p>Nine terrorists of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group have been killed in a joint operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Upper Dir district, the police said on Tuesday.
A statement issued by Upper Dir District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Bilal said the police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted a targeted operation against the TTP in the district.
“Nine terrorists were killed in the operation that has been going on for three days, and the bodies of five were recovered,” he said, adding that 10 police personnel were injured in firing by terrorists and two locals were also killed.
The statement said the operation was carried out in adjoining areas within the limits of the Dir City Police Station based on credible information indicating the presence of elements of banned terrorist organisations.
“Dir Police is always ready to eliminate terrorism and protect the lives and property of the people, and is determined to make every kind of sacrifice. This operation will continue until the complete elimination of Fitna-al-Khawarij,” the DPO said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the police and the CTD for the operations, adding that he and the entire nation were proud of them.
 






Five security personnel and three civilians, including a two-year-old child, embraced martyrdom while several policemen sustained injuries as clashes between security forces and militants continued over the weekend and a day ago in various parts of KP. At least seven terrorists were also killed, officials and sources had said.
In Upper Dir and Lower Dir districts, officials and sources had said five suspected militants were killed and seven policemen injured late on Sunday night during fierce clashes between the security forces and the TTP. They said the exchange of fire in the Dobando area of Upper Dir continued for several hours. Two civilians from Hatnar Dara, caught in the crossfire, lost their lives.
A senior CTD official had told Dawn.com that the bodies of all five terrorists were in police custody. They might have links across the border in Afghanistan, he had said.
In Lower Dir’s Lajbook Dara area, heavy firing broke out between police and militants. Though no casualties were reported from this clash, tension gripped the area as the attackers torched police vehicles, including two pick-up trucks and a car, locals had said. Sharing the footage on social media, the outlawed TTP claimed they had “seized the vehicles and destroyed them”.
In July last year, the government designated the TTP as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past years, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Recent terrorist attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.

An earlier version of this story erroneously mentioned Upper Dir as Lower Dir. The error has been rectified and is regretted.</p><small>2025-08-26 17:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2621544469f37e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937387/steep-us-tariffs-set-to-hit-indian-exports-from-wednesday' target='_blank'><strong>Steep US tariffs set to hit Indian exports from Wednesday</strong></a><br><p>Indian exporters are bracing for a sharp decline in orders from the United States after trade talks collapsed and Washington confirmed that steep new tariffs on the South Asian nation’s goods would take effect from Wednesday, escalating tension between the strategic partners.
An additional 25 per cent duty announced by President Donald Trump, confirmed in a notice by the Homeland Security Department, takes total tariffs to as much as 50pc, among Washington’s highest, in retaliation for New Delhi’s increased buying of Russian oil.
“The government has no hope for any immediate relief or delay in US tariffs,” said a commerce ministry official, who sought anonymity for lack of authorisation to speak to the media.
 
 

Exporters hit by tariffs would receive financial assistance and be encouraged to diversify to alternative markets such as China, Latin America and the Middle East, the official added.
However, the commerce ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the latest notice.
The new duties will apply from 12:01am EDT on Wednesday (9:31am IST), it showed. Exceptions are shipments in transit, humanitarian aid and items under reciprocal trade programmes.
The Indian rupee fell to a three-week closing low of 87.68 against the dollar, despite recovering some ground after suspected central bank intervention to support it.
The benchmark equity indexes closed down 1pc each, for their worst sessions in three months.
Wednesday’s tariff move follows five rounds of failed talks, during which Indian officials had signalled optimism that tariffs could be capped at 15pc.
Officials on both sides blamed political misjudgment and missed signals for the breakdown in talks between the world’s biggest and fifth-largest economies, whose two-way trade is worth more than $190 billion.
 

The chart shows India’s monthly imports and export to US

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have accused India of indirectly funding Russia’s war against Ukraine by boosting Russian oil purchases.
This month, Bessent said India was profiteering from its sharply increased imports, making up 42pc of total oil purchases, versus less than 1pc before the war, in a shift Washington has called unacceptable.
India has issued no directive yet on oil purchases from Russia. Companies will continue to buy oil on the basis of economics, three refining sources said.
Exporters seek aid
Exporter groups estimate hikes could affect nearly 55pc of India’s merchandise exports worth $87bn to the US, while benefiting competitors such as Bangladesh, China and Vietnam.
 

The table shows the sectors that get affected mainly from US tariffs on India and the total potential impact on trade numbers

“The US customers have already stopped new orders,” said Pankaj Chadha, president of the Engineering Exports Promotion Council. “With these additional tariffs, the exports could come down by 20-30pc from September onward.”
The government has promised financial aid such as greater subsidies on bank loans and support for diversification in the event of financial losses, Chadha added.
“However, exporters see limited scope for diversifying to other markets or selling in the domestic market.”
The commerce ministry official said the government had identified nearly 50 countries to which India could boost exports, particularly items such as textiles, food processed items, leather goods and marine products.
India’s diamond industry exports have already hit a two-decade low on weak Chinese demand, and the higher tariffs now threaten to cut it off from its largest market, taking nearly a third of $28.5bn annual shipments of gems and jewellery.

Broader economic impact
Private sector analysts warn that a sustained 50pc tariff could weigh on India’s economy and corporate profits, prompting the steepest earnings downgrades in Asia, even if proposed domestic tax cuts partly cushion the blow.
Last week, Capital Economics said full US tariffs would chip 0.8 percentage points from India’s economic growth both this year and the next.
Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar also said trade talks continued and Washington’s concern over Russian oil purchases was not equally applied to other major buyers such as China and the European Union.
The US could be a major energy supplier to India, an official of its New Delhi embassy said on Tuesday.
The US is committed to collaborating with India on exports of high-quality products and services to help achieve energy security and economic growth, the official added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed not to compromise the interests of Indian farmers, even if it entails a heavy price. Modi is also moving to burnish ties with China, planning his first visit there in seven years at the end of the month.</p><small>2025-08-26 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620525-over-174000-people-relocated-to-safe-locations-amid-floods-pm-told' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's monsoon death toll tops 800 after rains wreak havoc</strong></a><br><p>

Mirza, a resident of Machine Mohallah of Jhelum city, frequently uploads his lectures and speeches on his social media accounts and has amassed 3.1 million followers on his YouTube channel.
Earlier today, Jhelum Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Meesam Abbas and District Police Officer (DPO) Ahmed Mohiyuddin confirmed Mirza’s arrest under MPO to Dawn.com.
Section 3 of the MPO ordinance gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected persons to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order.
A religious group had yesterday filed an application, seen by Dawn.com, requesting legal action against Mirza for alleged controversial remarks made during an interview that “went viral on social media”.
Separately, a first information report (FIR) was registered at the Jhelum city police station on August 26 under Section 295 C (use of derogatory remarks, etc, in respect of the Holy Prophet) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (2016).
Mirza “has severely hurt the religious sentiments of Muslims by making blasphemous remarks”, the FIR read. The complainant said that legal action must be taken against Mirza under Section 295C of the blasphemy laws.
Mirza was also among 17 clerics whose speeches were banned by then-Jhelum DC during Muharram last year to prevent any potential sectarian violence.
The popular cleric survived an assassination attempt at a religious academy in March 2021. The suspect was taken into custody, and a case of attempted murder was registered against him.
The cleric had also been booked and arrested by the Jhelum police in May 2020 for derogatory remarks against some religious figures. However, he was later released on bail.</p><small>2025-08-26 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620513-47-terrorists-killed-while-attempting-to-infiltrate-balochistans-zhob-security-sources' target='_blank'><strong>47 terrorists killed in Zhob infiltration attempt: sources</strong></a><br><p>

There seems to be a tug of war within the PTI over whether to participate in the upcoming by-elections for national and provincial assembly seats — vacated after the recent disqualifications of a number of key lawmakers. Insiders had told Dawn the party’s political committee — in its meeting on Monday — had a change of heart after a majority of members voted against the decision to boycott by-polls. This contravenes the opinion reportedly expressed by Imran, transmitted by Aleema on a couple of occasions, to steer clear of by-elections so that the party isn’t seen as legitimising the process.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram had shared the party’s decision on social media and triggered a wave of criticism from across the globe. When approached, Akram confirmed that he, Raja and a few others were against the decision, but they had to go with the majority. In a dramatic turn of events, however, Raja announced his intention to step down from the post of secretary general. Although he did not specify what prompted him to take this decision, the timing of his X post indicated that the “incident” he referred to was — in all probability — the political committee’s decision to contest by-polls.
Questioned about reports of a tense exchange with him being the cause of his decision, Aleema said while talking to the media outside Adiala Jail today: “I had no bitter exchange of words with him. He is our lawyer and like a family [member] with all of us, but I think it is more so [a matter] of his own [decision] and that of the political committee. It is an issue [of participation] in the by-election and you should ask him (Raja).”
 


Pushed on the reports of a disagreement in the party over whether to contest the by-elections or not, Imran’s other sister, Uzma Khanum, interjected and said: “The party will tell what conflict it was. As per our last family meeting, Khan sahib very firmly, repeatedly and clearly said not to contest the elections but to boycott them because there will be no benefit, it will harm the party and the [movement] for actual freedom and the illegitimate disqualifications would be legitimised.”
Addressing the media later, Aleema said Imran had directed PTI lawmakers to resign from parliamentary committees and to inform him about the political committee’s decision regarding the by-elections tomorrow morning after holding a meeting later today on the issue based on his instructions.
Meanwhile, Raja said while talking to the media that Imran had not accepted his decision to resign.
He added that the political committee would have a meeting again today to discuss the issue of participating in the by-elections based on Imran’s “clear instructions”.
Raja further said that the PTI had a clear stance that Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz were still the opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate, adding that they were still contesting their cases and would fulfil all legal requirements.
“If there is a need after that, then the name that Imran has repeated today for the NA opposition leader is that of Mehmood Khan Achakzai.”
 


Raja explained that Imran gave his “clear directions” about participating in the by-polls after listening to all those allowed to meet him today, including his sisters.
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Ali Gohar said he had not read Raja’s statement on resigning as secretary general, nor had he received any resignation in writing.
“Imran will decide whether he decides to continue or not. It is unfortunate. I’ve always said that something always comes up from inside the party and people make it an issue. Imran said that no party leader would mention their resignation in public.”
 


The PTI has already obtained stay orders against the de-seating of key opposition leaders. It has also, albeit reluctantly, nominated replacements while the party pursues legal options.
But faced with threats on multiple fronts — including the possible loss of maj­o­rity in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly due to future disqualifications, a push to reclaim political space in Punjab, and a showdown between two opposing camps within the party — it seems as if the PTI may throw its hat in the ring, despite all misgivings about the by-elections. According to sources privy to proceedings, Monday’s meeting of the political committee had voted 12-9 in favour of fielding candidates for the upcoming by-elections.
Additionally, Akram had announced that all candidates would be issued tickets under the banner of the Sunni Ittehad Council, which appears to be an insurance policy of sorts, to offset chances of them being declared ‘independent candidates’, since the dispute around PTI’s intra-party elections and the matter of its electoral symbol are still in limbo.</p><small>2025-08-26 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26165117bcfea13.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937353/many-areas-in-gbs-ghizer-cut-off-for-5th-day-as-gilgit-shandur-road-remains-blocked' target='_blank'><strong>Many areas in GB’s Ghizer cut off for 5th day as Gilgit-Shandur road remains blocked</strong></a><br><p>Several areas in Gilgit Baltistan’s (GB) Ghizer district have been cut off for five days, as preparations are underway to clear the Gilgit-Shandur road, authorities said on Tuesday.
Since late July, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country, especially in its northern regions like GB, by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
According to locals, majority of the areas in the Ghizer district, including Gupis, Phander, and Yasin tehsils, remained stranded for five days as five kilometres of the region’s main road were submerged by an artificial lake formed at Raushan  village in Ghizer.
Local resident Meraj Ali Shah told Dawn.com that 300 houses had been dama­ged by the glacial flood, with houses submerged due to artificial lake in Hakis, Thangi, and Raushan villages as they remained without basic necessities.
He added that hundreds of people had been displaced when a glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) swept everything in Tildas village.
“They are living without electricity, drinking water, proper accommodation, medical facilities, [and] other basic needs,” he said.
Locals also complained of a lack of support from the government, adding that they had been dependent on relief items by welfare organisations.
Two patients in a critical condition were taken from Gupis to Gilgit on Monday through a helicopter belonging to the Aga Khan Development Network, as per the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat.
According to the locals, people affected in previous floods in Ghizer’s Khalti, Daen, Chatorkhand, Yasin, and other areas did not have access to roads, clean drinking water, and other necessities.
Since three weeks, the Karakoram Highway at Hassanabad Hunza could not be opened as it was blocked after a Glof from Shishper glacier submerged a portion of the thoroughfare, posing severe difficulties to Hassanabad’s residents. The Glof also damaged dozens of homes, farmland, and the area’s government and private infrastructure.
Residents in the Hisper valley of Nagar district have been disconnected for a month as the only accessible road was blocked owing to river erosion and landslides. Gilgil’s Haramosh and Bagrot valleys have also remained disconnected.

Locals said the water supply systems to areas populated by thousands of people, including Gilgit’s Danyor, Sultanabad, and Mohammadabad have remained suspended, adding that they had to purchase water tankers daily, which the poor could not afford.
“For the last month, people in the populated areas have faced a severe water shortage,” said a local resident Shahzad Hussain.
Furthermore, according to the locals, the crops and trees have dried up due to the unavailability of irrigation water supply systems.
A local, Muhammad Alam, told Dawn.com that flood-affected people in Mashabrum sub-division of Ghanche district in Baltistan are currently living in difficult circumstances. “Above sixty households in Ghanche district, including Haldi and Balayagan villages displaced in flood have taken shelter in tents under the open sky and are waiting for the government’s assistance.”
Unfortunately, locals said, no concrete steps have been taken by the government so far for their rehabilitation and redressal of their problems, due to which the victims have been plunged into severe difficulties and deprivation. Without basic facilities, they say they are forced to spend their days and nights in destitution and helplessness.

Furthermore, those traumatised by high intensity floods also complain of mental health issues, demanding mental rehabilitation.
According to a statement issued on Tuesday by the GB government, the affected people in the recent floods, especially children, women and the elderly, are suffering from mental and psychological problems.
In view of these challenges, a meeting was held under the chairmanship of Arif Tahseen, the additional secretary of the GB department of social welfare. Senior officials of various government and private institutions participated to formulate a coordinated strategy for the mental and psychological rehabilitation of the victims.
In the meeting, it was agreed to work together to restore mental health among the people of the affected areas in collaboration with the GB Health Department, Aga Khan Health Service and Rupani Foundation.
On this occasion, Additional Secretary Tahseen said the recent floods have not only caused physical and economic devastation but have also left deep emotional and psychological impacts on individuals and families, especially children, women and the elderly in affected areas.
“To address these impacts, it is imperative that a joint and coordinated strategy involving all relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors be launched immediately to include this important aspect in the overall disaster response process,” he said.
The meeting discussed the improvement of mental health facilities, provision of psychologists, community outreach programs and the launch of awareness campaigns, and suggested practical measures.
All the institutions expressed their determination to jointly fulfill this important national responsibility and agreed that a comprehensive and long-term plan would ensure the complete rehabilitation of the victims.
Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Director General Zakir Hussain said in a statement that due to the recent rains and flood situation, the National Highway Authority machinery has been mobilised to clear the Gilgit-Shandur road in the Raushan area. He added that formal approval has also been obtained for the construction of an alternative route in a short period of time and work on it is progressing rapidly.
“Under the project, a bypass will be constructed and the road will be connected to the main highway through a bridge,” he said, adding that this will ease movement and reduce difficulties faced by people.
“The government is utilising all available resources for the restoration of flood-affected areas, and for this purpose, work is being done in close coordination with the relevant institutions,” Hussain said. “We stand with the affected people and are trying to resolve their problems immediately.”

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to arrive in GB on Wednesday to review the disastrous situation.
A statement by the GB government said a high-level meeting was held to review arrangements for the PM’s expected visit. The meeting, chaired by GB Chief Secretary Abrara Ahmed Mirza, was briefed on the damage caused by the flood situation and the steps taken for the rehabilitation of the affected areas. The meeting’s participants also discussed the current status of the early warning system.
It was decided that all the relevant institutions will complete their preparations before the PM’s visit. Mirza directed the rehabilitation work in the affected areas to be accelerated, adding that all institutions should coordinate in this regard.</p><small>2025-08-26 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620501-imran-directs-pti-leaders-to-resign-from-all-parliamentary-committees-says-aleema-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Imran directs PTI lawmakers to resign from all parliamentary committees: Aleema</strong></a><br><p>

The 24-year-old was injured while bowling in the first Test against Zimbabwe this month and returned home, where scans revealed the extent of the damage.
“We’re really feeling for Will at the moment and wishing him speedy recovery,” New Zealand head coach Rob Walter said.
 






O’Rourke will miss the home white-ball series against Australia in early
October, England later that month and the West Indies in November.
All-rounder Glenn Phillips was also ruled out of the Australia series as he recovers from the groin injury that saw him miss the Zimbabwe tour.
And opening batsman Finn Allen will be out for a minimum of three months after having surgery on his right foot.
“It’s disappointing to lose the services of Glenn and Finn, who have played important batting roles in our T20 set-up in recent times,” said Walter.
White-ball captain Mitchell Santner returned home from England’s The
Hundred tournament at the weekend after feeling groin pain.
Walter said the spinning all-rounder will now have abdominal surgery with an expected recovery time of a month, but would be given every chance to prove his fitness before the three T20s against Australia.
“Mitch is a world-class player and a crucial part of our T20 side from a skills and leadership point of view,” said Walter.
“With that in mind we expect to name him in our squad. From there we can assess how his rest and rehabilitation progresses following surgery, before making a call on the eve of the series.”
Pace bowler Ben Sears has recovered from a side strain that saw him miss the Zimbabwe tour and is expected to be available.</p><small>2025-08-26 13:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620494-dar-reaffirms-pakistans-commitment-to-deepen-ties-with-brotherly-nations' target='_blank'><strong>Dar reaffirms Pakistan's commitment to deepen ties with brotherly nations</strong></a><br><p>

Vantara is a marquee project of the Reliance Foundation and the Ambani family. Located in western Gujarat state and led by the billionaire’s son, Anant Ambani, it has rescued and treated thousands of animals, and built the largest elephant hospital.
It was also one of the venues for Anant’s pre-wedding celebrations last year, with the global celebrities who attended advised to don “jungle fever” outfits when visiting Vantara.
The Supreme Court late on Monday ordered an inquiry as it ruled on public interest litigations that referred to complaints by non-profit and wildlife groups alleging mistreatment of animals at Vantara and questioning how the animals ended up at the rescue centre. They also alleged the Central Zoo Authority, the regulatory agency, failed in its duties.
In a written order, the court said although there was no evidence to support the allegations, an independent investigation was needed because the petitions alleged authorities were unwilling to discharge their duties.
“We consider it appropriate in the ends of justice to call for an independent factual appraisal,” the court said in its order.
In a statement, a Vantara spokesperson told Reuters it remains committed to transparency and legal compliance. Vantara added it would cooperate fully with the investigation panel, and its “mission and focus continues to be the rescue, rehabilitation and care of animals”.
The Central Zoo Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The panel will be led by a former Supreme Court judge and will submit a report on the acquisition of animals, particularly elephants, look at complaints regarding the creation of a vanity or private collection of wildlife, as well as check for compliance with India’s Wild Life Protection Act.
The panel needs to submit a report to the court by September 12.
Located in Jamnagar, Gujarat, Vantara is home to more than 150,000 animals across more than 2,000 species. It also has a 998-acre elephant welfare trust, which it says is the world’s largest care facility for rescued elephants.
This month, local communities in neighbouring Maharashtra state staged protests against the relocation of a 36-year-old elephant that was unwell to Vantara, arguing the animal had been part of their spiritual life, including processions, for decades.
Reliance has acknowledged the “deep religious and cultural significance” of the elephant, but says it was following a court’s directive with the relocation.
In March, Prime Minister Narendra Modi toured Vantara and said it “provides a safe haven for animals while promoting ecological sustainability and wildlife welfare”.
Anant is also an executive director of oil-to-retail conglomerate Reliance Industries, and is involved in its technology and telecoms business, Jio Platforms.
In media tours last year, Anant showed the large kitchens at the facility for elephants, where dishes such as juice and sweets were prepared for the animals, and popcorn was served as a “treat”.</p><small>2025-08-26 11:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26164832309c770.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937373/fact-check-viral-video-showing-imran-khan-with-a-beard-is-doctored' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video showing Imran Khan with a beard is doctored</strong></a><br><p>Posts from PTI supporters on multiple social media platforms since Sunday were sharing a video showing PTI founder Imran Khan with a beard. However, the video is doctored.
Imran has remained incarcerated for over two years since August 2023 due to ongoing legal proceedings, despite several acquittals and suspended sentences. In January 2025, he was handed a 14-year prison sentence in a corruption case linked to the Al-Qadir University Project Trust.
On Aug 23 this year, a TikTok user — who appeared to be a PTI supporter based on his past posts — shared a video showing Imran with a beard.
The user did not provide any details about when or where the video was recorded.
The video amassed over 21.3 million views and more than 2.3m likes.
The same video was also shared by other PTI supporters on TikTok, here and here, where it gained 4.1m and 2.2m views, respectively.
Other users also circulated the clip on various other platforms, which can be seen here, here, here, here, here and here.
In addition, an image of Imran with a beard was also widely shared online, with examples available here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in Imran.
A reverse image search led to an X post shared by PTI’s official account on May 23, 2023.
 






The caption of the post read: “PTI Chairman Imran Khan earlier today in ATC (anti-terrorism court), Islamabad”.
In the image, Imran appears clean-shaven, wearing a white shalwar kameez with a dark blue waistcoat, identical to his attire in the viral video. The policemen visible in the image — one bearded and one clean-shaven — also match those seen in the viral video.
 


A keyword search for news reports around that date led to a Geo News report from the same day, titled “NAB grills Imran Khan in £190m settlement case”.
According to the report, Imran was granted bail in eight cases, while his wife Bushra Bibi secured bail in the £190m settlement case. Later that day, NAB questioned him regarding the Al-Qadir Trust and the settlement with a property tycoon, seeking records of donations and trust deeds. Imran had denied wrongdoing, maintaining that the funds remained with the Supreme Court and no personal benefit was taken.
The same image from PTI’s official post also appeared in the news report, further confirming its authenticity.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows Imran Khan with a beard is false. The video clip is doctored.

Pakistan ranks among the world’s 10 most climate-vulnerable countries, despite contributing less than 1 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Experts warn that such floods and other calamities are no longer “rare disasters” and are becoming routine shocks in a country ill-prepared to withstand them.
The focus, according to these experts, must now be on adaptation, not emissions cuts.
“Floods are no longer rare disasters in Pakistan. They are becoming routine shocks that people brace for every monsoon. Calling them the ‘new normal’ is not an exaggeration,” said Karachi-based ecologist Rafi-ul-Haq.
 
 

Since mid-August, torrential rains, flash floods and cloudbursts have killed more than 460 people across the country, including in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and the Gilgit-Baltistan region.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been the worst-hit, where swollen rivers, mudslides and collapsing homes have buried entire families. Nationwide, almost 800 people have died in rain-triggered floods and landslides since late June.
Haq said the intensity of rains and floods is accelerating due to climate change, global warming and melting glaciers. But human actions — unplanned urbanisation, deforestation, blocked waterways, lax governance and weak emergency responses — account for as much as 60pc of the destruction.
“Pakistan cannot stop the rain, but it can prevent much of the suffering by fixing manmade vulnerabilities,” he said. “Floods will happen, but disasters don’t have to.”
Ahmed Kamal, an Islamabad-based flood management expert, described the current flooding as a “new normal”. Shifting monsoon patterns, he said, have intensified rainfall and created new hotspots of devastation.
The Gilgit-Baltistan region, home to towering glaciers, has experienced alarming changes. Temperatures have risen steadily, accelerating glacier melt and causing glacial lake outburst floods. In May, Chilas district recorded an unprecedented 49°C (120F).
 
 

“We have our glaciers melting very fast, while winters are shrinking,” Kamal said. “Snowfall was almost 50pc below average last year.”
He also pointed out the dangers of intensifying cyclone threats in Pakistan, saying that rising sea surface temperatures in the Arabian Sea have shifted storm activity westward, with cyclones increasingly striking the coast since 2007.
At the same time, decades of deforestation — driven by demand for farmland and housing — have stripped the country of natural flood buffers. “This has multiplied the frequency and intensity of floods,” Kamal said.
Adaptation, resilience, and governance
Experts argue that Pakistan must focus on building resilience through a mix of natural and structural solutions.
“Given its economic limits, Pakistan’s priority must be adaptation and resilience rather than emissions cuts,” Haq said.
 
 

He called for restoring wetlands, mangroves and floodplains to absorb excess water, clearing illegal construction from drainage channels, and upgrading city drainage systems with green infrastructure.
He also emphasised the need for flood-resilient farming backed by insurance and social safety nets. “Low-cost steps like pre-monsoon drain cleaning, early warning systems, and community shelters can save lives immediately,” he said, while also stressing the need to address weak land-use planning and corruption.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has acknowledged that “criminal negligence” by successive governments had allowed construction on riverbeds and watersheds. At a cabinet meeting last week, he vowed to clear these encroachments.
“Along with this, larger investments in watershed management and resilient housing can follow with international climate finance,” said Kamal.
Climate governance expert Imran Saqib Khalid warned that unless Pakistan takes quick action, the future could bring food insecurity, water shortages and mass migration. “Science shows that if we continue on this trajectory, by the end of the century we’ll reach close to 2.5°C warming, which will cause havoc,” he said.
Khalid also argued that Islamabad must join forces with other low-emitting nations to demand fairer global action and finance.
Kamal concluded on an optimistic note, saying: “The challenge is enormous, but the window of opportunity is still there. With scientifically smart adaptation strategies, we could at least mitigate much of the devastation.”</p><small>2025-08-26 11:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261450582afe678.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937356/dar-vows-to-boost-pakistans-ties-with-egypt-algeria-through-broader-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Dar vows to boost Pakistan’s ties with Egypt, Algeria through broader cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar vowed to strengthen Pakistan’s ties with the North African countries of Egypt and Algeria as he met their foreign ministers on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia.
Dar arrived in Jeddah on a two-day visit yesterday, where he spoke on Israel’s ongoing Gaza onslaught during the 21st extraordinary session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC) Council of Foreign Ministers.
Today, on the sidelines of the OIC meeting, Dar met with Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty and Algeria’s FM Ahmed Attaf.
Terming his discussion as a “meaningful interaction”, Dar said: “I reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening ties with our brotherly countries in North Africa, Algeria and Egypt, through enhanced connectivity and broader cooperation across diverse fields.”
The foreign ministers discussed the “grave situation in Palestine”, Dar said on X.
The trio stressed the “urgent need for humanitarian access, a ceasefire, and lasting peace, while underscoring the importance of unity within the Muslim Ummah in these challenging times”.
 






At the OIC session yesterday, Dar slammed Israel’s “annexationist and rogue mindset” and condemned Tel Aviv’s plan to take control of Gaza City as threatening regional peace.
He also presented seven “urgent and essential steps” for the international community and Muslim nations to halt Israel’s war on Gaza — already termed a genocide by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch — and secure enduring peace in Palestine.
 
 

Pakistan also fully endorsed and joined the statement issued by 31 Arab-Islamic countries and the secretaries general of the OIC, the League of Arab States and the Gulf Cooperation Council, condemning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments about ‘Greater Israel’.
Algeria’s Ambassador to the UN Amar Bendjama has called for sanctions on Israel in response to its Gaza City plan.
Pakistan has brotherly ties with Egypt and Algeria, bonded in shared religion and culture.
In April, Islamabad and Cairo agreed to enhance bilateral collaboration in the health sector, with a specific focus on eliminating Hepatitis C. It was also reported earlier this year that Egypt’s renowned Al-Azhar University had plans to set up its campus in Pakistan.
Meeting with Turkiye’s foreign minister
The deputy PM also met with Turkiye’s FM Hakan Fidan today, expressing his “deep appreciation” to Turkiye for its leadership role in the capacity of chairing the OIC ministerial session.
“We affirmed firm solidarity with Palestine, noting the worsening humanitarian crisis and famine, and the urgent need for humanitarian aid and relief,” Dar noted.
The two ministers also “reaffirmed the brotherly Pakistan-Türkiye relations, and looked forward to further strengthening our multifaceted cooperation”.
 






Dar had also met with the top diplomats of several other friendly countries yesterday on the sidelines of the OIC meeting. They included Saudi Arabia’s FM Faisal Bin Farhan, Iran’s FM Abbas Araghchi, Malaysia’s Mohamad Haji Hasan, and Bangladeshi Adviser for Foreign Affairs Md Touhid Hossain.</p><small>2025-08-26 10:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620459-nearly-150000-evacuated-amid-flood-warnings-as-india-releases-water-into-sutlej-ravi' target='_blank'><strong>Nearly 150,000 evacuated amid flood warnings as India releases water into Sutlej, Ravi</strong></a><br><p>

Aside from Russian President Vladimir Putin, leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia have been invited to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, to be held in the northern port city of Tianjin from August 31 to September 1.
The summit will feature Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first visit to China in more than seven years as the two neighbours work on further defusing tensions roiled by deadly border clashes in 2020.
Modi last shared the same stage with Xi and Putin at last year’s Brics summit in Kazan, Russia, even as Western leaders turned their backs on the Russian leader amid the war in Ukraine.
Russian embassy officials in New Delhi last week said Moscow hopes trilateral talks with China and India will take place soon.
“Xi will want to use the summit as an opportunity to showcase what a post-American-led international order begins to look like and that all White House efforts since January to counter China, Iran, Russia, and now India have not had the intended effect,” said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project, a research agency.
“Just look at how much Brics has rattled [US President] Donald Trump, which is precisely what these groups are designed to do.”
This year’s summit will be the largest since the SCO was founded in 2001, a Chinese foreign ministry official said last week, calling the bloc an “important force in building a new type of international relations”.
The security-focused bloc, which began as a group of six Eurasian nations, has expanded to 10 permanent members and 16 dialogue and observer countries in recent years. Its remit has also enlarged from security and counter-terrorism to economic and military cooperation.
‘Fuzzy’ implementation
Analysts say expansion is high on the agenda for many countries attending, but agree the bloc has not delivered substantial cooperation outcomes over the years and that China values the optics of Global South solidarity against the United States at a time of erratic policymaking and geopolitical flux.
“What is the precise vision that the SCO represents, and its practical implementation are rather fuzzy. It is a platform that has increasing convening power, which helps in narrative projection,” said Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Research Programme at the Takshashila Institution thinktank in Bangalore.
“But the SCO’s effectiveness in addressing substantial security issues remains very limited.”
Frictions remain between core members India and Pakistan.
The June SCO defence ministers’ meeting was unable to adopt a joint statement after India raised objections, saying it omitted reference to the deadly April 22 attack on Hindu tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which led to the worst fighting in decades between India and Pakistan.
 
 

New Delhi also refused to join the SCO’s condemnation of Israeli attacks on Iran, a member state, earlier in June.
But the recent détente between India and China after five years of heightened border frictions, as well as renewed tariff pressure on New Delhi from the Trump administration, are driving expectations for a positive meeting between Xi and Modi on the sidelines of the summit.
“It’s likely [New Delhi] will swallow their pride and put this year’s SCO problems behind them in a bid to maintain momentum in the détente with China, which is a key Modi priority right now,” said Olander.
Analysts expect both sides to announce further incremental border measures such as troop withdrawals, the easing of trade and visa restrictions, cooperation in new fields including climate, and broader government and people-to-people engagement.
Despite the lack of substantive policy announcements expected at the summit, experts warn that the bloc’s appeal to Global South countries should not be underestimated.
“This summit is about optics, really powerful optics,” added Olander.

The directive, dated August 6, follows investigations by Indian agencies after the two neighbouring countries engaged in a fierce military conflict in May, triggered by India blaming Pakistan, without evidence, for the April 22 Pehalgam attack in occupied Kashmir.
The RBI named Pakistan a “high risk” jurisdiction from an arms financing perspective and cited Indian investigations into arms financing, but did not go into detail about their findings.
According to a government source with direct knowledge of the matter, Indian investigative authorities found that some Pakistani nationals had sent funds to India via other countries.
India’s banking channels are at a “high risk of being used for arms funding by Pakistan”, alleged the source, who was not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified.
The central bank has general guidelines in place for banks to prevent money laundering and the financing of arms and terrorism, but a directive drawing attention to Pakistan is rare.
The Reserve Bank of India did not respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.
Zafar Masud, president of the Pakistan Banks Association, said in a statement that Pakistan’s “anti-money laundering laws and combating the financing of terrorism is very strict and robust.”
The RBI letter to banks and non-bank lenders also separately cited instances where Pakistan has been accused of violating global sanctions and rules.
It noted that a June 2025 report by the global anti-money laundering watchdog Financial Action Task Force had accused a Pakistan state-owned entity, the National Development Complex, of “evading sanctions by importing items for missile development without declaring them.”
Pakistan’s foreign ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The letter also listed North Korea as a “high risk” jurisdiction, citing sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council on the country in the past.</p><small>2025-08-26 09:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/26135224193ba04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937349/pakistan-buys-initial-30000-tonnes-sugar-in-tender-traders-say' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan buys initial 30,000 tonnes sugar in tender, traders say</strong></a><br><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has purchased an initial 30,000 tonnes of white sugar in an international tender seeking around 200,000 tonnes, European traders said on Tuesday.
On July 8, the government had approved plans to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have risen sharply since January.
The validity of other price offers submitted in the tender, which closed last week, has been extended until tomorrow, so more purchases are seen as possible, traders said.
The initial 30,000-tonne purchase was believed to have been made from Al Khaleej Sugar for medium-grade sugar at an estimated $582.50 a ton, cost and freight (c&f) included, they said.
 
 

Reports reflect assessments from traders, and further estimates of prices and volumes are still possible later. The tender sought sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel.
The TCP is believed to have purchased about 55,000 tonnes of white sugar in a previous international tender seeking up to 100,000 tonnes. The recent purchase will bring the total amount of sugar bought to 85,000 tonnes.
The government has vowed strict monitoring of sugar stocks and also placed some unidentified mill owners on the Exit Control List in a bid to stabilise rates.
A cartelisation case involving 79 sugar mills and the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) is also being heard by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP).</p><small>2025-08-26 08:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620453-cleric-engineer-muhammad-ali-mirza-arrested-under-3-mpo' target='_blank'><strong>Cleric Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza arrested under 3-MPO</strong></a><br><p>

Human smuggling from Pakistan to Iran has been a persistent issue, with many migrants attempting to cross through perilous land and sea routes in search of better economic opportunities or to reach onward destinations in the Middle East and Europe, according to a report by the National Initiative against Organised Crime.  Gwadar and other parts of Balochistan are frequently used as key transit points, where traffickers exploit vulnerable citizens by charging hefty sums for the dangerous journeys.
Per the FIA’s statement, “major operations” were carried out by the agency’s Composite Circle Gwadar, through which the suspects were arrested from different areas of the district.
“The arrested suspects are involved in sending citizens from Pakistan to Iran through illegal sea routes,” it said. “The suspect extorted Rs10,000 each from the victims.”
The suspects were arrested after being identified by the victims, the statement further said, adding that an investigation into the matter had been initiated.
Last week, FIA Balochistan arrested five traffickers in Taftan and Loralai for allegedly facilitating illegal travel abroad using fake documents and charging millions of rupees from the victims.
The group was sending people to Iran and Turkiye through illegal routes and fake documents, according to the FIA spokesperson.
“Three of the suspects were listed as most wanted by Pakistani embassies in Iran and Turkiye,” the spokesperson said, adding that they had already sent large numbers of people abroad illegally.</p><small>2025-08-26 08:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261111463e8fbfe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937325/two-more-polio-cases-confirmed-in-southern-kp-taking-2025-nationwide-tally-to-23' target='_blank'><strong>Two more polio cases confirmed in southern KP, taking 2025 nationwide tally to 23</strong></a><br><p>Two more poliovirus cases were confirmed in the southern parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, bringing Pakistan’s total count this year to 23, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said on Tuesday.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
A statement from the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at Islamabad’s NIH said the latest cases include a 16-month-old girl from Union Council Mullazai in Tank district and a 24-month-old girl from Union Council Miran Shah-3 in North Waziristan district.
“With these detections, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 23, including 15 cases from KP, six from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” the statement noted.
“Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under five during each campaign, alongside timely completion of all routine immunisations. Despite significant progress, the continued detection of polio cases, particularly in Southern KP, remains a serious concern,” as per the statement.
The statement noted that children in hard-to-access areas and those with low vaccine acceptance continue to be at risk, adding that the national and provincial Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) are taking all possible measures to ensure the implementation of high-quality vaccination campaigns.
It added that the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication has developed a vaccination campaign scheduled for the upcoming low transmission season. The first campaign of the season will be conducted from September 1 to 7, while in southern KP, the campaign will commence on September 15, targeting more than 28 million children under the age of five.
“The aim is to ensure that every child in these districts is vaccinated against polio as part of ongoing efforts to rapidly strengthen immunity and address existing protection gaps,” the statement said, urging parents and caregivers to ensure their children receive the polio vaccine during the campaign as well as the upcoming ones.
“Polio eradication is a shared responsibility. While frontline health workers continue to deliver critical vaccines to children, parents and caregivers play an important role by ensuring their children receive all recommended doses of the polio vaccine and complete their routine immunisations,” according to the statement.
“Communities can protect their children by actively supporting vaccination efforts, countering misinformation, and encouraging others to vaccinate.”
Last week, two new poliovirus cases were reported involving a six-year-old girl from KP’s Kohistan district and a 21-month-old girl from Sindh’s Badin.
Earlier this month, poliovirus was found in 36 per cent of samples across 87 nationwide districts tested in July.</p><small>2025-08-26 08:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261210129f79128.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937337/ngumoha-in-dream-premier-league-debut-with-late-winner-for-liverpool-at-newcastle' target='_blank'><strong>Ngumoha in dream Premier League debut with late winner for Liverpool at Newcastle</strong></a><br><p>The absent Alexander Isak dominated the build-up to Newcastle United’s clash at home to Liverpool but the Swede was temporarily forgotten in a rip-roaring contest that ended 3-2 to the reigning champions thanks to a stoppage-time winner by teenaged Premier League debutant Rio Ngumoha.
Isak’s desire to leave Newcastle, with Liverpool his destination of choice, guaranteed a boisterous St James’ Park atmosphere and it seemed Arne Slot’s visitors had buckled as they threw away a flattering 2-0 lead against a side reduced to 10 men by Anthony Gordon’s red card in first-half stoppage time.
But 16-year-old Ngumoha broke Newcastle’s hearts shortly after coming off the bench, thrashing in the winner with a first-time right-foot shot in the 10th minute of stoppage time to become Liverpool’s youngest ever scorer and the fourth youngest in Premier League history.

It was a sickening blow for Newcastle who were again without outcast striker Isak, but who began the game in superb fashion.
Even when the red mist and fate had dealt them multiple blows they still showed great resilience to fight back but it all counted for nothing in the end.
“We know there was a lot of oil on the fire this week to get Newcastle fired up,” Liverpool skipper Virgil van Dijk said.
“I enjoy these type of atmospheres, so I was really looking forward to it but we could’ve made it easier. We gave them the boost and the feeling and the drive with the fans behind them but we managed to get the three points and move on.”
Liverpool had been forced to soak up Newcastle pressure for half an hour and had made little headway but took the lead completely against the run of play when Ryan Gravenberch cut in from the left and dispatched a low shot just inside Nick Pope’s post in the 35th minute.
Rash tackle
Newcastle’s frustration got the better of Gordon who was sent off in first-half stoppage time for a rash tackle that left stud marks on the back of van Dijk’s calf — his initial yellow card being upgraded to a red by referee Simon Hooper.
And when Hugo Ekitike, who Newcastle had wanted to sign possibly as a replacement for Isak, struck 20 seconds after the break with the sort of clinical side-foot finish that makes you wonder whether Liverpool even require more strikers, it looked all over for the hosts.
It was a curiously lethargic display by Liverpool though with Mohamed Salah unusually quiet and when Bruno Guimaraes headed past Alisson in the 57th minute the noise levels rose and Newcastle were re-energised.
Liverpool completely lost control of the game and were punished in the 88th minute as William Osula seized on defensive hesitation to nip onto a long punt forward by Pope and slot a close-range finish past Alisson.
Despite being a man down and suffering injuries to Sandro Tonali, Joelinton and Fabian Schar it looked like Newcastle might grab an unlikely win but Ngumoha struck in fairytale fashion to make it two wins from two games for Liverpool.
They join Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur on six points while Newcastle, who will be desperate to settle the Isak saga before the closure of the transfer window next week, have one point from their opening two games.
“Second half we had a mountain to climb at 2-0 down with 10 men but I thought we controlled the game,” Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said.
“I thought we were really good and fought our way back unbelievably well but couldn’t get over the line.”
Howe opted not to comment on reports that Newcastle’s Saudi hierarchy had flown in for talks with Isak in a bid to resolve a saga that has been running since Liverpool had a bid of more than 100 million pounds ($135.09 million) rejected for the player who has scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League games for Newcastle.
“We hope that we can bring players in,” Howe said.
“We have been trying throughout the window, especially in the forward positions.”</p><small>2025-08-26 07:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/261035411672222.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937304/punjab-govt-opposition-spar-over-cm-maryams-japan-tour' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt, opposition spar over CM Maryam’s Japan tour</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government and opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have been wrangling over “exorbitant spendings, chartered jet and private persons in the delegation” of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s Japan’s five-day tour.
Ms Nawaz concluded her Japan visit on Monday and reached Thailand. Questions are also being raised on social media regarding CM Maryam’s ‘official visit’ to Japan, in which ‘private individuals’, including her family members, as also a part.
It is being argued that even if such participants claim to bear their own expenses, the practice undermines the sanctity of official delegations and blurs the line between state affairs and personal interests.
Questions are also being raised on social media platforms over the inclusion of private persons as part of her visit, causing a huge sum of money to the exchequer.

Entourage comes under scrutiny; PTI’s Waqas claims bank borrowing spent on excursion; Azma says PTI will consume in its own frustration

Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari, who is also part of the CM delegation to Japan, rejected a list of the ‘participants’ of the CM’s visit circulating on social media, calling it “a pack of lies“.
 






She said Pakistan and Japan were entering a new era of diplomatic cooperation, but certain anti-national elements were trying to malign this relationship with disinformation and propaganda.
“For the first time, a woman CM made a ‘historic’ visit to Japan and the malicious campaign against this milestone is nothing short of a shameful act of hostility against the country’s progress. The individuals (the Sharif family members and its friends) mentioned in the
social media list were not part of the ‘official government delegation’. Only officially nominated delegates had their expenses covered by the government, while all others covered their own costs privately,” she said.
Ms Bokhari said those pained by Pakistan’s cooperation with Japan in urban development, technology, and youth skills enhancement must accept that the nation is moving forward. “The opposition PTI has nothing to offer except falsehood and propaganda. Just like in the past, it will continue to consume in its own frustration,” she added.
 






On the other hand, the PTI strongly criticised Maryam Nawaz for her foreign trip to Japan, demanding full disclosure of public funds ‘squandered’ on the tour.
“What did Punjab really gain from Maryam Nawaz’s Japan visit? Questions persist over public spending, use of a chartered jet, and the actual outcomes beyond photo optics and promises,” it asked.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram termed Maryam’s trip a “wasteful” excursion at the expense of the poor nation’s hard-earned money, undertaken when the country was navigating its ‘worst-ever’ economic crisis.
 






He pointed out that as per the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Punjab government borrowed a staggering Rs405 billion in just first 38 days of the current fiscal year 2025-26 (July 1 to August 8), which were not utilised for any public welfare rather wasted on foreign trips, lavish advertisements, and political image-building.
“The people of Pakistan demand a full and transparent disclosure of how much has been spent on these useless advertisements and foreign excursions. The ‘fake’ CM Punjab must clarify whether her Japan trip, along with dozens of cronies, family members and sycophants, was paid from her personal pocket or from the funds of the Punjab and federal governments,” he said.
Analyst Imtiaz Gul said on X: “Massive advertisement campaign on @MaryamNSharif Japan visit: Isn’t it an affront to the poor of Punjab? Has she conquered Japan? Do donors ask about the rationale of the precious funds being spent on personal projection?”
 






Earlier, a local TV channel, citing official documents, had claimed that the Punjab government allocated Rs160 million for the CM ’s Japan trip which included expenses for luxury hotel stays in Japan and Bangkok, luxury cars for transport and diplomatic gifts.
Political observers are of the view that foreign visits by elected leaders should strictly focus on advancing provincial and national interests through professional representation, rather than projecting political families. They warn that such practices not only set a poor precedent but also raise concerns of nepotism, misuse of protocol, and dilution of credibility in the eyes of international counterparts.

The Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex were down about 0.7pc each at 24,787 and 81,028.63 points, respectively, as of 10:39am IST (10:09am PKT).
The benchmarks traded little changed for the month, on top of a nearly 3pc drop in July.
Fifteen of the 16 major sectors traded lower on the day. The broader mid-caps and small-caps declined about 1pc each.
Indian exports will face US duties of up to 50pc — among the highest imposed by Washington — after President Donald Trump announced extra tariffs as a punishment for New Delhi’s increased purchases of Russian oil earlier in August.
“While this is sentimentally negative for the market, we do not expect deeper correction from hereon as it is not shocking news,” said Pankaj Pandey, head of retail research at ICICI Securities.
Reliance Industries, the heaviest-weighted stock on the Nifty 50, fell about 1pc. Heavyweight financials fell 1.1pc and pharma stocks were down 1.4pc.
Shares of textile, chemicals and shrimp companies also inched lower as these sectors are expected to be hit the most from US tariffs.
“We are likely to see a sector/stock specific market going ahead as export-oriented stocks may remain under pressure due to tariff overhang, while domestic themes could gain traction on consumption boost,” Pandey said.
Consumer stocks were up 0.3pc on Tuesday, the sole gainer among 16 major sectors.
Among other stocks, telecom operator Vodafone Idea slumped 10pc as multiple reports said the government was not considering additional relief on pending dues.</p><small>2025-08-26 05:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620435-pm-shehbaz-lauds-uaes-outgoing-ambassadors-role-in-bolstering-bilateral-ties' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz lauds UAE outgoing ambassador's role in bolstering bilateral ties</strong></a><br><p>
