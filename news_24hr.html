FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi made the statement while responding to a question during his weekly press briefing.
Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year.
During Thursday’s press briefing, the FO spokesperson was asked about civilian casualties in the strikes, the total number of terrorists killed, and the locations of the camps targeted.
In his response, he said, “Let me begin by reiterating that the intelligence-based selective targeting of these seven terrorist camps and their hideouts in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, was primarily to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions”.
Andrabi stressed that the strikes were “proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence and were directed solely against identified terrorist camps and hideouts”.
“We exercised utmost caution to prevent any harm to civilians,” the spokesperson said.
He recalled statements made by the UN Security Council in reaction to terrorist attacks against Pakistan, with the latest being about the February 6 attack on an imambargah in Islamabad.
The spokesperson maintained that the UNSC had “repeatedly underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, abettors, sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”.
He further added that the UNSC had also urged states to cooperate with Pakistan in the matter, stressing that Pakistan’s actions must be viewed through the above-mentioned context.
He said that Pakistan “remained committed to peace in the region” and called on the Afghan Taliban government to “comply with these obligations”.
However, FO maintained that Pakistan would take “all necessary measures in the exercise of the right to self-defence against terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan”.
Responding to the third part of the question regarding the location of the terrorist camps, the spokesperson recalled the Feb 21 statement issued by the Ministry of Information in the aftermath of the strikes and said he had “nothing to further add in terms of either the location or numbers of terrorists killed”.
During the briefing, the FO spokesperson was also asked about India’s response to the strikes, specifically the statement issued by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), wherein it had condemned Pakistan for the move.
The FO spokesperson said that Pakistan “rejected” the statement and maintained that the statement vindicated Pakistan’s stance that “India continues to aid and abet terrorism” in the country through its support for Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other terrorist organisations in the region.
The spokesperson further said that Pakistan held “concrete evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring and abetting terrorism”.
The spokesperson maintained that the statement issued by the MEA and another issued after the recent spate of attacks in Balochistan, “reinforce this conclusion”.
“These statements provide additional evidence, circumstantial evidence, of India’s complicity in promoting terrorism in Pakistan,” FO said.
He maintained that the message that Pakistan “will respond swiftly, strongly in exercise of our right to self-defence” had been put across “through all international stakeholders”.
He reiterated Pakistan’s demand for action against “terrorist outfits operating with impunity and with freedom from Afghan soil”.
In response to another question, the FO spokesperson also said that he was not aware of “any structured dialogue” between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Asked if Qatar was playing any diplomatic role between the two countries, given the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to Doha, the FO spokesperson said: “On the role of Qatar, the issue may have come up in a broader context”.
Referring to PM Shehbaz’s recent meeting with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, he said that the two leaders exchanged views on regional and national developments, emphasising the importance of dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful resolution of disputes.
“To that extent, of course, we would welcome Qatar’s role in settling all these issues, including Afghanistan,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-26 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653080-opposition-accepts-govts-offer-to-hold-negotiations-amid-deadlock-over-imrans-eye-treatment' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition accepts govt's offer to hold negotiations amid deadlock over Imran's eye treatment</strong></a><br><p>

The two countries will also pursue joint development, production, and transfer of technology in defence, Modi said at the end of his two-day trip aimed at strengthening ties with Israel.
Modi said Tel Aviv and New Delhi agreed there was “no place for terrorism in the world”.
“India and Israel are clear that there is no place for terrorism in the world, in any form… We will oppose it shoulder to shoulder. We will always oppose it in the future,” Modi said at a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
“Humanity must never become a victim of conflict,” he added.







Following their meeting, Netanyahu’s office said the “two leaders will sign a series of agreements between Israel and India in economic, security, and diplomatic fields”.
Separately, Modi said he and Israeli President Isaac Herzog held “extremely fruitful and wide-ranging” talks.







In his post on X, which included Hebrew and Hindi translations, Herzog said, “The people of Israel and India are stronger together.”
“Fully agree with you, President Herzog,” Modi replied.
“It was a delight to meet you and discuss diverse aspects of the India-Israel friendship. There is immense scope in futuristic areas such as technology, innovation, startups and more,” he added.







Talks opened in New Delhi on Monday for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s government said in a statement, noting that merchandise trade reached $3.62 billion in 2024-2025.
Modi landed on a two-day visit to Israel on Wednesday, drawing sharp criticism at home.
He addressed the Israeli parliament, where he affirmed that India stands “firmly” with Israel.
While Modi did not explicitly mention the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in Gaza by Israel’s offensive, he said that India “supports all efforts that contribute to durable peace and regional stability”.
Days ago, Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus and unnamed Arab, African, and Asian countries as part of a “hexagon of alliances” against “radical axes” of Muslim nations.</p><small>2026-02-26 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26163235b369813.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975874/iran-us-hold-talks-in-geneva-in-push-to-avert-war' target='_blank'><strong>Iran, US hold talks in Geneva in push to avert war</strong></a><br><p>Iran and the United States held talks in Switzerland on Thursday, in a last-ditch bid to avert war under the shadow of the biggest American military build-up in the Middle East in decades.
The Oman-mediated discussions follow repeated threats from Donald Trump to strike Iran, with the US president last Thursday giving Tehran 15 days to reach a deal.
The US and Iranian delegations arrived at the venue at the Omani ambassador’s residence amid tight security, following a protest by Iranian exiles at their talks last week who threw objects at the Iranian motorcade.







Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi confirmed that discussions had begun, saying the two sides expressed “unprecedented openness to new and creative ideas and solutions”.
He later said the talks had been paused but would resume later in the day.







Iran’s president insisted ahead of the talks that the Islamic republic was not “at all” seeking a nuclear weapon.
“Our Supreme Leader has already stated that we will not have nuclear weapons at all,” President Masoud Pezeshkian said, in a reference to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
United Nations nuclear chief Rafael Grossi would likely also attend the discussions in Geneva, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman said.
While Iran has insisted the talks focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants Tehran’s missile programme and its alleged support for militant groups in the region curtailed.
As part of the dramatic US build-up, the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, sent to the Mediterranean this week, left a naval base in Crete Thursday, an AFP photographer said.
The developments follow massive protests in Iran that rights groups say saw thousands of demonstrators killed after the movement called for the end of the Islamic republic.
Trump makes case for invasion of Iran
In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”, though Tehran has always insisted its programme is for civilian purposes.
Trump also claimed Tehran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”.
The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”.







The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed.
However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000km — less than a third of the distance to the continental United States.
Trump’s State of the Union accusations in Congress were delivered in the same forum in which then-president George W. Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

 

Ahead of Thursday’s talks, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Iran must also negotiate on its missile programme, calling Tehran’s refusal to discuss ballistic weapons “a big, big problem”.
He followed up by saying that the “president wants diplomatic solutions”.
But US Vice President JD Vance told Iran to take Trump’s threats “seriously”, saying the US president had a “right” to use military action.
“You can’t let the craziest and worst regime in the world have nuclear weapons,” Vance told ‘America’s Newsroom’ on Fox News.







‘People would suffer’
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation at the talks, had called them “a historic opportunity”, adding that a deal was “within reach”.
The US will be represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka.
The two countries held talks earlier this month in Oman, then gathered for a second round in Geneva last week.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
In January, Tehran launched a crackdown on nationwide protests that have posed one of the greatest challenges to the Islamic republic since its inception.
Protests have since resumed around Iranian universities.
Tehran residents who spoke to AFP were divided as to whether there would be renewed conflict.
“There would be famine and people would suffer a lot. People are suffering now, but at least with war, our fate might be clear,” 60-year-old homemaker Tayebeh said.</p><small>2026-02-26 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/261625065dc685c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975899/3-european-countries-pakistan-agree-on-promoting-legal-pathways-to-counter-illegal-migration-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>3 European countries, Pakistan agree on promoting legal pathways to counter illegal migration: Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Three European countries — Italy, Spain and Greece — and Pakistan reached a consensus on Thursday to promote legal pathways to “effectively combat illegal migration”, according to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
The consensus was reached at a four-nation conference in Rome, Naqvi said in a post on social media platform X, adding that ministers from Italy, Spain and Greece attended the meeting.







“Productive meeting in Rome with my counterparts from Italy, Spain and Greece at the four-nation conference on curbing illegal migration.
“Pakistan, Italy, Spain and Greece agreed on a coordinated strategy against illegal migration, human smuggling and narcotics, including a joint policy framework and rapid-response mechanism,” he said.
The interior minister added that a consensus was also reached at the conference on “promoting legal pathways to effectively counter illegal migration [and] repatriation of criminals to face the law”.
“European partners appreciated Pakistan’s strong actions, noting a 47 per cent reduction in illegal migration, and agreed on enhanced European Union-supported capacity building,” he said.
Separately, a statement by the interior ministry also said that the three European countries endorsed Naqvi’s proposal of establishing legal pathways as a strategy to combat illegal migration and human smuggling during the conference.
Italy’s Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, Spain’s Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska and Greece’s Migration Minister Athanasios Plevri agreed that creating regulated legal channels for migration was the “most effective way to dismantle the networks of human smugglers and discourage dangerous irregular journeys”.
Agreeing with Naqvi’s proposal to curb illegal migration through legal pathways, they also decided to “extend full support” to Pakistan for capacity building via the European Union.
The participants also agreed to adopt a “coordinated strategy at all levels to combat illegal migration”, and a joint policy framework was finalised to counter illegal migration, human smuggling and narcotics trafficking.
Moreover, it was agreed that criminals involved in “serious offences” would be repatriated from Europe to Pakistan to face legal proceedings, the interior ministry’s statement said.
The four ministers emphasised the need for strengthening coordination and enhancing a joint and rapid response mechanism to curb illegal migration, the statement said, adding that they also decided to hold the next meeting in Pakistan later this year.
The statement quoted Naqvi as telling the European ministers that mafias involved in illegal migration had been brought under the law.
He noted that Europe was one of the most affected regions by illegal migration and stressed that a coordinated mechanism could effectively address this challenge.
The three European countries also “appreciated Pakistan’s efforts for curbing illegal migration and lauded the 47 per cent reduction” in such cases, the statement said.
It quoted the Italian minister as saying that “Pakistani institutions have taken excellent steps” against illegal migration. Meanwhile, the Spanish minister commended the “exemplary actions taken under Naqvi’s leadership”, the statement said.</p><small>2026-02-26 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/261749305005381.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975907/unbeaten-south-africa-thrash-west-indies-in-t20-world-cup-statement-win' target='_blank'><strong>Unbeaten South Africa thrash West Indies in T20 World Cup statement win</strong></a><br><p>South Africa captain Aiden Markram led from the front with an unbeaten 82 as South Africa all but secured a T20 World Cup semi-final berth with a brutal nine-wicket thrashing of the West Indies in Ahmedabad on Thursday.
After the West Indies fought back from deep trouble at 83-7 to post 176-8, Markram and Quinton de Kock put on 95 for the first wicket to set the platform for a thumping victory.
South Africa raced to their target with 23 balls to spare, scoring 177-1. Ryan Rickleton was not out on 45 at the end.
They are the only unbeaten side in the tournament, having also dismantled pre-tournament favourite India by 76 runs in the Super Eights.
An India win against Zimbabwe in Chennai later on Thursday will guarantee South Africa’s progress to the last four.
It will also make India’s clash against the West Indies in Kolkata on Sunday a winner-takes-all decider for the final semi-final berth.
Markram reached fifty off 27 balls and hit four sixes and seven fours.
De Kock scored 47 off 24 balls, with four sixes and Rickleton hit two sixes in his 28-ball knock in an utterly dominant display of batsmanship.
The West Indies has earlier needed a record eighth-wicket partnership by Romario Shepherd and Jason Holder to get to 176-8 afer an early collapse.
The pair came together with their team in deep trouble at 83-7 and put on 89, the highest eighth-wicket stand in the history of T20 internationals.
Shepherd was unbeaten on 52 off 37 balls with four sixes. Holder was run out off the penultimate ball of the innings for 49 off 31 balls with three maximums.
Both teams came into the match with a perfect five wins in the T20 World Cup so far.
South Africa have played four of their five matches in Ahmedabad and captain Aiden Markram had no hesitation in opting to bowl when he won the toss.
The West Indies took 17 off the first over, bowled by left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.
Kagiso Rabada’s introduction halted their charge as captain Shai Hope (16) edged his second ball to keeper Quinton de Kock.
Shimron Hetmyer was dropped at mid-on by Corbin Bosch off the next delivery, but lasted only two more when he miscued to midwicket, where Maharaj snapped up the catch.
Lungi Ngidi got in the act in his first over when Brandon King on 21 edged to De Kock and two balls later Roston Chase chopped on.
From 29-0 after two overs, the West Indies had slumped to 43-4 after four. Ngidi took 3-30 from his four overs, Rabada 2-2 and Bosch 2-31.</p><small>2026-02-26 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/261713431bf863c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975904/breathe-pakistan-partners-with-alertli-to-strengthen-citizen-led-climate-reporting' target='_blank'><strong>Breathe Pakistan partners with Alertli to strengthen citizen-led climate reporting</strong></a><br><p>Breathe Pakistan, a flagship climate change awareness initiative by DawnMedia, has partnered with Alertli, a socially intelligent platform powered by voice and location-based artificial intelligence (AI), to strengthen citizen-led climate reporting and resilience efforts across Pakistan.
According to a press release issued on Thursday, the collaboration will enable citizens to report climate-related incidents in real time, including urban flooding after heavy rainfall, heat-related emergencies, weather-induced road blockages, and climate-linked property damage.
The statement said these reports will contribute to a broader national framework for climate awareness and preparedness “at a time when rising temperatures and increasingly extreme weather events are placing unprecedented strain on urban infrastructure, public health systems, and everyday mobility”.
It added that under the partnership, Alertli will serve as an “official citizen-reporting tool across Breathe Pakistan’s platforms”.
User-submitted reports will be analysed using AI to generate structured, actionable insights, helping surface on-ground realities, identify emerging climate patterns, and strengthen data-driven climate discourse, the statement said.
A spokesperson for Breathe Pakistan said the partnership reflected the initiative’s continued commitment to meaningful public engagement.
“Climate resilience depends on timely information and active participation. By bringing together credible media, technology, and citizen voices, this collaboration helps translate lived experiences into knowledge that can inform awareness, response, and long-term preparedness,” the spokesperson said.
Meanwhile, a representative for Alterli said that critical reporting played a critical role in understanding climate impacts.
“When individuals share what they witness and experience, those realities become data. This initiative transforms everyday observations into actionable insights that can support more informed climate responses,” the representative said.
The statement further said that beyond real-time reporting, the partnership reinforces Breathe Pakistan’s broader mission to drive practical climate solutions.
It went on to say that the partnership complements existing efforts such as carbon footprint tracking tools and national climate change conferences that convene policymakers, experts, businesses, and communities to move from conversation to action.
“Together, Breathe Pakistan and Alertli aim to position Pakistan at the forefront of citizen-powered, AI-supported approaches to climate resilience, demonstrating how media and technology can work in tandem to build a more informed and prepared society,” the statement concluded.</p><small>2026-02-26 12:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26160819e1a8318.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975900/punjab-cm-launches-e-taxi-scheme-says-initiative-part-of-efforts-for-establishing-e-mobility-ecosystem' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM launches e-taxi scheme, says initiative part of efforts for establishing ‘e-mobility ecosystem’</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Thursday launched an e-taxi scheme in the province, saying that the initiative was part of the government’s efforts to establish an “e-mobility ecosystem”.
At a ceremony held for the scheme’s inauguration, the Punjab chief minister announced that around 1,100 e-taxies will be provided under the scheme at a subsidised rate, with a 30 per cent quota reserved for women.
“Punjab has become the first province to launch an e-taxi scheme, the first of its kind, not only for the environment, but it will also open up employment opportunities,” the chief minister said while addressing the ceremony.
“I am happy that over 30 pc of the scheme’s beneficiaries are women,” the chief minister added.

 


CM Maryam maintained that the initiative was a part of the government’s efforts to establish an “e-mobility ecosystem”.
“We have green buses as well — an example for the rest of the country,” she said, outlining plans to expand the service to “all 148 tehsils of Punjab”.
Turning her attention back to the e-taxis, the chief minister said that the government was providing “a subsidy of up to Rs4 billion on these 1,100 cars”.
She further announced that out of the 30pc down payment required, the Punjab government would cover 15pc.
“You can take this car home for Rs690,000 today,” she added, gesturing to the pink and green taxis lined behind her.
CM Maryam also announced that “for women, the government will bear 60pc of the downpayment cost”.
“Within the next 48 hours, you will see these e-taxis on the roads of Lahore and other districts in Punjab,” the chief minister added.
Separately, in a post on X, the Transport and Mass Transit Department of Punjab said, with the newly launched scheme, the government was “marking a major step towards clean mobility, employment generation, and inclusive transport opportunities”.






</p><small>2026-02-26 11:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26153237838100e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975894/how-job-design-improves-happiness-and-productivity' target='_blank'><strong>How job design improves happiness and productivity</strong></a><br><p>Have you ever come home from work feeling completely drained, even though you didn’t do anything physically exhausting? Surprisingly, this feeling is often less about the amount of work we do and more about the nature of the work and the structure of our jobs.
In today’s world, most people spend nearly a third of their lives at work. Yet many jobs are structured in ways that leave people bored, stressed, or disconnected. It is understandable that jobs needn’t be fun, but they also don’t need to be frustrating.
Even when people choose careers that they are passionate about, many gradually lose that passion and end up leaving the very jobs they once worked day and night for.
This often happens because of how jobs are structured, how tasks are organised, and whether people feel they have control and meaning in their work. All of this affects employee productivity and happiness.
Consider a job in which someone performs the same task every day, such as working in a print shop or performing desk work with minimal interaction. By contrast, consider someone who works in the same office but has the opportunity to handle customers, collaborate with colleagues, and help resolve issues.
Although both roles are in the same office, the second feels more engaging because it offers greater variety and responsibility. The difference lies in the job design.
Job design essentially involves organising duties, responsibilities, and decision-making processes within a workplace. Workplace satisfaction depends on these fundamental aspects, which, when met, enhance a sense of fulfilment at work. Incorporating a variety of daily tasks helps prevent monotony.
Recognising the importance of the work being performed contributes to overall job satisfaction. And finally, the freedom to make decisions rather than being told what to do at every step. This, along with regular feedback, will significantly improve employee productivity and overall well-being.
These simple elements might seem small or even obvious, but if no conscious effort is made to ensure their presence, work quickly becomes draining and irrelevant. When they are present, even demanding jobs begin to feel meaningful and worthwhile. When work engages our minds, it naturally becomes less tiring.
People seldom experience burnout simply from working hard. Instead, burnout occurs when their efforts seem futile or when they have little control over their tasks. Many assume that salary is the biggest factor in job satisfaction.
Of course, fair pay is necessary, but beyond meeting the basic needs, money doesn’t guarantee anything. That’s why many people earning high salaries feel dissatisfied with their lives and work.
Good job design is not just about employee well-being. It is also beneficial for the organisation. When employees feel connected to their work, they put in genuine effort to complete the task rather than merely doing the minimum.
Reflect on the last time you exerted yourself at work or observed a colleague do so. Then, revisit the effort you’re currently putting in to identify any changes. Is it the nature of the job, or is there another reason?
To implement the improvements, organisations need to make minor changes to their processes. They should rotate jobs among employees whenever possible and allow staff to engage in creative work rather than perform repetitive, monotonous tasks. Additionally, they need to avoid micromanaging and trust that their employees will complete the task.
If organisations want to grow, they need to consider how to better treat their employees to unlock their full potential, rather than focusing solely on keeping them in the office for long hours and making them work.
Ultimately, job design is not just a management concept. It is closely tied to mental well-being. Work that allows people to use their abilities, make decisions, and see the impact of their efforts supports both productivity and emotional health.
Here is something to consider. If work often feels exhausting or uninspiring, ask yourself whether the issue lies not in how hard you work, but in how your work is structured. And if you are in a position to influence others’ work, consider how small changes could help people feel more valued and motivated.
Work will always be part of life. The real challenge is ensuring that it supports well-being rather than depleting it.
Perhaps the next step is to initiate conversations in workplaces about designing jobs that not only get work done but also help people feel engaged while doing so.

At the outset of the meeting, Syed Aminul Haque, the committee chairman, noted that there were reports regarding the firewall. Meanwhile, Sadiq Memon called for a briefing on this system and its utility for the nation. He also enquired about the difference between an internet firewall and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority’s Web Monitoring System (WMS).
Information Technology Secretary Zarar Hashim Khan denied that any such system had been dismantled.
“The PTA’s WMS is fully operational,” Khan said, adding that neither a firewall nor the WMS had caused any delay in internet services.
After the initial briefing by the IT secretary, the floor was given to PTA Chairman Hafeezur Rehman, who clarified that the word firewall was a colloqial term for the WMS, adding that it had been in place in Pakistan since 2006.
“This system has been upgraded four times, with the most recent upgrade carried out in 2023,” he said. The PTA chairman said that like firewalls, the WMS was meant to provide security for digital connectivity in the country.
He informed the committee that the WMS was installed to eradicate grey traffic in telephony, block social media platforms, and illegal websites within the country’s jurisdiction.
“Our digital borders must also be protected,” the PTA chairman said, adding that cyberattacks originating from India were thwarted during periods of heightened tension between the two countries.
“However, social media platforms are blocked on the directives by the government or under court orders,” he asserted.
Rehman further informed the committee that social media platforms had been blocked seven times so far on orders either from the government and or the court.
“But this does not mean that the internet speeds experience a slowdown or anything else happens due to the WMS,” he added.
The committee was told that regulatory mechanisms were in place to safeguard the national cyber infrastructure while ensuring continuity of telecom services, particularly ahead of the upcoming 5G rollout.
The committee was also briefed on preparations regarding the upcoming 5G spectrum scheduled for March 10. It was also told that all three telecom operators in the country — Jazz, Ufone and Zong — had expressed the will to participate.
The PTA chairman said that in the past 12 years, a total of four spectrum auctions had been held and the government had released 69 megahertz (MHz). He said that in the upcoming auction, 597 MHz was being offered and each participant had to obtain a minimum of 100 MHz each.
He added that the availability of more spectrum would not only help introduce 5G in Pakistan but also help improve and increase 4G coverage across the country.
Meanwhile, a senior official of the IT ministry told Dawn that the WMS was not designed to block any particular social media account and referred to the X account of PTI founder Imran Khan, highlighting that it continued to operate while the ex-premier was in prison.
“If the WMS could stop individual accounts, why did the government wait so long and finally approach the X management to block this account?” the official asked.
The development comes amid reports and speculation on social media regarding the government’s decision to shut down the so-called firewall ahead of the 5G spectrum auction.
In August 2024, after months of speculation about the installation of a so-called firewall that could be leading to internet disruptions, the country’s IT minister finally confirmed that the government was indeed upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.
Despite the rather ambiguous terminology used by Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja, this was the first time an official had acknowledged the government’s actions, which were blamed for everything from slow browsing speeds, the arbitrary blocking of social media platforms and WhatsApp connectivity issues on mobile data.
Up until then, official stakeholders — Khawaja’s ministry and the PTA — had either been feigning ignorance in response to public outcry and media queries, or claiming that the problems were because of telecom and internet service providers, or even Meta.</p><small>2026-02-26 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653066-indias-reaction-to-balochistan-attack-effectively-corroborates-pakistans-stance-fo' target='_blank'><strong>India's reaction to Balochistan attack ‘effectively corroborates' Pakistan's stance: FO</strong></a><br><p>

The Extraordinary Open-Ended Ministerial Meeting of the OIC Executive Committee is set to be held tonight in Jeddah.
It will “consider the illegal decisions of the Israeli occupation authorities aimed at expanding settlements, pursuing annexation, and attempting to impose Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied West Bank”, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
Dar was received at Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport by Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the OIC Ambassador Fawad Sher, Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmad Farooq, and Consul General in Jeddah Syed Mustafa Rabbani, FO said.







The meeting is taking place against the backdrop of the Israeli government approving a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the occupation of the territory in 1967.
The move is in violation of international law, which states that an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.
At the OIC session, FM Dar would share Pakistan’s perspective on the “latest illegal measures by Israel to convert areas of the Occupied West Bank into so-called ‘state land’”, FO said.

 

He would also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from OIC member states on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting, the FO statement said, adding that he would “undertake brief visits to the Holy Cities” as well.
The OIC — along with Pakistan, the Arab League and 20 other Muslim and European countries — have jointly condemned Israeli attempts aimed at the “unacceptable de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank.
Last week, 93 states — including the eight-nation Muslim bloc — and the European Union (EU) also slammed Tel Aviv’s move. They called for the immediate reversal of the Israeli annexation of West Bank.</p><small>2026-02-26 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26153233146c00a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975895/street-smart-new-zealand-can-topple-england-to-make-t20-world-cup-semis-coach' target='_blank'><strong>‘Street smart’ New Zealand can topple England to make T20 World Cup semis: coach</strong></a><br><p>New Zealand’s “street-smart” cricketers can find a way to beat England and guarantee their semi-final place at the T20 World Cup, coach Rob Walters said on Thursday.
A win for New Zealand in Friday’s Super Eights clash in Colombo will see them top Group 2 and join the already-qualified England in the final four.
A defeat would leave the door ajar for Pakistan to beat eliminated Sri Lanka on Saturday with the second semi-final berth then being decided on net run rate.

 

Mitchell Santner’s New Zealand were in trouble at 84-6 against Sri Lanka on Wednesday before the captain steered them to 168-7 and a thumping 61-run win which knocked out the co-hosts.
“I think if you look historically at the Black Caps, you would probably say that they’re a team that have been great problem solvers,” Walters told reporters.
“They are street smart; they find a way to understand the conditions quickly.
“It’s certainly something that we pride ourselves on. We can adapt to conditions quickly and find a method.”
England are the only team to secure a place in the semi-finals so far after skipper Harry Brook’s match-winning century against Pakistan.
New Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra is aware of England’s threat.
“You’re always confident going into these fixtures, especially when we know what the surface is going to be like,” said Ravindra, who took four wickets against Sri Lanka.
“But I think it’d be silly to underestimate England at any point,” he said.
“They’re obviously such a quality unit and they’ve shown this in how well they’ve been bowling. They’ve got world-class batters throughout their order.”</p><small>2026-02-26 10:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26134225f44c769.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975889/ihc-to-hear-imran-bushras-pleas-for-sentence-suspensions-in-ps190m-graft-case-on-march-11' target='_blank'><strong>IHC to hear Imran, Bushra’s pleas for sentence suspensions in £190m graft case on March 11</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) is set to hear former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi’s petitions seeking the suspension of their sentences in the £190 million corruption case on March 11.
A division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan resumed the case proceedings on Thursday.
During the hearing, the bench expressed displeasure as dozens of lawyers affiliated with PTI stood up and approached the rostrum simultaneously.
“What is this? Are you trying to influence the court?” the IHC chief justice asked.
Imran’s counsel, Barrister Salman Sardar, replied: “Not at all.”
He argued that the matter had assumed greater urgency in view of the former premier’s sudden eye ailment. He further submitted that Bushra Bibi, despite being a woman, was serving a seven-year sentence and that her petition for suspension of sentence had been fixed after six months.
“We request you to suspend the sentence. The last order was passed on November 9,” he contended.
Justice Dogar observed that most of the miscellaneous civil applications seeking early hearing had turned infructuous, but ordered that the office objections on the suspension petitions be overruled.
Barrister Sardar then requested the court to fix the petitions for hearing next week.
However, the chief justice directed the registrar’s office to fix both the petitions seeking suspension and the main criminal appeals on March 11 and adjourned the proceedings.
Separately, in a related development, IHC’s Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro removed office objections on the petitions seeking suspension of Imran and Bushra’s sentences in the Toshakhana 2.0 case.
The judge directed the registrar’s office to number the petitions as well as the appeals against the convictions of Imran and Bushra Bibi and fix them for hearing in accordance with court policy.
An Islamabad special court on Dec 20, 2025 sentenced the couple to a total of 17 years in the case, which pertained to the purchase of a Bulgari jewellery set — gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021 — at a throwaway price.
‘Delay’ in case proceedings
Imran — imprisoned since Aug 5, 2023 for concealing details of Toshakhana gifts — is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in the £190m case.
He was convicted in another Toshakhana case in December 2025 and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
On his behalf, Imran’s legal team has repeatedly approached the IHC for early fixation and decisions on the multiple cases pending before the court.
A day earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum had criticised the delay in the proceedings in cases pertaining to the PTI founder. “We come and sit in court for hours, but cases are not fixed,” she had said.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja also pointed out that contempt petitions filed against the Adiala jail administration over non-compliance with IHC orders allowing jail meetings were not heard.
He said the IHC had become a “closed door” for the party.

 

Also on Wednesday, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan lamented that the pleas regarding the suspension of sentence in the £190m Al-Qadir Trust case had been pending for over a year, even though such cases “should be decided within 35 and 60 days as per the Judicial Policy”.
In January, Imran’s counsel wrote to Justice Dogar, seeking consolidation of all cases pending against the ex-premier before the high court and requesting urgent hearings.
The letter had contended that repeated adjournments or delayed fixation had caused serious prejudice to Imran.
The PTI has also moved the Supreme Court, seeking the early fixing of the concealment of assets case and Imran’s treatment at a hospital of his choice.
The £190m corruption case
An accountability court in Islamabad had sentenced Imran and Bushra to 14 and seven years in prison, respectively, on Jan 17, 2025 in the £190m graft case, also known as the Al-Qadir Trust case.
Both had challenged their convictions before the IHC on January 27 that year.

 

The case alleges that the couple obtained billions of rupees and land worth hundreds of kanals from Bahria Town Ltd to legalise Rs50 billion identified and returned to the country by the United Kingdom during the PTI government.</p><small>2026-02-26 10:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653026-190m-case-ihc-fixes-imran-khan-bushra-bibis-pleas-for-hearing-on-march-11' target='_blank'><strong>£190m case: IHC fixes Imran, Bushra's pleas for suspension of sentences on March 11</strong></a><br><p>

The advance placed the index 2.59 per cent above its previous close of 164,626.29 points.
During trading, a total of 291 scrips advanced, 145 declined, and 131 remained unchanged from their previous close. A total of 355,320,144 shares were traded by market close.
The index touched an intraday low of 162,953.63 and a high of 169,374.27. The range reflected the elevated volatility that has persisted from earlier in the week into today’s trading.
According to Topline Securities, “as the session progressed, the tone changed”. The brokerage house noted that selling pressure eased, and buyers returned with renewed confidence, turning a tentative recovery into a broad-based rally.
The strong close suggested some improvement in investor sentiment. On Wednesday, the index had also staged an early rebound, but ultimately closed in the red, shedding 1,632.25 points, suggesting continued fragility.
Among the most actively traded stocks, Unity Foods Limited led volumes, declining 10.02pc to Rs11.85 on turnover of 71,443,224 shares. It was followed by Bank of Punjab, which gained 7.76pc to Rs31.81 on volume of 38,659,618 shares, and K-Electric Limited, up 1.43pc to Rs7.82 on 35,071,352 shares.

Peers across party lines pressed the Labour government to intensify diplomatic engagement with Islamabad and consider linking aid and trade to human rights benchmarks.
The issue was raised during oral questions led by Labour peer Baroness Alexander of Cleveden, who asked about discussions with the government of Pakistan regarding Imran’s incarceration.
Responding on behalf of the Foreign Office, Minister of State Baroness Chapman of Darlington reiterated that while Pakistan’s judicial processes are a matter for its own authorities, the UK had consistently raised concerns over fundamental rights.
“While Pakistan’s judicial processes are, of course, a matter for Pakistan, we are clear that the Pakistani authorities need to respect fundamental freedoms, including the right to a fair trial, due process, humane detention and access to appropriate medical treatment,” she said.
“This applies to Imran Khan as it does to all Pakistani citizens.”







The minister added that UK ministers and officials had “regularly raised” with their Pakistani counterparts the need to uphold Pakistan’s constitution and international human rights obligations, including in relation to Imran.
Family access and medical concerns
Several peers highlighted reports that Imran had been denied access to lawyers, family members and doctors, and was being held in solitary confinement.
Conservative peer Zac Goldsmith — also the former brother-in-law of Imran — described the situation as “an international outrage”, later writing on X that peers had urged the UK foreign minister to “step up”.
During the debate, he said: “We understand that Imran Khan has been denied access to lawyers, denied access to his family, including his two sons, denied access to doctors, and that he has been kept in solitary confinement, with his health deteriorating rapidly.”







Goldsmith asked whether the UK should reconsider its aid contribution to Pakistan, noting that it has often been among the top recipients of British assistance. He suggested that aid should be contingent on Islamabad demonstrating a clear commitment to the Commonwealth Charter, including judicial independence and the rule of law.
In response, Baroness Chapman said the UK maintained a consistent position that all prisoners should have access to healthcare and family visits, and that this message would continue to be conveyed to Islamabad.
On development spending, she noted that the UK had already reduced its aid budget by 40 per cent and that further announcements regarding country allocations would follow shortly.
Comparisons with other cases
The debate also touched on comparisons with other high-profile cases.
The minister drew a distinction between the case of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai and Imran, noting that Lai is a British citizen, giving the UK specific consular responsibilities that do not apply in the same way to foreign nationals.
Labour peer Lord Sikka said there was “very soft criticism” when authoritarian acts were committed by countries regarded as Britain’s trade and defence partners.
Arguing that the government possessed the tools to exert pressure on the country’s military leadership, he suggested ending aid and imposing trade sanctions. He asked what moral principle guided UK foreign policy in such cases, compared to its approach towards states such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea.
In response, Baroness Chapman said it would not be right to end all aid to Pakistan, stressing that such a move was not the government’s position.
She said British assistance addressed genuine need and supported UK interests, including cooperation on climate issues and counter-terrorism, which she described as “absolutely in the interest of our country”.
Crossbench peer Lord Shaffaq Mohammed referred to the case of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was allowed to travel to London for medical treatment in 2019 while serving a sentence in Pakistan.

 

He asked what the government’s response would be if Imran sought permission to travel to the UK for medical care. Baroness Chapman replied that any such request would fall under the jurisdiction of the Home Office and immigration authorities.
Conservative peer Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon asked whether the government could facilitate access for Imran’s sons to visit their father during medical treatment.
The minister said that, in principle, prisoners undergoing medical treatment should have access to family, but decisions relating to immigration and prison access ultimately rested with Pakistani authorities.
Military courts and trade ties
Concerns about Pakistan’s wider democratic trajectory and the role of the military also featured prominently.
Liberal Democrat peer Lord Purvis of Tweed said that several opposition figures had been prosecuted and sentenced following protests, and warned of “significant worry about the extent of state capture of the Pakistani economy by the military”.
He asked whether human rights would be explicitly integrated into the UK-Pakistan trade dialogue.
Baroness Chapman acknowledged “very real concerns” about the operation and transparency of military courts, and said that human rights were integral to the UK’s trading relationships.

 

“It would not be the right thing to do to end all aid to Pakistan,” she said.
“The need is there, British interests are there, and we work with Pakistan on counter-terrorism, which is absolutely in the interest of our country.”



Democracy and elections
The debate concluded with broader reflections on Pakistan’s political future.
Conservative peer Lord Hannan of Kingsclere said no British government could be indifferent to developments in Pakistan, describing it as a Commonwealth ally with 1.5 million Britons of Pakistani origin.
He argued that Pakistan would struggle to achieve stability and attract investment without the restoration of democratic norms.



Baroness Chapman said the UK had raised concerns about Pakistan’s 2024 elections and would continue to engage with Islamabad on inclusive politics and rule of law, while maintaining trade and development ties.
“There are many countries where we have concerns about rule of law and democracy and yet maintain close relationships,” she said, adding that Britain does not limit its foreign relations only to countries that mirror its own governance model.</p><small>2026-02-26 08:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26131334cb524eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975888/japan-births-fall-for-10th-straight-year' target='_blank'><strong>Japan births fall for 10th straight year</strong></a><br><p>The number of births in Japan fell for the 10th straight year in 2025, official data showed on Thursday, highlighting the challenges for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.
A total of 705,809 babies were born in Japan, the preliminary health ministry data showed, down 2.1 per cent from 2024.
The data includes births to Japanese nationals in Japan, foreign births in Japan and babies born to Japanese nationals overseas.
Meanwhile, 505,656 couples got married in 2025, up 1.1pc, while the number of divorces fell 3.7pc to 182,969 cases.
There were 1,605,654 deaths, down 13,030 or 0.8pc from 2024.
The internal affairs ministry estimated Japan’s overall population as of February at 122.86 million people, down 0.47pc, or 580,000, from a year ago.

 

The world’s fourth-biggest economy has one of the world’s lowest birth rates and a falling and ageing population.
This is leading to a host of problems, including labour shortages, a ballooning social security bill and fewer working people paying tax.
That in turn is adding to Japan’s huge debts. It already has the highest debt ratio among major economies.
Figures last year showed that the number of people aged 100 or older was almost 100,000, with close to 90pc of them women.
The shrinking population is also gutting rural communities. The number of abandoned homes in Japan is now around four million.
Over 40pc of municipalities risk extinction, according to a recent study.
Successive Japanese leaders — including Takaichi, the country’s first woman premier — have promised to increase births but with limited success.
Tokyo’s city government developed its own dating app which requires users to submit documentation proving they are single and to sign a letter stating they are willing to get married.
“The declining birth rate and shrinking population are a quiet state of emergency that will gradually erode our country’s vitality,” Takaichi said in parliament last week.
Takaichi’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won a two-thirds majority in February 8 snap elections.
Increasing immigration would help reverse Japan’s falling population and the associated problems in the labour market.
But under pressure from the “Japanese first” Sanseito party, the right-wing Takaichi has vowed tougher measures on immigration.
The government said on Thursday it is striving to build a stronger economy to reduce the economic burden of childcare for working families.
“I believe there were some successes. Unfortunately, however, we have not managed to reverse this trend (of falling births),” Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Masanao Ozaki told reporters.
“I believe (an important factor) is to achieve a strong economy,” Ozaki said.</p><small>2026-02-26 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/260947020dc3392.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975857/local-administration-imposes-section-144-12-hour-daily-curfew-in-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Local administration imposes Section 144, 12-hour daily curfew in South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>The district administration on Thursday imposed Section 144 in the districts of Upper South Waziristan and Lower South Waziristan due to rising security concerns and to facilitate the movement of logistics for security forces.
Officials said the move aims to ensure public safety, maintain law and order, and facilitate the uninterrupted operational movement of security personnel.
Upper South Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir confirmed that Section 144 has been enforced in the tehsils of Sarvekai and Sararogha from 6am to 6pm. During this period, all movement will be strictly prohibited, and all markets and commercial centres will remain closed.
The affected routes include Makin, Sararogha, Kot Kai and Spinkai Raghzai up to Nazar Khel. Additionally, the route from Dargai Bridge through Madi Jan, Sheen Warsak and Moley Khan Sarai to Chagmalai will also remain closed.
Officials said in the statement that residents have been instructed to stop their vehicles at least 50 metres before approaching security forces and to ensure that all passengers exit the vehicle if required. The DC emphasised that violators will be held personally accountable and that strict compliance with security directives is mandatory.
Meanwhile, Lower South Waziristan DC Musarat Zaman announced that Section 144 has also been enforced in various parts of Wana. The curfew, effective from 6am to 6pm, prohibits all non-essential movement. The measure comes in response to security threats and the movement of security forces.
Officials said that restricted routes include Wana, Tiarza Gate, Karb Kot, Tanai, and Azizabad Chowk up to Dargai Bridge. Movement is only allowed for emergency purposes with prior permission from police or security forces and submission of valid identification and travel documents.
The deputy commissioner urged citizens to strictly adhere to security instructions and avoid non-essential travel. Any violation will be the sole responsibility of the individual concerned, he said.
During the enforcement of Section 144 in both districts, only approved emergency movement will be permitted.
Citizens were advised to cooperate fully with security forces, remain patient, and avoid any activities that may compromise public safety. Markets, shops, and commercial centres will remain closed to maintain law and order.
Officials stressed that these measures were essential to maintain sustainable peace, support security operations, and ensure the safety of residents.
The South Waziristan region has seen a deteriorating security situation in the past few months, alongside a spike in terrorist activities across the province.
Earlier this month, Mehsud tribal elders and jirga members called on the Upper South Waziristan DC to highlight the lack of basic facilities and raise law and order concerns.
On Nov 10, 2025, the Cadet College in Lower South Waziristan’s Wana had come under attack by terrorists, who the government identified as Afghan nationals.
The attackers had targeted the college’s main gate and gained entry to the educational institution, but a timely response from security forces averted a major tragedy.
While all students and teachers were safely rescued and all terrorists holed up inside the building were killed, the clearance operation resulted in the martyrdom of three individuals.</p><small>2026-02-26 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653001-fcc-upholds-tax-officials-power-to-raid-premises-without-prior-notice' target='_blank'><strong>FCC upholds tax officials' power to raid premises without prior notice</strong></a><br><p>

Eyewitnesses reported that 10–12 armed men entered the mosque, held worshippers hostage, and abducted three brothers before fleeing to an unknown location.
The abducted individuals were identified as Saeed Akhtar, a clerk at the commissioner’s office, and Amjad and Hazratullah serving in the Wazir subdivision’s police force.
Police officials confirmed that the two abducted police personnel were later brutally killed and their bodies were dumped along Marwat Canal Road, while the third brother remains missing.
Local Chairman Masoom Wazir said he received information about two bodies and, upon reaching the site, found both victims covered in blood. The bodies were immediately taken to the District Headquarters Hospital.
RPO Bannu Sajjad Khan stated that the kidnappers were affiliated with a militant group and that a full-scale operation is underway against them. He vowed that the martyrs’ blood would not be in vain and that the perpetrators would be brought to justice at all costs.
He strongly condemned the terrorists for violating the sanctity of a mosque, describing it as a deeply tragic and reprehensible act.
The RPO added that terrorist elements have previously used mosques as hideouts, but police continue to carry out operations against such groups to ensure the protection of places of worship and the lives and property of citizens.
The senior police official stated that police and other security agencies are jointly conducting search operations at various locations to recover the third abducted individual. He urged the public to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement authorities immediately.
Funeral prayers offered for martyred policemen
Funeral prayers for the two martyred police personnel were offered with full state honours at the Police Lines in Bannu today, bringing the community together in grief and solidarity.
Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan, Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Faheem Khan, senior police and civil administration officials, along with a large number of police personnel and local residents, attended the funeral.

A guard of honour was presented to the martyrs on the occasion, while special prayers were also offered for the elevation of their ranks in honour of their sacrifice. Prayers were further offered for the safe and early recovery of their abducted brother, who remains missing.
Earlier on February 21, during an intelligence‑based operation in the district, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack.
The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack, prompting targeted operations.</p><small>2026-02-26 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2612242250128c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975884/karachi-atc-frames-charges-against-armaghan-co-accused-sheraz-in-mustafa-amir-murder-case' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi ATC frames charges against Armaghan, co-accused Sheraz in Mustafa Amir murder case</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Thursday framed charges against main suspect Armaghan Qureshi and co-accused Sheraz alias Shavez Bukhari in the Mustafa Amir murder case.
Amir, 23, was allegedly kidnapped and murdered by his friends — Armaghan and Sheraz — in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Jan 6, 2025. According to the police, the accused stuffed Amir’s body in the trunk of his car and torched it in the Hub area of Balochistan.
Both accused denied the charges before the court, which also summoned witnesses and adjourned the hearing until March 12.
A final charge sheet against Armaghan in the murder case was filed in August 2025.

 

In the document, Investigating Officer (IO) Muhammad Ali had said that the last known location of the victim and the two suspects was Armaghan’s house in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
The IO stated that blood collected from Armaghan’s house allegedly matched samples taken from the body recovered from the car in Hub.
The report claimed that CCTV footage had been recovered showing the individuals cleaning Mustafa’s bloodstains from a carpet.
In the wake of the murder, three junior police officers, including the Darakhshan station house officer (SHO), were suspended and demoted to lower ranks over their “unprofessional conduct” while probing the kidnapping and murder case.
However, then-Sindh inspector general Ghulam Nabi Memon had defended senior police officials responsible for the investigation, saying they did face certain “handicaps” due to a host of factors during the initial probe.
Last month, a Karachi judicial magistrate granted Armaghan post-arrest bail in a case involving an illegal call centre and credit card data theft.
Other cases
Besides the murder case, Armaghan is facing several other charges.
Armaghan had been implicated in a data theft case in a first information report (FIR) registered with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on April 16, 2025.

 

The case accused Armaghan of operating an “illegal call centre” in Karachi’s DHA, which was used for harassment, fraudulent activities, identity impersonation, cheating, spoofing, phishing, and extortion.
In July 2025, the IO of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed a judicial magistrate that Armaghan had rented two properties to set up call centres in Lahore and Islamabad after Amir’s murder.
Cases had previously been filed against him for injuring policemen during a February 2025 shoot-out that led to his arrest, as well as for the recovery of imported illegal weapons and money laundering.</p><small>2026-02-26 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699f69e4a5b0f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975757/several-coaches-locomotive-of-greenline-express-derail-in-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>Several coaches, locomotive of Greenline Express derail in Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: Several coaches and the locomotive of the empty rake of the Greenline Express train derailed a kilometre away from Rawalpindi Railway Station on Wednesday, apparently due to the poor condition of the track as described by railway officials.
The rake was on its way to the Margalla Railway Station in Islamabad to prepare for 6DN journey with passengers to Karachi when the locomotive and several coaches derailed. Except for the locomotive and two passenger coaches, the remaining coaches were put back on track and moved swiftly to Rawalpindi Railway Station from where Greenline Express departed for Karachi with a delay of half an hour.
The waiting passengers at the Margalla Railway Station were moved to Rawalpindi station by buses and coaches by the railway administration of Rawalpindi, for onward journey.
Divisional Superintendent of Pakistan Railways Nooruddin told Dawn that the cause of the derailment was apparently ‘weak track’ on this particular point located close to Bakery Chowk. The weak track of the mainline has raised concern over the poor maintenance of track being used for train and freight services.

The divisional superintendent further said the train service from Peshawar and Hazara to Rawalpindi remained unaffected in view of the dual track. Arrangements have been made to put the locomotive and two coaches back on track, he added.
Greenline Express is among the trains operating in the luxurious category in the Pakistan Railways system.It is a flagship rail of Pakistan Railways and is considered as the country’s most premium train service between Islamabad and Karachi operating on daily basis, offering luxury travel.
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Railways, at a meeting on Wednesday, expressed serious concern over the frequent train accidents reported during the past year.
Committee Chairman Senator Shahadat Awan observed that disciplinary action had largely been confined to train drivers, while no senior officers had been held accountable. He directed the railways ministry to ensure that all responsible officials are proceeded against in accordance with law.
Highlighting security gaps at railway stations and onboard trains, the chairman emphasised the need for comprehensive security arrangements in view of the upcoming festival of Eidul Fitr. The committee also sought an update on new recruitments aimed at strengthening the railway security wing. The chairman directed the DIG Railways to provide periodic briefings to the committee on theft cases and related preventive measures.
Taking note of concerns raised by Senator Rubina Khalid regarding inadequate train services in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the chairman directed the ministry to brief the committee in forthcoming meetings on consultations held with the provinces regarding the upgradation and expansion of the railway network. The ministry briefed the committee on budgetary allocations for new development schemes and apprised members of the projects completed by the ministry.
The committee was informed that the Main Line-1 (ML-1) project extended from Karachi to Peshawar, covering a total length of 1,726km.
Officials stated that approximately 70pc of the country’s population travelled through the ML-1 corridor. It was further informed that the track from Karachi to Lahore is double track, whereas the section from Lahore to Peshawar is single track. The committee was also informed that recent floods have caused significant damage to the railway infrastructure.
Senator Shahadat Awan directed the railways ministry to expedite the disposal of all pending matters of departmental committees on a priority basis and to submit a comprehensive report detailing disposed and pending audit paras.
He further instructed the ministry to furnish, within one month, a complete list of cases related to the National Accountability Bureau and the Federal Investigation Agency. The committee also sought details within three months regarding progress made in the vacation of encroached railway land.

Fortunately, no casualties were reported.
The incident occurred in the Miami Kabul Khel Dorazinda area of the Shewa tehsil. Government High School Shamazan Kot sustained extensive damage, with nearly 80 per cent of its structure reportedly reduced to rubble.
According to local sources, a powerful explosion was heard across the surrounding villages, triggering panic and fear among residents. However, the blast took place at night while the school was closed, ensuring that students and staff remained unharmed.
A senior district administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that an investigation has been launched to determine the exact nature and cause of the explosion. Authorities are collecting evidence from the site to ascertain whether it was a drone strike or another form of attack.
District police and security personnel have cordoned off the area and initiated a search operation. In an official statement, authorities said security around educational institutions would be further tightened, and emergency measures would be taken to rehabilitate and reconstruct the damaged school building.
Local residents expressed deep concern over the incident, particularly as schools across the region were due to reopen on March 1. Parents and students fear the attack may disrupt the fragile return to normalcy in the conflict-affected district.
“Education here is already struggling. If schools themselves are targeted, what future will our children have?” said an elderly tribal elder while speaking to this correspondent.
A parent of one of the students told Dawn that the government must not only ensure the immediate reconstruction of the school, but also establish lasting peace in the area so that children can pursue their education without fear.

 

Educational institutions in North Waziristan and adjoining tribal districts have previously been targeted in various incidents. In some cases, militant elements have blown up school buildings using explosive materials, while in others, structures have reportedly sustained damage during security operations.
Only a few weeks ago, another alleged drone strike in the same area left students and a teacher injured. Investigations into that incident are still underway.
While attacks targeting infrastructure are fairly common in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has also seen a rise in such incidents in recent months.
In May 2024, a private girls’ school in Shewa was also blown up by unidentified militants. Similar attacks also took place in May 2023 when two government schools for girls in Mirali were blown up. No loss of life was reported in the incidents.</p><small>2026-02-26 07:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652979-jailed-pti-leaders-urge-cjp-to-ensure-justice-is-done-in-imran-khans-medical-treatment' target='_blank'><strong>Jailed PTI leaders urge CJP to ensure 'justice is done' in Imran Khan's medical treatment</strong></a><br><p>

Gerald Brown, 65, was arrested in Indiana after having recently returned to the United States from China, where he had been since December 2023, a Justice Department statement said.
He is accused of having “conspired with foreign nationals to provide combat aircraft training to pilots in the Chinese Air Force” without a required license from the US State Department, the statement said.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Kash Patel posted on X: “Major story… the FBI and our partners have arrested a former US Air Force Pilot who was allegedly training pilots in the Chinese military.”







Brown had a 24-year career in the US Air Force during which he “commanded sensitive units with responsibility for nuclear weapons delivery systems, led combat missions, and served as a fighter pilot instructor and simulator instructor on a variety of fighter and attack aircraft”.
He had retired from the military in 1996 and worked as a cargo pilot, the statement said, but he later began a role as a US defence contractor training pilots to fly the A-10 and state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jets.
He allegedly began negotiating a contract in August 2023 with Stephen Su Bin — a Chinese national who was imprisoned in the United States for four years beginning in 2016 over another espionage scheme — and travelled in December 2023 to China to begin his training job.
“The Chinese government continues to exploit the expertise of current and former members of the US armed forces to modernise China’s military capabilities,” said Roman Rozhavsky, an official with the FBI’s Counterintelligence and Espionage Division.
“This arrest serves as a warning that the FBI and our partners will stop at nothing to hold accountable anyone who collaborates with our adversaries to harm our service members and jeopardise our national security,” he added.</p><small>2026-02-26 05:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652964-rising-gas-bills-experts-ask-pm-to-end-monopoly' target='_blank'><strong>Rising gas bills: Experts ask PM to end monopoly</strong></a><br><p>

The chief minister briefed the prime minister in detail on the progress of ongoing development initiatives in the province, a Prime Minister’s Office news release said.
The Sindh CM and several other leaders of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) have been demanding that the federal government initiate and complete mega infrastructure development projects in the province especially the much-needed Sukkar-Hyderabad Motorway (SHM), the only missing portion of motorways networks from Karachi to Peshawar and northern areas of the country.
Recently, PPP Senator Waqar Mehdi had expressed concern over what he called deteriorated condition of major roads in Sindh due to negligence of the federal government. 
He also demanded that the Centre immediately start the Sukkur-Hyderabad Moto­rway and long-delayed Jamshoro-Sehwan Indus Highway which was to be completed in 2017.
During the meeting with the Sindh CM, the prime minister said the federal government would extend all possible support to ensure early completion of projects in Sindh. 
He directed the relevant ministries to maintain close coordination with the provincial government to accelerate public welfare initiatives.
The PM said that the PPP was an important ally of the federal government and emphasised that national development could be further accelerated through cooperation among coalition partners.
He noted that harmony and consultation among allied parties were essential for national stability and continuity of policies.
Appreciating Sindh’s leadership as a key partner in the coalition government, the prime minister said strong coordination between the federation and provinces would strengthen the democratic system and help address public issues effectively.
Matters relating to Sindh’s political situation and other issues of mutual interest also came under discussion.
Members of the federal cabinet Ishaq Dar, Azam Nazeer Tarar, Ahsan Iqbal and Rana Sanaullah were also present.

The controversy over the provincial government’s newly acquired aircraft took centre stage as Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) MPA Shazia Abid questioned whether the Rs11 billion plane would be available for official visits to south Punjab.
Punjab Information Minister Azma Zahid Bukhari defended the purchase, stating that if PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari could use the Sindh government’s aircraft, the Punjab government was equally entitled to use its own plane as it deemed appropriate.
Opposition Leader Moin Riaz Qureshi demanded clarity that which budgetary head funded the aircraft purchase and whether it was bought for “Air Punjab” or exclusively for the chief minister. He termed the acquisition of a “luxury” jet unnecessary amid the economic challenges being faced by the country, triggering desk-thumping and sloganeering by other opposition members.
Government Chief Whip Rana Arshad hit back, asking why the opposition was objecting to the plane when chief ministers of other provinces also use official aircraft.
The House also witnessed sharp protests over the alleged arrest of nine opposition MPAs without the speaker’s permission. Opposition members claimed this violated parliamentary norms.
MPA Sardar Sarfraz Dogar alleged he was unlawfully detained for three days and later booked in a “false FIR,” calling it contempt of the assembly. He insisted that members could not be arrested without the speaker’s approval.
Treasury members responded by accusing the opposition of having double standards, referencing past arrests of political figures, including Maryam Nawaz and her father.
Earlier, responding to questions about the Information and Public Relations Department, Minister Azma Bukhari announced plans to purchase a new building,equipped with modern facilities, to consolidate all departmental offices under one roof.
She also addressed concerns over the Punjab Journalists Housing Foundation (PJHF), confirming that its office would soon be shifted from a rented building to a commercial space in “Press Club Society.”
On staffing reforms, the minister admitted that past recruitment in her department had been made without merit and announced the launch of a “restructuring drive” this year. “Only necessary positions will be retained; redundant seats will be abolished,” she said, adding that performance reviews would be conducted.
LAW AND ORDER: A general debate on law and order was initiated by Parliamentary Secretary Khalid Mahmood Ranjha, who claimed crime rate had declined across Punjab.
He highlighted a significant reduction in rape cases, recovery of illegal weapons and operations against the gangs in Katcha areas.
Opposition members disputed the government’s claims, alleging political victimisation and suppression.
Several legislative measures were also introduced in the House and all referred to relevant committees for two months. These included the Child Marriage Restraint Ordinance 2026; The Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property (Amendment) Ordinance 2026; Punjab Land Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 2026; The Punjab Public Utilities Infrastructure Protection Ordinance 2026; the Punjab Waqf, Trust and Cooperative Societies (Monitoring) Bill 2026; The Punjab Sales Tax on Services (Amendment) Bill 2026; and The Punjab Infrastructure Development Cess (Amendment) Bill 2026.
The government also tabled amendments to the Punjab Employees Social Security Ordinance 1965 to align it with the revised minimum wage of Rs40,000. The draft noted that while the minimum wage had been raised, the outdated salary cap of Rs22,000 remained in the law, causing legal and administrative complications.
According to the bill’s text, the proposed amendments would validate social security contributions paid since July 2022 and prevent an estimated Rs24 billion loss to the provincial exchequer. The legislation will be enacted as the Punjab Provincial Employees Social Security (Amendment) Act 2026 after committee review and final approval by the governor.

The Sindh government along with the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), finalised the estimate of losses incurred by the shopkeepers of Gul Plaza in their trading goods, with the assistance of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), which put the total sum at Rs7 billion.
The officials involved in the process said that the KCCI, right after the government’s nod for compensation, initiated the process and invited claims from traders regarding their losses. The process, they said, was carried out on a fast track basis and in less than three weeks all the claims were verified and the estimates were finalised.
“The government didn’t interfere and made the traders’ body, the KCCI in charge of verifying all the claims and preparing the final estimates,” Mayor Murtaza Wahab told Dawn. “The registration of traders was done in collaboration with the KCCI to ensure transparency and fairness. The KCCI has done its job.
It verified all claims and cross-checked all the figures. All available documents, bank account details and tax returns were examined and the amount of seven billion rupees was finalised as compensation. The cabinet has approved the amount and we will start paying compensation to the affected traders in the next few days.”

Zubair Motiwala, prominent industrialist and renowned business leader, who oversaw the process on behalf of the KCCI, lauded the government’s efforts and said the compensation process was completed in record time “with 100 per cent satisfaction of all affected traders”.
“There are more than 900 affected traders with around 1,200 shops,” he said. “Many had more than one shop in Gul Plaza. We set up special counters at the chamber’s building, where we received claims from traders and verified them according to set standards.
The compensation ranged from a few hundred thousand rupees to more than Rs10 million for each trader, depending on their losses. This compensation covers the trading goods that the traders lost in the fire.”
Alternative locations
Regarding an alternative location for the shops, Mr Motiwala said the government had already identified a few locations — including Parking Plaza, New Jamia Market and Royal Market where it plans to build business facilities for the traders so they can restart their businesses.
Apart from the compensation for trading goods, the government had already paid Rs500,000 each to 1,153 affected traders as an initial amount to help bridge the gap during the process, he added.
“Along with this immediate relief, the Sindh government has also offered that if any shopkeeper wishes to take a loan, the government will provide up to Rs10 million as an interest-free loan on easy instalments,” said Mr Motiwala.
Mayor Wahab vowed that apart from compensation, the government had also taken emergency steps to provide immediate relief to the affected shopkeepers and has offered free alternative spaces at different locations across the city to enable them to resume business.
“Around 350 affected shopkeepers of Gul Plaza have been provided temporary stalls at the site of Baradari, Bagh-i-Jinnah (former Polo Ground), in the first phase so that they can resume commercial activities,” he said.
He said parking, basement facilities, security arrangements and deployment of police and wardens had been finalised. He added that the government would stand by the affected traders until complete restoration of their businesses.

• NPR report says key records were catalogued but never released; include over 50 pages of FBI interviews with a female victim• Democrat calls withholding of files ‘illegal’; launches probe against Justice Department• Dept says unreleased materials are privileged or part of ongoing investigation
THE US Department of Jus­tice has withheld Epstein files containing allegations that US President Donald Trump sexually abused a minor and also removed other related docume­nts from a public database, according to a report by the US National Public Radio (NPR).
According to the report, dozens of pages catalogued by the DOJ, including what appear to be over 50 pages of FBI interviews and notes with a woman who accused Trump of sexually abusing her as a minor decades ago, have not been made public as mandated by law.
The DOJ declined to answer NPR’s specific questions on the record but said that any unpublished documents are privileged, are duplicates or pertain to an ongoing federal investigation.
Following the report, the top Democrat on the House Over­sight Committee said his staff had confirmed the discrepancy.

 

“Oversight Democrats can confirm that the DOJ appears to have illegally withheld FBI interviews with this survivor who accused President Trump of heinous crimes,” Rep. Rob­ert Garcia said in a statement. Garcia announced a parallel investigation into the DOJ’s handling of the documents.
When asked for comment, a White House spokeswoman told NPR that Trump has been “totally exonerated on anything relating to Epstein” and has “done more for Epstein’s victims than anyone before him” by releasing documents and cooperating with Congress.
One allegation detailed in internal FBI documents involves a woman who claimed that when she was about 13, around 1983, Epstein introduced her to Trump. She alleged that Trump assaulted her, and when she resisted, he struck her and threw her out, according to the report.
While this specific claim appears in an internal FBI list and a slideshow, NPR found that associated FBI interviews with the accuser appear to be missing from the public files. A review of case logs from the criminal trial of Epstein’s associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, indicates the FBI interviewed this woman four times.
However, only the first interview, which does not name Trump, is in the public database. In that interview, the woman’s attorney said a photo of Epstein she provided was cropped because she feared “implicating additional individuals, and specifically any that were well known, due to fear of retaliation.” FBI agents noted the picture was a “widely distributed photograph” of Epstein with Trump.
Other missing files relate to a key witness in the trial that led to Maxwell’s 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. That woman told the FBI she met Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club as a minor while being abused by Epstein. She recounted Epstein telling Tru­mp, “This is a good one, huh,” to which both men chuckled.
NPR reported that the FBI in­­terview detailing this acco­unt was temporarily removed from the public database before being restored, while an interview with the woman’s mother that also mentions Trump remains offline.
Robert Glassman, an attorney for the witness who testified against Maxwell, criticised the department’s handling of the document release.
“The DOJ was ordered to release information to the public to be transparent about Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal enterprise network. Instead, they relea­sed the names of courageous victims who have fought hard for decades to remain anonymous and out of the limelight.”
A DOJ spokesperson told NPR the department is working to ad­­dress redaction concerns from victims, noting that due to the large volume of information, sensitive or personally identifiable information may have been inadvertently included.

“It was a race against time. Sifting through technical data, establishing coordinates and isolating the target,” a senior security official said. “It didn’t take long before we knew the location.”
By late evening, they had already laid siege to the residence, taken up position and called out those inside to come out, hands raised, and surrender.
For a moment, there was no movement. But then, someone showed a raised hand from behind the door, indicating their willingness to surrender. Except that he didn’t.
Aiming a 9mm gun straight at the security cordon, the lone gunman fired straight shots, hitting an assistant sub inspector of the police right in the chest, killing him on the spot, and injuring two intelligence officers.
The exchange of fire didn’t last long, though.
Within minutes, the gunman, said to be in his mid-thirties, was shot and killed. But the brief distraction offered by the gun battle gave those inside the house sufficient time to destroy cellphones and any other evidence of communication that could possibly betray them.
The gunman turned out to be a high-value target — identified as Yousaf alias Qasim aka Idrees — the leader of the militant Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) group in the Bajaur region, and the main handler of the Imambargah suicide bomber, carrying a reward of Rs12 million.
What followed was more startling, as the counter-terrorism department dug further into this cell’s activities. The gang, it turned out, had been involved in a series of assassinations and suicide bombings before stepping out of the tribal district to relocate to Gujranwala, Lahore and finally to Nowshera’s Hakimabad.
Investigators now have enough evidence to link them to the targeted assassination of all 20 men involved in the lynching to death of an IS-K operative, out to kill a local JUI-F leader for issuing a scathing attack against it.
They were also linked to the assassination of senior JUI-F figure Mufti Sultan Mahmood in Bajaur in October 2019, a suicide bombing at the party’s convention on July 30, 2021 that left more than 54 dead and over a hundred wounded, and the bombing and assassination of ANP leader Maulana Khanzeb on July 10, 2025.
Additionally, investigators say, the group was involved in the killings of at least 15 policemen, as well as the murder of the Nawagai assistant commissioner in a bombing on July 2, 2025.
Investigators say that Idrees — a tailor by profession — had been on their radar for some time, but had managed to evade capture by changing locations, moving with women and children, and avoiding staying at one location for longer periods.
“Pretty much living like nomads, leaving whatever little they had behind before moving onto the next location without notifying the landlord,” was how one official described his movements.
What surprised investigators the most was the role of the women in the group. Investigators have now established that not only did the suicide bomber travel to Afghanistan’s Kunar in May 2025, the women had also crossed the border using tampered passports.

 

Not only that, but one of the women had carried the suicide vest from Bajaur to Islamabad, and handed it over to another woman in the group. “They are all indoctrinated. The whole family is radicalised,” a senior investigator said.
As investigators dig deeper into the working and operations of IS-Khorasan, there is a realisation that its network is far bigger and more spread out than previously thought — from the Middle East to Central Asian Republics, and onwards into Afghanistan and Pakistan.
They use cryptocurrency for money transfer and employ encrypted communication apps, making their communications very hard to break.
Based on what they have learned, investigators now consider IS-Khorasan a much bigger threat than the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan in terms of its capability for mass killing, compartmentalisation, commitment to ideology, resources and the sophistication of their operations.

The past few months had been a nightmare, with passengers travelling abroad from Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad routinely complaining of long queues, repeated questioning by security personnel, and extremely long waits for immigration clearance. It seems that some unscrupulous elements had also jumped at the opportunity to fleece time-stressed travellers by furtively offering ‘facilitation services’ in exchange for extortive ‘fees’. Some passengers had even complained on social media that the free-to-use luggage trolleys meant to facilitate travellers had ‘disappeared’ from their usual drop-off spots, and they were forced to pay to use one. Then there were the reports of passengers being denied boarding on flimsy pretexts, or for no reason at all. It seems that the growing discontent finally forced the authorities to restore some order.
While there is no question that Pakistan needs to crack down on human smuggling and prevent unscrupulous elements from travelling abroad for less-than-legitimate reasons, the way the authorities went about it has left a bad taste. There was never any good reason to subject all foreign travellers to dehumanising and distressing checks and interrogation at the final stage of departure. If the authorities were serious, they would have launched a comprehensive drive against criminals running human smuggling networks, as well as the shysters and ‘immigration advisers’ who sell promises of employment abroad in return for exorbitant fees. That they chose to inconvenience countless travellers — including the old, the sick and those travelling with little children — just so that they could ‘look good’ in the eyes of those passing the orders goes to show what little consideration is accorded to ordinary citizens. One can only be grateful that sense seems to be prevailing at last. Otherwise, this could just as easily have become standard operating procedure.

The committee classified REEVs, essentially series hybrids, under HS Code 8703.8090, the same category as BEVs, on the basis that propulsion is provided solely by an electric motor, with the onboard internal combustion engine (ICE) functioning as a generator.
However, the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA) has termed the matter a case of misdeclaration under the Customs Act, 1969, and raised the issue with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
It noted that the importer declared the vehicle under HS Code 8703.8090, attracting a 25 per cent duty under the Fifth Schedule, whereas the exporter at the port of origin in China declared it under HS Code 8703.6023, which carries a 50pc duty.

Seek review of HS code for range-extended electric vehicles

According to PAMA, HS 8703.8090 applies to pure electric vehicles, while 8703.6023 covers hybrid vehicles.
The association argues that a vehicle equipped with an internal combustion engine, even if used as a generator, cannot be considered a pure electric vehicle and therefore should not qualify for incentives intended for zero-emission vehicles.
PAMA further said the inclusion of an ICE potentially contravenes the National Electric Vehicle Policy, which restricts incentives to all-battery vehicles operating solely on onboard battery charge without any combustion engine.
The association maintained that the dispute involves both classification and fiscal benefits. It argued that if there was no difference in duty, the classification under either of the two mentioned HS codes would be irrelevant.
The customs ruling relied heavily on the source of propulsion. However, industry representatives contend that the presence of an ICE generator — reportedly constituting at least 15pc of the vehicle’s value — makes the product distinct from a customary electric vehicle.
PAMA has called for the ruling to be suspended and reviewed to ensure that fiscal concessions are limited to genuine zero-emission vehicles and that market distortions are avoided.
An assembler pointed out that REEVs typically feature a 45-litre fuel tank, emission levels and fuel efficiency comparable to hybrids when not externally charged. He also noted that exporting countries and UNECE regulations classify REEVs as hybrids.
While the Customs Classification Committee stated that its ruling was confined to tariff classification — and acknowledged that the World Customs Organisation is expected to assign a separate HS code for REEVs by 2028 — the decision to extend BEV-level fiscal incentives rests with the federal government and cabinet.
Currently, completely built-up (CBU) BEVs below 50kWh attract 25pc customs duty and 12.5pc GST, while completely knocked-down (CKD) BEVs benefit from one per cent duty on specific parts, 10pc CKD duty, 25pc duty on its localised parts, one per cent GST and zero federal excise duty — incentives aimed at promoting zero-emission vehicles without combustion engines.
The assembler said industry representatives have warned that extending these same concessions to REEVs could significantly distort the market, trigger a surge in low-duty REEV CBU imports at a fraction of duty, and undermine the economic viability of CKD operations across ICE, HEV, PHEV and BEV segments.
He said this classification issue has emerged at a time when the Auto Policy 2026-31 is being discussed with respect to future tariff structures, sales tax treatment and concessions for hybrid, plug-in hybrid, REEV and battery electric vehicles.
He said automakers are awaiting clarity from the Engineering Development Board (EDB) and the Ministry of Industries and Production, especially as the upcoming policy will require alignment with IMF commitments, federal cabinet approval and consensus among key stakeholders.

The protesters blocked the Karakoram Highway at several points in Gilgit, calling for action against the culprits. The demonstrators dispersed peacefully after the authorities assured them that steps would be taken to arrest the individuals responsible for offending religious sensibilities.
The arrests came during a crackdown against “elements spreading communal hatred and blasphemous material” on social media, according to a police statement.
“Police took action und­er a zero-tolerance policy against elements offending religious sentiments or undermining harmony through social media,” the statement said.
Police did not name the four arrested individuals. The authorities have requested the public to cooperate with police in identifying such elements.
According to a separate statement, police arrested a resident of Gil­git’s Naumal area on a charge of sharing “derogatory content” on social media. A case was registered against him under sections 298 and 153 of the PPC and also under the Anti-Terrorism Act.
Caretaker home minister Sajid Ali Baig said at a press conference that the government would carry out a thorough investigation to nab the people involved in stoking disharmony and “exemplary punishment” would be given to them.
