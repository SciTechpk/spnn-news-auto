Britain, France and Germany have threatened to trigger a “snapback mechanism” to reintroduce UN sanctions that were lifted under the agreement unless Iran agrees to curb its uranium enrichment and restore cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) inspectors.
Iran will hold talks with the European trio in Geneva on Tuesday, Iranian state media reported. “On Tuesday, Iran and the three European parties to the 2015 nuclear deal, along with the European Union, will hold a new round of talks at the level of deputy foreign ministers in Geneva,” the state television said.
The meeting will be the second since Iran’s 12-day war with Israel in mid-June, during which the United States carried out strikes against Tehran’s nuclear facilities. The previous round of talks was held in Istanbul on July 25.

Tehran to hold negotiations with Britain, Germany and France today

Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, the Kremlin said on Monday, in which the pair “touched on the situation around Iran’s nuclear programme”.
 
 

It did not elaborate on what the pair discussed.
The Iranian presidency said Pezeshkian had thanked Putin for supporting Tehran’s “right to enrichment” and said Iran was “not seeking, and will never seek to build nuclear weapons”.
The two countries have bolstered political, military and economic ties during Russia’s military offensive on Ukraine.
Iran has regularly sought to coordinate its position with both Russia and China before key nuclear talks with the United States and Europe during the current stand-off.
Russia’s Kommersant business paper reported on Monday that Moscow opposed the idea of “snapback” sanctions.

outgoing EU envoy Riina Kionka

ISLAMABAD: Noting a deteriorating human rights climate, outgoing European Union Ambassador Riina Kionka has called on Pakistan to show ‘credible’ and ‘visible progress’ on human rights and labour reforms ahead of a crucial trade assessment in November, signalling that the EU’s next trade preference scheme will demand stronger compliance.
Speaking to Dawn days before leaving Islamabad, Kionka said the upcoming GSP+ monitoring mission, which had been delayed from June because of the Iran-Israel conflict, will scrutinise Pakistan’s record on 27 international conventions tied to the trade scheme, which grants duty-free access to most Pakistani exports.
“Pakistan needs to show more visible progress especially ahead of the upcoming GSP Plus monitoring mission in November,” she said.
 
 

“Governance is looking pretty good, (progress on) environment also positive. But labour rights need more work, and human rights remain the most challenging area.”

EU envoy says crucial trade assessment due in November

On human rights, she was blunt: “If you talk to many human rights defenders, civil society activists —and even just live here, like I have for three years — you often see … a clear degradation. Our monitors read the newspapers. They have networks, they know what’s going on. So, they’re in a position to judge whether things are moving in the right direction or not.”
European lawmakers and civil society, she added, are increasingly vocal about conditioning trade support on rights performance: “Why should we continue to offer this level of support if there’s no reciprocal progress on the values side?”
Despite what she described as “quiet diplomacy” between EU and Pakistan on sensitive issues like human rights, Kionka has sometimes been vocal on these issues.
 
 

“If we can’t support them (human rights activists) effectively because they’re being silenced or intimidated, then we lose a key channel of communication, a way to engage in dialogue and debate,” she said while explaining the reason for taking strong positions adding “civil society is essential to the EU’s human rights policy. It’s how we project values. It’s how we engage.”
The GSP+ programme is a lifeline for Pakistan’s export sector, with the scheme delivering 83pc growth in exports to EU since its inception. But Kionka stressed that the arran­gement is “a two-sided equation — one side is trade, which has been very successful. The other is susta­i­n­­able development and we need to see credible progress on both fronts.”
The EU measures progress towa­rds sustainability through active implementation of the 27 conventi­ons Pakistan has pledged to uphold, covering human rights, labour rights, governance and environmental standards, the diplomat noted.
She welcomed the Senate’s recent vote to reduce the number of crimes punishable by death, calling it “encouraging”, but urged further movement on freedom of religion and belief, freedom of expression, and the right to assembly.
The EU is finalising a new GSP+ regulation for 2024–2034 that will require all current beneficiaries to reapply before the next cycle begins by 2027. The revised framework, Kionka said, will introduce “a more efficient way of addressing ongoing concerns”.
The proposed regulation will give Brussels more flexibility to withdraw benefits in cases of serious, systematic violations including climate and environmental breaches.
“Once the new regulation comes into force, Pakistan will have to reapply and submit an action plan — a roadmap explaining how it intends to meet the required milestones,” she said. “It doesn’t roll over automatically.”
 
 

The proposed regulation will also have an expanded list of conventions to include children’s rights, disability rights, and stricter labour inspection regimes. The widened scope and expedited withdrawal me­­chanism could, meanwhile, make it more challenging for countries with weak compliance to stay in the scheme.
As she departs after three years, a tenure that started after the 2022 floods for which the EU mobilised nearly €1 billion in aid and ends with yet another episode of devastating floods, the envoy pointed to structural weaknesses in the trade relationship.
“About 75pc of Pakistan’s exports to the EU are textiles. There are ma­­ny other industries that could also benefit from GSP+,” she said, urg­ing diversification and value addition.
She also emphasised the need for political stability and plurality “to get things done and maintain long-term partnerships”, and highlighted the EU-Pakistan Business Network — a platform for European investors — as an unfinished project she hopes her successor will formally launch.

The question was answered in the negative by the Delhi High Court on Monday, which quashed the Central Information Commission’s 2016 order permitting a RTI activist to look at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s B.A. records, assuming the records exist.
The court quashed the order that would have enabled the RTI activist to inspect Delhi University’s 1978 B.A. records, the year Narendra Modi graduated, The Hindu said.
“Something which is of interest to the public” is quite different from “something which is in the public interest”, Justice Sac­­hin Dutta remarked as he set aside the CIC’s Dec 21, 2016 order.
In the 175-page combined judgement, Justice Datta also ruled against the CIC’s order asking the CBSE to share Class X and XII records of BJP leader Smriti Irani to a RTI applicant, saying, “there is no implicit public interest in respect of the information sought.”

Observes something which is of ‘interest to public’ is different from something in ‘public interest’

Mr Modi has been quoted as giving different accounts of his educational qualifications, but it is baffling why his claim of being a graduate should not be verified on behalf of a curious public.
On the RTI plea of activist Neeraj, the CIC had ordered Delhi University (DU) to allow inspection of its register containing details of all students who passed the B.A. examination in 1978 — including their roll numbers, names, fathers’ names and marks — and to provide certified extracts of the relevant pages.
 
 

After the DU challenged the CIC’s order, the court stayed it on the very first hearing, Jan 24, 2017.
In its plea, the DU had contended that it cannot reveal details of personal information of all students, who had appeared in Bachelor of Arts in the year 1978, the year Mr Modi cleared the degree.
The DU had argued that the information of students is held in “fiduciary capacity, the same is exempt from disclosure” under the RTI Act. The university said the CIC order had “far-reaching adverse consequences” for all universities that held degrees of crores of students.
Justice Dutta agreed with the DU’s contention, noting the “court cannot be oblivious to the reality that what may superficially appear to be an innocuous or isolated disclosure could open the floodgates of indiscriminate demands, motivated by idle curiosity or sensationalism, rather than any objective “public interest” consideration.”
“The fact that the information sought pertains to a public figure does not extinguish privacy/confidentiality rights over personal data, unconnected with public duties,” the court added.
Justice Dutta said: “Such data, which pertains to various facets of a student’s academic life, is held by the university in trust and confidence, and there is a legitimate expectation on the part of the students that confidentiality shall be maintained with regard thereto”.
Previously, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the DU, argued that the purpose of RTI was not to satiate a third party’s curiosity.
“Section 6 provides a mandate that information will have to be given, that is the purpose. But the RTI Act is not for the purpose of satisfying someone’s curiosity,” Mr Mehta had argued.
The CIC, in its order, told the DU to allow inspection and rejected the argument of its public information officer that it was third party personal information, observing there was “neither merit, nor legality” in it.

GAZA: Five journalists were among at least 20 people killed on Monday when Israeli strikes hit a hospital in the south, prompting a global outcry.
Reuters, the Associated Press and Al Jazeera all issued statements mourning their slain contributors, while the Israeli military said it would investigate the incident.
The war on Gaza has been one of the deadliest for journalists, with aro­u­nd 200 media workers kil­led over the course of the nearly two-year Israeli assault, according to media watchdogs.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said  “the toll so far is 20 martyrs, including five journalists and one member of the civil defence”, after strikes hit Khan Yunis’s Nasser Hospital — a large medical complex that has been targeted several times by Israel.
Bassal said an Israeli exp­losive drone hit a buil­d­ing at the hospital, followed by an air strike as the wounded were being evacuated.
Reuters reported that vi­­d­­eo journalist Hussam al-Masri — a contractor who was working for the agency — was operating a live feed at the hospital,  “which suddenly shut down at the mo­­ment of the initial strike”.
A Reuters spokesperson said the agency was  “devastated” to learn of Masri’s death “and injuries to another of our contractors, Hatem Khaled” in the strikes.
“We are urgently seeking more information and have asked authorities in Gaza and Israel to help us get urgent medical assistance for Hatem,” the statement added.
A spokesperson for Qatar-based TV network Al Jazeera said one of its photojournalists and cameramen, Mohammad Sala­­ma, was also killed in the attack.
“Al Jazeera Media Network condemns, in the strongest possible terms, this horrific crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces, who have dir­ectly targeted and assassinated journalists as part of a systematic campaign to silence the truth,” the broa­dcaster said in a statement.
 
 

The Associated Press said in a statement that it was “shocked and sadde­ned” to learn of the death of Mariam Dagga, 33, a visual journalist who had freelanced for the agency since the start of the war.
The Palestinian Journa­lists Syndicate named two other victims as Moaz Abu Taha and Ahmad Abu Aziz.
 
 

Later Monday, a sixth journalist, Hassan Douhan, was killed by Isra­eli fire in the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Yunis, according to the Palestinian Journalists Syn­dicate and Nasser Hospital.
AFP footage from the immediate aftermath of the attack showed smoke filling the air and debris from the blast on the floor outside the hospital.
Palestinians rushed to help the victims, carrying bloodied corpses and severed body parts into the medical complex. One body could be seen dangling from the top floor of the targeted building as a man screamed below.
A woman wearing medical scrubs and a white coat was among the injured, carried into the hospital on a stretcher with a heavily bandaged leg and blood all over her clothes.
Later in the day, a crowd carried the bodies of some of the slain journalists at a funeral in Khan Yunis, with the dead wrapped in white burial shrouds and their press flak jackets resting on top.

At least seven terrorists were also killed, officials and sources said.
In Upper Dir and Lower Dir districts, officials and sources said five suspected militants were killed and seven policemen injured late on Sunday night during fierce clashes between the security forces and the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Paki­stan (TTP). They said the exchange of fire in the Dobando area of Upper Dir continued for several hours. Two civilians from Hatnar Dara, caught in the crossfire, lost their lives.
A senior official of the Counter-Terrorism Depart­ment (CTD) of police told Dawn that the bodies of all five terrorists were in police custody. They might have links across the border in Afghanistan, he said.
In Lower Dir’s Lajbook Dara area, heavy firing broke out between police and militants. Though no casualties were reported from this clash, tension gripped the area as the attackers torched police vehicles including two pick-up trucks and a car, locals said. Sharing the footage on social media, the outlawed TTP claimed they had “seized the vehicles and destroyed them”.
Police officials, however, claimed the situation was under control. “We will never bow down to the mischief of the Kharijites (militants),” a police officer said.

Three civilians among the slain; seven terrorists killed in Upper Dir, Hangu engagements

Cop martyred in Bajaur
In Bajaur district, a policeman from Lower Dir was martyred in militant firing. Head Constable Shah Wazir Khan was laid to rest in his ancestral village Chansaruno Talash wit­h official honours. Besides Lower Dir District Police Offi­cer Abdul Salam Khalid, SP Elite Force Fahd Khan, Col Abrar of 184 Wing Dir Scouts, other security officials and lo­cal elders, a large number of area people attended the funeral.
Speaking on the occasion, DPO Khalid said the sacrifice of the fallen policeman would never be forgotten. He assured that the police would continue to stand by the families of martyrs in all circumstances.
Hangu, Khyber attacks
In Hangu district, militants mounted a late-night attack on the Tora Warai FC fort. As a result, two personnel of Hangu scouts were martyred, while several others were injured. In the ensuing gun battle, two militants were also killed.
In Tirah valley of Khyber district, two soldiers were martyred in a terrorist attack on a security post.
Sources said that an unspecified number of armed militants attacked the post of an army unit, resulting in the martyrdom of Lance Naik Ali Hasan Jan and Sepoy Nabi Jan. The attackers, however, fled when the security forces retaliated. Later, a search operation was conducted in the region as residents were asked to stay indoors.
 
 

Later, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi along with KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed, FC Commandant Riaz Nazir Gara and other officials attended the funeral of the personnel who embraced martyrdom in Hangu. The interior minister said the sacrifices of the martyrs would not go in vain as he met families of the martyrs.
 
 

Mr Naqvi also visited the FC Hospital to inquire about the health of Naib Subedar Kashif who sustained injuries. “You have set an unforgettable example of bravery and repelled the enemy’s attack. The way you fought against Indian-sponsored terrorists is highly commendable. We all stand with you and will always remain by your side,” he said.
Cop targeted in Jamrud
In Jamrud, a policeman was martyred in a firing incident, police said.
Officials said that armed men targeted Khurshid Khan in Ghundi area of Jamrud and fled. While police were ascertaining the motive for the shooting, they have not ruled out the possibility of a family feud.
Quadcopter strike in N. Waziristan
In North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area, a two-year-old boy was martyred and his grandmother injured in a quadcopter strike on a house on Monday.
According to sources, the quadcopter targeted a house in the Barokhel village of Mir Ali. As a result, a minor child, Sahir Tufail, son of Kashif Jan, was martyred and his grandmother was injured. The injured woman was shifted to Mir Ali hospital.

• Insiders say fear of losing majority in KP Assembly, ceding political space in Punjab behind ‘change of heart’
• Drama unfolds after Monday’s meeting as Salman Akram Raja announces decision to quit as secy general
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: A tug of war within the opposition PTI over whether to participate in the upcoming by-elections for national and provincial assembly seats — vacated after the recent disqualifications of a number of key lawmakers — will weigh heavily on party leaders as they meet Imran Khan today for a final decision in the matter.
Insiders told Dawn the party’s political committee — in its meeting on Monday — had a change of heart after a majority of members voted against the decision to boycott by-polls.
This goes against the opinion reportedly expressed by incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, whose sister Aleema has conveyed on a couple of occasions his intention to steer clear of by-elections, so that the party isn’t seen as legitimising the process.
The party has already obtained stay orders against the de-seating of key opposition leaders, such as Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz. It has also, albeit reluctantly, nominated replacements while the party pursues legal options.
But faced with threats on multiple fronts — including the possible loss of maj­o­rity in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly due to future disqualifications, a push to reclaim political space in Punjab, and a showdown between two opposing camps within the party — it seems as if the PTI may throw its hat in the ring, despite all misgivings about the by-elections. According to sources privy to proceedings, Monday’s meeting of the political committee voted 12-9 in favour of fielding candidates for the upcoming by-elections.
Additionally, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram announced that all candidates would be issued tickets under the banner of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which appears to be an insurance policy of sorts, to offset chances of them being declared ‘independent candidates’, since the dispute around PTI’s intra-party elections and the matter of its electoral symbol are still in limbo.
Three meetings with Imran
Aleema Khan had clearly stated after meeting with the former prime minister that Mr Khan did not want to field any candidates for the by-elections. If they did, it would appear to be an insult, disrespecting and dishonouring leaders who had been disqualified. This message was also shared Mr Khan’s official X account — even though the former PM does not personally have access to social media.
However, a majority of the party leaders were in favour of contesting by-elections. So, Mr Khan was approached once again through his sisters, and he repeated the same message, sources said.
But, in the last meeting between Imran and his legal team, Naeem Haider Panjotha called up Advocate Ali Bukhari — another member of the legal team —saying that Mr Khan wanted to meet him.
According to one account, it was Mr Bukhari who prevailed on the party founder to reconsider his stance, saying that in case any legislators from KP are disqualified in the coming days and the PTI does not field any candidates, it may stand to lose its majority in KP. Observers feel that while the PTI is under a lot of pressure in Punjab, there is no looming threat to the party in KP, partly because only a handful of the sitting or former MPAs have been nominated in cases where they may face disqualification.
In addition, the provincial government-appointed prosecutors are less inclined to push these cases in courts, which are widely seen are being comparatively lenient towards the party.
This is also a reason why many parliamentarians, who are facing prosecution in Punjab, have either taken up sanctuary in KP or approached the Peshawar High Court for legal relief.
Mr Bukhari reportedly also asked Mr Khan about fielding candidates for the vacant posts of opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate, and the Punjab Assembly. This issue, the founder had instructed, should be discussed the by political committee, and suggested that if candidates are to be fielded, Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Azam Swati should be considered.
Drama in political committee
During Monday’s meeting, it emerged that a majority of leaders were in favour of not ceding political space to the ruling parties.
A fear was expressed that PTI legislators from KP could be disqualified in Nov 26 cases, after which the party may not be able to hold on to the provincial government. Once the KP government goes, things will become more difficult for the party, sources said.
In addition, PTI leaders were confident that they could easily win elections in KP. However, when Sheikh Waqqas Akram shared the party’s decision on social media, it triggered a wave of criticism from across the globe. When approached, Mr Akram confirmed that he, Salman Akram Raja and a few others were against the decision, but they had to go with the majority.
In a dramatic turn of events, however, Salman Akram Raja tweeted his intention to step down from the post of secretary general, saying he would request Imran Khan to accept his resignation when the two met on Tuesday (today).
Although he did not specify what prompted him to take this decision, the timing of his tweet indicated that the “incident” he referred to was — in all probability — the political committee’s decision to contest by-polls. “Tomorrow I will resign from my position by requesting Khan sahib. My legal services will remain available without compensation,” he wrote on X.
 






Talking to Dawn, former Punjab Assembly opposition leader Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar said that the fog around whether to contest by-elections or not would be cleared up when lawyers meet Imran Khan in Adiala Jail today (Tuesday). He also voiced support for elements who feel that the party should not leave the field open in Punjab by boycotting polls. “While going into elections on around 14 provincial and national assembly constituencies, the PTI will be doing a lot of political activity, which would definitely expose the government if it tried to rig these elections,” he said.
Candidates withdraw
Meanwhile, three PPP candidates have withdrawn their nomination papers for by-elections in Punjab, in favour of PML-N nominees, as per a recent agreement between the two parties. A PPP spokesperson said that candidates had withdrawn their candidatures for National Assembly constituencies NA-129 (Lahore) and NA-66 (Wazirabad), as well as the Punjab Assembly constituency PP-87 (Mianwali).

• At least 10 districts on high alert as more than 24,000 relocated amid flooding of low-lying areas; heavy rain likely in next two days
• GB villagers await govt help to ease their suffering; three locals rewarded for timely Glof warning; PM likely to visit region tomorrow
LAHORE/GILGIT: As Punjab braces for a “high flood” in almost all eastern rivers prompting mass evacuations, thousands of people affected by glacial and flash floods in Gilgit-Baltistan earlier this month await government’s help amid a shortage of essentials.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said that more than 24,000 people had been relocated from the low-lying areas of the Indus, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers since Saturday. These rivers were experiencing low to high flooding due to torrential monsoon rains in the catchment areas and more rain was expected over the next 48 hours.
The evacuation operation was conducted in Kasur, Okara, Pakp­a­ttan, Bahawalnagar, Ve­hari, and Narowal, Mr Ahmad said, as a high alert had been issued in Kasur, Okara, Pakpa­ttan, Bahaw­a­lnagar, Vehari, and Narowal in light of a flood alert by India.
 
 

Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) also issued a flood alert in Punjab due to heavy rains. There is a risk of flooding in the upper reaches of these rivers due to heavy rain likely in the next 48 hours. There is a risk of “high to very high” flooding in the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers, whereas urban flooding was also expected in the Rawalpindi, Lahore, and Gujranwala divisions.
‘High-level flooding’
A high-level flooding warning had been issued at the Harike location of the Sutlej River: the upstream and downstream areas of Harike were facing a high-level flood situation. The water flow in the Sutlej and adjacent rivers would further increase.
There was a low flood situation at Kalabagh and Chashma in the Indus River, while the water flow was at a normal level at Tarbela and Taunsa. There was a high flood situation at Ganda Singh Wala in the Sutlej River and a medium flood at Sul­emanki. Similarly, there was a medium flood situation at Marala and Khanki on the Chenab River. About reservoirs, Tarbela Dam was completely full, while Mangla Dam was 76pc. Among the Indian dams, Bhakra was 80pc, Pong 87pc, and Thein Dam was 85pc full.
Separately, the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) issued a flood alert for the River Ravi over the next 48 hours, indicating a medium-level threat. According to hydrological data, sustained moderate to heavy rainfall in the catchments of River Ravi and associated nullahs had resulted in increased inflows at Thein Dam, which had reached 1,717 feet. As of Monday, River Ravi at Kot Naina was discharging 64,000 cusecs and may cause “low to medium” floods at Jassar within 24 hours, with the potential to escalate to high flood levels if additional spillway releases occurred along with continued rainfall activity till August 27.
In light of possible flooding, the PDMA is­­sued instructions to the district administrations concerned to remain alert, while an alert had also been issued to the commissioners of Lah­ore, Sahiwal, Multan, Bahawalpur and D.G. Khan. The deputy commissioners of Kasur, Oka­­ra, Pakpattan, Vehari, Baha­wal­nagar, Lod­hran, Bahawalpur, Multan and Mu­­zaffargarh were also put on alert in light of floods.
Meanwhile, the PDMA issued a fact sheet on the monsoon flood situation, including statistics on rains, rivers, dams, and the flood situation.In the last 24 hours, Narowal 27mm, Sialkot 5mm, Kasur 4mm, Lahore and Gujranwala 3mm, while Gujrat and Khanewal recorded up to 1mm of rain.
GB awaits help
Residents in several tehsils of Ghizer remained isolated for the fourth day due to the blockaded Gilgit-Shandur Road — a five-kilometre section of the artery had been submerged in last week’s glacial flood that created an artificial lake in Raushan village in Ghizer.
Mohammad Karim, a resident, said 300 houses damaged by the flash flood had been submerged by the lake, and villagers in Hakis, Thangi, and Raushan remained without basic necessities. The locals complained that they had been uprooted from their homes, but still did not get any relief from the government. The people were living without electricity, potable water, housing, medical facilities and other basic needs, Mr Karim said.
Furthermore, the flood-affe­cted people in Ghizer’s Khalti, Daen, Chaturkhand, and other areas also did not have access to roads and basic facilities.
For almost a month, the residents of remote Hisper Val­ley in Nagar had been maro­oned after the road was washed away by floods and landslides. Similarly, the Karako­ram Hig­hway near Hassanabad in Hun­za remained blocked for the third week and traffic was div­erted via an alternative route. The Haramosh and Bagrot valleys in Gilgit were also without road access, causing hardships.
A resident Shahzad Hussain told Dawn that the densely packed areas of Danyor, Sultanabad, and Mohammadabad in Gilgit did not have any water supply for more than a month, leading to a severe shortage of water. Locals said the residents had to purchase tankers daily, which the poor could not afford.
Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Director General Zakir Hussain, in a statement, said the National Highway Authority’s machinery had been mobilised to clear the Shandur road. He further said that a formal approval had also been obtained for the construction of an alternative route, and work was progressing rapidly. “Under the project, a bypass will be constructed and the road will be connected to the main highway through a bridge…” he added.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was expected to arrive in GB on Wednesday. According to a statement, a high-level meeting was chaired by GB Chief Secretary Abrara Ahmed Mirza to review the arrangements for the expected visit.
In a separate event at the PM’s House in Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the three local shepherds of Gilgit-Baltistan, who saved hundreds of lives in a nearby village by issuing a timely alert about a glacial lake outburst flood (Glof).

Speaking to reporters as he met South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in Washington, Trump pointed to recent talks with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping: “At some point, probably during this year or shortly thereafter, we’ll go to China.
“We’re going to have a great relationship with China,” Trump vowed.
The US leader added: “They have some cards. We have incredible cards, but I don’t want to play those cards. If I played those cards, that would destroy China.”
 
 

Tensions between the world’s two biggest economies have been simmering this year, but have significantly cooled since April, when both countries slapped escalating tariffs on each other’s exports.
At one point, the tit-for-tat duties reached triple digits on both sides, snarling supply chains as many importers halted shipments to try and wait for the governments to work things out.
Since then, Washington and Beijing have reached an agreement to de-escalate tensions, temporarily lowering tariffs to 30 per cent on the United States’ side and 10pc on China’s part.
 


But Trump on Monday kept the door open to hiking tariffs again if China did not hold up its end of the bargain.
“They have to give us magnets,” Trump said. “If they don’t give us magnets, then we have to charge them [a] 200pc tariff or something.” “But we’re not going to have a problem, I don’t think, with that,” he added.
The US-China truce has been an uneasy one, with Washington previously accusing Beijing of violating their agreement and slow-walking export license approvals for rare earths.
China is the world’s leading producer of rare earths, used to make magnets essential to the automotive, electronics and defence industries.
The countries have since agreed to move forward.
This month, they delayed the threatened reimposition of higher tariffs on each other’s exports for another 90 days — meaning the pause on steeper duties will be in place until November 10.
Trump says he wants to meet with North Korea’s Kim this year
Trump said, “I have a very good relationship. I understand them. I spent a lot of free time with them, talking about things that we probably aren’t supposed to talk about. And you know, I just, I get along with him really well. I think he has a country of great potential, tremendous potential.”
Asked if he wanted to meet with Kim this year or next year, Trump replied, “Well, I’m meeting a lot of people. I mean, it’s hard to say that, but I’d like to meet him this year.”
Trump, who met Kim Jong Un three times in his first term, hailed their relationship and said that he knew him “better than anybody, almost, other than his sister”.
“Someday I’ll see him. I look forward to seeing him. He was very good with me,” Trump told reporters earlier today.
Trump contended that North Korea has been firing fewer rockets since he returned to the White House on January 20.
He has boasted that he has solved seven wars in as many months back in the job — a claim that is contested — but has been quiet on North Korea despite the unusually personal diplomacy during his 2017-2021 tenure.
Trump once said that he and Kim “fell in love.” Their meetings reduced tensions but failed to produce a lasting agreement.
Since then, Kim has forged a close relationship with Russia, including sending troops to fight against Ukraine, and has dug in on refusing any dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program.
US will back Ukraine’s security, details being worked out, Trump says
The US president stated that he has not discussed specific security guarantees for Ukraine and reaffirmed the US commitment to support the country. The potential security guarantees for Ukraine represent a major obstacle to ending Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Trump also said that during his August 15 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the two leaders discussed limiting the size of their countries’ massive nuclear arsenal once the Ukraine crisis is resolved.
“We would like to denuclearise. It’s too much power, and we talked about that also. That’s part of it, but we have to get the war over with,” Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office.
Asked why Putin appears reluctant to sit down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump replied, “Because he doesn’t like him.”</p><small>2025-08-25 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620381-pakistan-rejects-greater-israel-plan-at-oic-moot-seeks-immediate-end-to-gaza-war' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rejects 'Greater Israel' plan at OIC moot, seeks immediate end to Gaza war</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on X today, he said: “An incident has occurred today that now demands a decisive decision from me. My life is an open book. None of my actions contradicts any principle. I do not accept compromise on intellectual and economic integrity. Tomorrow I will resign from my position by requesting Khan sahib. My legal services will remain available without compensation.”
Raja did not disclose what the incident was that compelled him to make the decision to step down.
 






He added that he had already sent a request to Imran last week to allow him to focus on legal matters away from the post of the secretary general.
However, he said Imran had not accepted his request, adding that he was grateful to the PTI founder for the trust reposed in him.
“My entire legal and intellectual life has been governed by the principles that are part of my nature: human dignity, which is the basis of democracy, resistance against social and state oppression of women and minorities, economic justice and the supremacy of law and Constitution.”
Listing some famous cases for which he is renowned, Raja said he had a long list in which he had the opportunity to support his principles. He added that he entered the political arena, along with providing legal assistance, on Imran’s instructions during the period of PTI’s tribulation.
“My aim was to contribute to the struggle for the supremacy of the Constitution, law and democracy. I am proud that I got the opportunity to contribute to the achievement of this goal with my body, mind and money.”
The PTI has been subject to recent discord in the party leadership and ranks that had prompted Imran to prohibit his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters and to shun all their differences.
Raja has had differences with others in the PTI before, including interim chairman Barrister Ali Gohar in April over access to Imran.
 
 

Raja had previously announced to step down from the party office in the wake of allegations and recriminations among party leaders over the ‘failure’ of PTI’s final November protest call in Islamabad last year.
Raja had submitted his resignation to Barrister Gohar, who had confirmed its receipt while maintaining that the decision to accept or reject the resignation would be made by Imran. Until then, Raja was asked to continue performing his duties.
 


Sources had said the political and core committee’s guns were trained on Raja, as he was censured for his complete failure in mobilising the masses and bringing out any rally from Lahore to reinforce the workers from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter who were pushing towards D-Chowk.
However, sources privy to developments had told Dawn that Raja was already demoralised as former first lady Bushra Bibi was calling the shots and had allegedly insulted several party leaders in meetings held in Peshawar ahead of the November 24 protest.
Raja also faced harsh and offensive commentary on his video message from a day earlier, where he presented “excuses” for not making it out of Lahore.
Hammad Azhar withdraws from NA-129 (Lahore) by-election race, nominates cousin
Separately, PTI leader Hammad Azhar withdrew from the race for the by-election for NA-129 (Lahore), which fell vacant after the death of his father, and nominated his cousin instead for the seat.
“I have no desire to be a part of Form-47 parliament that is full of fake MPs. Also, last time my 82-year-old father contested, he was harassed by police, arrested and my home repeatedly smashed. As the only son and sole male heir of the family, I do not want my mother to go through another trauma and on her instructions I have nominated my cousin and father’s nephew Chaudhry Arsalan Zaheer to contest in my place in case the party decided to not boycott the election in my constituency.”

Far-right National Rally (RN) leader Jordan Bardella immediately said his party would not back Bayrou’s planned cuts, suggesting the minority government could face defeat in the vote.
Bayrou told a news conference the National Assembly would be asked to “confirm the scale” of spending reductions, as the government seeks to save around €44 billion ($51bn) a year.
“I have asked the president, who has agreed, to convene an extraordinary session of parliament on Monday, September 8,” Bayrou told reporters.
Bayrou does not have a majority in parliament’s lower house, the National Assembly, and the upcoming vote underscores the fragility of his position.
Bayrou said France was going through a “decisive moment”.
“If you have a majority, the government is confirmed. If you do not have a majority, the government falls,” Bayrou added.
Both the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) and Bardella’s far-right RN said they would use the vote to try to oust the centrist government.
“Francois Bayrou has just announced the end of his government, undermined by its complacent inaction,” Bardella said in a social media post.
“The RN will never vote in favour of a government whose choices cause suffering to the French people. Our fellow citizens are waiting for a change and a return to the ballot box: we are ready.”
 






In mid-July, Bayrou presented 2026 budget proposals, saying he wanted to reduce the number of public holidays in France as part of a bid to tackle what he called the “curse” of the country’s debt.
After years of overspending, France is on notice to control its public deficit and cut its sprawling debt, as required under EU rules.</p><small>2025-08-25 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2518330710f2c14.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937098/fm-dar-says-greater-israel-plan-a-direct-threat-to-regional-peace' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar says ‘Greater Israel’ plan a direct threat to regional peace</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks about a “Greater Israel” threatened regional peace and security.
Earlier this month, AFP reported that Netanyahu was asked by i24NEWS interviewer Sharon Gal if he subscribed to a “vision” for a Greater Israel, to which he said “absolutely”, adding, “If you ask me what I think, we’re there.” These remarks drew widespread condemnation from the international community, including Pakistan. Last week, Israel’s defence minister approved a plan to conquer Gaza City, while Tel Aviv approved a controversial plan to build an Israeli settlement which would sever the occupied West Bank from East Jerusalem.
Addressing an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers (OIC-CFM) in Jeddah, Dar said that in recent days, Israel exhibited its “characteristic sordid insensitivity to international norms” with highly provocative and unwarranted statements encapsulating its “growing disdain and absolute contempt” for the international order.
“The brazen audacity of the so-called Israeli cabinet, in unveiling its ominous plan to extend Israel’s full military control over Gaza, as well as the Israeli prime minister’s recent allusion to the creation of a ‘Greater Israel’, provides an insight into Israel’s annexationist and rogue mindset.”
Pakistan strongly condemned Netanyahu’s remarks, stating that they call for action that would aggravate the already dire humanitarian situation and undermine efforts for peace in the Gaza Strip.
 


“We joined the statement issued by the Arab-Islamic Ministerial Committee, along with other countries, in expressing strong condemnation and categorical rejection of the Israeli announcement, denouncing it as an unacceptable escalation and a brazen attempt to entrench illegal occupation by coercion,” he said.
Pakistan also fully endorsed and joined the statement issued by 31 Arab-Islamic countries and the secretaries general of the OIC, the League of Arab States and the Gulf Cooperation Council, condemning Netanyahu’s comments about “Greater Israel”.
“His (Netanyahu’s) statement constitutes a direct threat to Arab national security, to the sovereignty of states, and to regional and international peace and security,” Dar stated.
“The root cause of this ongoing tragedy is Israel’s prolonged, illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. As long as this occupation endures, peace will remain elusive,” Dar said, quoting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “We fully stand by our brotherly Arab states in safeguarding their sovereignty against threats to their independence and territorial integrity.”
‘Wanton acts of collective punishment’
Dar called Gaza “a graveyard for innocent lives as well as for international law”, lamenting the deaths of over 60,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children.
“The systematic targeting of hospitals, schools, UN facilities, aid convoys and refugee camps are not incidental, these are wanton acts of collective punishment in full world view,” the deputy PM said.
“Gaza is enduring a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe. For nearly two years, it has suffered indiscriminate bombardment, total blockade, and deliberate deprivation and starvation, while violence and dispossession escalate in the West Bank and Jerusalem.”
 






The deputy PM highlighted that the humanitarian system in place was a “cruel illusion” and noted that an unprecedented hunger crisis and famine are rampant in the coastal enclave.
“Pakistan expresses its deep appreciation to all the states and stakeholders that are playing a role in advancing peace in Gaza. Their ongoing contributions and steadfast support remain essential in the pursuit of stability and justice for the Palestinian people,” he stated.
Dar also welcomed “international momentum” towards the recognition of a Palestinian state by governments around the world and appreciated the International Conference on the Two-State Solution, which was co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, on July 28.
“We urge those states that have yet to recognise the State of Palestine to do so as soon as they can,” he urged.
“We need to do more. It (the conference) must now be followed up by coordinated international action to realise the long-overdue settlement, based on a viable, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine, on the basis of pre-1967 borders, with Al Quds Al-Sharif (Jerusalem) as its capital,” Dar added.
‘A defining moment for the Muslim Ummah’
Dar outlined that Palestinians no longer need messages of sympathy but concrete action to end their suffering and ensure their freedom from Israeli occupation.
“This is a defining moment for the Muslim Ummah. History will not judge us by our words but by our actions,” he emphasised.
“The OIC must rise to this challenge with unity, resolve, and purpose. Another Nakba cannot, and must not, be allowed to happen,” he added, referring to the incident when 760,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes during the 1948 war with Israel.
Highlighting that the Palestinian question is a litmus test for the rules-based international order, FM Dar presented the following seven “urgent and essential steps” for ending the Gaza crisis:

An immediate, permanent and unconditional ceasefire across Gaza and
the occupied Palestinian territory with full implementation of UNSC
resolutions
Unfettered, sustained and secure humanitarian access to all civilians
in need and the protection of aid workers, medical teams and UN
personnel
Reinforce international support to UNRWA — which remains
indispensable to the survival of millions of Palestinians — with the
OIC playing a proactive role in this end
An end to forced displacement, illegal settlements and annexation of
Palestinian land, particularly in the West Bank and East Jerusalem
The implementation of the OIC’s reconstruction plan for Gaza, which
represents a vital framework for post-conflict recovery and
rehabilitation, sustainable development and the restoration of
dignity of the people of Palestine
The revival of a genuine process to achieve a just, comprehensive and
a lasting two-state solution in accordance with international law and
relevant UN and OIC resolutions
Accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity

The deputy PM also held meetings on the sidelines of the OIC session with his counterparts from Iran and Saudi Arabia, Dar wrote in separate posts on X.
Dar met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, where the pair “discussed the grave situation in Gaza, strongly condemning Israeli aggression, genocide and famine, and emphasised the urgent need for unhindered humanitarian aid and a lasting ceasefire”.
Additionally, the two top diplomats recalled Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s visit to Pakistan and discussed Pakistani-Iranian ties and exchanged views on peace and security in the region and beyond, Dar wrote.
 






Dar separately met Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal Bin Farhan, where the pair discussed Saudi-Pakistani ties and exchanged views on “key regional and international developments of mutual interest”.
“We discussed the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, including the ongoing genocide, famine and the urgent need for a permanent ceasefire, unhindered humanitarian access, reconstruction, and lasting peace,” the deputy PM wrote.
 






Dar also met his counterpart from Malaysia, Mohamad Haji Hasan, on the sidelines of the meeting, where both sides reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening ties through high-level exchanges, expanding trade and economic ties and people-to-people contacts.
“Expressing our firm solidarity with Palestine and deep concern over the situation in Gaza, we emphasised the urgent need for unhindered humanitarian access and a permanent ceasefire to pave the way for lasting peace,” Dar wrote on X.
 






The deputy PM also met Bangladeshi Adviser for Foreign Affairs Md Touhid Hossain once again in Jeddah, following the former’s visit to Dhaka over the weekend.
“We expressed strong solidarity with the just cause of Palestine, underscoring the urgent need for unhindered humanitarian access, a permanent ceasefire, and lasting peace through a two-state solution,” Dar wrote.
The pair reaffirmed the improving ties between their nations and “looked forward to seeing the fruits of our cooperation across diverse fields”.
 






The Foreign Office (FO) announced that Dar arrived in Jeddah earlier today to attend the meeting on the Gaza crisis amid Israeli aggression and plans to seize full control of Gaza City.
“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar […] has arrived in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to participate in the 21st Extraordinary Session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) being held today at the OIC Secretariat in Jeddah,” the FO said in the statement.
“The DPM/FM was received at the King Abdulaziz International Airport Jeddah by the Permanent Representative of Pakistan to OIC, Ambassador Fawad Sher, Ambassador of Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, Ahmad Farooq, and Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah, Khalid Majid.”
 






The OIC is the second largest inter-governmental organisation after the United Nations, with 57 member states. It was established in September 1969 in response to the Israeli terrorist attacks on Al Aqsa Mosque in occupied Jerusalem.
As a founding member, Pakistan has been at the forefront of the OIC’s efforts to champion Muslim causes — from freedom of the Palestinian and Kashmiri peoples struggling under foreign occupation, to upholding the rights of Muslims in Myanmar and Bosnia, to ending conflicts in Muslim lands such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and Libya.
‘Complete control’ of Gaza
Last week, Tel Aviv approved a plan to seize control of Gaza City, describing it as the last bastion of Hamas.
Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed to press on with the offensive on the city where famine has been declared, which has raised alarm abroad and objections at home. Katz has said that Gaza City would be razed unless Hamas agrees to Israel’s terms.
Hamas said Israel’s plan to take over Gaza City showed it wasn’t serious about a ceasefire, saying that a ceasefire agreement was the only way to return the Israeli prisoners, holding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for their lives.
The proposal on the table calls for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 10 living Israeli prisoners held in Gaza and of 18 bodies. In turn, Israel would release about 200 long-serving Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Once a temporary ceasefire begins, the proposal is for Hamas and Israel to begin negotiations on a permanent ceasefire that would include the return of the remaining Israeli prisoners.
Netanyahu said last Thursday that Israel would immediately resume negotiations for the release of all 50 Israeli prisoners held by Hamas — of whom Israel believes around 20 are still living, and an end to the nearly two-year-old war but on terms acceptable to Israel.
‘Manmade’ famine
According to a report released last week by the Famine Review Committee of the United Nations’ Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the famine in Gaza was “entirely man-made” and could be “halted and reversed”, but it required an “immediate, at-scale response” to do so.
“The time for debate and hesitation has passed; starvation is present and is rapidly spreading,” the committee said in a report.
“There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay — even by days — will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of famine-related mortality.”
The report also warned that avoidable deaths would “increase exponentially” unless a ceasefire was implemented to allow in humanitarian aid and restore the delivery of food and basic supplies to Gaza’s population immediately.
Pakistan dispatches aid
Meanwhile, a fresh consignment of 100 tons of relief goods was dispatched to Palestine from the Allama Iqbal International Airport Lahore via a special flight on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, marking the 21st consignment dispatched for the people of Gaza, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
The consignment includes ration bags, ready-to-eat meals, and canned fruits to meet the urgent food needs of the Palestinian people. With this dispatch, the total volume of aid sent by Pakistan to Gaza has reached 2,027 tons through 21 consignments, the report said.
Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed over 62,000 people and injured 157,951, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The United Nations warned last week that with Israeli forces blocking aid, half a million people face “catastrophic hunger” in Gaza, with famine conditions likely to spread further across the Strip. Meanwhile, Israel has continued its bombardment after approving a plan to seize control of Gaza City, calling it the “last bastion of Hamas.”</p><small>2025-08-25 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/252105354e97a2b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937160/musks-xai-sues-apple-openai-alleging-antitrust-violations' target='_blank'><strong>Musk’s xAI sues Apple, OpenAI alleging antitrust violations</strong></a><br><p>Elon Musk’s companies xAI and X filed a sweeping US antitrust lawsuit on Monday against Apple and OpenAI, alleging the tech giants formed an illegal partnership to stifle competition in artificial intelligence and smartphone markets.
The 61-page complaint, filed in federal court in Texas, accuses Apple and OpenAI of entering an exclusive deal that makes OpenAI’s ChatGPT the only generative AI chatbot integrated into Apple’s iPhone operating system, while blocking rivals like xAI’s Grok.
“This is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,” the lawsuit states.
The plaintiffs claim Apple holds 65 per cent of the US smartphone market, while OpenAI controls at least 80pc of the generative AI chatbot market through ChatGPT.
Apple and OpenAI announced their partnership in June 2024, making ChatGPT the exclusive AI assistant accessible through Apple’s Siri voice assistant and other iPhone features.
The lawsuit alleges this arrangement gives ChatGPT exclusive access to “billions of user prompts” from hundreds of millions of iPhone users. The complaint also accuses Apple of manipulating App Store rankings to favour ChatGPT while delaying approval of updates to the Grok app.
Musk’s companies are seeking billions in damages and a permanent injunction to stop the alleged anticompetitive practices. They have demanded a jury trial.
Neither Apple nor OpenAI immediately responded to requests for comment.
The lawsuit follows threats Musk made earlier this month that triggered a fiery exchange with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.
Altman called Musk’s accusation of ranking manipulation “remarkable,” charging that Musk himself “manipulates X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like.”
Musk called Altman a “liar” in the heated exchange.
Both men were original founders of OpenAI before Musk’s departure in 2018 and now have a highly conflictual relationship. Musk founded xAI in 2023 to compete with OpenAI and other major AI players.</p><small>2025-08-25 16:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251603587ab4243.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937111/may-9-riots-faisalabad-atc-sentences-key-pti-leaders-omar-ayub-shibli-faraz-57-others-to-10-years-in-jail' target='_blank'><strong>May 9 riots: Faisalabad ATC sentences key PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, 57 others to 10 years in jail</strong></a><br><p>A Faisalabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday sentenced key PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz and Zartaj Gul, along with 56 others, to 10 years in jail and acquitted 34 in the case of an attack on former interior minister Rana Sanaullah’s house during the May 9, 2023 riots.
On May 9, 2023, military installations and state-owned buildings were vandalised as PTI supporters protested the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan, who was released later but has been imprisoned in various cases since August 2023. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including the party’s top leadership, were arrested.
Judge Javed Iqbal Sheikh presided over today’s hearing of the case registered at the Samanabad police on May 9, 2023.
PTI legal team head Malik Khalid Shafiq confirmed the convictions to Dawn.com. He said that out of the total 109 accused, 59 were handed 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and 16 were given three years’ jail time.
Ayub, Faraz and Gul, as well as Muhammad Ahmad Chattha, were recently disqualified from their parliamentary seats following their convictions in other May 9 cases.
Other PTI leaders included Sheikh Rashid Shafique (nephew of former interior minister Sheikh Rasheed), Ashraf Khan Sohna, Rai Hassan Nawaz, Rai Murtaza Iqbal, former MNA Kanwal Shauzab and former Punjab MPA Farah Agha. They were also convicted in other May 9 cases on July 31.
 
 

Former information minister Fawad Chaudhry, who quit PTI in the wake of the May 9 incidents, and MNA Zain Qureshi (son of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi) were among those freed of the charges today.
Fawad and Zain had also been acquitted in three other Faisalabad cases pertaining to the May 9 riots.
PTI parliamentarians convicted would face automatic disqualification under Article 63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.
Reacting to the court verdict, Gul said on X that she was innocent.
She contended that the verdict was based on the argument that she was present in a meeting held at Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore on May 7, 2023, where plans for the protest were reportedly made.
However, according to Gul, she was present in her Dera Ghazi Khan constituency on that day, attending a “fateha, inauguration, wedding and other events”. She also shared screengrabs of social media posts that showed her activities that day, adding that she had presented this evidence in court.
 






Ayub said he was never there outside Sanaullah’s house and the prosecution witnesses had not named him.
“In addition, these prosecution witnesses’ testimony was rejected by ATC Sargodha last year. These prosecution witnesses were branded as liars by the ATC Sargodha judge.  This brings the total jail sentences against me to 40 years.”
 






The deadline given to ATCs to decide various May 9 cases had already passed earlier this month. Therefore, day-to-day hearings were being held in the case, according to PTI lawyer Shafiq.
Last week, the Kasur Crime Control Department (CCD) presented former Faisalabad Civil Lines station house officer Zeeshan Khalid Randhawa as a witness during the trial. The former SHO was already under arrest in a separate kidnap and murder case of a Kasur resident.
A joint investigation team probing the case had been summoned by an ATC in July 2024 to submit the charge sheet.
Sentences against opposition pile up
Today’s convictions are the latest in a slew of ATC sentences, wherein over 100 PTI leaders and workers have been handed lengthy jail terms.
On July 22, a Lahore ATC had handed Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and other PTI leaders 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in a case related to vandalism at Sherpao Bridge. However, incarcerated Shah Mahmood Qureshi and five others were acquitted.
 
 

The same day, a Sargodha ATC had sentenced as many as 32 accused, including then-Punjab Assembly opposition leader Malik Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in a case registered at the Musakhel police station.
On July 31, a Faisalabad ATC had senten­ced over 100 PTI leaders and workers to up to 10 years’ imprisonment in three cases. Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, Zartaj Gul and Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza were among key opposition leaders handed 10 years’ jail time.
In one case, 60 out of 67 accused were convicted, while seven were acquitted. In another case, 107 out of 108 accused were sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment, while one person received a three-year sentence and 77 were acquitted.
On August 1, a Sargodha ATC sentenced PTI worker Muham­mad Ismail to rigorous life imprisonment in May 9 cases related to an attack on the judicial complex in Mianwali and declared 50 others as proclaimed offenders.</p><small>2025-08-25 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25195735be62bb8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937155/doctors-warn-diseases-trauma-can-kill-more-people-than-floods-in-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Doctors warn diseases, trauma can kill more people than floods in KP</strong></a><br><p>Constant rains and raging floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have already destroyed a large chunk of infrastructure and agricultural lands, including hundreds of houses, roads, and bridges, and washed away livestock.
The battered locals are now facing an even worse ordeal, the outbreak of waterborne and other diseases, in addition to psychological trauma.
The expected outbreak has prompted government health authorities and non-governmental relief organisations to set up makeshift clinics and medical camps, mainly across KP, to cope with the massive outbreaks of several waterborne and skin diseases.
Rains and flood-related accidents have already killed more than 400 people across the province since August 15, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
“Post-floods situation is even more dangerous as the lurking threat of outbreak can kill more people than floods did,” warned Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, the secretary general of the Pakistan Medical Association.
Speaking to Anadolu, Shoro called for an immediate “prevention plan” involving the provision of basic health necessities, including clean drinking water and hygiene, to mitigate the danger.
“Considering the given hygiene conditions, we cannot fully contain the outbreak and possible deaths, but a smart prevention plan can reduce the volume of a secondary disaster to a good extent,” he maintained.
Dr Mohammad Zahid Latif, head of the health division of Al-Khidmat Foundation, said that waterborne and skin diseases are already on the rise in the flood-stricken areas.
“Thousands of people, mainly children, have arrived with complaints of diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, dengue fever, malaria and skin issues. Thousands more [with similar complaints] are still stranded on the outskirts due to the blockade of roads and washing away of bridges,” he told Anadolu.
Reproductive and mental health requirements are another major issue, which the affected population is battling with, Latif pointed out.
“Many affected people have been brought to us with severe trauma and stress disorder because of the disaster they have gone through,” he said, fearing that the physical pain and injuries will heal in weeks or months, but the mental trauma will take a long time to go away.
Endorsing the view, Ataullah Khan, a spokesman for the KP Health Department, said the government had already taken steps to contain the problem.
“In addition to communicable diseases, people are also facing trauma and acute stress disorder. To handle the issue, the provincial government has sent trained psychiatrists to the flood-hit areas in collaboration with psychiatrist associations,” Khan told Anadolu.
CM gives 6-day deadline for payments to flood victims
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur chaired a meeting on the district-wise review of progress so far on payments of compensation to flood victims.
During the meeting, he issued a six-day deadline to officials for payments of all types of compensation.
“The pace of work on payments of compensation to victims should be further accelerated, ensuring payments of all types of compensation to victims by the upcoming Sunday. A feasible mechanism should be devised for payments of compensation to those minor children of deceased individuals who cannot have identity cards and bank accounts made,” the chief minister was quoted as saying in a statement on his X account.
CM Gandapur also ordered that compensation payments should be made to the relatives of those individuals who are still missing.
He said the amount required by the PDMA for payments of compensation to victims and rehabilitation works should be released immediately, adding that cash payments should be made to migrating families in Bajaur instead of non-food items.
 






He said additional teams from the health department should be deployed to expedite the verification process for the injured and affected homes and shops.
“Work should be started on collecting data for homes destroyed on waterways, discussions should be initiated with victims for constructing homes at safe locations for owners of such homes, arrangements should be made to pay 100,000 rupees per household for cleaning homes to those whose homes have floodwater and debris entered,” Gandapur said.
“The process of compensation payments to victims should be completed within the stipulated time so that we can start the early rehabilitation process. There is no shortage of resources for compensation payments to victims and rehabilitation. Complete transparency should be ensured in the use of funds for compensation payments to victims and rehabilitation works, for this purpose, the monitoring process should be made more effective.”</p><small>2025-08-25 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251953446edd95d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937148/punjab-cm-maryam-issues-evacuation-orders-from-areas-along-rivers-amid-flood-warnings' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM Maryam issues evacuation orders from areas along rivers amid flood warnings</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday issued orders to evacuate the people living in areas around rivers and low-lying ones ahead of heavy rains and flood predictions across the province.
Punjab is on high alert for floods before the arrival of a fresh monsoon spell as the provincial government on Saturday evacuated thousands of people along the Sutlej River, as the river surged to a high flood level at Ganda Singh Wala, recording a dangerous flow of 129,866 cusecs.
A statement by the chief minister’s office said that CM Maryam issued orders “to ensure timely evacuation of the stranded population in view of [the] arrival of flood torrents”.
She ordered access to “all possible available resources” to prevent loss of life, relocation of population from around rivers and low-lying areas to safe places, and prompt measures for the timely relocation of livestock to safe places, it added.
The chief minister directed authorities to “vigilantly monitor the flood situation of Sutlej River and other rivers”, make arrangements for the “accommodation, food and medical treatment” and provide “suitable temporary accommodation” to the flood victims, the statement read.
She also ordered the immediate provision of snakebite vaccines in the flood-affected areas, it added.
The statement also said that the district administration, Rescue 1122 and other departments in Kasur, Pakpattan, Taunsa Sharif and other flood-affected areas were directed to remain “alert and vigilant”.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Climate Change said on X that heavy rains in Gujranwala, Gujrat, and Lahore divisions were expected over the next 48 hours, “with a high risk of both riverine and urban flooding”. It advised citizens “to stay alert, follow safety precautions, and remain prepared during this period”.
 






Earlier today, the Foreign Office confirmed India’s flood warnings to Pakistan but stressed that the alerts were routed through diplomatic channels rather than the Indus Waters Commission, as stipulated under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
Last week, district administrations in Punjab started evacuating flood affectees from the inundated villages along the Sutlej and Indus rivers, which were experiencing low to medium level floods.
‘High flood level’ reported in Sutlej River: PDMA alert
The Pakistan Commission of Indus Waters reported “high flood level” in the Sutlej River at 10am, according to an alert by the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
The alert issued measures urging district administrations across Punjab to maintain a “high level of preparedness and mitigation of the disaster”.
The measures include effective coordination and response, activation of flood monitoring and early warning systems, and accurate and timely dissemination of information on safety measures and evacuation plans.
The district administrations were also asked to ensure “pre-placement of heavy earth-moving machinery at chokepoints/at-risk regions, and strengthening of embankments and inspection of flood protection structures”.
They were also advised to deploy additional staff and resources, ensure necessary equipment and transportation and establish relief camps which provide essential amenities, stockpile medicines and medical supplies and relocate livestock to higher ground and safe areas.
PMD issues flood warning for Chenab, Ravi
Separately, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued a flood warning for the Chenab River and Ravi River during the next 48 hours.
In its weather advisory, it said that “moderate rainfall has commenced over the upper catchments of the Eastern Rivers”, adding that the intensity of rainfall was  “likely to increase significantly”.
“Consequently, the flows in the Chenab River at Marala, Khunki and Qadir Abad, along with the nullahs and tributaries of the Chenab and Ravi, may rise high to very high flood levels during [the] next 48 hours,” the advisory read.
The PMD noted that the flood intensity in the Ravi River depended on the “releases from Madhupur Barrage in India”. “However, due to high to very high rainfall downstream of Madhupur Barrage and in the catchments of the nullahs of Ravi River, medium to high flood conditions may develop in the river.”
 






It also said that urban flooding was expected in Lahore, Gujranwala and Gujrat divisions during the next 48 hours due to intermittent high to very high rainfall.
“It is further informed that the Indian reservoirs on the Ravi and Sutlej are already at danger level,” the PMD said, urging authorities to take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation during the forecast period.</p><small>2025-08-25 15:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25185414cca76e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937146/spacex-postpones-starship-test-flight-over-ground-system-issue' target='_blank'><strong>SpaceX postpones Starship test flight over ground system issue</strong></a><br><p>Elon Musk’s SpaceX on Sunday called off the launch of Starship’s tenth mission from Texas over an issue at its launch site, delaying an attempt to achieve several long-sought development milestones missed due to past tests ending in early failures.
The 70.7-metre-tall Super Heavy booster and its 52m-tall Starship upper half sat stacked on a launch mount at SpaceX’s Starbase rocket facilities as it was being filled with propellant ahead of a liftoff time of 7:35pm ET (4:35am PKT).
But roughly 30 minutes from liftoff, SpaceX said on X that it was standing down to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems.
 






Musk had been poised to provide an update on Starship’s development progress prior to the rocket’s launch on Sunday, but a placeholder live stream indicated it had been cancelled.
Similar postponements in the past have been resolved in a matter of days. SpaceX is now targeting as soon as Monday, August 25, for Starship’s next launch attempt, according to its website.
Development of SpaceX’s next-generation rocket, the centre of the company’s powerful launch business future and Musk’s Mars ambitions, has faced repeated hiccups this year.
Two Starship testing failures early in flight, another failure in space on its ninth flight and a massive test stand explosion in June that sent debris flying into nearby Mexican territory have tested SpaceX’s test-to-failure development approach.
Still, the company has continued to swiftly produce new Starships for test flights at its sprawling Starbase production facilities. Nasa hopes to use the rocket as soon as 2027 for its first crewed moon landing since the Apollo programme.
The setbacks underscore the technical complexities of Starship’s latest iteration, packed with far more capabilities such as increased thrust, a potentially more resilient heat shield and stronger steering flaps crucial to nailing its atmospheric reentry — key traits for Starship’s rapid reusability that Musk has long pushed for.
The stacked system had been expected to blast off from Texas around sunset on Sunday before its Starship upper stage separated from the Super Heavy booster dozens of miles in altitude. Super Heavy, which has returned for a landing at its launch pad in giant mechanical arms in past tests, would have instead targeted the Gulf of Mexico for a soft water landing in order to test a backup engine configuration.
Starship was to briefly ignite its own engines to blast further into space, where it would have attempted to release its first batch of mock Starlink satellites and reignite an engine while on a suborbital path around the planet.
After that phase, the ship targets an atmospheric reentry over the Indian Ocean, a crucial flight phase that tests a variety of prototypical heat shield tiles and engine flaps designed to endure a barrage of blazing heat that has largely shredded the rocket’s exterior during past flights.
“Starship’s reentry profile is designed to intentionally stress the structural limits of the upper stage’s rear flaps while at the point of maximum entry dynamic pressure,” SpaceX said on its website.</p><small>2025-08-25 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620345-salman-akram-raja-decides-to-resign-as-pti-secretary-general' target='_blank'><strong>Salman Akram Raja decides to resign as PTI secretary general</strong></a><br><p>

Farhan, brother of PPP leader and Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani, was arrested and remanded in a terrorism and attempted murder case on Sunday for allegedly assaulting a government employee overseeing fibre optic network laying work on Sharea Faisal. Saeed had said his brother and his associates would voluntarily surrender themselves and prove their “innocence in court”.
Farhan, Shakeel and Qamar Ahmed were produced before the ATC today upon the completion of their one-day police custody.
The court asked the IO the charges under which the accused were booked, to which the IO responded that the accused had beaten up the complainant while he and others were laying down the fibre optic cable on Sharea Faisal.
Farhan, who did not have legal representation, denied the claim, stating that he was “falsely accused”. He went on to say that he was only passing by and, as TMC chairman, he had a “right to ask why the area had been dug up”.
“I asked for a permission certificate, but they could not produce one,” Farhan claimed, adding that it is his job “to stop anything illegal”.
In response to the court’s enquiry on how the suspects were arrested, the IO said they had turned themselves in.
 
 

The IO then requested the judge to grant the police 14-day custody of the suspects for further investigation. However, the court approved a four-day physical remand till August 28.
It also ordered the IO to present a progress report at the next hearing.
Complainant Hafiz Sohail Jadoon had filed a first information report (FIR) at the Ferozabad police station on late Saturday night.
According to the FIR, at around 4:47pm on August 22, around 20-25 persons, including Farhan, arrived at the site of the incident in three vehicles and asked him whether he had permission to dig up Sharea Faisal.
Jadoon alleged that he told them he had all the required permissions, but some of them misbehaved with him and asked him to stop the work immediately. The complainant said that when he insisted that he had all the required no-objection certificates, they started using abusive language and beating him.
He went on to say that the men dragged him at gunpoint to a room of a nearby fuel station, keeping him in illegal confinement and continued to beat him.
In the meantime, a police team arrived and rescued the complainant. They took him to the police station, where he lodged the FIR.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620336-india-contacts-pakistan-for-second-time-to-alert-about-potential-flood' target='_blank'><strong>India contacts Pakistan for second time to 'alert about potential flood'</strong></a><br><p>

An incident report from the City Samundri Police station house officer said a call was received at 7:22am that a man had thrown acid on the caller’s daughter in Housing Colony No. 1, adding that she was in critical condition and being taken to the hospital.
The SHO added that he and other police personnel reached the Samundri Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, where the victim’s father told them that his daughter was married to the suspect about a year ago but was still living with her parents.
The father told the police that the couple had an argument earlier today over household expenditure, due to which the husband got angry and threw acid on her, wounding her face, left shoulder and hands.
The report added that doctors administered first aid and referred her to the Allied Burn & Reconstructive Surgery Centre. The SHO said that legal proceedings were being implemented in the case.
Police spokesperson Mohammad Tariq told Dawn.com that raids were underway and the suspect would be arrested soon.
Acid attacks remain a persistent form of gender-based violence in Pakistan, often stemming from domestic disputes, with survivors facing lifelong physical and psychological trauma. In April, the Punjab government, in view of acid attacks on women, finalised a bill to regulate the business of acid in Punjab.
The draft law restricts every person from carrying out the business of acid without a licence. It instructs that no acid shall be sold to the person below the age of 18 years. The law has listed 30 types of acid.
On Sunday, a woman and a man suffered serious burns in separate acid attacks in Bahawalpur.
In June, an anti-terrorism court in Sahiwal sentenced a man to 14 years in prison and imposed a fine of Rs8.1 million for critically injuring his former mother-in-law and her 10-year-old son in a brutal acid attack.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620325-two-women-among-three-crushed-to-death-by-speeding-bus-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Woman among three crushed to death by speeding bus in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

“FIA has received information that criminal elements are harassing people by sending fake and fabricated FIRs on WhatsApp in the name of” the agency, the press release, available with Dawn.com, stated. “Citizens are named in fake FIRs and terrorised.”
 






“These elements try to present themselves as FIA officials by using fictitious and misleading names,” the agency added. “In such messages, attempts are being made to blackmail citizens by making serious allegations like ‘cybercrimes and terrorism’.”
The FIA stated that it does not send messages of this nature to people via WhatsApp and urged the public to file complaints about suspicious messages with the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which is the “authorised agency to investigate cybercrime”.
“Beware of fake messages, and never share your personal and financial information,” the FIA said.
A copy of the fake FIR was also shared with Dawn.com, registered under Sections 11H (fundraising), 11N (punishment under Sections 11H to 11K) and 11Q *(forfeiture) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, read with Section 3 (offence of money laundering) of the Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2010 and Sections 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
On August 8, the agency warned citizens against “fake emails and WhatsApp messages” being sent in its name.
“The FIA has received reports that some unknown individuals are harassing the public by sending fake emails and WhatsApp messages in the name of the DG FIA,” a statement issued by the agency’s spokesperson, Abdul Ghaffar, read.
“In these fake messages, the public is being terrorised by using the name and position of DG FIA,” the statement said, adding that fraudsters put a fake stamp of “Top Secret” on these messages to make them appear authentic.
On August 5, the Digital Rights Foundation issued an alert warning against an ongoing scam aiming to compromise WhatsApp accounts via fake calls requesting a code.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25153230bfe27c7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937115/worlds-first-commercial-co2-graveyard-opens-in-norway' target='_blank'><strong>World’s first commercial CO2 ‘graveyard’ opens in Norway</strong></a><br><p>The world’s first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway’s coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said on Monday.
Northern Lights, led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe.
The aim is to prevent emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.
“We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,” Northern Lights’ managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. “Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.”
In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway’s western coast.
It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 110-kilometre (68-mile) pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 2.6 kilometres, for permanent storage.
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries like cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonise.
The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany’s Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.
But CCS technology is complex and costly. Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase “pollution permits” on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.
Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe.
One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted’s biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.
Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.5 million tonnes, which is expected to increase to five million tonnes by the end of the decade.</p><small>2025-08-25 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/25164040ba8ccfb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937121/fo-confirms-indias-flood-warnings-notes-use-of-diplomatic-channel-over-iwc' target='_blank'><strong>FO confirms India’s flood warnings, notes use of diplomatic channel over IWC</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Monday said India had shared flood warnings with Pakistan but stressed that the alerts were routed through diplomatic channels rather than the Indus Waters Commission, as stipulated under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension.
Under paragraph 8 of Article IV of the IWT, “each party agrees to communicate to the other party, as far in advance as practicable, any information it may have in regard to such extraordinary discharges of water from reservoirs and flood flows as may affect the other party”.
Punjab is on high alert for floods before the arrival of a fresh monsoon spell as the provincial government on Saturday evacuated thousands of people along the Sutlej River, as the river surged to a high flood level at Ganda Singh Wala, recording a dangerous flow of 129,866 cusecs.
Amid the situation, a missive on Sunday from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, notified the government of a high flood in Jammu’s Tawi River that flows into the Chenab River.
Confirming the development today, FO Spokesperson Shahfqat Ali Khan said: “On August 24, 2025, India communicated flood warnings through diplomatic channels, rather than through the IWC as required under the IWT.
“We reaffirm that India is obligated to fully comply with all provisions of the treaty. India’s unilateral declaration to hold the treaty in abeyance constitutes a serious violation of international law and could have significant negative consequences for peace and stability in South Asia.”
An Indian government source told Reuters today that the country shared the warning on possible cross-border flooding on “humanitarian grounds” and not under the IWT.
The Indian High Commission in Islamabad shared the warning following heavy rains in occupied Kashmir, the source said. India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The source declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.</p><small>2025-08-25 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251547156ad415f.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937112/two-fc-personnel-martyred-18-injured-in-hangu-terrorist-attack-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two FC personnel martyred, 18 injured in Hangu terrorist attack: police</strong></a><br><p>At least two Federal Constabulary (FC) personnel were martyred and 18 others were injured in a terrorist attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu district, police said on Monday.
Kohat Regional Police Officer Abbas Majeed confirmed the incident to Dawn.com, saying that terrorists attacked an FC fort in the Torah Wadi area of ​​Doaba. “The terrorist fired and martyred two FC personnel and injured 18 others,” he said.
The officer said that the FC soldiers retaliated to the attack, “resulting in the death of six terrorists”. He added, “The terrorists managed to escape with the bodies of their accomplices.”
He also said that the martyred and injured personnel were taken to CMH Hospital after being provided with first aid.
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the terrorist attack on the Federal Reserve Police fort in Hangu by Fitna al Hindustan, state media APP reported.
In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
In a statement today, Naqvi paid tribute to the FC personnel “who embraced martyrdom while bravely resisting the assault” and directed authorities to ensure the best medical treatment for the injured personnel.
“The brave officers of the Federal Reserve Police [the term used for FC personnel] sacrificed their lives to foil the attack of India-sponsored terrorists,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. “The sacrifices of our martyrs will never go in vain.“
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Recent terrorist attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.
Earlier this month, five cops were martyred and another eight left injured as militants attacked police checkpoints at different locations across KP, including Peshawar, Upper Dir and Lower Dir.
Last month, nine terrorists were killed and three security officers were injured in an exchange of fire during an operation in Hangu.
Three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department in KP’s Bannu district on the night of July 16.</p><small>2025-08-25 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/251527453cf0819.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937113/traffic-accident-kills-3-at-karachis-drigh-road-underpass-police' target='_blank'><strong>Traffic accident kills 3 at Karachi’s Drigh Road Underpass: police</strong></a><br><p>Three people were killed and one was injured after a car hit a motorcycle at Karachi’s Drigh Road Underpass on Monday, officials said.

A spokesperson for the Eastern District police said that the accident took place within the limits of the Sharea Faisal police station.
“According to initial information, a car hit a motorcycle, causing serious injuries to passers-by who were taken to the hospital,” the spokesperson said.
He added that the driver of the car had been arrested and the vehicle was in custody.
Karachi’s Edhi Information Centre confirmed three fatalities, including two men and an unidentified woman, adding that another woman was injured. All were taken to Jinnah Hospital via Edhi ambulance.
The traffic police have issued an alert that the Drigh Road Underpass is blocked due to the incident, saying that an accident analysis team was inspecting the site.
“Traffic is being diverted over the underpass,” it added, directing citizens to the Traffic Police Helpline at 1915 to choose alternate routes.
Last week, a head-on collision involving a passenger coach and two pickups on the Quetta-Karachi national highway killed at least nine people, including police personnel, and left eight others injured.
Earlier this month, a couple was run over and killed by a fast-moving dumper truck in Karachi’s Sultanabad area.</p><small>2025-08-25 10:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620313-saeed-ghanis-brother-remanded-in-police-custody-in-govt-employee-assault-case' target='_blank'><strong>Saeed Ghani's brother remanded in police custody in govt employee assault case</strong></a><br><p>

“India’s economic outlook remains strong relative to peers, even as momentum has moderated in the past two years,” Fitch said in a statement.
The agency forecast GDP growth of 6.5 per cent for the fiscal year ending March 2026 (FY26), unchanged from FY25, and well above the ‘BBB’ median of 2.5pc.
Fitch’s rating comes days after S&P Global Ratings lifted its sovereign credit rating on India, citing strong economic growth, marking its first upgrade in 18 years.
Economic Affairs Secretary Anuradha Thakur had then said she expects other rating agencies to take note of the factors behind S&P’s upgrade and follow suit.
Domestic demand will remain “solid”, helped by the government’s ongoing capital spending drive and steady private consumption, Fitch said, but flagged that private investment will remain moderate due to risks from US tariffs.
US President Donald Trump has threatened to double tariffs on Indian goods to 50pc — among the highest rates imposed on Washington’s trade partners — targeting India’s oil purchases from Russia. The 50pc tariffs are set to kick in from August 27.
 
 

“US tariffs are a moderate downside risk to our forecast,” Fitch said, adding that they will reduce India’s ability to benefit from supply chain shifts out of China if tariff levels fail to be negotiated lower.
“Proposed goods and services tax (GST) reforms, if adopted, would support consumption, offsetting some of these growth risks,” Fitch added, referring to the tax restructuring promises made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month.</p><small>2025-08-25 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620312-omar-ayub-shibli-faraz-among-other-pti-leaders-sentenced' target='_blank'><strong>Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz among other PTI leaders sentenced in Sanaullah house attack case</strong></a><br><p>

Torrential rains on August 19 had flooded neighbourhoods, severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, left people stranded on roads for hours, disrupted industrial operations and led to prolonged power outages.
Thoroughfares are still riddled with potholes, exposing the devastation of Karachi’s road network and posing serious dangers to commuters across the metropolis.
 
 

Subsequently, as Karachiites left their homes for offices and schools this morning, they faced hurdles caused by accumulated rainwater and “development work” being carried out to repair the ruined roads, as reported by the traffic police.
Areas in the Malir, East and Korangi districts were affected, with locations including the busy thoroughfare of Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road near Shaheen Complex.
Dawn.com staffers also reported traffic congestion near Shaheen Complex and on Sharea Faisal at around 10am.
To avoid hassle and inconvenience, the Karachi Traffic Police (KTP) urged commuters to call the 1915 helpline for alternative routes.
At around 12pm, Google Maps showed most main arteries as having light traffic flow. However, multiple road blockages were reported across the city, notably in locations where roads had been inundated due to rainwater.
 

This Google Maps screengrab shows traffic flow across Karachi at around 12pm on Aug 25, 2025.

Following the recent heavy downpour, roads located within the territorial jurisdictions of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, cantonment boards, Karachi Development Authority, various town municipal corporations and other land-controlling agencies are in damaged condition.
Vital arteries impacted include both tracks of Shahrah-i-Sher Shah Suri, Shahrah-i-Pakistan, University Road, S.M. Taufiq Road, Jahangir Road, Manghopir Road, Shahrah-i-Qaddafi.
Other key arteries, including M.A. Jinnah and I.I. Chundrigar Road, also have cracks.
On the stretch adjacent to Burns Garden on Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road, rains have created a deep crater, raising questions about the authorities’ ability to maintain some of the busiest and most vital thoroughfares of the metropolis.
In an update at 7:37am, the traffic police said “development work on potholes” was being done on the second track of Natha Khan Bridge going towards the airport.
However, the statement said there was “no traffic problem” as vehicles passed through the sides.
 






In the Malir district, Madras Chowk heading to Sachal Goth and Muhammad Khan Goth and on Suparco Road, was blocked for traffic at 8:43am as “drain development work” was underway.
“Traffic is being diverted to other roads on both sides. Due to both roads being blocked, there’s traffic pressure at Madras Chowk,” the KTP said.
 






For similar work, both roads in front of Huma Lawn near Shaheen Chowk on Dr Ziauddin Ahmed were also closed for traffic at around 9am.
Commuters were being diverted towards Jang Press from Shaheen Complex and from S.M. Law College as well.
 






At the same time, slow traffic flow was reported at Munawar Chowrangi in Gulistan-i-Johar as developmental work was being carried out on the underpass.
 






Another point impacted by accumulated rainwater and potholes was Checkpost No. 6 towards Tank Chowk near Malir Cantonment. The traffic police said it was managing the “slow” traffic flow.
 






Slow traffic flow was also reported at the main Superhighway in front of Sachal Mor before the Punjab Adda bus stand. The Frontier Works Organisation was carrying out cleaning on the first track, the KTP said.
 






Rainwater accumulation and potholes also caused traffic delays on Kashif Shaheed Chowk going towards Jamali Bridge on Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi Road at 9:18am, as vehicles were moving via a single track.
 






Bagh-i-Korangi Road from Awami Cut to Mazaar Cut was closed for traffic at 9:20am due to damage and flooding. “Traffic is being diverted to another road with double traffic,” the police said.
 






At 10:35am, traffic was moving at a slow speed on EBM Causeway heading towards Baloch Colony and Brookes Chowrangi, with KTP citing rainwater accumulation and potholes on the road as the reasons.
 






Slow traffic was also witnessed at Drigh Road Underpass, which had been closed for traffic due to rainwater last week, at 11:33am as Karachi Cantonment Board was doing drainage work.

The move came over a month after the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and the World Bank teams conducted the 12th and final mission to review and evaluate progress against the targets set under the Higher Education Development in Pakistan (HEDP) project.
“The World Bank has approved a US$47.9 million grant, funded by the Global Partnership for Education Fund, to help improve girls’ and boys’ participation at pre-primary and primary levels in Pakistan’s Punjab province,” the organisation said in a press release dated August 23, shared on social media today.
According to the press release, the GRADES-Balochistan project will also improve the responsiveness of the education sector to climate change and emergencies.
Among the four million children that the project aims to benefit are 80,000 out-of-school children, over 3m in School Education Department (SED) schools, 850,000 in the non-formal sector, and 140,000 differently-abled children in Special Education Department (SpED) schools, it said.
The World Bank added that over 100,000 teachers and school leaders, as well as parents and community members, would benefit through professional development and awareness campaigns.
“The project is aligned with the Government of Punjab’s broader education reform agenda, which seeks to create a more effective, accountable, and inclusive education system,” said Izza Farrakh, World Bank Task Team Leader for the project, according to the release. “It will do so by supporting the government’s efforts to improve governance, management, and capacity in the education sector.“
Bolormaa Amgaabazar, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan, called the project a “crucial step towards addressing learning poverty and ensuring equitable access to quality education across Punjab”.
The statement added that the project targeted those populations that were most vulnerable, in line with the group’s goals of eliminating extreme poverty and the promotion of “shared prosperity” and its Country Partnership Framework (CPF) with Pakistan.
It highlighted that Pakistan had been a member of the World Bank since 1950 and that since this time, the World Bank had provided over $48.3bn to the country in assistance.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, had invested approximately $13bn in Pakistan since 1956, it added. The projects it funded supported renewable energy, financial inclusion, infrastructure, healthcare and agribusiness, among others.
The current portfolio has 54 projects and a total commitment of $15.7bn.
In June, the World Bank had ap­­proved $100m for the “Getting Results: Access and Delivery of Quality Education Services in Balochistan” (GRADES-Balochistan) project, which aimed to benefit around 250,000 students by increasing enrolment and improving literacy.</p><small>2025-08-25 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620299-three-fc-personnel-martyred-17-injured-in-hangu-terrorist-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Three FC personnel martyred, 17 injured in Hangu terrorist attack</strong></a><br><p>

The Indian government has been considering projects since the early 2000s to control the flow of water from Tibet’s Angsi Glacier, which sustains more than 100 million people downstream in China, India and Bangladesh.
But the plans have been hindered by fierce and occasionally violent resistance from residents of the border state of Arunachal Pradesh, who fear their villages will be submerged and way of life destroyed by any dam.
Then in December, China announced that it would build the world’s largest hydropower dam in a border county just before the Yarlung Zangbo river crosses into India.
That triggered fears in New Delhi that its longtime strategic rival — which has some territorial claims in Arunachal Pradesh — could weaponise its control of the river, which originates in the Angsi Glacier and is known as the Siang and Brahmaputra in India.
India’s largest hydropower company in May moved survey materials under armed police protection near a prospective site of the Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam, which would be the country’s biggest dam, if completed.
Senior Indian officials have also been holding meetings about accelerating construction this year, including one organised in July by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office, according to two of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive government matters.
Delhi’s concerns were described in the undated Indian government analysis of the Chinese dam’s impact, the specifics of which Reuters corroborated with four sources and is reporting for the first time.
Beijing hasn’t released detailed plans about the dam’s construction, but the analysis drew on past work conducted by Indian government-affiliated institutions like the Central Water Commission and accounted for the expected size of the Chinese project, which broke ground in July and will cost nearly $170 billion.
Delhi estimates the Chinese dam will allow Beijing to divert as much as 40 billion cubic meters of water, or just over a third of what is received annually at a key border point, according to the sources and the document.
The impact would be especially acute in the non-monsoon months, when temperatures rise and lands become barren across swathes of India.
The Upper Siang project would alleviate that with its projected 14 BCM of storage capacity, allowing India to release water during the dry season. That could mean the major regional city of Guwahati, which is dependent on water-intensive industry and farming, would see a reduction in supply of 11pc, according to the sources and the document, as opposed to 25pc if the Indian dam isn’t built.
The project could also mitigate any move by Beijing to release devastating torrents of water downstream, the sources said.
If the dam is at its minimum drawdown level — where water is stored at less than 50pc of its height — it would be able to fully absorb any excess water released from a breach in Chinese infrastructure, according to the document and the sources.
India is considering a proposal to keep 30pc of its dam empty at any time in order to account for unexpected surges, two of the sources said.
A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said in response to Reuters’ questions that the hydropower projects “have undergone rigorous scientific research on safety and environmental protection, and will not adversely impact the water resources, ecology, or geology of downstream countries.”
“China has always maintained a responsible attitude toward the development and utilisation of transboundary rivers, and has maintained long-term communication and cooperation with downstream countries such as India and Bangladesh,” the spokesperson added.
Modi’s office and the Indian ministries responsible for water and external affairs did not respond to Reuters’ questions. State-owned hydropower major NHPC also did not return a request for comment.
India’s foreign ministry has said that top diplomat S. Jaishankar raised concerns about the dam during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart on August 18. A Jaishankar deputy also told lawmakers in August that the government was implementing measures to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of citizens in downstream areas, including building the dam.
India has itself been accused by Pakistan, a Chinese ally that it briefly clashed with in May, of weaponising water. Delhi this year suspended its participation in a 1960 water-sharing treaty with Islamabad and is considering diverting flows from another crucial river away from its downstream neighbour.
An international tribunal has ruled that India must adhere to the agreement but Delhi says the panel lacks jurisdiction.
 

India aims to construct a dam in its northeast to mitigate the potential impacts of a massive dam being built across the border in China.

Development or destruction?
When NHPC workers moved surveying materials near the village of Parong in May, angry locals damaged their machinery, destroyed a nearby bridge and looted the tents of police sent to guard the operation.
Many of them are members of Arunachal’s Adi community, who live off paddy, orange and sweet lime farms in the mist-shrouded hills and valleys nourished by the Siang.
The villagers have set up makeshift watch posts on regional roads to deny access to NHPC workers. That has forced security personnel to trek miles, often under the cover of night, to reach a prospective site of the dam.
At least 16 Adi villages are likely to be lost to the storage area of the dam, directly affecting an estimated 10,000 people, according to two of the sources.
Community leaders say more than 100,000 people will be impacted overall.
“The cardamom, paddy, jackfruit and pear we grow on this land help educate our children and support our family,” said Odoni Palo Pabin, an Adi grocer and mother of two. “We will fight the dam to death.”
The dam has the support of Arunachal’s chief minister, who is a member of Modi’s party and has called the Chinese project an existential threat.
The project will “ensure water security and provide flood moderation to counter any potential water surges,” the state government said in a statement, adding that it decided in June to engage in detailed compensation discussions with families that could be affected by the dam.
Lawmaker Alo Libang, an Adi who represents an area that would be submerged by the Indian project, said he believed locals could be convinced to move if they received generous compensation.
NHPC has plans to spend more than $3 million on education and emergency infrastructure to incentivise the villagers to move elsewhere, three of the sources said, citing instructions from Modi’s office.
In one sign of progress, three villages in the area recently agreed to let NHPC officials carry out dam-related work, according to the Arunachal government and dozens of locals.
India has a history of activist movements against large dams, which have sometimes slowed these projects by years or forced them to scale down.
Even if the Upper Siang dam gets the go-ahead, it could take a decade to build after breaking ground, according to four of the sources.
That means the project would likely be completed after China’s project, which Beijing expects to start generating power by the early-to-mid 2030s.
The delay means an Indian project would be vulnerable during construction if Beijing suddenly releases water during the monsoon season, triggering a surge that could wash away temporary dams, two of the sources said.
International experts and Adi activists have also warned that building large dams in seismically active Tibet and Arunachal could heighten risks for downstream communities.
The Chinese “dam is being built in a zone of high seismicity and in a zone that experiences extreme weather events,” said Sayanangshu Modak, an expert on the India-China water relationship at the University of Arizona.
“These kinds of extreme weather events trigger landslides, mudslides, glacial lake outburst flooding,” he said. “So that raises concerns about dam safety… it’s a very legitimate concern, and India should engage with China.”</p><small>2025-08-25 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620290-nab-exposes-trillions-lost-in-kp-placer-gold-mining-deals' target='_blank'><strong>NAB exposes trillions lost in KP placer gold mining deals</strong></a><br><p>
