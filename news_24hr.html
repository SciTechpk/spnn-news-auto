The US State Department made the announcement yesterday, stating that the designations demonstrated the US President Donald Trump’s commitment to counter-terrorism.
In today’s press release, the FO emphasised that Pakistan had proscribed the Majeed Brigade — BLA’s suicide squad — as a terrorist entity since July 18, 2024.  The BLA itself was proscribed in 2006, according to the National Counter-Terrorism Authority’s list of proscribed organisations.
 






“BLA/Majeed Brigade is involved in multiple terrorist attacks in Pakistan, including the heinous Jaffer Express terrorist incident and the Khuzdar bus attack that resulted in the loss of precious lives,” the release said.
At least 26 hostages lost their lives in the Jaffar Express attack in March, for which the BLA claimed responsibility. In the Khuzdar bus attack, 10 people — including two students — lost their lives during a suicide attack on a school bus in May.
The group was also behind the 2024 attack near the Karachi airport, which killed three people, including two Chinese nationals, as well as the Gwadar Port Authority Complex attack, which claimed the lives of eight soldiers.
“Pakistan remains a steadfast bulwark against terrorism. Our sacrifices have secured critical counter-terrorism successes, not only for the country, but for regional stability and global security.”
It added that the country remained unwavering in its resolve to protect its citizens and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. “Pakistan remains committed to cooperating with the international community to overcome this common challenge.”
Islamabad had previously requested that the Majeed Brigade be listed as an international terrorist organisation. In 2019, the State Department labelled the BLA as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), making it a crime for anyone in the US to assist the militants, but did not designate the Majeed Brigade at that time.
FTO designations are made by the Secretary of State, following section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and “are an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business”.
SDGT designations, meanwhile, target individuals and groups under Executive Order 13224, even if they are not part of a formally recognised organisation.</p><small>2025-08-12 09:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618475-holiday-announced-in-islamabad-on-august-13' target='_blank'><strong>Holiday announced in Islamabad on August 13</strong></a><br><p>

In November 2024, a Lahore anti-terrorism court had denied Imran bail in the cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots, including an attack on the house of the Lahore corps commander.
The incarcerated PTI leader’s plea challenging that was also rejected by the LHC on June 24. Subsequently, days later, Imran moved the Supreme Court against the high court’s decision.
A three-member bench led by CJP Afridi, which also included Justices Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, resumed hearing the bail pleas today.
Barrister Salman Safdar appeared on behalf of Imran, while Punjab Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi was representing the state.
During the hearing, CJP Afridi took note of some “findings” issued by the LHC in its detailed verdict of dismissing Imran’s bail pleas.
 
 

“Can final observations be given in a case for bail?” the chief justice questioned rhetorically.
Based on the same principle, he said, “For now, we will not touch upon whether the findings in this case are right or not. We will not go into the legal matters at the moment.
“If we touch upon the legal findings, then the case for either [party] can be affected,” CJP Afridi explained.
He directed the counsels of both respondents to assist the court with legal questions and complete their preparations by the next hearing.
“The Supreme Court will not issue any such findings that may affect the case,” the top judge reiterated.
At one point, Safdar requested the court to allow him to speak at the rostrum but CJP Afridi denied that plea.
Subsequently, the bench issued notices to the Punjab government and adjourned the hearing till August 19.
‘Engineered and fabricated evidence’
A two-member bench of the SC had taken up Imran’s bail pleas on June 29, but adjourned the hearing without issuing notices as Safdar could not appear.
Imran’s appeal, filed through Safdar, claimed that the PTI founder has been accused of conspiring and abetting violence on May 9.
However, at the time of the alleged offence, Imran was in the custody of the National Accountability Bureau. Therefore, his involvement in violence was “impossible”, the petition argued.
On LHC’s rejection of the bail pleas, the fresh appeal claimed that the court relied on “engineered and fabricated evidence” which included “stale, discredited and delayed statements of police officials”.
In its detailed verdict, the two-member LHC bench comprising Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi and Tariq Mahmood Bajwa observed that the prosecution had evidence that reflected Imran’s role in the violence that broke out on May 9 following his arrest.
The bench reproduced the statements of two police officials and prosecution witnesses, who claimed to have secretly attended PTI’s meetings wherein Imran allegedly gave instructions to other leaders to attack military installations in case of his imminent arrest from the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The meetings were allegedly held at a rest area of Chakri, Rawalpindi, on May 4 and at Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore on May 7-9, 2023.</p><small>2025-08-12 08:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/12133807f028496.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930391/lahore-atc-orders-confiscation-of-properties-owned-by-dr-yasmin-rashid-other-pti-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC orders confiscation of properties owned by Dr Yasmin Rashid, other PTI leaders</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Tuesday ordered the confiscation of properties owned by PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed a day after they were convicted in two May 9 cases.
ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill on Monday sentenced the four PTI leaders to 10 years in prison in the cases pertaining to the Shadman police station attack and burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House. The court, however, acquitted former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the cases.
Today’s hearing was also taken up by Gill, who ordered the confiscation of the convicted PTI leaders’ properties.
The judge issued jail warrants for the leaders and handed them to the jail superintendent.
In its verdict yesterday, the ATC had also fined Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema and Rasheed Rs600,000. PTI leaders Aliya Hamza and Sanam Javed were sentenced to five years in prison in the Shadman case.
 
 

In a separate development today, Judge Gill ordered the release of Qureshi in the two cases.
“If Shah Mehmood Qureshi is not wanted in any other case, then he should be released,” Judge Gill said.
Despite the fresh acquittal, Qureshi will still not be released from jail as he has other cases pertaining to the May 9 riots pending before the courts.
On Saturday, the ATC had reserved its verdict in the two cases after completing proceedings at Kot Lakhpat jail. The judge concluded the hearings inside the jail in two sessions during the whole day.
Last month, the Lahore ATC had acquitted Qureshi while sentencing Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema, Rashid and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.</p><small>2025-08-12 08:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618464-lahore-atc-orders-qureshis-release-following-acquittal-in-two-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC orders Qureshi's release following acquittal in two May 9 cases</strong></a><br><p>

He also showed up in New York City politics, snatching a huge victory no one saw coming.
But his win wasn’t the point.
The point was that we had arrived — my family’s sudden competition to claim biradari with this kinetic smiling, charismatic new player. Could he be more than just a family friend? Could his family be in our faded photo albums? If we try hard, could he be a distant cousin?
The last time the lot of us were this giddy was, well, never. When was the last time a Kampala-born-desi-beard-trotting-Muslim had the white supremacists worried? Well, never.
More than just politics
All of us siblings were born in Kampala Nsambya Hospital. Like Mamdani’s family, Uganda is home. We have eaten its staple foods and lived its wars. For us, Zohran isn’t just a headline, and he certainly is not a meme. His dad, Mehmood Mamdani, was a friend of my dad’s since both were academicians — a visitor to our home, not just a name on a Wikipedia page. His mother, Mira Nair, filmed the critically acclaimed movie Mississippi Masala in Kampala’s streets. I’m hoping it’s true that we might’ve been extras behind Denzel Washington. No.
For us, Zohran is more than a fragment of the past; he is tracing the steps of historic exile routes our forefathers took in the chaotic aftermath of dictatorship and dispossession. Zohran’s ascent means more than just politics. It means we get to shape it. His proximity to power in America is where we can imagine a life where we immigrants weren’t kicked out on some nostalgia-driven nationalism. But we were, from India, Uganda, Pakistan, to now the United States, which reminds us of the Uganda of the 80s.
We pride ourselves on knowing men with unchecked anger. Idi Amin, the former Ugandan president whose shadow stretches long over Kampala’s vanished Asians, was our best prototype, against whom dutiful obedience was the only rational response.
 
 

Zohran Mamdani is helping us imagine a strange new world, Beatles style, where we didn’t have to be uprooted in the first place, nor silenced. A world where we are not just mentioned in the news, but are of it.
So no, our WhatsApp chatter is not delusional — we are rarely on the main stage like this. We get to be giddy. We will remain giddy. It is our time. The global muhajirs have the mic now.
The real political act
After generations of being on the margins of power, Mamdani’s mayoral campaign — a cocktail of audacity and humour — shook us to the core. He was not invited; he came anyway.
That is the real political act — not his win, but his irreverent entrance.
Conversely, the non-Mamdani rulebook of survival is — do not show up uninvited anywhere. When asked to leave, leave. If you’re built like us immigrants, you pour your identity hyphens into the American Dream. You show up for 50-hour workweeks, write a few books or make a few films, maybe save a life during a pandemic or build tech tools to improve tomorrow. You provide utility.
 
 

But run for office? Take on Trump? “To what end?” whispers my grandmother’s ghost.
If we wanderers take something on, we cannot come out as victims. In fact, we sort of hate victims of tyrants. We think it is a dumb way to die. We are the first to say we-told-you-so when they are squashed. Schadenfreude perhaps. We think that if an iron-fisted general wins and a revolutionary loses, that makes the most sense. Even if it is not moral, at least it is predictable.
Our elders survived through invisibility — never invited, never at any chief’s table, be it Ugandan, Pakistani, British or American. Even our nostalgia wears a warning label: “Things can always get worse than they already are.”
Strongmen do, however, lose their novelty after round one.
Idi Amin lost to Yoweri Museveni.
Others will lose it to others, over time.
Mamdani and the new America
Around 1990, as a kid, I may have handed welcome flowers to Museveni — Uganda’s current president — when he visited my father’s university. That was as close as my people had ever been to politics. Every revolution in our 35-year family home in Uganda left us with slogans to obey: “Uganda for Ugandans,” “Africa for Africans,” and for us ominously brown folk: “Shoot Asians at sight.”
Fear kept us small and silent.
Now that I’m in America, nostalgia is “Make America Great Again” hats and “Ultra MAGA” car stickers.
We are allowed to entertain. Our English has a lilt. Our self-deprecation fascinates. We’re exotic, right up until we’re too much — then it’s deportation notice: Next stop, South Sudan. That’s the game.
In this new America, Mamdani refuses to play.
He has gusto, he trolls the creeping-Shariah fearmongers and wields sarcasm like a shield. He called out Islamophobia in the press, poked fun at “go back to where you came from” by announcing that he is going back to Uganda. He went mocking up satirical magazine covers: “Kampala-etely Crazy!” Every insult he flipped became a lesson in not blinking. America’s youth, tired of being talked down, tuned in.
 






When American power flexes — defunds NPR, bullies universities for Gaza protests, scrubs aid records, calls off inconvenient investigations — you know for sure it is not democratic. We, the recovering targets of dictators, see it too clearly.
Mamdani has the legacy of that clarity, and he is undaunted. He’s marching where we used to tiptoe. We’re cheering, even if quietly, because he’s doing what we never dared to do. Nor would, frankly. The threat is not imagined; it is real.
But here’s the thing, assimilation is an illusion.
Even if you whisper, you get noticed; sometimes threatened, at times killed. My family learned this when gunmen broke into our house in Kampala’s peaceful teacher housing on campus, shot my mother near her foot, and just missed — “just” as a warning to stay in our place. From this incident, we learned that shrinking does not keep you safe.
The moment of revenge
How is Mamdani different from us lot?
He knows compliance does not guarantee safety. He knows that trying to act like the opposite of the brown savage stereotype will not spare you. The stereotype itself is a trap: perfect victims are easy targets. The world always prefers its brown people meek.
In fact, even brown people prefer brown people meek.
My two-decade-long Pakistani experiment taught me one thing — there is no room for a Mamdani among Pakistanis. They will be picked up and disappeared.
If there were a Mamdani way to do Pakistan, it would be to look like the power elite’s biggest nightmare (Ahmadi, Christian, Hindu, and Sikh), then step into office looking exactly like one.
Back to the real American contest: Not Democrat vs Republican, but David vs Goliath — we are always told ambition is dangerous, but without it, you become scenery.
Obama had his Americanism questioned. On CNBC, Colin Powell, the four-star general, was asked to answer if Obama had any Muslim ancestry at all: But instead, Colin Powell responded by pushing back on the indignity of the question: “So what if Obama is Muslim? Can’t he still be president?”
That’s America. That was 2008.
 


In 2025, Mamdani is that exact “what if?” kid — daring, public, and resolutely plural.
Our family, tucked safely behind digital borders, gives him the highest honour imaginable: thumbs-up emojis in our private group chat. When you win over the silent ones, you’re on to something.
America is not about this candidate’s win; sometimes it’s about who dares to try despite the threat. Mamdani raising his slingshot is a moment for every underdog.
Mamdani takes the hate, hears the death threats, but stands up to remind us that the world is not a monolith. He’s ready to pay the price for changing the narrative, and every family WhatsApp thread from Lyari to Kampala just got a little bolder, because he did.</p><small>2025-08-12 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/121157441bd3a0b.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930387/trump-signs-order-to-extend-china-tariff-truce-by-90-days' target='_blank'><strong>Trump signs order to extend China tariff truce by 90 days</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Monday ordered a delay in the re-imposition of higher tariffs on Chinese goods, hours before a trade truce between Washington and Beijing was due to expire.
The White House’s halt on steeper tariffs will be in place until November 10.
“I have just signed an executive order that will extend the tariff suspension on China for another 90 days,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. The truce on steeper levies had been due to expire on Tuesday.
 


While the US and China slapped escalating tariffs on each other’s products this year, bringing them to prohibitive triple-digit levels and snarling trade, both countries in May agreed to temporarily lower them.
As part of their May truce, fresh US tariffs targeting China were reduced to 30 percent and the corresponding level from China was cut to 10pc.
Those rates will now hold until November — or whenever a deal is cut before then.
Around the same time that Trump confirmed the new extension, Chinese state media Xinhua news agency published a joint statement from US-China talks in Stockholm saying it would also extend its side of the truce.
China will continue suspending its earlier tariff hike for 90 days starting August 12 while retaining a 10pc duty, the report said.
It would also “take or maintain necessary measures to suspend or remove non-tariff countermeasures against the US, as agreed in the Geneva joint declaration,” Xinhua reported.
In the executive order posted on Monday to its website, the White House reiterated its position that there are “large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits” and they “constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.”
The order acknowledged Washington’s ongoing discussions with Beijing “to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship” and noted that China has continued to “take significant steps toward remedying” the US complaints.
Trump-Xi summit?
“Beijing will be happy to keep the US-China negotiation going, but it is unlikely to make concessions,” warned William Yang, an analyst at the International Crisis Group.
He believes China sees its leverage over rare earth exports as a strong one, and that Beijing will likely use it to pressure Washington.
US-China Business Council president Sean Stein said the current extension is “critical to give the two governments time to negotiate an agreement” providing much-needed certainty for companies to make plans.
A trade deal, in turn, would “pave the way for a Trump-Xi summit this fall,” said Asia Society Policy Institute senior vice president Wendy Cutler.
But Cutler, herself a former US trade official, said: “This will be far from a walk in the park.”
 
 

Since Trump took office, China’s tariffs have essentially boomeranged, from the initially modest 10pc hike in February, followed by repeated surges as Beijing and Washington clashed, until it hit a high of 145pc in April.
Now the tariff has been pulled back to 30pc, a negotiated truce rate.
Even as both countries reached a pact to cool tensions after high level talks in Geneva in May, the de-escalation has been shaky.
Key economic officials convened in London in June as disagreements emerged and US officials accused their counterparts of violating the pact.
Policymakers met again in Stockholm last month.
Trump said in a social media post on Sunday that he hoped China will “quickly quadruple its soybean orders,” adding that this would be a way to balance trade with the US.
 


China’s exports reached record highs in 2024, and Beijing reported that their exports exceeded expectations in June, climbing 5.8pc year-on-year, as the economic superpower works to sustain growth amid Trump’s trade war.
Separately, since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has slapped a 10pc “reciprocal” tariff on almost all trading partners, aimed at addressing trade practices Washington deemed unfair.
This surged to varying steeper levels last Thursday for dozens of economies.
Major partners like the European Union, Japan and South Korea now see a 15pc US duty on many products, while the level went as high as 41pc for Syria.
The “reciprocal” tariffs exclude sectors that have been targeted individually, such as steel and aluminum, and those that are being investigated like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
They are also expected to exclude gold, although a clarification by US customs authorities made public last week caused concern that certain gold bars might still be targeted.
Trump said on Monday that gold imports will not face additional tariffs, without providing further details.
The president has taken separate aim at individual countries such as Brazil over the trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of planning a coup, and India over its purchase of Russian oil.
Canada and Mexico come under a different tariff regime.</p><small>2025-08-12 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/121155176c766fb.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930384/italian-athlete-dies-at-world-games-in-china' target='_blank'><strong>Italian athlete dies at World Games in China</strong></a><br><p>Italian orienteering athlete Mattia Debertolis died on Tuesday at the World Games in Chengdu, China after collapsing during competition, organisers said.
Debertolis, 29, was found unconscious during an orienteering event on August 8 and died four days later, said a joint statement from World Games organisers and the International Orienteering Federation (IOF).
The World Games is a multisport event held every four years for disciplines not included in the Olympics.
“Despite receiving immediate expert medical care at one of China’s leading medical institutions, he passed away,” the statement said.
It did not provide details on the cause of death.
Orienteering sees athletes navigate an unmarked course with a map and compass, punching in at designated spots along the route in the quickest time.
The event, held about 50 kilometres outside of central Chengdu, took place in intense heat and humidity, with temperatures above 30 degrees.
Debertolis, from Primiero in eastern Italy, was taking part in the final of the men’s middle-distance event when he collapsed.
The six-km course featured 180m of ascent and 20 control points that athletes must visit.
Footage from the World Games’ social media accounts showed athletes running through crop fields and villages on a largely rural course.
The winner, Switzerland’s Riccardo Rancan, completed the course in 45 minutes and 22 seconds.
“I needed to acclimatise quickly with hot and humid conditions. I think I managed quite well,” Chinese state media quoted Rancan as saying.
Debertolis was listed as “Did Not Finish” in official results, along with 11 other athletes.
He was ranked 137th in the men’s Orienteering World Rankings and had been competing since 2014, according to the IOF website.
He participated in several World Championships and World Cups as part of the Italian team.
Alongside his training, Debertolis was studying for a PhD at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, where he lived.
This is the 12th edition of the World Games and it runs until August 17, with approximately 4,000 athletes competing in 253 events.
The men’s middle-distance orienteering was the first medal event of the Chengdu Games.
World Games organisers and the IOF were “struck by this tragedy and extend their heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of the athlete and the whole orienteering community”, the joint statement read.
“Our thoughts are with those touched by this event.” Organisers will “continue to support the family of Mattia Debertolis and the orienteering community in every possible way”, it added.</p><small>2025-08-12 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1211331786bcf49.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930380/another-3-terrorists-eliminated-in-zhob-anti-infiltration-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Another 3 terrorists eliminated in Zhob anti-infiltration operation</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have eliminated another three terrorists attempting to infiltrate via the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Balochistan’s Zhob district, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
The military’s anti-infiltration operation, which began on the night of August 7, has so far killed 50 terrorists.
“On night [of] 10/11 August 2025, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Sambaza along [the] Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” the Inter-Services Public Relations said in a press release.
“During the conduct of the operation, three more Indian sponsored khawarij were hunted down and successfully neutralised. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed khawarij,” the ISPR added.
 






Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The ISPR highlighted: “The number of khawarij killed in four days’ anti-infiltration operation has risen to 50.”
It noted that “47 khwarij were sent to hell” previously, following successful engagements by the security forces in the general area Sambaza of Zhob from August 7 to 9.
The military also shared collages of images showing an aerial view of the eliminated terrorists — all 50 of them numbered — as evidence.
 
 

“The security forces remain committed to secure the nation’s frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan,” the military reaffirmed.
Just a day ago, the US State Department designated the banned so-called Balo­chistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its combat wing, the Majeed Brig­ade, as a Foreign Terr­­orist Organisation.
The US said the move, long-desired by Pakistan, demonstrated its commitment to countering terrorism, while signalling strengthened cooperation and international coordination in the fight against terrorism.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP broke its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-08-12 06:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618460-flooding-feared-in-punjab-rivers-amid-rains-possible-water-release-by-india' target='_blank'><strong>Flooding feared in Punjab rivers amid rains, possible water release by India</strong></a><br><p>

Mr Gandapur’s petition requested that Dr Asim Yousaf, Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Samina Niazi be permitted to conduct the monthly check-ups and that the reports be submitted to the court and given to Mr Khan’s family.
It cites concerns over possible health complications for the 72-year-old founder of the party, who has reportedly lost weight during his detention.
 
 

The petition, filed through Advocate Raja Zahoorul Hassan, noted that Khan’s complete medical history is maintained at Shaukat Khanum Hospital.
It named the Punjab government, the inspector general of prisons, Adiala Jail Hospital, and Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital as respondents.

The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) along with other groups held a protest at the site of the demolished Madni mosque near Rawal Dam Chowk. The protesters also uprooted the saplings planted by the CDA on the place. The mosque had been demolished late Saturday night.
The JUI-F Member of National Assembly, Naeema Kishwar, also submitted a resolution condemning the demolition of Madni mosque.
 






Addressing the protesters, JUI-F Islamabad chapter Emir Mufti Owais Aziz announced that legal proceedings would be initiated against the demolition of the mosque. He said the government was planning to raze 50 mosques in Islamabad and vowed to resist the move.
He said the religious groups have unanimously agreed to get an FIR registered against Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and other officials under blasphemy laws.
“If the police refuse to register the case, we will consider them enemies of Islam,” Mufti Owais Aziz said, adding that razing mosques overnight was an act of hostility towards Islam.

He further said the Frontier Corps was illegally occupying greenbelts along Embassy Road and Margalla Road.
“While the mosques are being demolished in the name of beautification, no action was taken against the illegal occupation by FC on these prime roads,” he questioned.
As tension flared, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, along with commissioner Islamabad, inspector general of Islamabad police and deputy commissioner held negotiations on Sunday night with a delegation of clerics led by Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haidari. The delegation also included the leader of the Islamabad chapter of the proscribed Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan.
The statement issued by the JUI-F said it had been agreed that further progress would require 48 hours, and a final decision would be made after meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
Amid threats of violent protests by the clerics, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said spreading baseless rumours about madressahs and mosques was incorrect.
In a statement, he said the madressah located on Murree Road was relocated with the consent of its administration.
“A modern-style facility has been constructed on the new site at a cost of Rs40 million, which provided high-quality accommodation, meals and religious education to around 200 students,” the minister said in a statement.
He emphasised that any relocation of madressahs or mosques situated on greenbelts or unauthorised land would only be carried out in consultation with religious scholars and the administration.
Meanwhile, fire band cleric Maulana Abdul Aziz has issued a call for jihad and announced the launch of a civil disobedience movement against the government in response to the demolition of the mosque.
A video statement released by the Maulana showed him sitting inside Lal Masjid with a gun on his lap, hurling threats at the government.

During a debate on the law and order situation in the province with Speaker Babar Saleem Swati chairing the session, Mr Baz of the opposition Awami National Party insisted that the people displaced from his district due to a military operation against terrorismfaced multiple problems due to the government’s failure to cater for them.
He said that neither the provincial government nor the federal government had made any arrangements to meet the needs of displaced residents.
Mr Baz urged authorities to lift curfew to enable people to shift to safety.

Opposition demands end to curfew to help residents move to safety

“Almost the entire population is literally hostage to the curfew, which halted their migration. It’s astonishing why the government has imposed curfew in a situation when the people were relocating to safe areas,” he said.
The opposition lawmaker said that the displaced people were making arrangements on the self-help basis, with help coming in from some local political parties.
He complained that the government’s machinery was not visible in the critical situation. Mr Baz also said thatthe residents were struggling to move to safety due to a shortage of transport vehicles.
Mr Baz said thatthe displaced people had taken shelter in schools, while some had installed tents.
He complained that those residents lacked access to basic facilities, including food. He asked the provincial government on whose direction the curfew was imposed.
Ahmed Karim Kundi of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party said thatthe provincial government should clarify its position on the claim of interior minister Mohsin Naqvi that Chief MinisterAli Amin Gandapur was “giving extortion money”to terrorists.
“If terrorists are receiving extortion money from the chief minister, what will be the state of the common man’s security in this province?”
The opposition member said thatthe provincial government should reveal where it had utilised Rs700 billion received for fighting terrorism since 2010. He said thatthe province would getRs130 billion for the same purpose in the current financial year.
Mr Kundi said that the province’s people had lost trust in the chief minister about the law and order situation, especially in Bajaur district, as he had changed his statements about it multiple times.
“The chief minister issues one statement during meetings with those at the helm of affairs but releases another when in public,” he said.
The opposition lawmaker demanded that the chair forma house committee with representation from both treasury and opposition benches to make recommendations on the law and order situation after consulting all stakeholders.
Housing minister Dr Amjid supported the idea and said thatits recommendation should be taken up with Peshawar’s corp commander and the premier intelligence agency sector commander, who should also be called to the provincial assembly for a briefing on the security situation in the province.
Member of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-InsafMalik Adeel Iqbal said thathis party always opposed military operations in the province because it made people stand against security forces.
He said that all controversial issues should be resolved through the traditional jirga system and talks. The chair later adjourned the session untilTuesdaydue to a lack of quorum.

According to CCD sources, the suspect ‘M’, a refrigerator mechanic residing in Kot Khan Muhammad locality on Satiana Road, had allegedly been raping minor boys and girls at gunpoint.
The sources say the suspect would also record videos while raping children through secret cameras and later blackmail the victims. More than two dozen pornographic videos of eight to 12-year-old children were recovered from his mobile phones, besides other objectionable and obscene videos.
The sources say that around a year ago, the suspect was caught red-handed raping a child, after which he fled to Multan. However, he returned to Faisalabad after six months and again raped an eight-year-old girl and made her pornographic videos.
According to sources, the suspect had also allegedly electrocuted 10-year-old Shoaib after raping him some years ago. The CCD arrested the suspect on a tip-off.

Pakistan’s basmati rice exports have witnessed steady growth in recent years. According to the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (REAP), the country exported approximately 772,725 tonnes of basmati rice in FY24, generating $876.9m — up from 595,120 tonnes worth $650.4m in the previous fiscal year. The average export price per tonne also increased from $1,092.93 to $1,134.86.
Data from Volza’s Global Trade platform shows that between November 2023 and October 2024, the United States accounted for 24pc of Pakistan’s total basmati exports through 1,519 shipments. Italy and the United Kingdom followed with shares of 14pc (908 shipments) and 11pc (716 shipments), respectively.
 
 

Together, these three markets consumed nearly 49pc of Pakistan’s basmati rice exports. Pakistan currently exports basmati rice to over 110 countries, with other key destinations including Australia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Canada, the Netherlands, and Germany.

Basmati exports rose 35pc in FY24 to 772,725 tonnes, earning $876.9m

According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), rice imports in the US have grown steadily over the past three decades — from 7pc of the domestic market in 1993/94 to over 25pc by 2022/23. Over 60pc of these imports consist of aromatic varieties from Asia, mainly jasmine from Thailand and basmati from India and Pakistan.
While the US produces some aromatic rice domestically, these differ in quality and aroma from their Asian counterparts. The USDA projects continued growth in demand for aromatic rice imports in the coming years.
The tariff dispute emerged from US punitive measures targeting India’s trade and energy ties with Russia, resulting in broad tariffs on several Indian exports, including basmati rice, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Although some sectors later received exemptions, basmati rice remained subject to the full 50pc tariff. In contrast, Pakistani basmati rice continues to face a lower tariff of 19pc, giving it a distinct pricing advantage in the US market.
Indian media reports suggest that the tariff hike could reduce India’s basmati exports to the US by 50-80pc, with prices climbing to nearly $1,800 per metric tonne. Pakistani basmati, by comparison, remains priced at around $1,450 per metric tonne, making it more competitive for US importers and retailers.
Retailers across the US are already reporting increased interest in Pakistani basmati rice. Khan Mohammed, a salesman at Super Halal grocery in Springfield, Virginia, noted: “Pakistani rice is already popular.

• World’s most populous nation is a key market for US goods
NEW DELHI: From McDonald’s and Coca-Cola to Amazon and Apple, US-based multinationals are facing calls for a boycott in India as business executives and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s supporters stoke anti-American sentiment to protest against US tariffs.
India, the world’s most populous nation, is a key market for American brands that have rapidly expanded to target a growing base of affluent consumers, many of whom remain infatuated with international labels seen as symbols of moving up in life.
India, for example, is the biggest market by users for Meta’s WhatsApp and Domino’s has more restaurants than any other brand in the country. Beverages like Pepsi and Coca-Cola often dominate store shelves, and people still queue up when a new Apple store opens or a Starbucks cafe doles out discounts.
Although there was no immediate indication of sales being hit, there’s a growing chorus both on social media and offline to buy local and ditch American products after Donald Trump imposed a 50 per cent tariff on goods from India, rattling exporters and damaging ties between New Delhi and Washington.
McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Amazon and Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters queries.
Manish Chowdhary, co-founder of India’s Wow Skin Science, took to LinkedIn with a video message urging support for farmers and startups to make “Made in India” a “global obsession,” and to learn from South Korea whose food and beauty products are famous worldwide.
“We have lined up for products from thousands of miles away. We have proudly spent on brands that we don’t own, while our own makers fight for attention in their own country,” he said.
Rahm Shastry, CEO of India’s DriveU, which provides a car driver on call service, wrote on LinkedIn: “India should have its own home-grown Twitter/Google/YouTube/WhatsApp/FB — like China has.”
 
 

To be fair, Indian retail companies give foreign brands like Starbucks stiff competition in the domestic market, but going global has been a challenge. Indian IT services firms, however, have become deeply entrenched in the global economy, with the likes of TCS and Infosys providing software solutions to clients world over.
On Sunday, Modi made a “special appeal” for becoming self-reliant, telling a gathering in Bengaluru that Indian technology companies made products for the world but “now is the time for us to give more priority to India’s needs.” He did not name any company.
Public rallies
Even as anti-American protests simmer, Tesla launched its second showroom in India in New Delhi, with Monday’s opening attended by Indian commerce ministry officials and US embassy officials.
The Swadeshi Jagran Manch group, which is linked to Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, took out small public rallies across India on Sunday, urging people to boycott American brands.
“People are now looking at Indian products. It will take some time to fructify,” Ashwani Mahajan, the group’s co-convener, told Reuters. “This is a call for nationalism, patriotism.” He also shared with Reuters a table his group is circulating on WhatsApp, listing Indian brands of bath soaps, toothpaste and cold drinks that people could choose over foreign ones.
On social media, one of the group’s campaigns is a graphic titled “Boycott foreign food chains”, with logos of McDonald’s and many other restaurant brands.
In Uttar Pradesh, Rajat Gupta, 37, who was dining at a McDonalds in Lucknow on Monday, said he wasn’t concerned about the tariff protests and simply enjoyed the 49-rupee ($0.55) coffee he considered good value for money.
“Tariffs are a matter of diplomacy and my McPuff, coffee should not be dragged into it,” he said.

The investigating officer of the case brought the suspect before Judicial Magistrate (Central) Farman Ali Tager and sought his custody for 14 days for interrogation.
He informed the court that as per initial inquiry the suspect did not possess a licence to drive a heavy vehicle. He said he only had the licence to drive light transport vehicles (LTV) and that too had expired in 2016.
The IO asked for more time to get information regarding the owner of the dumper — involved in the accident — as well as need to verify the documents of the suspect.
After hearing the IO, the court remanded him in police custody for two days and directed him to submit a progress report at the next hearing.
Body formed to probe arson attacks
A high-powered committee was formed to investigate arson attacks, where miscreants torched seven dumpers after the fatal accident.
According to an order issued by Karachi police chief Javed Alam Odho, DIG-West Irfan Ali Baloch will head the team comprising Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi, West SSP Tariq Illahi Mastoi and Investigation SSP Anam Tajjamul.

Former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi are already facing imprisonment in connection with the same case.
The auction took place at the Patwar office in Bhara Kahu, overseen by an auction committee in the presence of Assistant Commissioner Secretariat Uzair Ali. The agricultural land, measuring 405 kanals and three marlas, located in Mohra Noor, was auctioned for Rs3.42 million per kanal.
In contrast, investors showed no interest in land owned by another absconder in the case, Farhat Shehzadi alias Farah Gogi. Her property, also located in the revenue estate of Mohra Noor in the Bani Gala area, remained unsold.
Earlier in the day, rumors circulated regarding the possible auction of Imran Khan’s Banigala residence. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja tweeted at 11:50am about the alleged auction, expressing concern that if the news was true, it would have been a secretive process. He promised to verify and share accurate information.
 






Two hours later, at 2:15pm, Mr Raja tweeted an update, stating that according to information gathered by PTI’s legal team regarding NAB reference 19/2023 — the state vs. Imran Khan in the Al-Qadir Trust case — the auction was related to the properties of other accused who have been declared absconders. “Our legal team is keeping an eye on this issue,” he added.
 






Despite repeated efforts, Dawn was unable to confirm the identity of the successful bidder for Ali Riaz Malik’s land at the time of filing this report. At least two government officials contacted said they were unaware of the buyer’s name. “I have no idea who the successful bidder is, as the transfer deed is yet to be completed,” one official stated.
Recently, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) also conducted a public auction of six commercial properties linked to Malik Riaz and Bahria Town, as part of efforts to recover unpaid amounts related to the Al-Qadir Trust case.
These properties included five in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad. Of the six, three were successfully auctioned: Rubaish Marquee sold for Rs508m, while Corporate Office-I and Corporate Office-II received conditional bids of Rs876m and Rs881.5m, respectively.

• PTI stages walkout after Gohar, Asad not allowed to raise points of order
• House adopts resolution for Milad celebrations, inclusion of Jinnah’s speech in curricula
ISLAMABAD: As the series of convictions of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders and the subsequent disqualification of its lawmakers continued, members of the opposition party staged a vociferous protest in the National Assembly on Monday.
The protest started when PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and former speaker of the National Assembly Asad Qaiser were denied permission by the chair to raise points of order during the question hour.
Carrying portraits of ex-premier Imran Khan and other convicted PTI leaders, the opposition members chanted slogans denouncing the convictions and disqualifications, while demanding release of the incarcerated founder of the party.
The lawmakers tore up copies of the day’s agenda, threw the pieces into the air, and gathered near the speaker’s podium before staging an undeclared walkout.
Soon after their exit, PTI legislator Iqbal Afridi pointed out a lack of quorum. However, a headcount confirmed the House was in order.
On the other hand, Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari during the question hour told the House that electricity charges for households consuming up to 200 units per month had dropped by around 60 per cent over the past nine months.
 






He said that out of total 35 million electricity consumers, around 18.3 million already benefited from subsidies — 90 per cent for those using up to 100 units and 70pc for those consuming between 100 units and 200 units.
However, he pointed out that expanding the 200-unit slab to households using up to 300 units would require an additional Rs275 billion in subsidies, which was unaffordable under the current fiscal constraints. Still, the government was bearing a substantial subsidy burden for low-use consumers, he added.
No power subsidy for crypto mining
Responding to another question, the federal minister clarified that no subsidised electricity had been provided to any cryptocurrency mining project in Pakistan, nor had any tariff, rate, or legal framework been approved for such ventures.
He also outlined an incremental electricity package for the entire industrial sector —without subsidies — to enhance competitiveness, particularly for export industries.
He claimed that 7,500MW of surplus power was available, and talks were underway with development partners and the International Monetary Fund to use it for grid stabilisation.
On the remarks of MNA Syed Hafeezuddin that mock drills should be arranged for citizens of Karachi to prepare them for any eventuality considering that the city was located in a seismically active tectonic zone, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Cha­u­dhry assured the House that the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in collaboration with provincial authorities, would continue to raise public awareness about natural hazards.
Milad, Minorities Day resolutions adopted
The National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution urging the federal and provincial governments to celebrate the 1,500th Eid Milad-un-Nabi (Peace Be Upon Him) in a befitting manner.
 






Moved by Pir Syed Fazal Ali Shah Jillani, the resolution called for Milad programmes at the highest level and illumination of both public and private buildings, while highlighting the importance of promoting the teachings of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
In connection with National Minorities Day, another resolution was passed to include in the national curriculum the historic address of August 11, 1947 by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah to the first Constituent Assembly.
In that speech, Pakistan’s founder declared, “You are free to go to your temples, mosques, or any other places of worship in this country.
You may belong to any religion, caste, or creed — that has nothing to do with the business of the State.“ The resolution was moved by PPP lawmaker from Multan, Naveed Aamir Jeeva.

The mortar shell, fired from an unknown location, landed and exploded in the Gomazai area of Tump as the three children were returning home from a seminary, according to security officials.
One of the injured children, identified as Muhammad, succumbed to multiple injuries after being taken to a hospital.
The other two were identified as Abdullah and Muhammad Fazil.
Security forces have launched an investigation to find the location from which the shell was fired.
 
 

In a separate incident in the same area, authorities found the body of Yousaf Faith, a young poet and musician who, according to his family, had been missing. Levies recovered the body, and said hospital officials confirmed Faith had been badly tortured.
Human rights activists expressed serious concern over the death and demanded “a transparent and independent probe into the incident”.

The meeting of Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakista­nis and Human Resource Deve­l­o­pment was held to discuss problems being faced by under-trial/convicted Pakistanis in different countries of the world. Senator Zee­­shan Khanzada chaired the meeting.
Of the total, 17,236 are in jails in the Middle East countries whereas 85 Pakistani prisoners are being held in Afghanistan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs failed to provide details about the nature of crimes for which these Pakistanis are detained in prisons of different countries of the world.
 
 

Expressing serious displeasure over the non-provision of this critical information, the Senate panel told the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to produce comprehensive data within 15 days of all overseas Pakistanis convicted or under-trial worldwide, including the nature of their crimes.

Foreign ministry told to produce data within 15 days

It also directed the ministry concerned to submit within 15 days a list of countries that have policies to inform Pakistani authorities about such cases, as well as those that withhold such information.
Community Welfare Attachés (CWAs) from various postings briefed the committee on the status of under-trial and convicted Pakistanis in their respective jurisdictions. The CWAs from Dubai, Doha, and Kuala Lumpur reported 3,523, 619, and 499 detainees, respectively.
The chairman of the committee directed the ministries of overseas Pakistanis and foreign affairs to expedite efforts to finalise prisoner transfer agreements with various countries to help repatriation of innocent Pakistanis trapped in legal cases abroad.
The committee reviewed the status of overseas Pakistani prisoners and called for immediate enactment of consular protection bill to enable the jailed Pakistanis to serve their remaining sentences in Pakistani jails.
Senator Nasir Mehmood recommended verification of the citizenship status of the 85 Pakistanis being held in Afghanistan.
The committee reviewed the functioning of CWAs and directed the ministry concerned to submit evaluation procedures for assessing their performance, along with detailed information on all convicted and under-trial Pakistanis in each jurisdiction.
Senator Shahadat Awan expressed concern over incomplete information provided in the working papers submitted by ministries concerned. He stressed the need for presenting complete and accurate information in a professional manner before such a prestigious forum.
 
 

The chairman of the committee also observed a significant lack of coordination and data sharing be­­tween ministries of foreign affa­irs, interior and overseas Pakis­ta­nis. He emphasised the importa­n­­ce of improving inter-ministerial cooperation for the welfare of overseas Pakistanis.
The chairman stressed the urgent need for the enactment of a consular protection act to safeguard the rights of Pakistani prisoners abroad.
The committee was also briefed on the performance and upcoming programmes of the National Voc­a­tional & Technical Training Com­mission (NAVTTC). The chair­man appreciated NAVTTC’s efforts and directed the commission to align its programmes with international standards to enhance overseas em­­ployment opportunities for Pakistanis.
The meeting was attended by senators Raja Nasir Abbas, Nasir Mehmood, Shahadat Awan, Saeed Ahmed Hashmi and Khalida Ateeb.

“Australia will recognise the state of Palestine at the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly in September, to contribute to international momentum towards a two-state solution, a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages,” Prime Minister Ant­h­ony Albanese said in a statement.
The conflict raging in Gaza since Oct 2023 has revived a global push for Palestinians to be given a state of their own.
The action breaks with a long-held view that Palesti­nians could only gain statehood as part of a negotiated peace with Israel.
 
 

At least 145 of the 193 UN members now recognise or plan to recognise a Palest­inian state, including Fra­nce, Canada and Britain.
Here is a recap of the Palestinians’ quest for statehood:
1988: Arafat proclaims state
On Nov 15, 1988, during the first intifada, Palesti­nian leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally proclaimed an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
He made the announcement in Algiers at a meeting of the exiled Palest­inian National Council, which adopted the two-state solution as a goal, with independent Israeli and Palestinian states existing side by side.
Minutes later, Algeria became the first country to officially recognise an inde­pendent Palestinian state.
2011-2012: UN recognition
In 2011, with peace talks at a standstill, the Palestinians pushed ahead with a campaign for full UN membership.
The quest failed, but in a groundbreaking move on Oct 31 of that year, the UN cultural agency Unesco voted to accept the Palestinians as a full member, much to the dismay of Israel and the United States.
In Nov 2012, the Palestinian flag was raised for the first time at the United Nations in New York after the General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to upgrade the status of Palestinians to “non-member observer state”.
New push
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza over the last two years has boosted support for Palestinian statehood.
Four Caribbean countries (Jamaica, Trinidad, Barbados and the Bahamas) and Armenia took the diplomatic step last year.
So did four European countries: Norway, Spain, Ireland and Slovenia, the latter three EU members.
Within the European Union, this was a first in 10 years since Sweden’s move in 2014, which resulted in years of strained relations with Israel.

In a report by correspondents in Islamabad, New Delhi and Washi­ngton, the FT described what it called an “unexpected resurgence” in relations between Islamabad and Washington. The newspaper said Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir has twice been received in high-level settings in the US this summer,  most recently in Florida, where he attended the retirement ceremony of Gen Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command.
According to the  FT, Munir also met President Trump in June for a two-hour private lunch,  just a month after Pakistan and India experienced their bloodiest confrontation in decades. The meeting was notable given Mr Trump’s  earlier public criticism of Pakistan.
Michael Kugelman, a non-resident senior fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation, told the FT:  “What’s happening in US-Pakistan relations is a surprise. I would describe the relationship now as one that’s enjoying an unexpected resurgence, even a renaissance. Pakistan has very successfully  understood how to engage with such an unconventional president.”
The FT attributed the change in tone to a diplomatic strategy by senior Pakistani officials, combining counterterrorism cooperation, outreach to individuals in Mr Trump’s business network, and agreements involving energy, mineral resources and cryptocurrency. These moves, it said, were accompanied by positive messaging towards the White House.
A key development cited in the report was the March arrest and transfer to US  custody of an ISIS-K suspect alleged to have organised the 2021 Kabul airport bombing. Mr Trump publicly commended Pakistan for the arrest in his State of the Union address.
 
 

The newspaper also detailed an April agreement between World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed cryptocurrency initiative, and Pakistan’s crypto council. One of the venture’s co-founders remarked during a visit to Pakistan on the scale of the country’s mineral resources.
 
 

On the regional response,  the FT said India reacted with “deep irritation” to the warming of ties,  particularly after facing a US tariff increase to 50 per cent, while Pakistan’s rate was set at 19 per cent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi  disputed Mr Trump’s assertion that the US had mediated a May ceasefire between the two countries, with New Delhi emphasising that the agreement had been reached through direct channels between their armed forces.

LAHORE: The ruling PML-N senior leadership discussed upcoming by-poll, local bodies elections in Punjab and overall performance of the federal and provincial governments at a huddle in Murree hill station.
PML-N president Nawaz Sharif presided over the meeting at his Murree residence in which Prime Min­ister Shehbaz Sharif, Dep­uty Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, federal cabinet mem­bers Rana Sana­ullah, Ahsan Iqbal, Kha­waja Asif, Azam Nazir Tarar, Dr Tauqeer Shah and Ameer Muq­­am, Sen­ator Pervaiz Ras­hid, Kha­waja Saad Raf­ique, Mur­taza Javed Abbasi, Anusha Rehman and retired Capt Muh­ammad Safdar were present.
“The meeting discussed upcoming by-polls and local body elections. Suit­able candidates will be finalised once the schedule of all by-election is anno­unced. The huddle was told that the local body election had already been delayed and now it’s time to conduct it,” PM’s a­dviser and PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah told Dawn after the meeting.
Twelve opposition Paki­stan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers in Punjab have been disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) following their conviction in the May 9, 2023 cases.
The disqualified lawmakers comprise eight National Assembly and four Punjab Assembly legislators. The NA-129, Lahore, fell vacant after the death of MNA and former governor Mian Azhar. PTI patron-in-chief Imran Khan has barred his party from contesting the by-polls except on NA-129 where Azhar’s son Hammad Azhar is likely to be the party’s candidate.
“We will not field any candidates in the by-elections for the seats of our unjustly disqualified members. These individuals stood firm with PTI despite extreme challenges. Therefore, the party will completely boycott these by-elections,” Imran Khan had said in a post on X.
 






When asked after the PTI’s boycott, the PML-N has been given a ‘walkover’ in the by-election, therefore, why the leadership felt the need to discuss it in the huddle in which all the party heavyweights were present, Rana Sanaullah said: “We have information that the PTI is not boycotting the by-poll, therefore, it featured in the meeting.”
Mr Sanaullah further said he told the meeting that the party workers would be mobilised once the schedule of the local government election was announced. “However, before the announcement of its schedule, there is a need to amend the local government law regarding delimitations,” he added.
To a question about ‘reconciliation’ between CM Maryam and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif in the meeting over the issue of the arrest of Sialkot’s additional deputy commissioner revenue, Sanaullah said: “There has been no issue between them as it was only played up by the media.
Regarding the proposed 27th amendment, he said it did not come under discussion.
According to sources, discussion on the “smooth functioning” of the federal and Punjab governments was also discussed in the meeting.
Khawaja Asif says Maryam is like his daughter
The defence minister uploaded a clip of his talk with a digital media platform on his X account clarifying the reports about his reported conflict with CM Maryam over the arrest of a bureaucrat of his native town, Sialkot. “Maryam Nawaz is like a daughter to me. She is our future leader. I pray for her like my own daughter. There has been no issue [between us] at all .”
Meanwhile, the Punjab government has cautioned the PTI from staging a protest on the Independence Day.
“The nation will celebrate Independence Day with great fervour and will also mark the success of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos while a disruptive faction, PTI, is conspiring to create unrest on this national occasion which will not be allowed,” Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari said in a statement.
 
 

“Protesting on a national day is not the agenda of any patriotic political party. This is the same group that emerged from the 2014 sit-ins and has since made agitation and protests their hobby. The PTI has no regard for national events as its politics revolves solely around creating division and chaos.” Issuing a strong warning, Bokhari said the law would take its course if anyone tried to stage violent protest.
Advising the PTI leadership, she urged it to call off their planned protest on Aug 14.

• Jirga leader censures admin for not consulting residents, demands facilities for displaced families
• More than 300 families flee restive tehsils ahead of curfew; displaced people to be housed in schools
BAJAUR: A “targeted military” operation to eliminate militants in Bajaur’s Lowi Mamund tehsil resumed on Monday as the provincial government imposed a curfew in several areas of the restive tehsil for three months — a move that attracted criticism from the residents.
The offensive, named ‘Operation Sarbakaf’, was initially launched on  July 29, but it was postponed the next day after peace talks between the Bajaur Amn Jirga and local militant commanders inched forward.  However, talks for the relocation of militants to Afghanistan, after multiple rounds of negotiations, fell through on Friday evening due to a stalemate on some issues.
On Monday, the security forces reportedly assisted by helicopter gunships and artillery, pounded militant hideouts in Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils, located about 20km from Khar, the district headquarters. However, no loss of life was reported on the first day of the operation, which continued till sunset.
The army’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, did not issue a statement.
Due to the curfew announced by the district administration, several major roads and trade centres remained closed, and the restrictions in over two dozen villages of Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils would remain in place till Aug 14.
 
 

The notification was posted on the Deputy Comm­issioner’s official Facebook page around 2am on Monday. According to the notification, the district administration said that with the approval of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Home Department, it has imposed a 12-hour curfew on several key roads in the district, including the Khar-Munda road, Khar-Nawagai Road, Khar-Pashat Salarzai Road, and Khar-Sadiqabad-Inayat Kalley Road. “The restrictions on these roads, which commenced at 11am on Monday, will remain in place until 11pm the same night,” said the statement.
The notification said that the three-day curfew had been imposed in around 27 areas of Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils, in addition to the mentioned roads, to ensure public safety and security during the “targeted operation” against terrorists.
The under-curfew areas include Laghari, Gohati, Ghanam Shah, Bad-i-Siah, Gat, Kitkot, Regai, Daag, Ghundi, Amanato, Zagai, Garigal, Niaag, Damadola, Sultan Big, Chowtra, Gaang, Jawar, Inam Khooro Chinagai, Aanga, Safari, Bar Gatki, Kharki, Shakroo, Shinkoot, and Bakaroo.
“We appeal to the people to abide by the restrictions and stay indoors, suspending all activities until 10:30am on Monday, while failure to comply with [this] may result in unpleasant consequences, for which they would be responsible,” the directive concluded.
As the curfew took effect in the morning, the police sounded sirens and directed traders to shut their shops. Subsequently, major roads and bazaars across the district, including Khar, Inayat Kalley, Sadiqabad, Nawagai, Raghagan, Pashat, Laghari, Yousafabad, and Loe Sam, were shut down.
Inconvenience to residents
The restrictions in the district, particularly in the urban areas of the Khar tehsil, caused inconvenience to residents and attracted flak from several political figures, including Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, head of the Bajaur Amn Jirga.
At an emergency news conference at the Bajaur Press Club in Khar, Mr Rashid accused the district administration of failing to take the residents on board before imposing the restrictions. Alongside the jirga members, he criticised the provincial government and district administration for not providing adequate arrangements for transportation and accommodation to the people displaced by the anti-militant action. He sought immediate measures to address the accommodation needs of the displaced people.
Exodus continues
According to estimates, more than 2,000 families, including 300 families on Monday, have fled their homes since Saturday in light of the military operation in the restive Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils. There is no official figure about the displaced families, and these estimates have been based on interviews with local NGOs and residents.
Khalid Khan, executive director of the Siraj Uddin Khan Foundation, told Dawn that about 300 more families fled their homes ahead of the curfew imposed in the morning. He said some people moved to the shelters set up by his organisation, while others chose to stay with their relatives and friends.
In order to accommodate the influx of displaced people, the district administration has announced accommodation facilities in 449 public schools across the district. The decision was made during a meeting of the local education department officials with Khar Assistant Commissioner Dr Sadiq Ali.
A statement issued after the meeting said that 309 boys schools and 140 girls schools would house the displaced people. In addition, 113 private schools will also be used to accommodate the displaced people

Last year, Pakistan proscribed the Majeed Brigade, which is the BLA’s dedicated suicide squad. The BLA itself was proscribed in 2006, according to the National Counter-Terrorism Authority’s list of proscribed organisations.
Pakistan has previously requested that the Majeed Brigade be listed as an international terrorist organisation. In 2019, the State Department labelled the BLA as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), making it a crime for anyone in the US to assist the militants, but did not designate the Majeed Brigade at that time.
FTO designations are made by the Secretary of State, following section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and “are an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business”. SDGT designations, meanwhile, target individuals and groups under Executive Order 13224, even if they are not part of a formally recognised organisation.
According to today’s press release, the Department added the BLA to the FTO list, while adding the Majeed Brigade as an alias to the BLA’s previous SDGT designation.
“BLA was designated as an SDGT in 2019 following several terrorist attacks.  Since 2019, BLA has claimed responsibility for additional attacks, including by the Majeed Brigade,” the press release read. 
 
 

“In 2024, BLA claimed it had committed suicide attacks near the airport in Karachi and the Gwadar Port Authority Complex.  In 2025, BLA claimed responsibility for the March hijacking of the Jaffar Express train travelling from Quetta to Peshawar, killing 31 civilians and security personnel and holding hostage over 300 train passengers.”  
The State Department said that the designation demonstrated US President Donald Trump’s commitment to counter-terrorism.
“Terrorist designations play a critical role in our fight against this scourge and are an effective way to curtail support for terrorist activities,” the press release stated.  “Today’s actions are taken pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, and Executive Order 13224, as amended.” 
 
 

Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti welcomed the State Department’s designation in a post on X, lauding the federal government and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir for presenting Islamabad’s case to Washington.
“We welcome the US decision to designate BLA and its alias Majeed Brigade as terrorist outfits,” Bugti wrote. “These groups have long shed innocent blood under the false cover of ethnicity and rights.
“Terrorism is terrorism; no cause justifies killing civilians. The world must unite to end this menace.”
 






Talking to Geo News, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry termed the development a fruit of Pakistan’s successful diplomacy and a “great win” for the country. He said the groups were “proxies” of India that were sponsored by the neighbouring country and others.
“The day is not far when their sponsors will also be on the list of terrorists. This will not only strengthen Pakistan against fighting terrorist organisations, but the stronger Pakistan is against terrorism, the safer the world will be from terrorists,” he said
Chaudhry said the development showed the world stood with Pakistan’s stance and the country in the fight against terrorism.
“We are winning this fight every day and such uplifting news and successes will quickly bring this fight to its logical end.”
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed BLA, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
In April, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel, particularly in Balochistan.
Last month, the Foreign Office (FO) reaffirmed Pakistan’s stance against terrorism, saying that the country has “effectively and comprehensively dismantled” terrorist outfits.
“Pakistan condemns terrorism in all forms and manifestations; zero tolerance, and international cooperation against terrorism are cornerstones of our policy,” the FO said in a statement.
The FO’s statement came in the wake of the State Department designating The Resistance Front — the little-known group responsible for the Pahalgam attack on April 22 — as an FTO and a “front and proxy” of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
The Pahalgam attack — which resulted in the deaths of 26 people — sparked a military confrontation between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan as New Delhi blamed it on Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation.
The BLA’s designation comes as relations between Islamabad and Washington are improving.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir completed a visit to the US on Sunday, terming the trip — the second in just one-and-a-half months — a “new dimension” in ties between both nations.
The COAS engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora, the military’s media wing said.
He also visited the US in June on a five-day official visit, where he met with Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
Also in June, United States Central Command (Centcom) chief Army General Michael Kurilla praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism”, citing the nation’s struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“Through a relationship we have with them and providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ISIS Khorasan high-value individuals,” Kurilla said.
Gen Kurilla noted that there have been 1,000 terrorist attacks in “the western area” of Pakistan since the start of 2024, noting that they “are in an active counter-terrorism fight right now”.</p><small>2025-08-11 18:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618387-us-labels-bla-majeed-brigade-as-terrorist-groups-after-deadly-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>US labels BLA, Majeed Brigade as terrorist groups after deadly attacks</strong></a><br><p>
