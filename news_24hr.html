Taking to X, he ordered the withdrawal of a clause seeking to grant immunity to the PM in the 27th Amendment and said, “On my return from Azerbaijan, I have learnt that some Senators belonging to our party have submitted an amendment regarding immunity for the prime minister.”
“While I acknowledge their intent in good faith, the proposal was not part of the Cabinet-approved draft. I have instructed that it be withdrawn immediately,” PM Shehbaz wrote.
 






“As a matter of principle, an elected Prime Minister must remain fully accountable, both before the court of law and the people.”
The statement comes as Senate and National Assembly committees continue to hold discussions on the proposed bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), changes to the appointment process for high court judges, a higher cap on provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.
It also grants immunity to certain office holders. A set of clauses in the bill grants life-long constitutional protection to officers promoted to five-star ranks of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet.
 
 

Such officers would “retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life”, removable only through the impeachment-like procedure under Article 47.
Immunities similar to those enjoyed by the president under Article 248 would apply in this case.
On Saturday afternoon, the federal cabinet approved the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment, welcoming it to “the fullest extent.”
Subsequently, it was tabled before the Senate, triggering noisy protests from the opposition over the pace and scope of the proposed changes.

Yesterday, hours after the Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act 2025 was tabled in the Senate, the TTAP announced a nationwide protest movement against the proposed legislation starting today.
Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai, who leads the alliance, TTAP Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas addressed a joint press conference in Islamabad.
 


Khokhar said the fundamental objection to the amendments was that the parliament was “not a representative” of the public as the “mandate was manufactured”, reiterating the rigging allegations during the February 2024 general elections.
The former senator also recalled the “way the 26th Amendment was passed”, indirectly referring to the claims of the PTI and the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) of their leaders being pressured to vote in favour of it.
Khokhar also criticised the Supreme Court for playing the “most important role” in the preparations for the 27th Amendment by allotting the reserved seats to the ruling coalition parties. The ruling, given by the court’s Constitutional Bench formed under the 26th Amendment, struck down an earlier SC verdict that had declared the PTI eligible for those seats.
“They (coalition partners) then got the required number [of lawmakers], as a result of which today they are about to pass the 27th Amendment,” the politician contended.
“We can’t shy away from the facts before us. This parliament does not have the ethical or legal legitimacy to carry out such big amendments,” he asserted.
“Fundamentally, the concept of social contract implies how the state will take care of an individual’s basic rights. This is what the Constitution is all about,” the former PPP leader noted.
According to the TTAP, its leadership was scheduled to hold a press conference at 1pm to discuss the political situation and the 27th Amendment.
 






The 27th Amendment bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), changes to the appointment process for high court judges, a higher cap on provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.
PTI parliamentary lea­der Barrister Ali Zafar has contended that the debate on the bill was inappropriate in the absence of a notified leader of the opposition. He accused the government and its allies of being in a “hurry” to pass the amendments.
However, the PML-N and the PPP have rejected the impression that the 27th Amendment bill was rushed through without proper debate, saying the draft has undergone “extensive scrutiny”.

Yesterday, the bill for Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 was tabled before the Senate hours after it was approved by the federal cabinet, triggering noisy protests from the opposition over the pace and scope of the proposed changes.
The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), changes to the appointment process for high court judges, a higher cap on provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.
Senate Standing Committee on Law and Justice Chairperson Senator Farooq H. Naek and his counterpart for the National Assembly panel, MNA Chaudhry Mahmood Bashir Virk, are co-chairing today’s meeting.
 
 

The standing committees are also likely to finalise the mechanism for the transfer of high court judges through the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) — a process which may not require the consent of the judges being transferred.
The panels cleared nearly 80 per cent of the proposed bill yesterday in a joint in-camera meeting, including most clauses of the judicial reforms package.
But deliberations on the field marshal’s status under Article 243 (command of the armed forces) of the Constitution were deferred to today.
 






Lawmakers of the PTI, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) continued their boycott of the parliamentary committee today.
Prior to today’s meeting, Naek told reporters that all provisions of the bill will be deliberated upon today. “We fully hope that we will complete this [discussion] today,” he said.
Asked about suggestions made by various ruling allies and whether “two parties had come face to face on the immunity for the president and prime minister”, the PPP senator affirmed that all parties had a right to voice their opinion.
Noting that the proposals of the PML-N and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) will be considered in today’s meeting, Naek said, “Decisions will be taken based on whatever the majority’s opinion is.”
The committee chairman expressed the hope to finalise the draft by 5pm today.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik are among those participating in today’s meeting.
PML-N Senator Khalil Tahir Sindhu, Awami National Party’s (ANP) Hidayatullah Khan, and PPP MNAs Kasim Gilani and Syed Abrar Ali Shah were also part of the joint moot, while PML-N MNA Shumaila Rana attended via video link.
“Day 2 of the Parliamentary Committee on law and justice,” Gilani wrote on X.
 






In another post, he summarised that the 27th Constitutional Amendment “mainly touches 5 key areas: establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court, transfer of judges (Article 200), fixing the KP Senate election anomaly, [two per cent] cabinet size increase on smaller provinces’ demand (Article 130(6)), [and] amendments in Article 243 on defence services & presidential immunity.
“All other changes are merely consequential,” the PPP lawmaker added.
 






After yesterday’s meeting, Tarar told reporters that all parliamentary parties were participating in the process and that the government had also “requested the opposition to contribute constructively”.
“Till the time we do not reach a consensus, from all members of both Houses, the discussions will continue,” the law minister had said.
 


Senate to meet at 3pm
Meanwhile, in yet another rare move, the Senate will meet today at 3pm with a one-point agenda to “consider” the bill, demonstrating extraordinary haste to pass the amendments.
The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes the PTI, has announced a nationwide protest movement against the 27th Amendment, urging the people to take a stand against the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution.
PTI parliamentary lea­der Barrister Ali Zafar has contended that the debate on the bill was inappropriate in the absence of a notified leader of the opposition. He accused the government and its allies of being in a “hurry” to pass the amendments.
 
 

“These amendments strike at the very foundation of the constitutional structure by undermining the independence of the judiciary and eroding the delicate balance of powers that the 1973 Constitution so carefully created,” he told Dawn.
However, the PML-N and the PPP have rejected the impression that the 27th Amendment bill was rushed through without proper debate, saying the draft has undergone “extensive scrutiny”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had held consultations with multiple ruling allies on Thursday, meeting with the top leadership of the MQM-P, the PML-Q, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), the ANP and the PML-Zia.
However, no meeting was reported between the government and the PTI.

Her immediate aim: to clinch the fourth game and move a step closer to claiming another title.
It wasn’t to be. The hotly-contested first three games had been indicative of a battle to the end and Sana would soon have to put her body on the line to win when her opponent’s racket hit her in the throat. Struggling to breathe as she clutched her throat, Sana stumbled out the glass door and into the stands.
Her father, Sher, rushed over and crouched in front of her, asking what happened. He told a concerned referee rushing over that she had been hit in the throat, but the referee told him not to interfere during play.
“I was speaking for Sana because you don’t understand sign language,” Sher quipped to silence the referee. He opened his mouth to argue with Sher but shut it just as quickly, staring at the medical officer and Sher attending to Sana. Her opponent, Sadia Gul, eyed the cluster from across the arena.
Sana is entirely deaf and mute, and although she communicates using sign language, the rest of the world doesn’t.
The 19-year-old became the first deaf squash player in Pakistan and across Asia when she began competing a decade ago, followed by her younger brother Saifullah. Both only have 10 per cent of their hearing — able to hear a jet plane soaring above, but not a conversation someone is having with them.
This is how every squash game unfolds for Sana; not the rough play and string of injuries she’s unable to articulate, but the constant need for her father to step in and speak on her behalf. She signs to her father, he then speaks in Pashto, Urdu, English, depending on where in the world she’s competing. There were no accommodations for her deafness, no special training centres or sign language interpreters; this setup with Sher is all she has.
After a three-minute medical break, Sana signalled a thumbs-up to the referee to resume the fourth game, which she ultimately lost to Sadia despite protesting more foul play.
The deciding fifth game was equal parts aggression and theatrics; Sadia was arguing with the referee after calling him out on a first-name basis when he awarded the point to Sana; moments later, the duo collided and Sana slammed to the floor. At 10-10 game and match point, Sana equalled the score and roared in triumph to cheers from the sparse audience. Sadia was once again a single point away from winning when Sana turned the score 11-11, with the mildest of contact between the two players prompting Sadia to stumble backwards until she slammed into the court’s glass wall.
Moments later, Sadia hit her head against the wall and sent her racket flying, which Sana picked up and returned to her before offering a helping hand. The game point bounced between the two for a few more points until Sadia won it 16-14 to advance.
They embraced before walking off court. Sana clapped her hand against her racket to thank the referee before slumping down next to her father and brother.
Tempers flaring, Sher walked up to Sadia and congratulated her before accusing her of foul play.
Hours later that Friday evening at the Koh-e-Noor Hotel, Sher had calmed down. He kicked off a shoe and tucked one foot under his thigh as he sat on the edge of his bed. Sana and her brother, Saif, were playfully wrestling on another bed in the narrow room. Sana gestured to her throat and opened a fist as though holding a cricket ball to emphasise how much her throat had swollen.
“Believe me, I’ve cried three or four times today since the match,” Sher said slowly as he looked down at his dark grey kameez. The air in the room hung heavy, punctured only by the flashing light of Sana’s phone buzzing for a notification. His children were oblivious of the conversation unfolding, just as they were to almost everything other than squash.
Neither was aware that Sher had already emailed the Professional Squash Association (PSA) asking them to independently review and assess the match footage. He alleged that unqualified “referees” officiating local matches like these were why foul play was allowed unabated.
“Sana works so hard,” Sher continued after a deep breath. “The angst of this match kept her up till midnight last night. “I told her I want her to be happy, not just win in this sport.”

Squash was unaffordable for a young Sher from a middle class family in Charsadda, some 42 kilometres from Peshawar where he lives now. Watching squash matches on a tiny black-and white Russian TV set they owned was the closest he ever got to the sport.
“I’ve instilled what I call ‘Charsadda discipline’ in her; I don’t want to teach her to be snide or do anything that brings dishonour to where I’m from.
“When we compete abroad, I want Sana to hold herself in a way that brings respect to Pakistan, and to herself,” Sher said.
Contrary to the CNS quarterfinal, Sana’s international matches end with Sher being showered with praise for Sana’s exceptional skills on court, her sportsmanship, her vibrant personality and equally glowing smile.
When asked what squash means to her, Sana signed that it pulled her out from the cloak of invisibility her deafness put her under.
“I was a nobody when I was younger. But when I started playing squash, people began to recognise me,” Sana signed to her father, who then translated in Urdu. She tugged the Pakistan logo on her shirt and signed that it was a dream come true to don the green jersey.
“They began acknowledging me, greeting me, taking pictures with me. I’ve become famous, and it makes me really happy,” she signed, her smile growing wider when she said top ranked players Nour El Sherbini and Nouran Gohar wanted photos with her, in awe of her capabilities. Most of her opponents have never competed against a deaf player before.
Sana has close to a dozen national titles to her name and was ranked No. 1 in all the national age-group categories through the years. She’s also bagged a handful of international titles while competing across Australia and the US, where she reached a career-high PSA ranking of 212.
Sher has scraped together money to finance international tours that most squash players attain through long-term sponsorships, which Sana has only ever had in the short run. He knows that if given more exposure through international competitions, Sana would make it to the upper echelons of squash rankings.
Financial shortfalls aside, Sana and Saif have come to experience a “normal” life because Sher challenged the limitations of disability imposed on them. He chaperones them everywhere and translates conversations for them, picks and drops them from every practice session, wakes up at 5am for physical training before school.
But his devotion has come at a price. Age is catching up with him, and worries for his children’s future often seep into the present.
“I pray to Allah for life and courage because 10 years like this has been exhausting, and I often get disheartened,” he admitted quietly as he stared at his hands. Even so, he does his best for his children and leaves his fate in the hands of Allah and the blessings of his aged parents.
Ironically, Sher has literally outrun age catching up to him as he joins Sana during her morning runs before school. “If she runs 4 kilometres for training, I run it with her. I do everything in tandem so she feels like she has my support,” Sher said.
“Even today’s fight is a win for her — she learned what life is like, and what hurdles she’ll have to face.”
Sana’s journey ahead is long. She wants to be the contemporary version of Pakistani champions like Jansher Khan and Qamar Zaman, who once dominated the sport’s hall of fame. “We’ve come this far, and we’ll keep going till we reach that goal,” Sher said.
It was almost as if the family was beholden to have the surname Bahadar — brave.</p><small>2025-11-09 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0907235869ca412.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954002/27th-amendment-dethrones-supreme-court-legal-experts-warn' target='_blank'><strong>27th Amendment ‘dethrones’ Supreme Court, legal experts warn</strong></a><br><p>• Article 175 tweak ‘ends judiciary as we knew it’, says senior counsel
• Supporters believe new constitutional court will modernise judiciary
ISLAMABAD: The initial draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill, ta­­b­led in the Senate on Saturday, has led many legal experts to believe that the tw­­eaks would, in effect, dethrone the Sup­r­e­­me Court as the country’s highest judicial forum, ceding that position to a proposed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
However, proponents of the amendment say the new constitutional court would modernise the judiciary, reduce backlogs and separate constitutional and appellate jurisdictions — a reform they argue will improve efficiency and clarity in the justice system.
“Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’,” remarked a senior counsel who asked not to be named.
He warned that the government could now amend laws like the Elections Act 2017 and others to route appeals to the FCC instead of the Supreme Court.
 
 

Amendment to Article 175, he said, was “virtually the end of the judiciary as we knew it”, arguing that the Supreme Court had been “amended out of the Constitution by making it irrelevant”.
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar said the essence of the package was twofold.
First, the insertion of a new Chapter 1A in the Constitution that, in his view, tightens executive control over the superior judiciary through expanded powers to transfer high court judges, and establishes an FCC “empowered by disempowering the Supreme Court”.
Second, an amendment to Article 243 that formally vests the office of Chief of the Defence Forces in the Chief of the Army Staff and constitutionally guarantees the Field Marshal rank for life.
 
 

Another lawyer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said that although the senior-most of the two chiefs would chair the Judicial Commission of Pakis­tan, “for all other purposes, the FCC will be in the commanding position”.
He pointed out that wherever the oaths of judges of the Supreme Court and FCC are mentioned, the FCC is referenced first. “It is clear now which court is higher in terms of hierarchy,” he said.
He noted that under the amended Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC is listed before the chief justice of the Supreme Court and will have a longer tenure, retiring at 68, compared to the current retirement age of 65 for Supreme Court judges.
‘Forward-looking reform model’
In contrast, senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar welcomed the initiative, calling the proposed 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in the justice system.
He said the creation of two separate apex courts — the existing Supreme Cou­rt dealing primarily with appellate functions, and a new FCC with exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation, inter-governmental disputes and matters arising under Article 199 — ref­lected “a forward-looking reform model”.
This division, he argued, would bring Pakistan closer to systems in many established democracies where constitutional and advisory jurisdictions are institutionally distinct, providing “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence”.
He said the reforms could help depoliticise the higher judiciary, eliminate internal divisions, reduce backlogs and prevent overlapping between constitutional and appellate benches.
Mr Khokhar said the amendments to Article 243 were in line with “modern constitutional democracies”, with a unified advisory framework under a principal military adviser answerable to the prime minister, the defence minister and the National Security Committee.
Meanwhile, newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association President Haroonur Rasheed supported the idea of setting up an FCC, and said the association was considering convening an All Pakistan Lawyers Convention, in consultation with the Pakistan Bar Council and other bar bodies.
“I am glad that an FCC is being established in the country by amending the Constitution with consensus and unanimity,” he said.

Not with a bang but with a whimper — (The Hollow Men) T.S. Eliot
Newspaper editors, at times, require writers to cobble up a short article on famous persons, in the throes of death, that can be used as an obituary when they cease to be. Institutions on the brink of extinction merit similar consideration.
This is not an essay on the impact of the 27th constitutional amendment bill on the judiciary. It is not even a comment. It is an obituary of the Supreme Court (SC) and the high courts that we once knew. If you have known a person or institution well and for long, such a piece is also not easy to write. Expression requires words. The bill has left us at a loss for words. Trying as it is, one must nevertheless soldier on.
One must begin with the high courts. Central to the authority of these highest provincial courts is their jurisdiction to check executive and legislative overreach.
Any aggrieved citizen can call an action of state in question by invoking Article 199 of the Constitution. That jurisdiction will survive. Such cases will, however, be heard now by the constitutional benches of the high courts.
In the past, the chief justice of the res­pective high court assigned these cases.
With the 26th Amendment, this authority has been transferred to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), where the chief justice of Pakistan and other judges are in a minority.
The state whose actions are under scrutiny in such matters is ascendant.
Every experienced lawyer knows that a party with the authority to control the assignment of cases can also control outcomes.
Judges, like the rest of us, have their pre­ferences and prejudices. Baser moti­v­es are not needed. When the desired outcome of a case is matched with the inclinations of a judge, success is almost assured.
Any miscalculation in assessing human predilections is ringfenced by keeping the sword of transfer in full view of any judge, who may entertain adventurous ideas.
The president of the country will have the authority to transfer a judge of one high court to another. They can be exiled from a city or an area, where they have spent a lifetime, to another high court in another province.
They will have no say in the matter. To the contrary, a judge, who does not accept such a transfer will be deemed retired.
 
 

The powerful dissent of SC’s Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan in the Islamabad High Court judges’ case ought to have made us pause and reflect on the deleterious consequences of such transfers for judicial independence.
Instead, we have swung full throttled in the opposite direction. Even the judges of the SC will no longer be immune from such actions.
The judges of the Federal Constitu­tional Court (FCC) will be appointed from lawyers or from judges of the SC.
Any SC judge, who refuses to accept this appointment, will be deemed retired.
Do not be surprised if you soon witness a purge of “undesirable” SC judges.
In matters of transfer, the SC will at least be at par with the high courts. In other respects, it will fare worse.
It will not be left with any authority to hear any appeals in constitutional cases from the high courts.
That authority will belong to the FCC. So will the jurisdiction to decide disputes between provinces, or between one or more provinces and the Federation, to adjudicate petitions for the enforcement of fundamental rights, and to advise the president on questions of constitutional law. All such matters presently pending in the SC will stand transferred to the FCC.
Appeals, under various statutes, will be diverted to the FCC by making an amendment to them.
It is apparent that the Elections Act, 2017 and other such statutes will soon be modified to effect this change.
All election disputes will soon fall into the FCC’s lap. If a substantial question of constitutional law, by some quirk of fate or lawyer’s ingenuity gets raised in any case before any court, the FCC will have the authority to sweep all such matters into its domain.
With one stroke of pen, the almost century old law of precedent will be erased. The FCC will not be bound by a judgment of the SC. All courts, including the SC, will be bound by the judgement of the FCC. That settles any lingering doubt about which of the two courts is higher.
Where does this leave the SC? It will not be the highest court in the land anymore. It will be restricted to hearing appeals in civil and criminal matters just like the district and sessions courts.
Nothing of any consequence on the national and constitutional plane will remain in its domain.
For all effects and purposes, it will be reduced to the ‘Supreme District and Sessions Court’.
What General Ziaul Haq may have dreamt of, and what General Pervez Musharraf could not achieve, will soon be an accomplished fact.
This amendment, when carried, will give a lie to all those who have protested the ineffectiveness of our “elected” representatives and the inability of our parliament to change things. As demolition jobs go, this one is inimitable.

Sharaa, whose rebel forces ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad late last year, is due to meet US President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday.
It’s the first such visit by a Syrian president since the country’s independence in 1946, according to analysts.
The interim leader met Trump for the first time in Riyadh during the US president’s regional tour in May.
US envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said earlier this month that Sharaa would “hopefully” sign an agreement to join the international US-led alliance against the Islamic State (IS) group.
The United States plans to establish a military base near Damascus “to coordinate humanitarian aid and observe developments between Syria and Israel”, a diplomatic source in Syria told AFP.
The State Department’s decision Friday to remove Sharaa from the blacklist was widely expected.
State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said Sharaa’s government had been meeting US demands, including on working to find missing Americans and on eliminating any remaining chemical weapons.
 
 

“These actions are being taken in recognition of the progress demonstrated by the Syrian leadership after the departure of Bashar al-Assad and more than 50 years of repression under the Assad regime,” Pigott said.
The spokesman added that the US delisting would promote “regional security and stability as well as an inclusive, Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process.”
The Syrian interior ministry announced on Saturday that it had carried out 61 raids and made 71 arrests in a “proactive campaign to neutralise the threat” of IS, according to the official SANA news agency.
It said the raids targeted locations where IS sleeper cells remain, including Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, Homs, Deir ez-Zor, Raqqa, and Damascus.
After his arrival in the United States, Sharaa shared a video on social media of him playing basketball with CENTCOM commander Brad Cooper and Kevin Lambert, the head of the international anti-IS operation in Iraq, alongside the caption “work hard, play harder”.
Transformation
Sharaa’s Washington trip comes after his landmark visit to the United Nations in September — his first time on US soil — where the ex-jihadist became the first Syrian president in decades to address the UN General Assembly in New York.
On Thursday, Washington led a vote by the Security Council to remove UN sanctions against him.
Formerly affiliated with Al-Qaeda, Sharaa’s group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), was delisted as a terrorist group by Washington as recently as July.
Since taking power, Syria’s new leaders have sought to break from their violent past and present a moderate image more tolerable to ordinary Syrians and foreign powers.
The White House visit “is further testament to the US commitment to the new Syria and a hugely symbolic moment for the country’s new leader, who thus marks another step in his astonishing transformation from militant leader to global statesman,” International Crisis Group US program director Michael Hanna said.
Sharaa is expected to seek funds for Syria, which faces significant challenges in rebuilding after 13 years of brutal civil war.
In October, the World Bank put a “conservative best estimate” of the cost of rebuilding Syria at $216 billion.</p><small>2025-11-09 06:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091056436d89773.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954072/as-cop30-gathers-whats-the-latest-in-climate-science' target='_blank'><strong>As COP30 gathers, what’s the latest in climate science?</strong></a><br><p>With the pace of climate change speeding up, extreme weather and other impacts are taking an increasing toll on populations and environments across the globe.
Here are some of the developments this year in climate science:
Warmer, faster
Global temperatures are not just climbing, they are now climbing faster than before, with new records logged for 2023 and 2024, and at points in 2025. That finding was part of a key study in June that updated baseline data used in the science reports done every few years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The new research shows the average global temperature rising at a rate of 0.27 degrees Celsius each decade — or almost 50 per cent faster than in the 1990s and 2000s when the warming rate was around 0.2°C per decade.
 
 

Sea levels are rising faster now too — at about 4.5 millimetres per year over the last decade, compared with 1.85 mm per year measured across the decades since 1900.
The world is now on track to cross the 1.5°C warming threshold around 2030, after which scientists warn we will likely trigger catastrophic, irreversible impacts. Already, the world has warmed by 1.3-1.4°C since the pre-industrial era, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.
Tipping points
Warm-water corals are in an almost irreversible die-off from successive marine heatwaves — marking what would be the first so-called climate tipping point, when an environmental system begins to shift into a different state.
Researchers in October also warned that the Amazon rainforest could begin to die back and transform into a different ecosystem, such as savannah, if rapid deforestation continues as global warming crosses 1.5°C, which is earlier than previously estimated.
They said meltwater from the thawing ice sheet atop Greenland could help cause an earlier collapse in the ocean current called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, that keeps winters mild in Europe.
In Antarctica, where ice sheets are also under threat, scientists are worried about declining sea ice surrounding the southernmost continent. Similar to what is happening in the Arctic, ice loss exposes dark water that can absorb more solar radiation — which amplifies the overall warming trend. It also jeopardises the growth of phytoplankton that consume much of the world’s CO2.
Land on fire
Along with heatwaves and drought, wildfires still threaten to be frequent and severe.
This year’s State of Wildfires report, led by a group of weather agencies and universities, counted some 3.7 million square kilometres as having burned between March 2024 and February 2025 — an area about the size of India and Norway combined.
That was slightly less than the annual average burned for the last two decades. But the fires produced higher CO2 emissions than before, as more carbon-dense forests burned.
Deadly heat
Researchers are working on ways to assess heat-related health risks and tolls, as UN health and weather agencies estimate about half the world’s population is already struggling.
 
 

The agencies also estimate worker productivity dropping 2-3pc for every degree above 20°C, while another study in the Lancet journal in October estimates global losses of more than $1 trillion from that lost productivity for last year alone.
There is no consistent international definition for a heat-related death, but technological advances are helping scientists to bridge data gaps and compare conditions from place to place.
For example, in Europe, one team at the UK’s Imperial College used mortality trends to estimate more than 24,400 deaths this summer related to heat exposure across about 30pc of the European population.
They attributed up to 70pc of those deaths to climate-fueled heat, based on the same mortality trends applied to a model of Europe without global warming.
For last year’s record-hot European summer, another team used computer modelling to examine mortality statistics along with temperature data and health parameters, estimating more than 62,700 heat-related deaths across 32 countries, or about 70pc of the continent’s population.
Science under attack
The US administration under climate-denying President Donald Trump is hoping to slash funding for agencies that collect and monitor climate and weather data, worrying a scientific community that says US leadership will be hard to replace.
 
 

Trump’s 2026 budget request, yet to be approved by Congress, proposes halving the annual budget for NASA Earth Science to about $1 billion and cutting NOAA’s spending by more than a quarter to $4.5bn while eliminating its climate research arm, among other cuts.
Elsewhere, however, public science spending is increasing, with record budgets for science research in China, the UK, Japan, and the European Union. The EU also last month opened its real-time weather data monitoring to public access.</p><small>2025-11-09 06:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08213126ff3ddc6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953906/pml-n-ppp-dismiss-claims-of-27th-constitutional-amendment-being-passed-in-haste' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N, PPP dismiss claims of 27th Constitutional Amendment being passed in haste</strong></a><br><p>The PML-N and the PPP on Saturday rejected the impression that the 27th Constitutional Amendment was rushed through without proper debate, saying the draft has undergone “extensive scrutiny”.
Earlier today, after getting approval from the federal cabinet, the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
Speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said there was “no urgency” in convening the cabinet meeting even though Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif attended the session virtually from Baku, Azerbaijan.
Malik said there was “a lot of discussion” about the proposed constitutional amendment, adding that deliberations were continuing within party committees and that it was the parliamentarians’ right to propose amendments.
He maintained that a “wrong impression” had been created that the process was being hurried. The state minister also said that some changes can be made to the draft as it is under debate in parliamentary committees.
When informed by the show’s host that the 18th Amendment was passed after over a year of consultations and the 26th Amendment was debated for more than a month, while the proposed 27th Amendment appeared to have moved from draft to agreement in less than a week, with PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari receiving the draft on Monday, holding a Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting, and reaching consensus shortly after, Malik acknowledged the unusually rapid pace of the process.
PPP’s Nadeem Afzal Chan, however, credited his party, highlighting that hours-long sessions were held during the two-day CEC, with every member participating in a detailed and open discussion on issues ranging from Article 243 to dual nationality. He assured that there was adequate debate within the PPP on the proposed changes.
“If law-making is done in a hurry, the public becomes suspicious for no reason,” Chan said.
When asked about revision in the NFC formula, Chan said that the federation grants tax exemptions worth Rs300 billion and oversees around 25 departments that do not even conduct audits.
“You cannot fix your own tax system and then say you will take money from the provinces,” he said.
The bill, which was tabled in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, proposed the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, changes in the process for appointing high court judges, changes to the threshold for provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.
At the outset of the session, Tarar, who had earlier in the day briefed the media on some features of the proposed legislation after the federal cabinet meeting), requested the suspension of the question hour and other house business so he could brief lawmakers on the amendment.
The law minister then moved the bill before the upper house, with Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani referring it to the National Assembly and Senate standing committees on law and justice for review and consideration. He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
During the Senate session, PTI’s Ali Zafar said debating the constitutional amendment was not appropriate when the leader of the opposition’s seat remained vacant. He said that the government and its allied parties appeared to be in a hurry to pass the bill.
The PTI did not attend the subsequent session of the parliamentary committees and called it a “conspiracy against the Constitution”.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-09 05:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08200814a5716e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953897/pti-terms-27th-amendment-conspiracy-against-the-constitution-boycotts-committee-discussions' target='_blank'><strong>PTI terms 27th Amendment ‘conspiracy against the Constitution’, boycotts committee discussions</strong></a><br><p>The PTI has called the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment a “conspiracy against the Constitution” and refused to become part of the proceedings of the committee established to discuss the bill.
“The proposed 27th Amendment is nothing short of a conspiracy against the Constitution. The entire process is being carried out in haste, without consultation or deliberation, in complete disregard of democratic norms and parliamentary traditions,” Senator Ali Zafar said while talking to Dawn.
“These amendments strike at the very foundation of the constitutional structure by undermining the independence of the judiciary and eroding the delicate balance of powers that the 1973 Constitution so carefully created,” he said.
“Any change to the Constitution must come only through broad-based national consensus, not through secret drafts or executive dictates. The Constitution belongs to the people of Pakistan, not to any government of the day, and no one has the right to mutilate it for political convenience,” Senator Zafar said while explaining why his party has decided not to become part of the debate.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said the proposed constitutional amendment is a “ploy to enslave us”.
“Subjugating the Supreme Court to a new court, whose judges will be the favorites of the current Form 47 government, is to turn the judicial system into an instrument of coercion,” said the PTI leader in a post on X.
 






Former Speaker National Assembly Asad Qaiser, while talking to Dawn, said that PTI has a clear stance that the current parliament cannot do any legislation as it lacks the mandate of the masses.
“We will use all possible tactics and platforms, including protest, to stop the legislation. I believe that fresh elections should be held before any such legislation because the current government is a Form-47 government and it does not have the mandate of the people,” he explained.
Asad Qaiser said that a meeting of the party leadership will be called to devise further strategy to resist the move.
Earlier, while talking to the media outside the Parliament, Senator Zafar claimed that the draft of the 27th Amendment had 50 amendments.
He said it was strange that the amendments were being made without sharing them with the masses. Zafar added that his party’s Senators would not be able to discuss the amendment in the committee, as they had not read the bill.
Replying to a question, he said that the civil society, legislators and other stakeholders discussed the draft of the 18th Amendment for over a year and gave their recommendations and proposals, but this time “efforts were being made to pass the amendment in haste”.
Senator Zafar said that it was unfortunate that the spirit of the 1973 Constitution was being changed, and the PPP is supporting it.
Earlier today,  the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
The bill proposed the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, changes in the process for appointing high court judges, changes to the threshold for provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.

He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
Following deliberations on the proposed amendment, the law committees of both Houses adjourned the moot till Sunday.
PM Shehbaz had held consultations with multiple ruling allies on Thursday, meeting with the top leadership of the PML-Q, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), the Balochistan Awami Party, the Awami National Party (ANP) and the PML-Zia.
However, there was no meeting between the government and the PTI.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-09 05:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/090852203c99ddb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953943/sindh-high-court-decides-to-examine-whole-concept-of-keeping-zoos-and-caging-animals' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh High Court decides to examine ‘whole concept of keeping zoos and caging animals’</strong></a><br><p>• After Rano’s relocation to Islamabad, bench broadens scope of petition to welfare of all zoo animals
• In written order released on Saturday, court orders formation of new committee comprising govt officials and civil society members
to inspect zoos across Sindh
KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has ordered formation of a new committee to visit zoos across the province and suggest steps for improvement as well as sending the exotic animals to their natural habitats.
Inviting suggestions to phase out zoos in the entire province, a two-judge SHC bench comprising Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Justice Syed Fiaz-ul-Hassan Shah declared that the court had decided to examine the whole concept of keeping zoos and caging animals.
The remarks were part of a written order issued on Saturday regarding the Nov 6 hearing of a petition seeking shifting of lone female bear Rano from Karachi Zoological Gardens to Bear Sanctuary, Islamabad Wildlife Management Board.
The order stated that the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and other respondents filed statements and reports and submitted that Rano had been successfully transported to the federal capital on Nov 5 in compliance with the orders issued by the bench earlier.
However, the bench enhanced the scope of the petition from Rano to the welfare of all animals kept in zoos and invited suggestions as to how to phase out zoos in the entire province.
Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar proposed that a committee may be constituted with the municipal commissioner, forest & wildlife secretary, wildlife conservator and KMC’s senior director-zoo as its members.
 
 

Representing the petitioner, Mohammad Jibran Nasir also suggested that philanthropist Ava Ardeshir Cowasjee, Dr Uzma Khan from Asia lead for WWF Pakistan, Advocate Nazia Hanjrah, Zhalay Sarhadi and petitioner/animal rights activist Jude Allen Preira may also be made part of the committee.
The bench ordered constitution of the committee and inclusion of all the names suggested by the wildlife conservator and the petitioner’s counsel.
The bench in its order stated: “In addition, the committee shall be given mandate to co-opt experts of the subject fields, who shall visit the zoos in the province and suggests steps for improvement in the zoos and identify issues being confronted by them at the moment to resolve them as a short term measure. As a long term measures, they shall recommend steps to be taken which may include but not limited to sending the exotic animals to their natural habitat.”
It further stated that as per the petitioner’s counsel the committee, constituted by the chief minister for shifting of Rano, had visited Karachi Zoo and found all the medical equipment out of order.
 
 

The bench stated that Zoo Director Aklaq Ahmed Yousufzai had undertaken to replace all out-of-order machines immediately and to outsource vets for treatment of the animals.
The hearing was adjourned till Nov 21.
At a previous hearing, the bench had directed the committee formed by the CM to visit the Karachi zoo and prepare a detailed report about the number of animals kept there as well as their physical and mental health.
It also asked the committee to examine the circumstances under which animals are being kept as well as to identify the animals as natives or exotic and must also make recommendations for improving the situation if it found the animals were kept in improper conditions.
The bench further ruled that since the issue was not of one bear but hundreds of animals being kept in captivity apparently just for entertainment of people and court has decided to examine the whole concept of keeping zoos and caging animals.

Earlier today, after getting approval from the federal cabinet, the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
The TTAP is a coalition of six opposition parties and was formed last year. Earlier in July, it formalised its organisational structure, declaring blanket support for all anti-government protests.
Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, in a video statement, said the protest movement would begin from November 9 (Sunday).
 






Abbas said that democratic institutions in the country have been “paralysed” and the “nation must step up”. Lamenting the proposed changes, he said the government was given even more power through “to the powerful”.
“In this hour, it is the responsibility of the people of Pakistan to take a stand and speak against such an extremely dark and extremely dangerous constitutional amendment, which is the 27th (Amendment).
Leader of the opposition-designate Achakzai said the alliance, through the protest movement, will show that the “will of the people” of Pakistan will be the final decision.
“I have given an oath, at least on five different occasions, that I will safeguard the Constitution. Our parliament is attacking our Constitution,” said the PkMAP leader, who is also the chairman of the opposition alliance.
He added that as the parliament is representative of the people, the opposition alliance is approaching the masses directly. “The way they are attacking the parliament, and the manner in which they are shaking the foundations of the Constitution and Pakistan, we are left with no other option.”
Achakzai appealed to all political parties to participate and said their movement would kick off on Sunday night. “Every night, with a new slogan, we will awaken the consciousness of the people. The slogan of the people is the supremacy of the Constitution,” added the veteran politician.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar moved the bill before the upper house, with Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani referring it to the National Assembly and Senate standing committees on law and justice for review and consideration. He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
Following deliberations on the proposed amendment, the law committees of both Houses adjourned the moot till Sunday.
Key clauses of the proposed amendment
Tarar, while tabling the bill in the Senate, said it would address five subject areas.
He highlighted that one of the things agreed in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006 was the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters.
“During consultations on the 26th Constitutional Amendment, some of our friends suggested that we refrain from making such a huge change and experiment by forming constitutional benches,” he said.
The minister said that constitutional benches had been formed, but judges spent most of their time listening to such matters and other cases during the rest of the time. “The fact of the matter is that five to six per cent of cases take 40pc of the court’s time and the rest of the cases remain as is,” he said.
He further stated that some argued that constitutional benches were a “court within a court” and also raised other objections.
“After detailed consultations with all political forces … We said that the wish and demand of a Federal Constitutional Court should be brought into the Parliament, which we have done through this bill,” he said.
He said that another issue concerned the process for the transfer of high court judges. This was addressed in the 1973 Constitution, which empowered the president to make the transfer on the advice of the premier in consultation. He said that the transfer could be made for two years without the judge’s consent, but longer periods would require it.
“In the 18th Amendment, the two-year condition was removed, and it was stated that the judge’s consent would be sought. In the 26th Amendment, the condition remained the same but concerns were raised about the interference of the executive,” he said.
He further said that it was proposed that the bit about the premier’s advice for the transfer of judges be removed and handed over to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
“It also has safeguards that a judge more senior than the chief justice will not be sent so that there is no dispute about that,” he said, adding that it was up to the JCP whether or not it wanted to seek the judge’s consent.
Talking about elections for the upper house of Parliament, he noted that they took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after a delay of more than a year.
“The first thing after a Senate election is the election of the chairman and deputy chairman. To avoid any dispute in this regard, a clause has been introduced,” he said.
The minister further said that the bill also proposed increasing the 11pc provincial threshold for the cabinet to 13pc, noting that all provinces had voiced concerns apart from Punjab.
The Constitution allows the provinces to have cabinets not exceeding 15 ministers or 11pc of the total membership of their respective provincial assembly, whichever of the two is higher.
“Previously, there were five provincial advisers … now they have been increased to seven,” he said.
Talking about Article 243, which provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces”, the minister said that certain clauses were being introduced.
He said that Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir had been awarded the title of field marshal. “This is a title, not a rank, not an appointment as such … whereas army chief is an appointment with a five-year tenure,” he said.
“Field marshal, or marshal of the air force, admiral of the fleet — these exist in different countries for land, navy and air forces — these have been mentioned, and it has been stated that these titles will be given to national heroes. These titles are for a lifetime. It is a title,” he said.
He further said that it was clarified that the “impeachment or reversal” of the title would not be at the premier’s authority but at Parliament’s.
He further said that the office of CJCSC would be abolished from November 27, 2025. “The present CJCSC is also our hero; it will be abolished after his appointment ends. Parliament cannot even think of depriving him of the role during his tenure,” he said.
The minister said, however, that there would be no new appointment because the COAS had been given the role of the chief of defence forces. He further said that the bill proposed that the prime minister, on the recommendation of the COAS, would appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command.
“Where the federal government promotes a member of the armed forces to the rank of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet, such officer shall retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life,” he said, reading from the bill.
“Upon completion of the term of his command, under the law, the federal government shall determine the responsibilities and duties of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet in the interest of the state,” he read out from the draft.
The opposition PTI has criticised most of the tweaks, terming the proposed amendment an “attack“ on the Parliament. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said earlier this week that it would be inappropriate to claw back population and education from the provinces.
On the other hand, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Wednesday assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th Amendment.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-09 05:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/091036503df80be.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954056/essay-when-was-allama-iqbal-actually-born' target='_blank'><strong>ESSAY: WHEN WAS ALLAMA IQBAL ACTUALLY BORN?</strong></a><br><p> 

Allama Iqbal

Allama Iqbal’s date of birth has always been a contentious issue among scholars. Though the government of Pakistan had officially declared November 9, 1877 as Iqbal’s date of birth and the year 1977 was celebrated as Iqbal centennial year, some scholars have had their doubts and argued that it could not be said with absolute certainty that Iqbal was born on the official date.
A great many articles have been written, both in Urdu and English, elaborating the issue of Iqbal’s date of birth. Going through these articles and some books — notably Allama Iqbal Ki Tareekh-i-Vilaadat: Aik Mutal’a, compiled by Waheed Qureshi and Zahid Muneer Aamir (Bazm-i-Iqbal, Lahore, 1994) — there are some interesting facts which emerge. Firstly, during the last 100 years or so, scholars have mentioned different dates while discussing Iqbal’s life. Second, despite the official announcement, disagreement still exists on Iqbal’s correct date of birth.
Akber Hyderi Kashmiri, an Indian scholar, in his article published in Nuqoosh’s special issue on Iqbal (1977) listed contrasting years that different writers had mentioned as Iqbal’s birth year. These included: 1870, 1872, 1873, 1875, 1876 and 1877.
Muhammaduddin Fauq (1877-1945), editor of Kashmiri Magazine, was among the scholars who penned the earliest writings on Iqbal. Fauq had mentioned 1875 as Iqbal’s year of birth, in his article published in 1909, but when Zulfiqar Ali Khan — in his book A Voice from the East (1922) — said Iqbal was born in or around 1876, Fauq changed his stance and, in Nairang-i-Khayal’s special issue on Iqbal (1932) wrote that Iqbal was born in 1876.

Today, November 9, is celebrated as Muhammad Iqbal’s birthday and Iqbal Day every year. But there is still debate about Allama Iqbal’s actual date and year of birth

One of the reasons for this confusion was Iqbal’s own indifference to his year of birth. Once, when Fauq tried to gather some biographical details, Iqbal did not cooperate and wrote back in a letter (1922) saying that “there was nothing in it.”
Dates and debates
Scholars had been quoting different years as to when Iqbal was born, but an editorial note and its correction in Inqelaab, one of Lahore’s leading newspapers at that time, sparked a debate that lives on even today.
Inqelaab had published, after Iqbal’s death (April 21, 1938), December 1876 as the month and year of Iqbal’s birth. But in its May 7, 1938 issue, another editorial note appeared, saying that Iqbal’s date of birth mentioned in a previous issue was based on what Sheikh Ata Muhammad, Iqbal’s real brother, had said. The note further said that it was established after research that Iqbal’s correct date of birth was February 22, 1873 and, according to the Islamic calendar, it was Zilhaj 23/24, 1289 Hijri.
This caught on and some writers began to quote Iqbal’s newly assumed date of birth. For instance, Muhammad Tahir Farooqi, in his Seerat-e-Iqbal (1939), wrote that he was born on 24 Zilhaj 1289, which corresponded to February 22, 1873. In 1951, the government’s archaeology department sent a letter to Bazm-i-Iqbal, Lahore, asking for the authentic date on which Iqbal was born, wrote Waheed Qureshi. Bazm-i-Iqbal constituted a committee which, after obtaining some records from Sialkot’s Municipal Committee and others from Iqbal’s school and college, discussed the issue in detail to resolve that Iqbal was born on February 22, 1873.
The committee decided to convey the date to the archaeology department to amend the year of Iqbal’s birth inscribed on his tombstone, which read 1292 Hijri (corresponding to 1875-76). Interestingly, the tombstone had been presented by the government of Afghanistan and nobody knew where they had got the year from.
With this authentication from Bazm-i-Iqbal, some writers — such as Abdul Majeed Salik in his Zikr-i-Iqbal (1955) — mentioned February 22, 1873 as Iqbal’s date of birth. Also, Pakistan’s postal department issued a commemorative postage stamp on Iqbal’s 20th death anniversary in 1958 and it carried 1873 as Iqbal’s year of birth.
Iqbal’s own account
But in 1958, Prof Jan Marek of Prague University published a research paper titled ‘The Date of Muhammad Iqbal’s Birth’ in which he said that, according to Iqbal’s own account, he was born on Ziquad 3, 1294 Hijri, in Sialkot which, according to the Gregorian calendar, was November 9, 1877, though Iqbal had mistakenly thought that it corresponded with 1876.
The renowned German scholar Dr Annemarie Schimmel wrote in Gabriel’s Wing that “9th November 1877 would correspond to this hijra date and this date would match also better with the different phases of Iqbal’s life in college and university than 1873” (Iqbal Academy, Lahore, p.35).
Faqeer Vaheeduddin, Abdul Vahid Moini and some other scholars agreed that Iqbal had wrongly assumed that 1294 Hijri would correspond to 1876 and his correct date of birth was Nov 9, 1877. So it was generally accepted as Iqbal’s correct date of birth and Pakistan’s postal department issued two commemorative postage stamps on April 21, 1967, giving 1877 as Iqbal’s year of birth.
Further research
In 1971, Khalid Nazeer Sufi, who was related to Iqbal, published his book Iqbal Daroon-i-Khana and in it, quoting from Sialkot Municipality’s register of births and deaths, he claimed that, as per the record, Iqbal was born on December 29, 1873.
To discuss the issue, Bazm-i-Iqbal, Lahore, constituted a sub-committee in 1972. On the committee were renowned scholars like Syed Nazeer Niazi and Allama Iqbal’s son Justice Dr Javid Iqbal and others. Later on, Waheed Qureshi, too, was included in the committee and he and two other members of the committee visited Sialkot to obtain the records.
Government committees
While Bazm-i-Iqbal’s sub-committee was still researching the matter, the government of India announced the formation of a committee, with the then prime minister Indira Gandhi as its head, to celebrate Iqbal’s centennial in 1973, assuming that Iqbal was born in 1873. This prompted the Pakistan government to declare that Iqbal’s centenary would be celebrated on a grand scale here, too.
But the issue of Iqbal’s correct date of birth, however, was yet to be resolved. To settle the issue, a committee was constituted by the government of Pakistan. So Bazm-i-Iqbal’s sub-committee stopped its work. The committee formed by the government, after deliberations, decided that the date of birth mentioned by Iqbal himself in his PhD dissertation, ie November 9, 1877, should be accepted as authentic.
Disagreement
But some members included in the government’s committee, such as Waheed Qureshi and Hameed Ahmed Khan, disagreed and insisted on adding a clause to their work that said “until no further evidence is available, November 9, 1877, should be accepted as Iqbal’s date of birth.” In other words, they had accepted this date tentatively. But when the official announcement was made, the clause was missing and it was officially pronounced that the year 1977 was to be celebrated as Iqbal’s centenary year.
At least four scholars, Khalid Nazeer Sufi, Dr Waheed Qureshi, Malik Ram and Dr Akber Hyderi Kashmiri, were of the view that it was more probable that Iqbal’s correct date of birth was December 29, 1873. Waheed Qureshi in Nuqoosh’s Iqbal number (vol. 2) and Malik Ram in his book Tehqeeqi Mazameen have discussed the issue in detail.
The three dates
Of three dates, often quoted as Iqbal’s correct date of birth, the first one is February 22, 1873. Inqelaab wrote that it was based on Sialkot’s Municipality’s records. But Justice Dr Javid Iqbal, Iqbal’s son, quoting senior members of his family, said that this date referred to a baby boy born to Iqbal’s parents before Iqbal’s birth and that boy died in infancy.
The second date, December 29, 1873, is — as claimed by Khalid Nazeer Sufi — recorded in Sialkot’s Municipal register of births and deaths. Sufi’s claim was rejected by Javid Iqbal on the basis that the entry assumingly referring to Iqbal, in fact, belonged to a baby boy whose father shared the same name as Iqbal’s father. Also, the other details, such as father’s caste and profession mentioned in the register, did not match with Iqbal’s father.
But Waheed Qureshi, while mentioning Iqbal’s educational records and the years in which Iqbal attended certain educational institutes, said this date was most probably Iqbal’s correct date of birth, as it coincided with Iqbal’s life events. Malik Ram, too, said that if this date is accepted as Iqbal’s date of birth, the other events of his life, such as passing certain exams at educational institutes, fitted in well.
As for November 9, 1877, it is not recorded in Sialkot’s Municipal register. But it can be safely assumed that, for some reason, the birth was not reported to the municipality and not being reported is not a proof of not being born. What gives credence to this date is that Iqbal himself mentioned it in his doctoral dissertation note, though he had mistakenly written 1876 instead of 1877.
On the basis of this evidence, some scholars believe November 9, 1877, should be accepted as Iqbal’s correct date of birth.

The cleric from Punjab’s Attock district had once served quietly as a government-appointed prayer leader in Lahore. Yet, by 2015, he had emerged as the fiery voice behind rallies demanding the release of Mumtaz Qadri, the police guard who had murdered Punjab governor Salman Taseer in 2011 over his views on Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.
Rizvi was, by all appearances, an unlikely revolutionary. Paralysed after a 2006 road accident, he spoke with a mix of crude Punjabi humour, caustic wit and eloquent Urdu, often quoting Allama Iqbal to give profound gravity to his fiery sermons.
Initially attracting only a small following from the Barelvi school of thought, Rizvi’s fusion of intense religious fervour and populist anger quickly resonated across Pakistan’s disillusioned and devout segments. His thunderous speeches transformed him from a fringe preacher into the architect of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a group capable of mobilising massive rallies and paralysing entire cities.
Five years after Rizvi died in 2020, the TLP has not only survived but also thrived under his son, Saad Rizvi. The movement has cemented its status as one of Pakistan’s most volatile and potent political forces, blurring the boundaries between religious extremism, political populism and state authority.

The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) is once again facing a ban after being accused of being involved in terrorism. Five years after the death of its founder Khadim Hussain Rizvi, his party remains one of the country’s most disruptive political forces. But the TLP’s story is not just about weaponisation of religion — it’s about class, power and a state caught between crackdown and appeasement

This October, familiar scenes of unrest resurfaced following a protest call by the TLP. Major cities, including Lahore, Islamabad and Rawalpindi, came to a standstill as mobile services were suspended, schools closed and highways blocked with shipping containers. Clashes near Lahore turned deadly, reigniting memories of the group’s previous confrontations with the state. In response, the government once again imposed a ban on TLP under anti-terrorism laws.
 
 

Yet, as many analysts note, such prohibitions may restrict the group’s legal status but do little to diminish its ideological influence, particularly on the deeply sensitive issue of blasphemy in Pakistan.
To understand this enduring paradox, this piece traces the TLP’s trajectory: from its rise through blasphemy politics and the revival of Barelvi identity, and the state’s continuing struggle to contain the growing political power of faith on Pakistan’s streets.
THE BARELVI POLITICAL AWAKENING
For many, the TLP’s rise was not a disruption but a long-awaited moment of identity assertion. It is the awakening of Pakistan’s Barelvi community, a vast majority who have long felt both politically and religiously marginalised.
“The TLP is not just politics for us, it is the powerful reclamation of our Barelvi identity,” Aamir Mustafai, a teacher at a local madrassa [seminary] in Punjab’s Jhelum district, told me during the 2024 election campaign. “This is the continuation of a forgotten struggle, echoing the same battle for dignity and faith that Syed Ahmad Barelvi led against the Sikh Empire in Punjab generations ago.”
The Barelvi school of thought has historically had a strong influence among Pakistan’s rural populace, due to its deep association with Sufi orders and shrine networks. Politically, the Barelvi movement found its organised expression in the post-Independence era through the urban-based Jamiat-i-Ulema Pakistan (JUP). 
Under the leadership of Allama Shah Ahmad Noorani, a Karachi cleric, the JUP rose to national prominence as he unified fragmented Barelvi clerics and revived the party in the late 1960s, leading it into the 1970 general elections. However, its political strength was centred in urban Sindh, especially Karachi and Hyderabad, where it won seven National Assembly seats, the peak of organised Barelvi representation. By the 1980s, however, the rise of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and deepening internal rifts pushed the JUP into political obscurity.
Analysts note that this decline was further compounded by Cold War-era geopolitics. After the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan’s Deobandi institutions emerged as the principal intellectual and logistical backbone of the Afghan ‘jihad’, benefitting from state patronage, US support and Gulf funding.
“In the decades that followed,” says Israr Madani, an Islamabad-based researcher studying Islamist movements, “the influence of Deobandi scholars, madrassas, religious parties and militant groups expanded across the region, especially after the rise of the Taliban, which drew heavily on Deobandi ideology and networks. In contrast, the Barelvis increasingly felt invisible and irrelevant in the political and religious landscape, despite being a demographic majority.”
In this vacuum, new urban-based actors emerged. Saleem Qadri, a Karachi cleric, founded the Sunni Tehreek (ST) in 1990, to militantly protect Barelvi mosques from encroachment by Deobandi and Ahl-i-Hadith (Salafi) groups. Its slogan, “Jawaniyaan lutayein gey, masjidein bachayein gey [We will sacrifice our lives to protect our mosques]”, reflected its militant defensive posture. 
But following Noorani’s death in 2003, the JUP weakened further, and the ST’s influence waned after its leadership was killed in a suicide bombing in Karachi in 2006. 
Barelvi clerics, grounded in Sufi traditions of devotion and restraint, largely avoided the jihadist and sectarian conflicts of the era. This distance, as Mustafai noted, “made us invisible and irrelevant.” The community eventually sought a more assertive voice, one it ultimately found in the TLP’s aggressive political activism.
Now, the centre of power of Barelvi politics had moved from the urban centres of Karachi to the rural and small-town populace of Punjab. Furthermore, the nature of leadership shifted from Noorani’s intellectual-clerical approach to Rizvi’s populist mobilisation, focused intensely on the issue of blasphemy.

THE POLITICS OF BLASPHEMY
“Gustakh-i-Rasool ki ek hi saza, sar tan se juda [The only punishment for blasphemy is beheading]” has become the defining chant of TLP rallies, encapsulating both the group’s ideological core and the mechanism through which it mobilises large crowds. 
The TLP emerged directly from the campaign to defend the convicted Qadri. Qadri’s execution in 2016, after the government’s resistance to immense pressure, became a formative moment in Pakistan’s modern religious politics. The vast, impassioned crowds at his funeral showed the dormant strength of Barelvi supporters across Punjab and Sindh, a constituency long considered apolitical or organisationally fragmented.
In the days following the funeral, senior Barelvi clerics convened in Islamabad to deliberate the future political direction of their community. Some advocated restraint, warning against politicising devotional sentiment. However, a majority endorsed Rizvi’s call to form a new movement capable of channelling Barelvi grievances into organised political influence. The result was the creation of the Tehreek Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah, later renamed as the TLP.
The group entered electoral politics in January 2017 at Karachi’s Nishtar Park and gained national attention that same year by contesting a Lahore by-election. This transition marked its evolution from a street protest movement into an organised political force, willing to confront the state through both ballots and large-scale blockades.
TLP’s rapid rise is rooted in its strategic — critics say weaponised — use of Pakistan’s stringent blasphemy laws. By portraying Qadri as a martyr and redefining religious devotion as political resistance, the party transformed traditional Barelvi piety into a defiant and uncompromising street movement, sharply diverging from the sect’s historically Sufi orientation.
The party first tested the state’s limits in 2017, when it staged a weeks-long sit-in near Islamabad over a minor amendment to the Khatm-i-Nabuwwat [Seal of the Prophets] oath in the Election Act. The protest brought Islamabad to a standstill and ended only after the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government conceded to the group’s demands, including the resignation of the law minister.
A year later, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government faced similar pressure over the appointment of Princeton economist Atif R. Mian, an Ahmadi, forcing his removal. And when the Supreme Court in 2018 acquitted Asia Bibi, a Christian woman accused of blasphemy, TLP-led protests erupted across the nation, demanding the judges’ execution.
The party’s influence has since extended to foreign policy. In 2021, the TLP organised nationwide protests demanding the expulsion of the French ambassador over blasphemous caricatures published in France, underscoring its capacity to steer both domestic and diplomatic discourse.
CLASS, POPULISM AND STREET POWER
In Lahore, the TLP’s street-level appeal cannot be missed. Hundreds of rickshaws bearing portraits of Rizvi and the insignia of the Labbaik Rickshaw Union weave through the city, turning public transport into rolling political billboards. “We support the TLP because it’s a party led by people like us, not Sharifs, Bhuttos or Khans,” Jamil Butt, a rickshaw driver, told me a week before the 2024 elections.
Analysts argue that the TLP’s strength lies in its social composition, particularly in Punjab, where rapid urbanisation has transformed villages into sprawling peri-urban settlements. This shift has produced a frustrated, alienated lower-middle class that feels excluded from both elite politics and economic opportunity.
“Rickshaw drivers, shopkeepers, small traders and farmers saw in him [Khadim Hussain Rizvi] an authentic voice of their frustrations,” says Umair Rasheed, a US-based PhD scholar researching the TLP. “His aggressiveness, his language, the way he challenged the ruling elite, all of it allowed him to appear as ‘one of them’ — a man of the people rather than a distant politician.”
This dynamic, analysts note, is why even the PTI, despite its broad populist appeal, struggled to capture this segment of Punjab’s electorate. Some observers describe the TLP as “the PTI of the poor.”
Rasheed added that Rizvi also cleverly exploited class tensions within the Barelvi community. By empowering local mosque-level maulvis [clerics], he positioned himself against the established Barelvi clerical elite, including pirs [spiritual leaders] or sajjada nasheens [custodians of shrines], whom he frequently condemned in his sermons. This intra-sect critique further endeared him to lower-rank clerics and their followers, who long felt marginalised by hereditary religious hierarchies.
Adam Weinstein, an analyst at the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, who witnessed the TLP’s violent 2017 protest observes, “Enforcing blasphemy is the rallying cry, but beneath it lies rage at a society that offers no way up, and enraged young men always turn on minorities and the state itself.” He argues that what appears to be a religious movement is, in many ways, “class-based fury wrapped in religious language.”
The TLP in Karachi, however, draws strength from an additional and influential source: the conservative Memon business community, giving it both financial muscle and urban legitimacy. Several prominent Memon traders have even contested elections on TLP tickets, fusing economic power with religious populism.
ELECTORAL PERFORMANCE AND POLITICAL DISRUPTION
The TLP built its electoral identity around slogans such as “Deen ko takht par lana hai [Bring religion to power]” and “Vote ki izzat Nizam-i-Mustafa mein hai [The sanctity of the vote lies in the Prophet’s system].” These messages positioned the party as a force seeking to fuse religious absolutism with state authority. 
Unlike many traditional religious parties, the TLP showed an unusual ability to transform street agitation into electoral momentum, drawing in voters disillusioned with mainstream parties and eager for a political vehicle that promised dignity, certainty and confrontation.
Its urban expansion became most visible in Karachi. The 2022 by-election in Korangi, typically a battleground for MQM-Pakistan, demonstrated the TLP’s ability to unsettle entrenched political actors. Groups of TLP supporters appeared at MQM-P rallies, loudly chanting “Labbaik, Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah [O Prophet of God, We Are Ready]”, creating an atmosphere of fear among MQM workers wary of mob aggression. A widely circulated video from the campaign captured MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal accusing the TLP of “using religion as a political weapon.” Clashes erupted between rival workers on the polling day. 
During the campaign, several TLP supporters described their political migration from MQM after a paramilitary crackdown weakened it. Abid Qureshi, a TLP activist, says, “When MQM’s muhalla [neighbourhood] committees disappeared, the local mosque and milad committees became new centres of influence. That’s where TLP stepped in and filled the vacuum.”
Political analysts argue that the TLP’s rise reflects not only religious fervour but also patterns of political displacement in Pakistan’s two largest provinces. Yet the party’s sociology differs sharply between Punjab and urban Sindh. In Punjab, its growth largely came at the expense of the PML-N. A 2018 Gallup Pakistan survey found that 46 percent of TLP voters had backed the PML-N in 2013, indicating a significant transfer of conservative, lower-middle class support toward Rizvi’s movement.
The party’s electoral breakthrough came in the 2018 general elections, when it secured more than 2.2 million votes nationwide, around 4.2 percent of the total, becoming Pakistan’s fifth-largest party by vote count. Although the first-past-the-post system prevented it from winning National Assembly seats, the TLP gained a foothold in the Sindh Assembly, winning two general seats in Karachi, along with one reserved seat for women.
Its disruptive impact extended beyond Punjab. In Karachi’s Lyari, historically a PPP stronghold, the TLP outperformed PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, relegating him to third place and indirectly facilitating a PTI victory. This outcome symbolised how the TLP had begun altering urban political equations.
Despite widespread doubts over the credibility of the 2024 elections, analysts note that the TLP’s vote bank expanded further, reaching roughly 2.89 million, an increase of nearly 700,000 votes since 2018.

DEVASTATING SOCIAL TOLL
In August 2023, the Christian neighbourhood of Jaranwala in Punjab’s Faisalabad district descended into chaos after allegations of Quran desecration against two Christian brothers. Within hours, mobs armed with sticks and stones swept through the streets, burning churches, desecrating Bibles and ransacking Christian homes. Over 20 churches and nearly 100 houses were torched, forcing hundreds of families to flee.
Subsequent police investigations confirmed that the violence did not erupt spontaneously. Local clerics affiliated with the TLP had used mosque loudspeakers to summon crowds, urging them to “defend the sanctity of the Quran.” Punjab authorities later arrested over 100 people, several of them identified as TLP activists.
The Jaranwala tragedy was not an isolated episode — it revealed the deepening fractures in Pakistan’s social and moral order. Over the past decade, the TLP’s aggressive brand of religious populism has fundamentally reshaped the country’s political and social discourse, causing an explosion of blasphemy accusations, a surge in mob lynching and renewed fear among religious minorities, particularly Ahmadis and Christians, according to police officials and rights activists. 
They say that mob violence triggered by mere rumours of blasphemy has become “common, deadly and difficult to contain.” A police officer pointed to a recent Lahore incident, in which a woman wearing a dress decorated with calligraphy was nearly lynched by a mob on the mistaken assumption that the dress was sporting Arabic verses from the Quran. According to him, TLP activists, often backed by sympathetic lawyers, regularly pressure local police to register blasphemy cases without evidence, deepening local law-and-order crises.
A Dawn report on October 18, 2025 cited police officials who linked TLP workers to at least 25 attacks on churches and other religious sites in Punjab during the past three years. These mobs often vandalised property, set buildings ablaze and left several people dead and dozens injured.
Muhammad Amir Rana, an Islamabad-based security analyst, highlights the grave threat posed by the TLP’s Fidayeen Jathay, organised squads whose members reportedly take death oaths and pledge to sacrifice their lives at Saad Rizvi’s command, mirroring the suicide tactics of groups like the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). 
“The TLP’s Fidayeen operate openly among the population,” Rana says, “unlike the TTP’s more concealed camps in Afghanistan. And because the TLP is rooted in Punjab, the country’s political heartland, the emotional charge surrounding its mobilisation may be even more volatile.”
The pattern is disturbingly consistent. Last year, a local PPP member of the National Assembly (MNA), together with TLP leaders in Sindh’s Mirpurkhas district, garlanded police officers to praise them for killing a blasphemy suspect in a staged encounter. 
In 2018, PML-N leader and then Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal narrowly survived an assassination attempt by a TLP sympathiser. There have also been reports of teachers killed by students over alleged “disrespectful remarks”, as well as mobs torching police stations for protecting blasphemy suspects.
GLOBAL REACH
During the 2024 general election campaign, posters of TLP candidates across Punjab featured not only Qadri, the executed assassin, but also Tanveer Ahmed, a British-Pakistani taxi driver from Bradford serving a life sentence in Scotland for murdering an Ahmadi shopkeeper in Glasgow in 2016. Ahmed’s framed portrait, surrounded by slogans praising his “sacrifice” underscored the transnational echo of TLP’s message.
In 2017, an audio recording attributed to Ahmed, who was in jail in Britain, widely shared on TLP social media, urged listeners to attend a rally in Karachi that drew tens of thousands. On stage, the party’s leader, Khadim Rizvi, hailed Ahmed as a hero who had “surprised all of Europe.”
The global resonance of this militant trend is now a concern for Western governments. In 2020, a Pakistani man who stabbed two people outside the former Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine — which had published caricatures of the Prophet (PBUH) in 2006, 2011 and 2012 — told investigators he had been radicalised by watching Rizvi’s speeches online.
Last year, the British government’s Commission for Countering Extremism released a report warning about the emergence of a UK-based wing of the TLP, describing it as “an extremist Pakistan anti-blasphemy political party.” The commission’s findings were unequivocal: the ideological current that propelled TLP’s rise in Pakistan was being mirrored, in subtle but significant ways, among segments of the British Pakistani diaspora.
THE STATE’S DILEMMA
The Pakistani state’s relationship with the TLP has long been defined by a cycle of confrontation and accommodation, bans followed by negotiations, and crackdowns followed by concessions. This cycle reflects the state’s enduring struggle to balance public order with the fear of provoking a religious backlash. Every attempt to contain the group has been tempered by anxiety over the explosive power of blasphemy politics, which the TLP has mastered more effectively than any other contemporary movement.
Since the 2017 sit-in in Faizabad near Islamabad, and until last month, successive governments have oscillated between repression and reconciliation, consistently bowing to the group’s ability to paralyse major cities. 
Some analysts argue that the TLP’s initial ascent was not entirely organic but may have been enabled by certain establishment factions that viewed it as a counterweight to the PML-N, whose leadership had, at the time, adopted a confrontational posture toward the military. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz recently reiterated this claim while defending the provincial government’s renewed crackdown on the TLP.
However, many experts dispute the extent of such alleged state patronage, noting that, while some level of tacit support may have existed, the TLP swiftly developed an autonomous and potent street force. Its resonance within segments of the Barelvi community, particularly around issues of blasphemy and perceived socio-religious marginalisation, allowed the movement to evolve beyond any initial political engineering.
Repeated negotiations with the group, including the lifting of the previous ban in 2021, the release of detained leaders and the further tightening of blasphemy laws have sent a clear, detrimental message: mass religious mobilisation can successfully extract concessions from the state.
The latest ban, recommended by the Punjab government amid fresh unrest, appears to signal a potentially tougher stance, though the state’s sincerity remains debatable. 
The October operation in Murdike, near Lahore, involving thousands of law enforcement personnel, had dispersed the TLP supporters planning to march towards Islamabad. Punjab police registered 75 cases, including terrorism and murder charges, against TLP leaders and workers. The undisclosed whereabouts of key figures, brothers Saad Rizvi and Anas Rizvi, have deepened speculation and internal anxiety.
Since then, most TLP candidates from Punjab who contested the 2024 elections have started distancing themselves from the party, stating that “violence and mob action cannot bring meaningful change by attacking the state.“
Before the ban, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met senior Barelvi scholars in Karachi, including Mufti Muneebur Rehman, who had earlier mediated between the government and TLP, assuring them the crackdown targeted the TLP’s network, not the broader Barelvi community. The TLP claims over 300 of their mosques and seminaries have been sealed. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz later confirmed their transfer to Mufti Muneebur Rehman. 
However, analysts opine that the Punjab government’s attempt to counter the TLP through engagement with traditional, moderate Barelvi clerical elite, which Rizvi frequently targeted, may have a limited impact. As scholar Umair Rasheed remarks, the state is once again resorting to the flawed logic of “Good Barelvis, Bad Barelvis”, an echo of earlier strategies of distinguishing between “Good Taliban and Bad Taliban.”
FUTURE SCENARIO
The TLP’s future is acutely uncertain, hanging on the state’s political resolve, the judiciary’s response and the party’s enduring populist appeal. The current official strategy, an immediate ban followed by legal proceedings for dissolution, signals a more assertive posture. 
As one Islamabad-based security official tells me, “The state has decided that it has had enough. Given rising regional tensions and the surge in terrorism across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, it cannot afford internal instability triggered by the TLP’s street agitations.”
Officials signal an intention to dissolve the TLP as a registered political party, though legally establishing its terrorist credentials remains challenging. Among more than 80 proscribed groups, the TLP stands out for its deep grassroots networks, rapid mobilisation capacity and emotive religious appeal, making it far harder to suppress through conventional law-enforcement measures.
The party’s trajectory will also depend on its leadership. The death of Khadim Hussain Rizvi was expected to fracture the party, but his son Saad Rizvi has maintained its coherence and its capacity to bring cities to a standstill. 
If political stability is maintained and the TLP is unable to trigger new crises, its influence may gradually decline ahead of the next election cycle. Yet, the ideology it embodies, combining religious populism, vigilantism and emotionally charged rhetoric, has already permeated Pakistan’s socio-political mainstream.
According to Weinstein, “TLP is the classic Pakistani dilemma — an extremist movement born from within society, tolerated and, at times, weaponised, until it became a menace. But its followers are still your neighbours, and the blasphemy issue isn’t going anywhere.”

It largely expands on the thinking behind the 26th Amendment and plugs whatever loopholes that exercise left to ensure that the days of ‘judicial activism’ that some saw as politically motivated are long gone. The judiciary will find itself much more tightly corralled.
The irony won’t be lost on those who desired and campaigned for judicial independence that this tighter corralling of the judiciary will be accomplished with the help of some of the honourable members of the institution itself such as through a mechanism to transfer judges of the high courts. (I already have a list emerging in my mind, for example, of Islamabad High Court judges heading to far less salubrious and picturesque and definitely more turbulent and volatile centres than the federal capital).
The unity of the days of former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry is no more than a dot disappearing in the rear-view mirror, a distant memory. When we are lamenting the clipping of the judiciary’s wings it would be in bad taste to mention the excesses of the Chaudhry era. But how can one forget those?

The share of power and resources for the lead partner has been sought and is likely to be granted.

For it was those excesses that culminated in the unholy alliance between the judiciary and the establishment that marked the era of chief justice Saqib Nisar who presided over the first major rollback of democracy (in 2016) since its revival after the 2008 elections and triggered the downslide that continues to this day. Elements of the political class have been willing collaborators.
Those with far more legal competence and nous than I will ever have are commenting on this aspect of the amendment so I can move on to other areas such as the amendment governing Article 243 which deals with military appointments.
 
 

One of the changes to 243 will abolish the position of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee with the retirement of the incumbent Gen Sahir Shamshad this month. At which time the incumbent army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir will take over the newly minted dual role of the Chief of Army Staff-Chief of Defence Forces. The amendment states that the title of the field marshal will be for life. As far as my knowledge is concerned the title is always for life. So this part of the amendment is merely a reiteration. Also, a Commander of the National Strategic Command will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the COAS-CDF.
While it has not been spelt out, it is likely that the position will be a four-star general so the senior-most serving three stars will have something to aspire for, given the five-year tenure of their boss that is extendable for further period(s).
In essence, all of this represents the post-facto recognition and cementing of the status quo. The proponents of this move cite this May’s ‘victory in the war with India’ as the rationale or justification behind the changes to Article 243 as they reflect on the operational ‘lessons’ learnt about the demands of this new era of warfare.
Against this backdrop and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s insistence that his country’s Operation Sindoor was ‘on pause’ and not ended, there was considerable speculation about a 10 per cent cut in the provincial share of the federal divisible pool as enshrined in the National Finance Commission Award (NFC) to fund additional defence needs.
It was also suggested that the ministries of education and population welfare and planning that devolved to the provinces via the 18th Amendment in 2010 would revert to the centre along with their sizeable, donor-supplemented, budgets. On the reversion of these two ministries to the centre and the removal of the protection to the provincial share in the NFC, it seems, the PPP dug in its heels and, according to Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the PML-N agreed to exclude matters ‘for now’ from the amendment on which consensus was not reached.
While the PPP managed to block a constitutional (institutionalised) cut to its share, it would not be surprising if the extra Rs500 billion needed for defence needs is offered up voluntarily by the provinces including Sindh and Balochistan (where too the PPP claims it leads the provincial government) with dangers looming large on the eastern as well as the western fronts.
It would be difficult to describe the KP government’s posture under its belligerent new chief minister. If Sindh and Balochistan were to offer up their share, Punjab would follow suit, given that the PML-N has the government there.
Yes, democrats and those who believe in the independence of the judiciary will be crestfallen when this amendment is passed by parliament (and passed it will be, rest assured) but all it does is to once again underline the reality: power flows through the barrel of a gun.
In the past, takeovers have happened a few years (1977) or a few months (1999) after military debacles major or minor. Now, after a Trump-rubber-stamped win, an institutionalised increase in the share of power and resources for the lead partner of the hybrid set-up (this last a term used by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif) has been sought and is likely to be granted.
This is the reality. Notwithstanding the token provincial resistance. And sadly, for some of us this is how it will remain for the foreseeable future: save for a dramatic turn of events, that, for now at least, is improbable and not even a distant possibility.

Officials said that the number of violent incidents against polio teams had decreased in the current year due to foolproof security measures, as four policemen and one civilian were killed and three police officials suffered injuries. Also, 17 health workers were kidnapped during house-to-house vaccination campaigns.
 
 

Official data shows that a total of 96 people have been killed by alleged terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 2012 and they included 61 policemen, 27 health workers and five civilians. Also, 170 people, including 124 policemen, 28 health workers and 21 civilians, were injured in attacks on polio teams.
During this period, 32 health workers, three civilians and one policeman were kidnapped during vaccination campaigns.

KP records better vaccination coverage

Of the people who were subjected to violence in the shape of death, injuries and kidnapping, 283 were men and 18 women, according to an official report.
However, the current year has proved to be relatively peaceful, enabling health workers to bring down the number of children who missed polio drops earlier either due to vaccination refusal by their parents or for being accessible to vaccinators in security-compromised areas.
Officials said that it was a welcome sign for the polio programme as health workers would be able to reach most children targeted in polio drives.
They said the continued violence against polio teams had also caused scare among health workers, so the number of unvaccinated children continued to rise.
The officials, however, said that in the current year, vaccinators were covering more children than those vaccinated in previous years due to enhanced supervision and surveillance both from the government and Emergency Operations Centre for Polio.
They said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had recorded 18 polio cases, most in the countrywide tally of 29, due to strong surveillance, which led to the collection of “most samples from suspected children.”
The officials said Sindh had recorded nine polio cases, while one case each was reported in Punjab and GB.
A recent report by the Independent Monitoring Board, which works on behalf of international donor agencies, said that Pakistan faced continued transmission in core reservoirs, particularly southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, alongside ongoing operational challenges that include missed children, security constraints and the urgent need for strengthened essential immunisation systems.
According to an IMB report released in September, security assessments have revealed a more nuanced picture than is often portrayed.
Of Pakistan’s 45.4 million target children, only 1.2 million face direct security constraints, primarily those in southern parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The report, titled “The Glass Mountain,” said that escalating circulation in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with more than 100,000 unreached children represented the most immediate threat to interruption of transmission.
It noted that there were persistent access constraints and accumulated vulnerability, while many children missed vaccination in rounds after rounds, so intensive new approaches were required.
The polio programme has divided south Khyber Pakhtunkhwa into three categories, including green areas (71 per cent of the population, 159 union councils) with good access but quality challenges; community-led vaccination initiative areas (20 per cent of the population, 80 union councils) utilising community-led approaches; and black areas (nine per cent of the population, 26 union councils) requiring intensive engagement to achieve house-to-house access.
Officials said that new strategies and approaches were paying off with the unprecedented support of the government and security forces.
They said the innovative strategies had strengthened security due to which the vaccinators felt secure and took part in the campaign fearlessly.
The officials also said that recently, health secretary Shahidullah Khan transferred three district health officers and one district coordinator for showing laxity in polio drives.
They said that chief secretary Shahab Ali Shah, as the chairman of the provincial task force on polio, was likely to take action against the deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners for similar reasons.

Yet, for Pakistan, the supposed front-line state in that long global campaign, the war never truly ended but rather got worse. Ironically, nations once branded as epicentres of terrorism, Iraq, Syria, and even Afghanistan now appear relatively more stable. One must ask why Pakistan remains suspended in perpetual insecurity, despite once being the front-line state in the war against terrorism.
The state has found many excuses to explain terrorism within its borders, blaming Afgh­anistan, global jihadist networks, local militant groups and religious extremism. Yet it rarely reflects on the policies it crafted to remain relevant in the region’s strategic game. These policies were marred by miscalculations regarding the strengths and weaknesses of militant groups, and more critically, by persistent policy failures. Successive governments and security institutions have refused to admit these mistakes, hold anyone accountable, or meaningfully reform the frameworks that consistently failed to deliver.
The irony lies in the fact that Pakistan’s security apparatus continued to implement the very approaches that had proven ineffective. Instead of acknowledging their flaws, it became defensive and intolerant of criticism, silencing legitimate forums and institutions that could have questioned these policy failures and ensured even minimal transparency in decision-making.
Apparently, the state institutions have decided to address the problems of terrorism and extremism decisively. This renewed resolve is reflected both in Pakistan’s posture towards Afghanistan and in how the state has dealt with the extremist group TLP in Punjab. However, once again, these policies are being implemented with full impunity, and it remains unclear who’ll be held accountable if they fail to deliver the desired outcomes.

State institutions must not lose their composure in their display of muscle.

In recent times, civilian governments have borne the burden of the strategic blunders made by state institutions. But under the current hybrid system, there is little room left to shift the entire responsibility onto civilian shoulders. The civilian leadership today appears to be in complete synchronisation with the military establishment in its approach to security, the economy and politics.
The synchronisation has created relative political stability in the country, but it is unable to address the security challenges that Pakistan is facing. What happened in Doha and Istanbul during the dialogue between Afghanistan and Pakistan showed that Pakistan, which had facilitated the Doha dialogue between the Taliban and the US, was now itself in talks, enabled by Turkiye and Qatar, with the Taliban regime. And in these talks, the bone of contention remained the terrorist groups TTP and the Ittihadul Mujahideen led by Gul Bahadur, and terrorist activities inside Pakistan.
Both these terrorist groups were close aides of the Taliban in their fight against Nato forces, and clearly, Gul Bahadur had been Pakistan’s proxy to support the Taliban insurgency. The TTP, which was equally lethal in Afghanistan and Pakistan, was tolerated for several years in North Waziristan until Operation Zarb-i-Azb was launched. Once again, the group was engaged in talks.
It was a deliberate policy to bring the Taliban into power in the hope that they would strengthen the state’s strategic interests on the western borders. The price was so high that it bled Pakistan and caused disharmony inside it. The approach to supporting the Taliban had only one objective — to bring them to power; the state institutions did not have any plans once they came to power.
The Haqqanis, considered close to the state, have turned against Pakistan — something that should have been a strategic shock, but was absorbed silently. Neither the state institutions nor the intelligentsia in Pakistan questioned why the Haqqanis wanted to reverse Fata’s status and convert the area once again into tribal territory, where they could operate freely, sustain their political economy, and continue spreading radicalism in Pakistan. The TTP and Gul Bahadur are merely the Haqqanis’ stooges in this plan.
 
 

The irony lies in Pakistani officials signalling the possibility of regime change in Afghanistan if the Taliban do not comply with their expectations, an approach that violates diplomatic norms. Yet analysts are raising a valid question: if the state were to attempt regime change in Afghanistan, who would be its closest ally? Who else, if not the Haqqanis?
This is not just a dichotomy in the state’s approach; it reflects a mindset rooted in the concept of a ‘hard state’, where the application of hard power often clouds the distinction between friends and foes. The state appears to be focused solely on achieving its set objectives, regardless of the long-term consequences.
One hopes that whatever policy the state has crafted to deal with terrorism and extremism, it will deliver tangible results and allow Pakistan to finally declare victory over this decades-old scourge. However, state institutions must not lose their composure in their display of muscle. A ‘hard state’ should not mean a loss of reason; it must evolve long-term policies to address its challenges.
Anatol Lieven’s central argument in Pakistan: A Hard Country is that Pakistan is not a ‘failed state’; rather it has a weak state apparatus that governs a socially resilient society. The idea derived from his analysis is that a muscular state could strengthen itself through firmness and control. However, as seasoned former diplomat Ashraf Jehangir Qazi recently reminded us, quoting Swedish economist and sociologist Gunnar Myrdal, Pakistan today is “characterised by weak governance, a lack of effective law enforcement, and a general societal and political indiscipline” — a reflection of Pakistan’s current political condition. As he wrote in these pages: “Reliance on the use of force to resolve complex political challenges is not an indication of a strong or hard state.”

It is materialising and has triggered speculation about how this regime expects to consolidate its power. It is clear why it was kept under wraps: the proposed legislation will hollow out the Supreme Court and supplant it with a supra-court with all powers to overrule the former’s authority. The other subjects it touches on are the number of ministers and advisers, as well as the leadership of the armed forces.
It would seem as if the potential rollback of the 18th Amendment and significant changes to be made to the National Finance Commission Award were but a smokescreen. There is no mention of either of the subjects in the legislation presented before the Senate. Did the government use a bait-and-switch to make its proposals more digestible? We must wait to see how they are received.
Meanwhile, one cannot help but comment on the grand ambitions of the proposed amendment. The Supreme Court, once the last resort on all questions of law and legality, will be superseded by the federal constitutional court, which will quite literally be handpicked by the ruling regime. In theory, under the amendment, the ruling parties could stack the entire bench of this new, most powerful court in the country.
 
 

Could such a bench ever be expected to rule impartially on the constitutionality of the government’s actions? It would seem naïve to expect it to do so. How supporters of the amendment will explain this blatant subversion of judicial independence remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is to be reduced to a final court for routine civil and criminal appeals only. This demotion will complete the apex court’s descent to irrelevance, triggered by its failure to enforce its writ in the ‘90-days elections’ case. The humiliation will be complete.
One also wonders about the wisdom behind granting five-star ranks immunity from all prosecution for life. It is a rather surprising concession, given that past governments of both the PML-N and PPP were persecuted and overthrown by military strongmen. Those same military rulers also committed gross excesses against ordinary citizens and resorted to subjugating civil rights wholesale whenever the public’s will clashed with their personal interests. Unfortunately, they never faced justice for their crimes.
 
 

Given such precedents, would the promise of near-blanket, lifetime immunity not give future despots more incentive to commit violations of oath and law with impunity? The government should perhaps have considered formally recognising the titles of five-star-ranked personnel only and conferring all the prestige it wished upon them. A lifetime of immunity is a rather odd honour to bestow on anybody.
Attention now turns to the debate. The government must not rush matters and allow all to share their thoughts freely.

Some passengers were coming home for the weekend, some were coming for cricket.
Saturday’s third One-day International betw­e­­en Pakis­tan and South Africa has been set up perfectly; the series, marking the return of international cricket to the city after 17 long years, tied at 1-1 ahead of the final fixture.
 
 

“I work in Islamabad and this is my hometown but I’ve come here specially for the match,” said one passenger, scurrying for his luggage in the cargo hold of one of the executive buses that had made a stop in Faisalabad on its way to Sahiwal. “I hope it’s a great game and Pakistan win tomorrow.”
That sense of anticipation or the feeling of excitement wasn’t shared by everyone, though.
“Cricket has returned, yes, but it’s brought a lot of complications with it,” Abdul Rehman, a driver from a ride-hailing app, told Dawn, sharing the sentiment of many across Pakistan. “The road closures for teams travelling to and from the Iqbal Stadium are too much … it’s impossible to go to areas close to it.”
A hazy, cool night had given way to a lazy, sun-kissed morning and the afternoon, by which the crowd had started to fill in at the venue. The return of international cricket hasn’t only seen cricket enthusiasts from the city be entertained, but fans from districts and tehsils in the Faisalabad division have also come over.
“Fans have poured in from tehsils in Chiniot, Jhang and Toba Tek Singh districts as well as adjoining divisions like Sargodha and Mianwali,” local television journalist Arsalan Hussain Durrani told Dawn.
“The appetite for cricket here is huge, crowds filled up the venue for the National T20 Cup in March so imagine how long they’ve been waiting for international cricket to come here even though the stadium is very basic, very much as it is since it was inaugurated in 1968.”
The entrance to the stadium is through a large red brick gate but the venue itself is a throwback to the past. Just two stands, on either side of the pavilion, have seats. The rest of the seating is on steps or ‘tharray’ in the local dialect.
The Iqbal Stadium is under the district administration, with the Pakistan Sports Board having been its caretaker for a few years. Two amusement parks are on either side of the venue. The Pakistan Cricket Board rents it, with the crowd turnout at the Champions Cup in September last year having convinced PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi that international cricket should finally return.
“Not only is it good for the fans in the city and the adjoining districts but the return of cricket will also see more business come to Faisalabad, which is the textile hub of the country,” Umer Rafique, the owner of Celebrity Cricket League which has held exhibition cricket matches across the country, told Dawn.
“The fact that cricket sees packed crowds in Faisalabad is a puller for corporates, attracting greater sponsorship opportunities due to the eyeballs here,” added the Faisalabad native. “And while Sialkot remains the country’s sports good hub, cricket’s return will help Faisalabad’s textile industry as well, shining light on the exceptional sports kit-making here.”
In the interim, though, it is the cricket’s enthusiasts in the region that are making the most of the opportunity that has presented itself.
A group of teenaged boys, led by Sumair and Abdullah, arrived at the Iqbal Stadium in t-shirts printed with pictures of former Pakistan middle-order batter Umar Akmal accompanied with messages of ‘Miss You’. “We haven’t found anyone like him in the middle order since he’s been cast away,” quipped Abdullah in front of a loud group.
A teenaged girl and her younger brother, coming to the ground with their father, expressed her excitement, stating it was going to be her first time watching an international cricket match. Alongside them was Mohammad Yasin, ‘Junior Chacha Cricket’, who arrived decked in a bright green robe of Pakistan colours.
“I go wherever Pakistan are playing and it’s wonderful to see them in action here in Faisalabad,” Yasin, who has travelled for the series from Lahore, told Dawn.
The start of the match, the toss and South African skipper Matthew Breetzke’s decision to bat first, was greeted by loud roars. There ‘oohs’ and ‘ahs’ as an edge off Lhuan-dre Pretorius flew for a boundary off Haris Rauf. Cheers of “Fauji” accompanied Fakhar Zaman as he came towards the boundary to field, a reference to him being an officer of the Pakistan Navy.
The biggest cheers, though, came when Salman Ali Agha had Pretorius caught at long-off by Babar Azam, whom the majority of the crowd had come to see. Babar’s highest first-class score of 266 came at the Iqbal Stadium in 2014, when he was a 20-year-old. Three years prior to that, he’d been part of Pakistan ‘A’ side that beat Afghanistan in an unofficial one-dayer at the venue.
Faisalabad’s fixation with the batting superstar was evident on Saturday and the fans are hoping to see more of Babar and the national team in the times to come after Pakistan sealed a convincing victory to clinch the series 2-1.
“I’ve come here to see Babar and it’s an opportunity I’ve waited for a long time,” Shakeel Awan, who had travelled for the match from Toba Tek Singh — two hours away from Faisalabad, told Dawn. “I hope this series is the start of more to come.”

• US coordinates Gaza aid flow but Israel maintains oversight, officials say
JERUSALEM: Israeli forces continued to wage deadly assaults across the Palestinian territories and southern Lebanon on Saturday, in a series of air and artillery attacks that violated ceasefire agreements on both fronts.
In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops shot dead two 16-year-old boys, adding to the mounting number of Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces.
The Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah identified the victims as Mohammed Abdullah Moham­med Ateem and Muhammad Rashad Fadl Qasim, both from the village of Judeira. The ministry said Israeli forces were withholding the boys’ bodies.
The Israeli military acknowledged the killings, referring to the teenagers as individuals it had “eliminated” — a term frequently employed by Israeli authorities to obscure civilian deaths and dehumanise Palestinians.
At the same time, in the besieged Strip, Israeli gunfire killed one Palestinian and wounded another near the Bureij refugee camp.
A separate attack in western Khan Younis left another Pales­tinian wounded, medics reported.
Three killed in Lebanon
In a separate escalation, Israeli strikes on Lebanon killed three people and wounded several others on Saturday.
Lebanon’s National News Agency said two brothers from the town of Shebaa were burned alive when an Israeli missile hit their SUV. A separate strike in Baraashit killed one person and wounded four. Another Israeli strike on Saturday morning on a car near a hospital in the southern city of Bint Jbeil wounded seven people, according to the ministry.
The latest attacks came as the European Union voiced concern. “Focus by all parties must be on preserving the ceasefire and the progress achieved so far.”
Body exchange
Simultaneously, under the cea­­sefire’s prisoner exchange plan, for every one dead Israeli prisoners returned, the bodies of 15 slain Palestinians are handed back by Israel.
On Saturday, Israel identified the latest prisoner remains sent back from Gaza as those of Lior Rudaeff. Meanwhile, the Nasser Medical Centre in Khan Younis reported receiving the bodies of 15 Pales­tinians.
US, Israel coordinate aid
Meanwhile, according to the Washington Post, US forces are now involved in coordinating aid through the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that will replace Israel in overseeing aid into Gaza. It cited a US official and people familiar with the matter as saying Israel was part of the process but that CMCC would decide what aid enters Gaza and how.
 
 

However, an Israeli security official confirmed that Israel remains part of the supervision and monitoring process, with decisions made jointly. This suggests little change to the stifling Israeli control over what aid enters Gaza.

Trump had announced in September that Vice President JD Vance would travel to the meeting later this month instead of him, but has now said that US representatives will skip it entirely.
“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa,” Trump said on his Truth Social network. “No US Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue.”
Trump said that Afrikaners — descendants of the first European settlers of South Africa — “are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated”. He added that he looked forward to hosting the 2026 G20 summit in the US — which the billionaire US president will controversially hold at his own golf resort in Miami, Florida.

South Africa calls Trump’s decision ‘regrettable’, pledges smooth summit

The South African foreign ministry cal­led Trump’s comments “regrettable” and said it was looking forward to hosting a “successful” summit set for November 22-23.
“The characterisation of Afrikaners as an exclusively white group is ahistorical. Furthermore, the claim that this community faces persecution is not substantiated by fact,” it said in a statement.
Pretoria chose “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability” as the theme for its G20 presidency but has faced some resistance, including from Washington.
“South Africa’s focus remains on its positive global contributions,” the foreign ministry said.
“Drawing on our own journey from racial and ethnic division to democracy, our nation is uniquely positioned to champion within the G20 a future of genuine solidarity.”
Trump has singled out South Africa for harsh treatment on a number of issues since he returned to the White House in January, most notably on his false claims of a “white genocide” in the country.
He ambushed South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval office earlier this year, playing a video in which he alleged a campaign against white farmers by the post-apartheid government.
South Africa’s government denies any such policy. Trump’s administration announced plans last week to drastically cut back the number of refugees to be accepted annually by the United States to a record low of 7,500 — and give priority to white South Africans.

According to the 2025 Review of Climate Ambition in Asia and the Pacific, released by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP), Pakistan needs significant investment and coordination to upgrade and expand its grid network to integrate large-scale renewable energy while maintaining system stability.
The report says that a successful phase-down of coal in Pakistan will require a comprehensive energy transition plan with clear targets, strong policies and engagement of all stakeholders. The transition, it adds, must be “just” to avoid disproportionate impacts on workers, businesses and households.
Renewable edge over coal
The UN report highlights that solar and wind energy are now cost-competitive with coal, giving Pakistan an opportunity to accelerate its shift towards cleaner energy. Data from the SDG-7 Roadmap for Pakistan show that the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for solar and wind generation is significantly lower than that of coal-based power.

Solar and wind can cut power costs, but weak infrastructure may slow carbon-free transition

The energy landscape, the report notes, is evolving as global pressure to cut emissions increases. However, Pakistan’s transition will depend on long-term policy stability, financial support and institutional reforms that encourage private investment in renewables.
Regional context
The report places Pakistan’s situation within a broader Asia-Pacific context, describing the region as being at a “critical juncture” amid accelerating economic growth and intensifying climate pressures. Economic activity in the region expanded 4.6pc in 2024, contributing 60pc of global GDP growth over the past decade. Yet, rising debt, climate change and biodiversity loss continue to expose countries to mounting risks.
Despite these challenges, the Asia-Pacific has maintained its position as a global leader in renewable energy, accounting for 70pc of new capacity additions in 2024. Governments are increasingly adopting net-zero targets, revising climate policies and integrating them into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to meet emission-reduction goals.
Policy and carbon pricing reforms
To translate these commitments into action, countries are reinforcing their legal and regulatory frameworks to attract investment in clean energy. The report says private companies also have a crucial role in implementing deep decarbonisation strategies across their operations and supply chains.
The region remains heavily reliant on coal, producing 84pc of the world’s coal-fired power in 2024 and consuming 81.7pc of global coal output in 2023. The UN stresses that phasing down coal will require strong political commitment, removal of fossil fuel subsidies and coordinated policy frameworks to support renewable growth and energy efficiency.

The crackdown, which spanned Lahore and other districts over the last 24 hours, led to the arrest of the violators and resulted in fines totaling over Rs1.067 million imposed on 491 people. An additional 38 individuals were issued warnings for environmental violations.
 
 

According to the breakdown provided by the spokesperson, the operations targe­ted key sources of pollution. A total of 209 smoke-emitting vehicles were cited, alon­gside 101 incidents of crop residue burning and 7 violations related to brick kilns.
This recent enforcement action is part of a larger, year-long initiative.
The spokesperson revealed that since the beginning of the current year, the police have registered a significant 2,275 cases and arrested 2,027 violators. The financial penalties have been substantial, with fines exceeding Rs227.1m imposed on 87,780 individuals, while 11,268 others have received warnings.
 
 

The annual data highlights the scale of the problem, with 52,872 violations for smoke-emitting vehicles, 3,365 for brick kilns, 1,725 related to industrial activities, and 1,166 cases of crop residue burning.
IG police Dr Usman Anwar has directed officers to further accelerate the anti-smog crackdown.
In his directives, the IG emphasised a zero-tolerance policy, ordering strict and immediate action against all those found violating the standard operating procedures (SOPs) designed to combat smog. The operations are to be intensified on highways, in industrial areas, on agricultural lands, and at other key locations contributing to poor air quality.

However, the Ministry of Finance has asked the Ministry of Industries and Production to first seek the IMF’s clearance for the incentives proposed under the new policy.
Officials said a meeting between IMF representatives and a team led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan is expected later this month to discuss the annual fiscal cost of the incentives planned for various sectors.
The policy targets $60 billion in exports by 2030, GDP growth of 6pc and manufacturing growth of 8pc annually by the end of the decade. It aims to provide a roadmap for industrial competitiveness, job creation and export expansion.
Key constraints
The NIP identifies a range of structural and policy-related challenges impeding industrial growth. These include macroeconomic instability, policy uncertainty, costly industrial land, excessive regulation, unreliable and expensive power supply, and limited access to long-term credit.

NIP targets $60bn exports by 2030; identifies high costs, weak regulation and uneven taxation as key hurdles

The ministry said local industries face high borrowing costs and limited access to capital markets. Weak investor protection and an inadequate insolvency framework have further discouraged lending, leaving banks with few tools to restructure loans.
The policy notes that uneven taxation across sectors discourages industrial investment. While manufacturing bears a heavier tax burden, sectors such as real estate, construction, wholesale and retail remain undertaxed, reducing returns on industrial ventures.
Manufacturing firms also face foreign exchange constraints, with frequent delays in accessing dollars for importing raw materials. In some cases, foreign investors struggle to repatriate profits, deterring foreign direct investment.
The NIP highlights weak standards compliance, which hampers exports, and calls for reforms to improve product quality and certification systems. It also stresses the need for inclusive industrialisation, noting that women remain largely excluded from industrial entrepreneurship and management.
 
 

“Women remain at the periphery and suffer from a sense of not belonging. This needs to change, and more women industrialists must be promoted,” the document states.
The policy proposes a predictable and transparent taxation regime consistent with IMF-backed reforms. It recommends widening the tax net and ensuring that all sectors contribute proportionately to their share of value-added in GDP.
The NIP also calls for the review and simplification of corporate income tax (CIT), currently set at 29pc, higher than the regional average of 26pc, which affects export competitiveness. The super tax, levied in addition to the CIT, should also be reassessed to ease the burden on industries, the document says.
Structural measures
To support struggling firms, the policy proposes setting up a National Industrial Revival Commission (NIRC) to oversee company rehabilitation and coordinate regulatory support.
It further calls for strengthening intellectual property rights (IPR) through accession to the Patent Cooperation Treaty and enhancing the enforcement capacity of the Intellectual Property Organisation of Pakistan (IPO) to counter counterfeiting and piracy.
Reducing port charges, particularly those levied by the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) and Port Qasim Authority (PQA) — among the highest in the world — is also recommended to improve export competitiveness.
Officials said the policy, once approved, will serve as a framework for industrial transformation through improved governance, fiscal discipline and an enabling environment for private investment. However, its implementation will depend on IMF endorsement of the incentive package, given Pakistan’s commitments under the ongoing economic stabilisation programme.

Yet, the city often attracts ill-informed and reactive commentary, particularly from those unfamiliar with its unique historical, sociological and geographical underpinnings.
The city’s complexity is often oversimplified into political statements — as if mere political allegiance dictates whether one likes or dislikes it. This tendency even affects some Karachiites, whose view of the city fluctuates between ‘doing well’ and ‘hell’ based on which party holds power. To truly understand Karachi, one must look beyond politics, to its identity as a thriving port city.
Karachi’s coastal location has endowed it with a ‘maritime mindset’ — a characteristic shared by port cities globally. A 2021 study in the European Journal of Creative Practices in Cities and Landscapes notes that port cities have historically been “nodes for global flows of goods, people and ideas”, fostering an environment of diversity and tolerance. 
Residents in port cities are often more accustomed to change and open to new ideas than those in landlocked areas. The sea itself is embedded in the collective consciousness, capable of evoking awe and serving as a backdrop for reflection. However, for a majority of present-day Karachiites, this consciousness is relatively recent.

Karachi’s maritime soul — once buried under waves of migration from landlocked regions — is now re-emerging and redefining

Before 1947, the majority of Karachi’s inhabitants — mostly Sindhi-, Balochi- and Gujarati-speaking Muslims, Hindus and Zoroastrians — were strictly tied to the port and the sea. But the city’s demography and culture underwent a seismic shift post-Partition. Millions of Urdu-speaking Muslims (Mohajirs) began arriving from landlocked regions of India, quickly becoming the majority. 
This migration initially brought a cultural struggle against the city’s inherent maritime identity. For example, the local seafood culture almost vanished, replaced by the ‘Mughal dishes’ of the newcomers. Early Urdu cinema established in Karachi rarely featured the sea, instead replicating the urban imaginations rooted in the landlocked environs that the Mohajirs had left behind. The sea only began to appear in films from the late 1960s, mostly as a ‘picnic spot.’ The Mohajir community took decades to develop a maritime mindset.
As Karachi rapidly industrialised, further landlocked communities arrived. Pakhtuns from present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa became the primary labour force, building factories and homes, and later dominated transport (buses, rickshaws and taxis). Punjabis migrated here, continuing the British-era practice of joining the city’s police force. Sindhis from so-called ‘interior Sindh’ also began a gradual move to the metropolis. And in the 1980s, Afghans from landlocked Afghanistan began to settle in the city as well.
As landlocked communities came to form the majority, Karachi’s maritime mindset began to disintegrate. The city became home to ethnic ghettoisation and conflict. Settlers often compared it unfavourably to their places of origin, using Karachi as a temporary abode rather than a home to be owned. This disconnect contributed to political volatility.



 
The Mohajir community, represented by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) after 1985, often lamented this fractured identity. However, as the Mohajir majority began to shrink and other groups opted for different political parties, especially the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), many Mohajirs began to revert to their earlier landlocked disposition.
But despite the struggles, the city’s inherent maritime mindset has returned, driven not by a single group, but by the undeniable economic, social and cultural impact of the sea. 
John M. Eger, Emeritus Professor of Public Policy at San Diego State University, highlights that “port cities are more tolerant, mostly because ports tend to attract people with fewer prejudices than the inner cities.” Tolerance becomes a prerequisite for survival in such a fluid environment.
Interestingly, it has been the city’s non-Mohajir communities that have largely led the way in restoring Karachi’s original maritime identity. Regardless of ethnic group or class, Krachiites now increasingly see the sea as something that defines them, and not as something that looked alien and even scary to their elders, who arrived here from ethnically homogeneous, landlocked regions. 
And for those who visit Karachi but don’t like it, I’d suggest they visit one of its many magnificent beaches, sit in front of the sea and reflect. One has to mould oneself according to the nature of the city because no city in the world will mould itself for you. This is especially true of folk coming from landlocked regions to port cities. Port cities don’t give a hoot what you think of them. They’re too busy and fluid, making a country’s economy run. And yours too. 
Landlocked shouldn’t mean one becomes brain-locked. Karachi is an open city like no other in the country. It can’t be locked inside a particular view of a ‘likeable city.’ It is a city inside which are many cities run by multiple departments. This confuses its many landlocked guests. There are many Karachis but each is defined by one sea. Visit one of its beaches on a Sunday and you shall understand.

Maulana Fazlur Rehman will be accompanied by Maulana Rashid Soomro, Mufti Abrar Ahmed and others.
Earlier today, after getting approval from the federal cabinet, the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
However, during the session of the standing committees, two JUI-F members, Aliya Kamran and Senator Kamran Murtaza, boycotted the meeting and said the proposed draft included amendments that were discarded in the 26th Amendment bill.
Yesterday, Maulana Fazlur Rehman said that his party would oppose any proposed amendment that seeks to reduce the powers granted to the provinces under the 18th Amendment.
“The provinces have a constitutional right to an increased NFC (National Finance Commission) award, not a reduced one,” he had stated, warning that if provincial rights were stripped, the JUI-F would “strongly oppose it.”
The JUI-F chief’s statement came after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held consultations with ruling allies to secure support for the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad a day earlier, Fazl said his party had agreed on certain points in principle, but would only comment further once a draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment was presented.
Commenting on proposed changes to Article 243, he said the matter must be viewed in two ways: “If it is used to affect democracy, the Constitution or politics, we will not accept it. But if it is purely administrative, we will review it first and then decide.”
The PPP, a major ally of the ruling PML-N-led government, on Thursday also drew a red line against any change to the provinces’ share under the NFC while indicating conditional support for limited amendments to Article 243 governing federal control of the armed forces.</p><small>2025-11-08 19:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632704-opposition-alliance-announces-nationwide-protest-movement-against-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance announces nationwide protest movement against 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

Normally, home supporters would’ve quietened at seeing Fakhar Zaman cleaned up early on in a small chase – potentially a harbinger of things to come; perhaps an all too familiar collapse in the offing.
But here on Saturday night, there were loud roars with chants of “Babar” echoing across the venue with Pakistan’s batting superstar set to come next. Babar didn’t disappoint, dispatching the South African bowlers with his trademark elan, and alongside Saim Ayub set Pakistan on their way to a rousing seven-wicket victory that sealed the three-match One-day International series 2-1 in their favour.
The venue had gone silent after Babar’s departure in the 11th over, disappointment filling the air that they weren’t able to see more of him when he was looking close to his best, run out for 27 after stroking five crisp fours.
But they soon found their voice as Saim tore into the South African attack with a 70-ball 77 that featured 11 fours and a six and although he fell with Pakistan nearing victory, Mohammad Rizwan (32 not out) took them through with Salman Ali Agha hitting the winning boundary.
The foundation for Pakistan’s victory, under new skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi for this series, had been laid by the spinners as the visitors were bundled out for 143 in 37.5 overs. South Africa captain Matthew Breetzke had elected to bat and his side were coasting smoothly with openers Quinton de Kock (53) and Lhuan-dre Pretorius (39) well set until their lineup collapsed in the face of spin.
Salman (2-18) provided the first two wickets before Mohammad Nawaz (2-31) followed with the big dismissal of De Kock until Abrar Ahmed (4-27) ran through South Africa’s spine and Pakistan eventually secured their first-ever ODI series triumph at home against their opponents.
“The credit goes to the players,” reflected Shaheen at the post-match ceremony. “We didn’t get much help in the first five or six overs but when the spinners came in, they made it really tough for them.”
On a sun-kissed afternoon, the 72-run opening stand between Pretorius and De Kock ended after the former, who had hit four fours and a six, was caught at long-off by Babar and Salman struck again four overs later when Tony de Zorzi chipped him to the cover fielder.
De Kock, whose splendid century in the second game had helped South Africa level the series, completed his half century off 68 deliveries with his sixth four, a sweep of Nawaz, only to be trapped lbw by the spinner two deliveries later. The left-hander also hit a six.
South Africa then slipped from 106-2 to 109-4 with player-of-the-match Abrar cleaning up debutant Rubin Hermann on the first ball of the 26th over. Bails were flying once again, twice off two balls, two overs later as Abrar worked his magic. First Donovan Ferreira was bowled round his legs before a googly that stayed low knocked back Corbin Bosch’s off-stump.
Pakistan had South Africa on the ropes with Breetzke (16) running out of partners quick and fast as Nawaz had Bjorn Fortuin lbw, and the writing was on the wall for the Proteas when their skipper was caught behind off Abrar, who recorded his career-best ODI figures, as they slipped to 130-8.
Pakistan captain Shaheen (2-18) then cleaned up the tail with two wickets in two balls – both of them bowled, including the wicket of Nqabayomzi Peter who made a defiant 16.
“Batting conditions were pretty tough and we didn’t get enough runs and they batted freely because of that,” rued De Kock, who was named player-of-the-series.
The sentiment was echoed by Breetzke. “Not enough runs… we were probably looking at 250. It was tough conditions and unfortunately we lost too many wickets there.”
Nandre Burger’s dismissal of Fakhar, knocking his stumps through the gate, brought Babar to the crease and after a quiet opening couple of overs, the right-hander, who had scores of seven and 11 in the opening two matches, got Pakistan off the mark in the third which ended with a boundary of Saim’s bat – a punch through the covers.
A deft touch of Lundi Ngidi then brought Babar’s first boundary before Saim flicked away the pacer for four. Babar then pulled Burger away for four before treating the crowd to two delightful boundaries off Ngidi in the sixth over.
Boundaries were flowing for Pakistan – three of them coming off the eighth over off Bosch, all of them from Saim with the first a six. At the other end, Babar showed his elegance with a scrumptious cover drive for four as Pakistan reached 59-1 after the first 10.
Babar would soon be run out, but Saim took over and was unrelenting. He reached his 50 of just 39 balls with his eighth four, pulling away Burger. Fortuin and Ferreira were then swept for boundaries before the latter was hit for a one-bounce four.
Saim fell when he couldn’t get the distance off Fortuin but by then the job was done with Rizwan closing it out. Rizwan, who was replaced by Shaheen as skipper ahead of the series, hit three fours and a six – over midwicket – to leave Pakistan four runs away and Salman finished it off with 24.5 overs to spare.</p><small>2025-11-08 15:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/081825171abc2d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953880/pm-shehbaz-again-thanks-trump-for-bold-and-decisive-leadership-in-brokering-pak-india-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz again thanks Trump for ‘bold and decisive leadership’ in brokering Pak-India ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday, once again, thanked the “bold and decisive leadership” of US President Donald Trump for brokering a ceasefire between Pakistan and India during the conflict between the two nuclear neighbours in May.
While addressing Azerbaijan’s Victory Day parade in Baku, the premier praised President Trump’s exemplary leadership, which led to the success of the peace efforts.

“It was President Trump’s, bold and decisive leadership, that brought about, the ceasefire, between Pakistan and India, restoring peace in South Asia — averting a major war, and saving millions of people.”
In his speech, the PM reiterated that Pakistan, “just like their Azerbaijani and Turkish brothers”, seeks peace, adding that no one can ever be allowed to challenge its sovereignty or undermine its territorial integrity.
The premier recalled that the Azerbaijani and Turkish military contingents had “proudly” marched alongside the Pakistani armed forces in Islamabad amid tremendous applause on August 14 this year, when they celebrated ‘Marka-i-Haq’ to commemorate their “historic victory” in the four-day war with India.
The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as “Marka-i-Haq” in May.
PM Shehbaz highlighted how, five years ago, “the courageous sons of Azerbaijan, under the bold and visionary leadership of President Ilham Aliyev, rose to respond to the call of history”.
“The world witnessed in awe as Azerbaijan’s brave armed forces liberated their ancestral lands of majestic Karabakh,” the PM stated. “Throughout this entire struggle for liberation, Pakistan stood like a rock with its brotherly country Azerbaijan.”
 






According to PM Shehbaz, Azerbaijan’s victory in Karabakh was a “glorious vindication” of a just cause and a beacon of hope for all nations striving for sovereignty and self-determination, including the brave and resilient people of Gaza and Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
The prime minister arrived in Baku on Friday for a two-day official visit to Azerbaijan at Aliyev’s invitation and to attend the country’s Victory Day ceremony.
Referring to the recent flare up with the Afghan Taliban regime, the prime minister said that their common resolve for peace has most recently been tested in the case of Afghanistan and expressed gratitude to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as well as to Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani for their “invaluable contribution” in facilitating, the peace efforts, between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“This is a true reflection of the strong and time-tested fraternal ties between our countries that stand together, through thick and thin,“ he opined.
Victory Day is observed to “commemorate the historic victory in the 44-day-long Karabakh Liberation War against Armenia”, according to the PM’s Office.

PM Shehbaz meets Türkiye’s President Erdogan
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Baku during his two-day official visit to the Central Asian country.
The two leaders reviewed all aspects of bilateral relations between Pakistan and Turkey and reaffirmed their commitment to further deepen cooperation in areas of mutual interest, reported state-run PTV.
 






During the meeting, the premier emphasised Pakistan’s commitment to transforming its longstanding fraternal relations with Türkiye into a broad partnership encompassing political, defense, economic, trade, investment, and people-to-people links.
The two also agreed that a Turkish ministerial delegation would visit Pakistan soon. They also agreed to maintain close coordination on regional and international issues of “mutual concern and reiterated their shared desire to promote peace, stability, and prosperity in the region and the broader Muslim world”.
The prime minister, accompanied by Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, also extended warm congratulations to President Erdogan and the brotherly people of Türkiye on the occasion of Türkiye’s Republic Day.
Later, the prime minister departed Baku for Islamabad.
JF-17s to participate in parade
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that Pakistani troops and JF-17 Thunder fighter jets would appear in Azerbaijan’s Victory Day parade scheduled for later today.
Since 2020, Victory Day has been observed in Azerbaijan on November 8 to commemorate its victory in the 44-day-long Karabakh Liberation War against Armenia.
“Long live Pakistan-Azerbaijan friendship. Pakistani troops and JF-17 Thunder fighter jets will be appearing in Azerbaijan’s victory parade today, commemorating the liberation of Karabagh,” he said.
The minister made the comments while responding to a post on social media platform X by Pakistan’s embassy in Baku. The embassy had posted about Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who embarked on a visit to the country a day earlier to attend Victory Day celebrations, and Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev attending a joint dinner.
 






A day earlier, Pakistan and Azerbaijan had reiterated their resolve to further cement their cooperation in the fields of trade and investments, energy, connectivity and defence. The two sides made the pledge during a meeting between PM Shehbaz and Azerbaijan President Aliyev in Baku.
Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir was also present during the meeting.
“The two leaders reviewed the whole range of bilateral relationship and agreed to further strengthen their multi-layered cooperation in the fields of trade and investments, energy, connectivity and defence,” says a press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.
The prime minister also extended an invitation to the president of Azerbaijan to visit Pakistan at his earliest convenience, which the latter accepted.
In a late-night post on X, Shehbaz had stated that he was looking forward to the “grand parade”.
Talking about his meeting with President Aliyev, he said the two “reviewed the deep-rooted and fraternal ties between our two countries and agreed to further expand cooperation in trade, energy, connectivity, and defence”.
 






Last month, a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) contingent comprising JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets, accompanied by skilled air and ground crew, had landed in Azerbaijan to participate in a bilateral aerial combat exercise.
 






According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the exercise, called Indus Shield Alpha, aimed to enhance mutual understanding, tactical coordination and interoperability between the air forces of Pakistan and Azerbaijan.</p><small>2025-11-08 15:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08151301a8b0e27.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953879/bill-for-27th-constitutional-amendment-tabled-in-senate-after-federal-cabinets-approval' target='_blank'><strong>Bill for 27th Constitutional Amendment tabled in Senate after federal cabinet’s approval</strong></a><br><p>Shortly after getting approval from the federal cabinet, the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment was tabled before the Senate on Saturday and subsequently referred to the standing committees on law and justice.
A joint session of both the NA and Senate standing committees on law and justice was then summoned to discuss the amendment.
However, during the session of the standing committees, two Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) members, Aliya Kamran and Senator Kamran Murtaza, boycotted the meeting and said the proposed draft included amendments that were discarded in the 26th Amendment bill.
Following deliberations on the proposed amendment, the law committees of both Houses adjourned the moot till Sunday.
‘Discussions will continue till consensus is reached’
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, speaking to the media after the adjournment of the committees, said all parties were participating in the session and they had also “requested the opposition to participate”.
“Aliya Kamran had informed us that they have instructions from their party not to attend the session; however, all other parties were in attendance. We even asked the opposition to be a part of the session.”
Tarar said the “long-awaited” proposed amendment has been in discussion for the last 10-15 years. “Even today we are having a constructive debate on the matter.”
“At the time of the 18th Amendment, it was on the constitutional agenda, and even earlier, during the 26th Amendment, but due to certain reasons, one of which was Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s suggestion that such a major change should not be made and that it would be better to move towards transition and form constitutional benches,” said Tarar.
The law minister elaborated that the formation of the benches increased the workload of the judiciary, as the same judges were hearing cases fixed for the bench and otherwise.
“The objective was to ensure that the cases fixed in the Supreme Court are not delayed further and the common man gets relief.”
Tarar added that one of the aims of the proposed changes is also to do away with the criticism of a “court within a court”.  “All members have reviewed it (proposed constitutional amendment) and we have completed arguments on around 60pc of the clauses.”
The law minister said a few questions have been raised by some members, clarifying that they are legal in nature and “not fundamental issues”.
“We will reconvene again tomorrow morning at 11am and continue our discussions. And till the time we do not reach a consensus, from all members of both Houses, the discussions will continue,” said the law minister.
The Senate and standing committee sessions will resume on Sunday, November 9.
Farooq H. Naek said no decision has been reached yet after deliberations on the proposed constitutional amendment, and claimed around 80pc of the bill was discussed.
He added that certain “mistakes” in the draft will be corrected and the law ministry has been made aware.
When asked about changes to Article 243, he said it was not discussed during today’s session.
Tarar tables bill in Senate
The bill, which was tabled in the Senate by the law minister, proposed the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, changes in the process for appointing high court judges, changes to the threshold for provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure.
At the outset of the session, Tarar — who had earlier in the day briefed the media on some features of the proposed legislation after the federal cabinet meeting —  requested the suspension of the question hour and other house business so he could brief lawmakers on the amendment.
The law minister then moved the bill before the upper house, with Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani referring it to the National Assembly and Senate standing committees on law and justice for review and consideration. He said that both committees may hold joint meetings for a detailed review and consideration, and the report would be presented before the House.
 


During the Senate session, PTI’s Ali Zafar said that debating the constitutional amendment was not appropriate when the leader of the opposition’s seat remained vacant. He said that the government and its allied parties appeared to be in a hurry to pass the bill.
“I would suggest that instead of sending it to the committee, let this Senate be treated as a committee as a whole,” he said, suggesting the bill be debated by all individuals. He further said that the opposition had received the draft today and had also not yet read a word of it.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“We cannot debate something we have not read,” he said.
Law minister details key clauses
Meanwhile, the law minister said that the bill would address five subject areas.
He highlighted that one of the things agreed in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006 was the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court, which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters.
“During consultations on the 26th Constitutional Amendment, some of our friends suggested that we refrain from making such a huge change and experiment by forming constitutional benches,” he said.
The minister said that constitutional benches had been formed, but judges spent most of their time listening to such matters and other cases during the rest of the time. “The fact of the matter is that five to six per cent of cases take 40pc of the court’s time and the rest of the cases remain as is,” he said.
 
 

He further stated that some argued that constitutional benches were a “court within a court” and also raised other objections.
“After detailed consultations with all political forces … We said that the wish and demand of a Federal Constitutional Court should be brought into the Parliament, which we have done through this bill,” he said.
He said that another issue concerned the process for the transfer of high court judges. This was addressed in the 1973 Constitution, which empowered the president to make the transfer on the advice of the premier in consultation. He said that the transfer could be made for two years without the judge’s consent, but longer periods would require it.
“In the 18th Amendment, the two-year condition was removed, and it was stated that the judge’s consent would be sought. In the 26th Amendment, the condition remained the same but concerns were raised about the interference of the executive,” he said.
He further said that it was proposed that the bit about the premier’s advice for the transfer of judges be removed and handed over to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
“It also has safeguards that a judge more senior than the chief justice will not be sent so that there is no dispute about that,” he said, adding that it was up to the JCP whether or not it wanted to seek the judge’s consent.
Talking about elections for the upper house of Parliament, he noted that they took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after a delay of more than a year.
“The first thing after a Senate election is the election of the chairman and deputy chairman. To avoid any dispute in this regard, a clause has been introduced,” he said.
The minister further said that the bill also proposed increasing the 11pc provincial threshold for the cabinet to 13pc, noting that all provinces had voiced concerns apart from Punjab.
The Constitution allows the provinces to have cabinets not exceeding 15 ministers or 11pc of the total membership of their respective provincial assembly, whichever of the two is higher.
“Previously, there were five provincial advisers … now they have been increased to seven,” he said.
Talking about Article 243, which provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces”, the minister said that certain clauses were being introduced.
He said that Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir had been awarded the title of field marshal. “This is a title, not a rank, not an appointment as such … whereas army chief is an appointment with a five-year tenure,” he said.

“Field marshal, or marshal of the air force, admiral of the fleet — these exist in different countries for land, navy and air forces — these have been mentioned, and it has been stated that these titles will be given to national heroes. These titles are for a lifetime. It is a title,” he said.
He further said that it was clarified that the “impeachment or reversal” of the title would not be at the premier’s authority but at Parliament’s.
He further said that the office of CJCSC would be abolished from November 27, 2025. “The present CJCSC is also our hero; it will be abolished after his appointment ends. Parliament cannot even think of depriving him of the role during his tenure,” he said.
The minister said, however, that there would be no new appointment because the COAS had been given the role of the chief of defence forces. He further said that the bill proposed that the prime minister, on the recommendation of the COAS, would appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command.
“Where the federal government promotes a member of the armed forces to the rank of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet, such officer shall retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life,” he said, reading from the bill.
“Upon completion of the term of his command, under the law, the federal government shall determine the responsibilities and duties of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet in the interest of the state,” he read out from the draft.
Federal govt approves draft
Shortly before the Senate session, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had chaired the cabinet meeting via video link from Azerbaijan, according to state-run PTV News.
“The federal cabinet approved the draft for the 27th Constitutional Amendment and welcomed it to the fullest extent,” it had added.
“Everyone made joint efforts for the 27th Constitutional Amendment for strengthening the Centre’s relations with the provinces and the country’s wider interests,” the premier was quoted as saying. He commended the law minister’s efforts, as well as those of the attorney general of Pakistan.
 






Shehbaz noted that he had taken PML-N President Nawaz Sharif into confidence for the amendments and sought his guidance on them. “I also took President Asif Ali Zardari into confidence regarding the Amendment and we are deeply grateful to him for their approval,” the premier said.
He went on to specifically thank PPP Chairman Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari and heads of other allied parties who held discussions with him and “strongly supported” the draft. The prime minister noted that Awami National Party (ANP) President Aimal Wali Khan, PML-Zia head Ijazul Haq and other politicians were also apprised of the legislation.
He stressed that everyone must work together for the country’s progress and prosperity.
PM Shehbaz had held consultations with multiple ruling allies on Thursday, meeting with the top leadership of the PML-Q, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP), the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), the Balochistan Awami Party, the ANP and the PML-Zia.
After the federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad, the law minister had briefed the media on some of the key features of the draft and informed that the bill would be tabled in the Senate.
Moreover, Tarar recalled that at the time of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, the MQM-P had contacted the prime minister and the PML-N seeking changes to Article 140A, which provides that the provinces will establish local governments (LGs).
“They had introduced a bill in the Senate, which was referred to a committee and on the directives of the premier, I, as the law minister, also gave a note in its support,” Tarar said.
“As that bill is already pending, the cabinet has also directed me today that when today’s bill is referred to the committee after being presented in the senate, the committee should also mull over [the one tabled by the MQM-P],” he said.
Tarar said that the government would try to convince its allied partners to develop a consensus on this bill so it could be passed, adding that a recent resolution by the Punjab Assembly regarding LGs would also be discussed.
He further said that Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) leaders, in their meeting with PM Shehbaz earlier this week, had directed his attention to a bill pertaining to an increase in the seats for the Balochistan Assembly.
“So both these bills, which are already pending before the law and justice standing committee, will be debated,” the minister said.
“Pakistan is going through very tough circumstances, and I think the country’s greatest need today is political consensus and political stability,” the law minister stressed.
The proposed constitutional tweaks have been heavily criticised by lawyers and politicians, who termed them an attempt to revoke provincial rights granted in the 18th Amendment.
The federal cabinet meeting was originally scheduled for Friday, but was postponed due to PM Shehbaz’s commitments in Azerbaijan, sources in the PM Office said. However, some were of the opinion that the meeting was put off due to a lack of consensus between the ruling PML-N and the PPP over the Amendment.
The PPP has said it would support amendments to Article 243, which defines the powers of the armed forces, but has rejected proposals related to provinces’ shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award and any rollback of the 18th Amendment.
The PPP’s Central Executive Committee (CEC) yesterday decided that it “agrees in principle with the idea that constitutional courts should be formed” — a proposal also mulled during the 26th Amendment discussions last year.
The MQM-P presented its own version of additions to the 27th Amendment, calling for strong and autonomous LGs across the country. The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), which met with an MQM-P delegation on Thursday, has opposed any amendment that would reduce the powers granted to the provinces under the 18th Amendment.
The opposition PTI has criticised most of the tweaks, terming the proposed amendment an “attack“ on the Parliament. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said earlier this week that it would be inappropriate to claw back population and education from the provinces.
On the other hand, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Wednesday assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th Amendment.
On November 3, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that the government’s proposed amendments included “setting up [of] constitutional court, executive magistrates, transfer of judges, removal of protection of provincial share in NFC, amending article 243, return of education and population planning to the federation and breaking [the] deadlock on appointment of ECP”.</p><small>2025-11-08 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632690-what-the-27th-amendment-is-all-about-salient-features-explained' target='_blank'><strong>What the 27th Amendment is all about: Salient features explained</strong></a><br><p>

Rainfall in the capital has this year been at its lowest level in a century, local officials say, and half of Iran’s provinces have not seen a drop fall in months.
Now, to save water, the government is planning water cuts in Tehran — and several local news outlets have already reported pipes running dry overnight in some areas.
“This will help avoid waste even though it may cause inconvenience,” Iran’s Energy Minister Abbas Ali Abadi said on state television.
In a speech broadcast on Friday, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian had warned that Tehran might have to be evacuated if no rain falls before the end of the year.
But he gave no details about how such a vast operation would be conducted.
Tehran nestles on the southern slopes of the Alborz mountains and has hot, dry summers usually relieved by autumn rains and winter snowfall.

Reservoirs run dry
Tehran is by far the country’s biggest city and its inhabitants use three million cubic metres of water per day, according to local media.
The main Amir Kabir dam on the Karaj river, one of five reservoirs serving the capital, is running dry and holds only 14m cubic litres, according to Behzad Parsa, director general of the Tehran water company, cited by the official news agency IRNA.
During the same period last year, the reservoir held 86m cubic metres, he added, but now it only has enough to maintain supplies to the Tehran region for less than two weeks.
On Saturday, state television broadcast images of several dams, serving the central city of Isfahan and Tabriz in the northwest, showing significantly lower water levels compared to previous years.
Hassan Hosseini, the deputy Iran’s second-largest city Mashhad, told IRNA agency on Thursday that night-time water cuts were being considered to address the water shortage.
And over the summer on July and August, two public holidays were declared in Tehran to save water and energy, at a time when power outages were almost daily during the intense heatwave.</p><small>2025-11-08 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632675-pakistan-seeks-peace-but-wont-compromise-sovereignty-says-pm-in-baku' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks peace but won't compromise on sovereignty, says PM in Baku</strong></a><br><p>
