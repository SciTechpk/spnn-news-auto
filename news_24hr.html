A fervent Catholic who himself converted in 2019, Vance said on Friday that pushback against his remarks reeks of “anti-Christian bigotry“.
The 41-year-old was asked about raising their three children in an interfaith marriage at a Turning Point USA event honouring assassinated right-wing activist Charlie Kirk at the University of Mississippi on Wednesday.
“Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that,” he said.
“But if she doesn’t, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn’t cause a problem for me.”

• Over 1,400 test positive in Karachi, Hyderabad during 24 hours
• Experts warn situation is turning critical as people fail to take the infection seriously
• True scale of outbreak unclear as no official mechanism is in place to collect data from private health facilities
KARACHI: The alarming situation over the dengue outbreak in the province, especially in Hyderabad and Karachi, persists as the provincial health department on Saturday confirmed the deaths of three more patients from the mosquito-borne viral infection, raising the (official) tally for the current year to six.
According to the department’s data, two patients — a 30-year-old female resident of Malir and a 65-year-old male resident of district West — have died at the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital and Research Centre (SIDH&RC) over the past two days (Oct 30-31st).
An 18-year-old girl, resident of Latifabad, died at the Liaquat University Hospital, Hyderabad, on Saturday.
 






It also showed that out of the 5,000 plus tests conducted for detection of dengue fever in the province in 24 hours, a total of 1,411 patients tested positive. Of them, 618 and 793 patients tested positive in Karachi and Hyderabad, respectively.
A total of 106 and 93 new patients were also admitted to the public and private hospitals, respectively, in 24 hours.
“The dengue situation, especially in Karachi, is very serious. Every third patient presenting at clinics these days is being diagnosed with dengue fever,” Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, senior general physician representing the Pakistan Medical Association said.
Complications, he pointed out, were occurring due to self-medication and severe inadequate hydration. “Some medications, including some pain killers, can cause a low platelet count, which can lead to excessive bleeding. Second, patients must keep themselves well hydrated to avoid complications and consult a qualified general practitioner.”
Unaccounted deaths
Sources said the situation was far more serious than what’s depicted by official data and that the official figures didn’t represent the ground reality.
They pointed out that there was no official mechanism in place to get feedback from private clinics operating in every nook and corner of a locality as well as private hospitals. Many people constrained by their financial resources didn’t even opt for laboratory tests.
 
 

The sources said the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) this year has so far seen six deaths from dengue, while the SIDH & RC recorded 12 deaths — including the recently reported two mortalities — with 500 admissions from the illness.
“Both patients were brought in critical condition and could hardly survive for a few hours. Unfortunately, people are not taking the viral infection seriously that can turn deadly in patients experiencing internal bleeding,” a senior doctor at the hospital said, emphasising the need for disease monitoring and adequate hydration during the illness and vector-control measures.
According to experts, most people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in one to two weeks. Symptoms may include: high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting and rash.
Individuals who are infected for the second time are at greater risk of severe dengue. The symptoms of severe dengue often come after the fever has gone away and may include: severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums or nose, fatigue, restlessness and blood in vomit or stool.

KARACHI: Senior Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader and former chief minister of Sindh Aftab Shaban Mirani passed away on Saturday after a brief illness, his party and family said.
They stated that he had been unwell for several days and was recently discharged from a private hospital in Karachi.
According to family sources, his funeral prayers were offered at Masjid Baitus Salam in DHA on Saturday night, and he was laid to rest at the Gizri graveyard.
A large number of people, including Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and other PPP leaders, attended his last rites.
 






Mirani, a senior politician from Shikarpur, had a long and distinguished political career spanning several decades. He was among the senior-most leaders of the PPP and was known for his close association with the late prime ministers Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto.

President, PM express deep sorrow over demise of seasoned PPP leader

He served as the 18th chief minister of Sindh in 1990. Later, during Benazir Bhutto’s second tenure, he held the key portfolio of defence minister of Pakistan from October 1993 to November 1996.
Mirani was elected multiple times to the National Assembly of Pakistan from his home constituency in Shikarpur, representing the PPP. He won seats in the general elections of 2008, 2013 and 2018, serving as a member of the NA from 2008 till 2023.
Over the years, he played an active role in parliamentary affairs and was respected for his moderate views and strong party loyalty.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed deep sorrow over the demise of Mirani, calling him “a senior parliamentarian and a loyal leader of the PPP.”
In his condolence message, the president said that Mirani’s political wisdom and commitment to democratic values would always be remembered.
President Zardari also prayed for the departed soul and extended heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed grief over the passing of the senior politician, saying that the late PPP leader rendered valuable services for the country and its people.
“Aftab Shaban Mirani’s political and public service contributions will be remembered with respect,” the PM said, praying for eternal peace for the departed soul and strength for his family in this difficult time.
CM Shah, who visited Mirani at a private hospital last week, also expressed deep sorrow, calling his death a great loss to the province and the PPP.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also expressed deep sorrow and grief over the passing of Mirani and said that with his demise, the PPP has lost a sincere, loyal, and dedicated leader devoted to public service.

“Sadly, a number of the victims we’ve found were minors,” Alfonso Durazo, governor of Sonora state, said in a video message as he announced the toll of 23 dead and another 11 injured.
Durazo said the survivors were being treated at hospitals in the city of Hermosillo, where the explosion took place.
“I have ordered an extensive and transparent investigation to determine the causes of the incident and figure out those responsible,” he said.
 






The prosecutor’s office said in a statement that “the working assumption is that the incident was accidental, and the investigation is looking into a transformer located inside the store“.
“Once the firefighters allow access into the building … it will be possible to precisely determine the cause of the incident,” it added.
The explosion happened at a Waldo’s store in the city centre.
“Nobody will face this pain alone. From the very first moments, emergency, security and health services responded with great professionalism and commitment, controlling the situation and saving lives,” the governor said.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed her condolences on X “to the families and loved ones of those who died.”
“I have been in contact with the Sonora governor, Alfonso Durazo, to provide support where needed. I’ve instructed Interior Secretary Rosa Icela Rodriguez to send a support team in order to assist the families and the injured,” she continued.
 


Mexican media reports said customers sought refuge inside the store after the explosion, only to become trapped by the flames. Images in local media showed the building’s facade blackened from the fire, with windows shattered.
Newspaper El Universal said the explosion occurred around 2pm (1am PKT) and that nearby businesses opted to close their doors in order to prevent the fire from spreading there.
Local authorities urged members of the public to avoid the area of the explosion, and cancelled celebrations scheduled to be held that day in honour of the Day of the Dead holiday.</p><small>2025-11-02 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/69060a075e531.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952559/smokers-corner-insider-or-outsider' target='_blank'><strong>SMOKERS’ CORNER: INSIDER OR OUTSIDER?</strong></a><br><p>In 1923, an Indian migrant to the United States, Bhagat Singh Thind, went to the US Supreme Court to argue that he should be treated as a ‘Caucasian’ (white person). 
Thind had arrived in the US in 1913 for higher studies. He was granted US citizenship in 1918, but it was revoked under a 1906 law that only allowed “free white persons” to be eligible for US citizenship. Five years later, Thind and his lawyer, S. G. Pandit, went to the court, where they argued that the law did not apply to Thind because he belonged to the “Aryan race.” Even though a Sikh, Thind described himself as a high-caste Indian whose ancestors were Aryan.
At the time, various pseudoscientific theories about race were popular among many white Europeans and Americans. These theories placed the white race on top of the “Great Chain of Being.”
 
 

According to the legal scholar Ian Haney López, Thind tried to prove that, by being a “high-caste, of full Indian blood”, he was a Caucasian as per certain anthropological definitions of the time. But Thind lost the case.
This case highlights the intriguing manner in which many South Asians often tried to come to terms with the Western cultural and political ethos of the early 20th century. In his 2006 study of the Indian middle class milieu in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the German academic Markus Daechsel demonstrated that many Hindu and Muslim notables were smitten by racial theories developed in the West.

From colonial racial theories to Hindu nationalism and Islamophobia, South Asians’ struggle for identity in the West remains as complex — and revealing — as ever

They claimed that the roots of these theories (which they accepted as “scientific truths”) could be found in the genealogy of South Asian people. For example, some Hindu Indians, especially those from higher castes, internalised the colonial idea of Caucasian supremacy to elevate their social status. They insisted they were part of the original Aryan people, of which Western Caucasians were a branch.
Similar claims were also aired by many Indian Muslims. However, the Muslims evolved the claims to mean having Arab and Persian ancestries that built great civilisations, which then went on to inspire the rise of modern Western civilisation.
South Asian Hindus and Muslims who adopted ‘Western ways’ were severely criticised by those who claimed to be the original Aryans, or from civilisations that had inspired the growth of modern Western civilisation. This was their way of coming to terms with Western political, economic and social dominance in a world in which Hindu and Muslim empires had long collapsed.
 
 

Then, unable (or unwilling) to compete with the technologies and ideas driving modern Western civilisation, many Indian Hindus and Muslims turned to filling the ‘spiritual void’ that they believed Western civilisation had plunged into in its pursuit of materialistic goals.
From the mid-1960s till the mid-1970s, Western countries were flooded with South Asian Hindu preachers and gurus, and Muslim ‘Sufi’ masters. They wanted to spiritually enrich (for a fee) the ‘spiritually bankrupt’ West. To the South Asian gurus and the ‘Sufis’ in the West, this began to signify the overcoming of amoral Western superiority through the ‘moral/spiritual superiority of the East.’
This did not go unnoticed, though. From the 1980s onwards, right-wing Christian groups in the West started to formulate their own strands of spiritualism and morality that, to them, were at odds with ‘Eastern spiritualism.’ They viewed the practices of the gurus and ‘Sufi’ masters as products of the ‘perversities’ of the 1960s’ counterculture in Europe and the US, and at odds with the West’s ‘white Christian heritage.’
South Asian Hindu and Muslim diasporas in Europe and the US responded by detaching themselves from the ‘perversities’ and becoming more active components of ‘Western materialism.’ Hindu diasporas were more successful in doing this than Muslim diasporas. 
The latter retreated and ghettoised themselves within the confines of more puritanical (and less esoteric) variants of Islam. This retreat signified a desire to overcome ‘amoral’ Western environs and ideas with the moral superiority of the puritanical and highly ritualised variants of Islam that the South Asian Muslim diaspora in the West began to adopt.
 


Right-wing Christian groups and white nativists/nationalists saw this as a threat to the ‘Western way of life’, its Christian heritage, and a refusal by Muslim migrants to become part of the dominant culture.  This resulted in increasing cases of Islamophobia. Muslims who had seamlessly adopted Western culture saw the adoption of puritanical Islam by their contemporaries as a defeatist ploy.
Recently, Hindu interest groups in Europe and the US have reported an increase in attacks against Hindus and their places of worship. Unlike the South Asian Muslim diaspora in the West, the Hindu diaspora successfully became a more vital component of Western economies. So what has triggered cases of what is now referred to as Hinduphobia?
In the last three decades, the Indian Hindu diaspora rose to become an enterprising lot. They then began to couple this with Hindu nationalism. In the 1990s, Hindu nationalism came to the surface with great force in India. This nationalism — strengthened by the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India — promoted a strong, prosperous and ‘culturally proud’ India. This resonated immediately with the Indian Hindu diaspora’s economic aspirations.
Yet, the increasing displays of this cultural pride, backed by newfound wealth in the West, have begun to be viewed by many white Westerners as a show of arrogance and an unwillingness to get assimilated — especially during a time when many Western economies and democracies have begun to struggle.
Last week, I came across a middle-aged white American in Seattle. He’s an assistant professor of sociology at a university. He said that, when he was in his early twenties, an Indian friend of his used to mock him as a spiritually bankrupt person who had lost all contact with his soul. Decades later, the friend became a prosperous businessman in Seattle and a leading overseas donor to the BJP. His son now sits in the sociology class of the assistant professor. The professor said that the son does not hesitate in telling him that he (the son) belongs to a superior race that gave birth to the Caucasian races of the West.
According to the assistant professor, “Due to the embracing of Hindu nationalism, the economic advancement of the Indian diaspora in the US has been offset by a regressive and reactionary cultural ethos, mostly within the higher caste, middle-class Hindu communities.” 
He then added: “This is not going down well with a lot of Americans, who have begun to see many such Indians as arrogant, crass and antagonistic towards Western culture.”

In a statement on X, he said: “I firmly believe that Pakistan’s growing population and expanding administrative needs make the creation of new provinces an urgent national requirement.
“It is time to reorganise our four existing provinces — Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan — into three new administrative units each, named North, Central, and South, while preserving their original provincial identities.”
Aleem Khan, who is also the president of the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP), an ally of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), termed his proposal a significant step toward improved governance.
 






He further said that such restructuring would bring governance closer to the people, ensure efficient delivery of public services, and allow chief secretaries, inspectors general of police, and high courts to function more effectively within manageable jurisdictions. “For decades, the debate on new provinces has remained limited to politics and slogans. Now is the time for serious, consultative action to make this vision a reality,” he added.
 
 

Mr Khan said creating new provinces would not divide Pakistan but instead strengthen national unity, improve economic management, and enhance stability through balanced regional development.
“Let us work together to establish administratively feasible, people-centered provinces, so that every citizen’s voice is heard and their problems are solved at their doorstep,” he remarked.
Meeting with Iran’s envoy
Later, during a meeting with the Ambassador of Iran to Pakistan, Reza Amiri Moghadam, Communication Minister Aleem Khan reaffirmed his commitment to facilitating smoother cross-border movement of goods between Pakistan and Iran.
He expressed hope that bilateral trade between the two countries could reach Rs10 billion, emphasising that all necessary measures would be taken to address issues related to the entry and exit of Iranian trade trucks at border points.

Prices are forecast to drop by seven per cent in both 2025 and 2026, driven by weak global economic growth, a growing oil surplus, and persistent policy uncertainty.
Falling energy prices are helping to ease global inflation, while lower rice and wheat prices have helped make food more affordable in some developing countries. Despite the recent declines, however, commodity prices remain above pre-pandemic levels, with prices in 2025 and 2026 projected to be 23pc and 14pc higher, respectively, than in 2019.
The global oil glut has expanded significantly in 2025 and is expected to rise next year to 65pc above the most recent high, in 2020. Oil demand is growing more slowly as demand for electric and hybrid vehicles grows and oil consumption stagnates in China.
Brent crude oil prices are forecast to fall from an average of $68 in 2025 to $60 in 2026 — a five-year low. Overall, energy prices are forecast to fall by 12pc in 2025 and a further 10pc in 2026.

World Bank sees prices falling 7pc in 2025 and 2026 as weak growth and oil surplus drag markets

Food prices are also easing, with declines of 6.1pc projected in 2025 and 0.3pc in 2026 soybean prices are falling in 2025 because of record production and trade tensions but are expected to stabilise over the next two years. Meanwhile, coffee and cocoa prices are forecast to fall in 2026 as supply conditions improve.
However, fertiliser prices are projected to surge 21pc in 2025, reflecting higher input costs and trade restrictions, before easing 5pc in 2026. These increases are likely to further erode farmers’ profit margins and raise concerns about future crop yields.
Precious metals have reached record highs in 2025, fuelled by demand for safe-haven assets and continued central bank purchases. The price of gold — widely viewed as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty — is expected to increase by 42pc in 2025.
It is projected to increase by a further 5pc next year, leaving gold prices at nearly double their 2015-2019 average. Silver prices are also expected to hit a record annual average in 2025, rising by 34pc and further 8pc in 2026.
Commodity prices could fall more than expected during the forecast horizon if global growth remains sluggish amid prolonged trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Greater-than-expected oil output from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) could deepen the oil glut and exert additional downward pressure on energy prices. Electric-vehicle sales, which are expected to increase sharply by 2030, could further depress oil demand.
Conversely, geopolitical tensions and conflicts could push oil prices higher and boost demand for safe-haven commodities such as gold and silver. In the case of oil, the market impact of additional sanctions could also lift prices above the baseline forecast.
Extreme weather from a stronger-than-expected La Nina cycle could disrupt agricultural output and increase electricity demand for heating and cooling, adding further pressure to food and energy prices. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) and growing electricity demand to power data centers could raise prices for energy and for base metals like aluminum and copper, which are essential for AI infrastructure.
Instead of using price-control schemes, the report recommends that countries foster more diverse and efficient production, invest in technology and innovation, improve data transparency, and promote market-based pricing to build long-term resilience to price volatility.

Shaheen picked up 3-26, being the standout of Pakistan’s bowling attack, in which Faheem Ashraf and debutant Usman Tariq picked up two wickets each, as South Africa were restricted to 139-9 after being put into bat.
Babar then provided an anchor in the chase with a brilliant 68, featuring nine fours, as Pakistan eased to victory with six balls to spare.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated the team on X, saying, “Very well-played boys in Green!”
He also commended Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and his team for their “great efforts”.
 






In a statement, Naqvi hailed Babar’s batting and Shaheen’s bowling skills for playing an “important role” in the win.
Conveying his congratulations to Captain Salman Agha, Head Coach Mike Hesson and other players, Naqvi said “teamwork, hard work and professional approach” led to the victory.
 






Shaheen got Pakistan off to a flyer with two wickets halfway through the first over and almost bagged a third victim two balls later.
Opener Quinton de Kock’s stumps were undone on the second ball of the innings with a delivery that jagged back, found an edge and clattered into the woodwork.
On the very next ball, Lhuan-dre Pretorious then spooned a catch to Usman Tariq at short fine-leg.
Pakistan were in dreamland when the umpire adjudged Dewald Brevis lbw on the first ball of a spectacular opening over, only for the decision review system to show that the ball was going to rise over the stumps.
South Africa were rocking and their first boundary only came on the penultimate ball of the third over when opener Reeza Hendricks punched Shaheen away to the extra cover fence.
Things were otherwise kept tight by Shaheen’s new ball partner, Salman Mirza, who came off a sparkling performance in the second match of the series a day earlier, where Pakistan had shot down South Africa for 110 to level the series, giving little away.
Faheem, player-of-the-match on Friday, gave away just two runs in the fifth over with Salman bowling a tidy sixth as South Africa crawled to 22-2 at the end of the powerplay.
 






Brevis, though, broke the shackles with two sixes off spinner Mohammad Nazwaz in the seventh over — the first straight down the ground and the second over deep midwicket.
Brevis (21), though, was gone soon after with debutant spinner Usman Tariq getting his maiden T20I wicket with the second ball of his career; the South African batter finding Babar Azam at long-on as he tried to go big once again.
The incoming Matthew Breetzke didn’t last long, seeing his stumps shattered by Nawaz with a ball that straightened after pitching in the following over as South Africa slipped from 38-2 to 42-4.
Skipper Donovan Ferreira breathed fresh impetus with a six off Usman, as South Africa reached 56-4 halfway through their innings, and then upped the ante with two sixes and a four in the 11th over bowled by Nawaz.
But Ferreira’s big-hitting spree didn’t last long as, after making 29 off 13, he holed out to his counterpart Salman Ali Agha at mid-off in the following over by Faheem.
South Africa were six down on the next ball with George Linde finding Hasan Nawaz at midwicket with Pakistan firmly on top.
Hendricks’ long, patient stay at the crease ended in the 15th over when he top-edged Usman to Hasan at deep backward square to depart for 34 off 36 with two fours.
 






The incoming Andile Simelane then hoisted Shaheen for the fourth six of the innings to set South Africa’s total beyond Friday’s below-par effort, but departed after making 13 when Salman Mirza had him caught at midwicket in the 18th over.
Shaheen bagged his third wicket when he sent back Lizaad Williams in the penultimate over, but Corbin Bosch (30 not out) ensured South Africa reached a respectable total.
Sahibzada Farhan got Pakistan’s first runs in the chase with a six over long-off on the third ball of their innings, but lost his opening partner Saim Ayub in the second over — the left-hander miscuing to Ferreira of Bosch.
Babar, arriving to adoring cheers from the crowd, got his first four on the ninth ball he faced with a sumptuous pull off Williams and then cut him away for another two deliveries later.
Babar was in the mood and swept Linde for a one-bounce four in the following over as Pakistan reached the end of the powerplay at 36-1.
Sahibzada then got his second boundary, driving Ferreira down the ground for four, but departed soon after when the South African skipper had him caught at deep midwicket for 19 on the last ball of the seventh over.
In the face of spin from both ends, Babar and captain Salman Ali Agha sought to steady the chase with just one boundary coming in overs eighth to 10th, by the end of which Pakistan were 64-2.
Boundaries, however, came thick and fast in the 12th over by Ottneil Baartman — Agha’s edge flying to the third man fence after a misfield before Babar got three in a row to raise his half-century off 36 balls.
 






Babar, who returned to the side for the series, was putting on a show and got another two boundaries in the 14th over of Bosch as Pakistan closed in on the target.
Babar and Salman, who was providing able support at the other end, however, couldn’t take Pakistan to the end.
Salman had just got his second boundary but perished on the next ball, having made 33 off 26, when he chipped Williams to Simelane in the 16th over.
Babar fell in the next over, when he pulled Bosch to Hendricks at deep backward square to bring an end to his 47-ball knock.
Two more wickets followed Babar’s fall as Hasan was caught off Williams and Silemane cleaned up Nawaz, but Pakistan eventually wrapped it up with an over to spare.</p><small>2025-11-02 04:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0209474718d2763.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952653/tax-net-expands-with-892000-new-filers' target='_blank'><strong>Tax net expands with 892,000 new filers</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has linked the filing of 892,419 new tax returns for the tax year 2025 to rising public confidence in the government’s reform agenda.
The premier’s remarks followed the Federal Board of Revenue’s announcement that the tax department received 5.912 million tax returns for tax year 2025, up from 5.025m returns in tax year 2024, marking a 17.65 per cent increase. The last date for filing the tax returns was Oct 31.
An official announcement issued by the Prime Minister’s Secretariat has commended the FBR for achieving a historic milestone. He expressed deep gratitude to the public for demonstrating civic responsibility and trust in the government’s economic policies.
Highlighting the inclusion of new filers into the tax net, Prime Minister Shehbaz said this surge reflects growing public confidence in the government’s reform agenda. “We are sincerely thankful to the people for their support,” he stated.

PM Shehbaz links surge in new returns to FBR digitisation drive

Mr Shehbaz attributed the positive outcomes to ongoing tax system reforms, calling them a blessing and a sign of progress.
He emphasised merit as the cornerstone of FBR’s institutional culture, noting that capable and hardworking officers are being encouraged while underperformance is being actively discouraged.
Individual tax filings surge in FY25, with a sharp rise in returns accompanied by payments. The FBR recorded a significant uptick in individual tax filings for the year 2025, with the total number of returns reaching 5.805 million — an 18.18pc increase from the 4.912m filed in the previous year.
Of these, 3.599m returns were submitted along with tax payments, marking a 19pc rise compared to 3.024m paid filings in 2024.
The total tax revenue collected through these returns climbed to Rs69.02bn in FY25, up from Rs60.15bn the year before — reflecting a year-on-year growth of 10pc.
According to the announcement, the prime minister underscored his personal oversight of FBR’s digitisation efforts, chairing weekly meetings to ensure transparency and efficiency.
He noted that tax filing procedures have been simplified, and automated clearance systems at ports have helped curb corruption and improve performance.
The government has launched a simplified tax return form in Urdu for salaried individuals to make tax filing easier.
To combat the informal economy, the government has expanded the use of point-of-sale systems, effectively reducing sales tax evasion.
The prime minister also pointed to a Rs9bn increase in tax revenue along with the filing of tax returns compared to the previous year as clear evidence of the success of FBR’s reforms.
He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to further reforming the FBR and pledged continued efforts to eliminate corruption and the shadow economy. “We are working day and night to ensure a fair and transparent fiscal system,” he concluded.

This question is gaining traction in Pakistan’s public discourse as tensions between the two sides deepen. Analysts are seeking explanations rooted in political and strategic realities, but the roots of this shift lie deeper in the Taliban’s ideological self-conception and the tribal codes that shape their worldview.
Long before the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021, some observers had predicted that the movement would swiftly discard the perception of its being Pakistan’s creation once it achieved its objective in Afghanistan. That prediction has proved accurate. The Taliban’s behaviour reflects not just political pragmatism but also an embedded sense of honour (nang or ghairat) within the framework of Pashtunwali, the traditional Pakhtun code of conduct that governs social and moral life.
 
 

In Pashtunwali, honour transcends mere pride or courage. It embodies integrity, loyalty, and the defence of autonomy. It demands that promises be kept and hospitality respected, yet it also obliges independence from external control. Loyalty, in this sense, is conditional, not permanent servitude. It must not compromise one’s dignity or sovereignty. For the Taliban, accepting Pakistan’s continued patronage after victory in Kabul would be seen as a violation of their honour, a sign of subordination incompatible with their self-image as victors and rulers.
Expecting loyalty in return for hospitality is common across many South Asian and Central Asian tribal and rural societies. Yet within the same social codes, prolonged hospitality is often seen as a burden and, in some contexts, even a curse. It exposes the inner character of both host and guest, creating emotional and material strains.
The longer such relationships last, the greater the likelihood that dependency will turn into resentment. Shared resources and overlapping interests frequently become sources of dispute. This dynamic has been visible in many parts of the world where conflict has triggered mass migrations, whether among Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran, or the Rohingya communities in India and Bangladesh.

The Taliban have turned even more hostile towards Pakistan than previous Afghan regimes.

In tribal social norms along the Pak-Afghan border, demanding loyalty in exchange for hospitality is also viewed as a bargain, one that distorts the moral context of both loyalty and hospitality. When loyalty is demanded, it ceases to be an act of honour and becomes a transaction. In the Taliban’s understanding, the TTP are their guests and brothers-in-arms who once fought alongside them against a common enemy.
For Pakistan to now demand that they disarm, disband, or be handed over is perceived by the Taliban as a bargain that would stain their code of honour. To betray a guest or comrade under external pressure would violate the very moral fabric that sustains their tribal and ideological identity.
However, states operate via different norms. Their honour and codes are rooted in politics and interests of varying nature, from security and economy to grand strategy. When such interests outweigh the fear of stigma, states act pragmatically, and much of the emotionalism attached to a nation’s image erodes. This is what Pakistan did with the Taliban leadership: it applied pressure from multiple directions, strikes, economic embargoes, diplomatic and political incentives, and, over time, helped craft a new domain of bargaining between the two actors.
What happened in Doha and Istanbul was a manifestation of that shift, although the sequence of events offers only a sliver of hope for a longer-term resolution of the dispute between the two sides.
 
 

One critical element in explaining why and how the Taliban turned hostile towards Pakistan lies in religious and ideological brotherhood. This argument has been unpacked in several ways, but a central factor is the dogma and ideological architecture that underpins the movement.
Pakistan nurtured and supported mujahideen groups during the 1980s and 1990s, and later the Taliban, aiming to create prototypes of madressah graduates and even non-religiously educated cadres through public education channels who would think like Pakistanis and share its anti-Indian outlook. The project was strategic: to limit Indian influence in Afghanistan and to secure a friendly government on Pakistan’s western flank.
The project failed because the religious dogma embraced by the Taliban, many Pakistani madressahs, and religious elites presents a different vision of the state. They view Pakistan as a polity with weak ideological credentials that ought to be replaced by a ‘proper’ Islamic system. For that transformation, they regard political and armed struggle as necessary.
 
 

This is the argument many Taliban leaders continue to project to their audiences. The Pakistani militant groups, once engaged in Indian-held Kashmir, in Afghanistan, or used by the establishment for internal political purposes, held the same view. The jihadist literature of the 1990s was replete with the notion that once Kashmir and Afghanistan were ‘liberated’, the next turn would be Pakistan itself. Even Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, one of the earliest militant groups, was involved in the failed 1995 military coup attempt aimed at toppling the government and establishing a theocratic state, one not unlike the regime the Taliban have since built in Afghanistan.
For the Taliban, who have absorbed much of Al Qaeda’s political interpretation of Islamism, loyalty is defined through their religious worldview, their tribal and social code, and the political ethics these codes nurture. They interpret alliances and support during wartime as instruments of divine providence rather than acts of friendship. Assistance from states like Pakistan is thus viewed as part of God’s plan, not a favour that demands reciprocity.
The result is that Taliban-led Afghanistan has become even more hostile towards Pakistan than previous Afghan regimes, which at least operated within globally accepted diplomatic norms.
Within this worldview, any assumption among state elements here that the Taliban would remain loyal or act subservient now seems naive. Those who nurtured these groups in the hope of creating a strategic ally failed to grasp the ideological nature of their creation. In doing so, they not only empowered religious extremism beyond control but also harmed Pakistan’s own social fabric, embedding sectarian hatred and militancy as enduring legacies of that miscalculation.

Against the backdrop of this upheaval, I was seeking some temporary respite from the uncertain, often ugly and violent world, and surfing the net for content that could serve as a mild analgesic, even anaesthetic, and got lucky. And you’d be hard-pressed to realise how very lucky.
What I found on a video-streaming social media platform was a window to a Pakistan that was uplifting, life-affirming and reassuring. I don’t watch much of our TV channels for the simple reason that it is largely a case of more of the same.
News and current-affairs programmes (NCA, as we media people call this genre) are anything but NCA. These are mostly designed to either serve as homage to the ego of the ‘anchor’ or are entertainment with politicians from across the political divide, socking it to each other.
These offer near-zero insights and are often as pleasant as a cockfight that leaves the poor birds bloody and debilitated. One learns nothing. And if watching two (or more) people talking over one another in a pointless, escalating shouting match does not do anything for you, as is the case with me, sitting in front of the idiot box becomes an exercise in futility.

One man’s love for music made a difference because that is the upside of authoritarianism.

But back to more pleasant things. So, on the video-streaming platform I found some clips from a talent hunt show called Pakistan Idol. Having lived through the Zia years as a young college and then university student and then as a journalist in the nascent years of my professional life, I was sure that the culturally barren society that the dictator sought to create would remain so.
 
 

Of course, the democratic interludes did resuscitate the ‘cultural scene’ somewhat, but it was left to another authoritarian leader, a proponent of ‘enlightened moderation’, to revive it in a bit more structured manner. Yes, one man’s love for music made a difference because that is the upside of authoritarianism. It suddenly became kosher for high civil and military officials to be seen enjoying a musical evening and patronising art and artistes.
Once an interviewer, half mockingly, asked Malakah-i-Mouseeqi Roshan Ara Begum if those who showed up in large numbers to her live events understood the classical music that was her forte. The indomitable classical artiste par excellence smiled and said: “Mere sunnay walay do qism ke hein. Ek woh jo raag jaantay aur samajhtay hein aur doosray woh jo kan rasiya hein. Mere liye donon qabile ehtaram hein.” (Those who listen to me are of two kinds: first, those who understand classical music; and second, those whose ‘ear’ is discerning and can tell when they hear good music. I value both).
Although my soldier-father could sing classical music and could tell apart one raag from another with consummate ease, I count myself in the ‘kan-rasiya’ category. I wish I could have learnt the intricacies of each raag and its defining characteristics but remain grateful for a discerning ‘ear’.
 
 

Having read criticism of some of the Pakistan Idol judges and their alleged lack of nous to be able to ‘judge’ others, it was easy to see in the worst of cases, they were ‘kan rasiya’. Almost all of them were able to tell what was good singing.
Some of the songs (ghazal, geet, nazm) chosen by the contestants took me to back to my childhood, as I grew up in a household where artistes, singers and musicians were held in high esteem and musical evenings were the norm. How else other than a privilege can you describe watching as a child in awe maestros of the calibre of Ustad Umrao Bundu Khan and Muneer Khatoon performing in our drawing room, emptied of all its furniture for a ‘farshi nishist’.
For Ms Khatoon, I recall my father telling me years later that he needed to get special permission from the GHQ to invite the ‘Indian classical artiste’ to our home whilst she was on a visit to Pakistan. I remember him telling me how what was possible in the first half of the 1960s would be impossible after the 1965 war — and perhaps even more so today.
In my formative years, whether it was a ghazal evening in an army mess, the Services Club or the Karachi Press Club, literally a one-minute walk from where we lived on Ingle Road in the mid-1960s up to 1966-67, I always accompanied my parents. Annu (Bhai) Uncle (Dawn journalist Anwer Husain), my father’s university classmate, would always invite us.
 
 

I was thus able to listen to my heart’s content Farida Khanum, Iqbal Bano and Mehdi Hasan among others. Much later, after my parents’ passing, during the 1983 MRD movement, I watched a defiant Abida Parveen singing up a near-revolution at the KPC.
Because the Pakistan Idol had some of the contestants singing songs of so many of the asataza including Melody Queen Nur Jahan, it was but understandable that I was flooded with memories, nostalgia. The quality of the singing whether it was a ghazal, thumri, nazm or geet was so good. Pakistan is abundant in talent. It is bursting at the seams actually. Its flaws lie elsewhere.
Pakistan Idol performances triggered a desire to indulge in a listening session lasting long hours over several days, on headphones. I wonder what it was like for my wife who had to hear pretty loud cries out of nowhere of ‘wahwahwah … kiya kehnay … bohot khoob’. As for me, at least for now I feel rejuvenated and prepared to face the cruel world.

According to the International Federation of Journalists, at least 99 journalists and media workers have been killed so far this year, mostly in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan. The Committee to Protect Journalists notes that the persistent failure to prosecute perpetrators has emboldened those who target reporters, spreading fear and eroding the public’s right to know. Unesco, meanwhile, warns that nine out of 10 journalist murders worldwide remain unsolved, revealing how deeply impunity has taken root.
 


 
 

The stories behind these numbers are those of immense courage and loss: Palestinian-American reporter Shireen Abu Akleh, shot dead in 2022 while covering an Israeli raid; Mexico’s Javier Valdez Cárdenas, murdered for exposing drug-cartel links; Slovakia’s Ján Kuciak, killed for investigating corruption. Their families still wait for justice, while governments evade responsibility. CPJ observes that the pattern of impunity stretches from autocracies to democracies. This is proof that the failure to protect journalists is a global moral collapse, not a regional flaw.
This year’s global theme — ‘Chat GBV: Raising Awareness on AI-facilitated Gender-Based Violence against Women Journalists’ — captures a newer, more insidious front. Technology-facilitated gender-based violence has grown exponentially, with deepfakes, doxxing and algorithm-driven harassment used to discredit women and deter them from public life.
The anonymity of digital platforms, combined with the speed and scale of generative AI, has created a hostile environment where smear campaigns can spread worldwide within minutes and remain online indefinitely. Such abuse is not only psychological warfare but a deliberate attempt to push women out of journalism. When women journalists retreat from digital spaces, society loses voices essential to fair and diverse storytelling.
The picture is no less grim in Pakistan. Freedom Network’s impunity report for 2025 recorded a 60pc rise in attacks and legal actions against journalists between November 2024 and September 2025, documenting 142 cases nationwide. Government authorities were responsible in seven out of 10 incidents, while Islamabad and Punjab each accounted for 28pc of violations.
 
 

The Pakistan Press Foundation’s 2025 review corroborates this pattern, listing over 137 cases of threats, arrests, and assaults during the same period — including 35 physical attacks, eight arrests, and 22 cases under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act. Both groups warn that such actions are eroding the fragile gains once promised by Pakistan’s journalist-safety laws. Despite the early adoption of these laws, enforcement is weak and commissions largely dormant.
Until the state shows the will to investigate attacks credibly, reform Peca, and confront the online persecution of women journalists, impunity will remain the unspoken law of the land.

The inauguration of the Grand Egyptian Museum, or GEM, marks the end of a two-decade construction effort hampered by the Arab Spring uprisings, pandemic and wars in neighbouring countries.
“We’ve all dreamed of this project and whether it would really come true,” Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly told a press conference, calling the museum a “gift from Egypt to the whole world from a country whose history goes back more than 7,000 years”.
Spectators including President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi gathered late on Saturday before an enormous screen outside the museum, which projected images of the country’s most famous cultural sites as dancers in glittering pharaonic-style garb waved glowing orbs and sceptres.
 


‘New chapter’ for Egypt
They were accompanied by Egyptian pop stars and an international orchestra decked out in white beneath a sky lit with lasers, fireworks and hovering lights that formed into moving hieroglyphics.
 
 

By opening the museum, Egypt was “writing a new chapter in the story of this ancient nation’s present and future,” Sisi said at the
opening.
The audience included German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Tshisekedi, and the crown princes of Oman and Bahrain.
The museum’s most heavily promoted attraction is the expansive collection of treasures from Tutankhamun’s tomb, uncovered in 1922, including the boy-king’s golden burial mask, throne and sarcophagus, and thousands of other objects.
A colossal statue of Ramses II that sat for decades in a downtown Cairo square bearing the pharaoh’s name now adorns the grand entry hall.

In Gaza, 253 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed since October 2023 — more than those killed in the wars of Afghanistan, Vietnam, the Balkans, World War I, and World War II combined. Yet these killings remain mostly uninvestigated, unpunished, and unacknowledged by those responsible — a stark example of the impunity that allows attacks on journalists to continue.
Ten of those 253 were my colleagues at Al Jazeera Media Network. I still miss the voice of my colleague, Anas Al-Sharif, every morning from Gaza City — reporting on the humanitarian situation, talking to people every day. He was killed in a targeted attack on journalists near Al Shifa Hospital on August 10, 2025. He left behind a family who will forever be without a father, and a farewell letter that went viral — a heartbreaking tradition now common among Gaza’s journalists, who leave their last words in hospitals to be delivered to loved ones after their death.
 
 

No other media organisation has ever lost so many journalists in such a short time, in any single conflict. These are reporters and camerapersons who have been working under inhuman conditions for a prolonged period: bombed, starved, displaced, hunted, and threatened. Their killings are not accidents of war but deliberate state policy — and the whole world is watching it live on their phones.
Their work should be celebrated as heroic. Were it not for them, the world might never have known what has been happening in Gaza, since Israel allows no foreign journalists to enter unless embedded with the Israeli army and reporting under its scrutiny. It is still the case today, after the ceasefire agreement has entered in place.
Journalists have been inheriting gear from each other. When one is killed, the next takes their vest and resumes their work — sometimes on the same day, reporting on the killing of their colleague while wearing that very vest. One particular vest is now being worn by a third journalist, after two were consecutively killed wearing it. They know the risk they face, yet they continue — driven by duty to tell the world their people’s stories, and by the conviction that their lives as Palestinians are already under threat, so they might as well use the time left to make a difference.
I remember our first loss in Gaza in December 2023: Samer Abu Daqqa. He was killed while documenting the aftermath of an airstrike. Wounded and trapped, he bled for hours as medics were blocked from reaching him. We kept pleading with the world on all platforms to save him. We knew he was still alive. When colleagues later recovered his camera, it was still recording — smoke and silence filling the final frame.
His death turned Al Jazeera’s newsroom into a mourning hall and sent a clear message: journalists in Gaza were now deliberate targets, exactly like April 8, 2003 when our newsroom turned into a mourning hall as we lost our colleague Tarek Ayyoub, killed in a US airstrike on Baghdad, Iraq. The aim is always the same: to silence the voice of the truth.
In Palestine, this impunity had begun way before the genocidal war on Gaza — when my colleague and friend Shireen Abu Akleh was killed by a sniper in May 2022 while reporting from the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. She was a dual Palestinian-American citizen. Dozens of investigations proved, time and again, that she was targeted — yet there were no consequences. That lack of accountability allowed Israel to continue and intensify its killing of journalists without fear of repercussions. It has even gone further, labelling journalists as “terrorists” to justify their murder.
Sadly, some media organisations echoed this propaganda, betraying their own profession by failing to verify Israel’s claims. The dehumanisation of Palestinians by the media extended to Palestinian journalists, who were not considered “white” enough to be defended in the name of “universal” human rights.
If the community of journalists does not defend its own — regardless of colour, race, nationality, ethnicity, or religion — then Israel’s war on journalists will inevitably become a war on journalism itself. If this massacre is allowed to continue in Gaza today, unpunished and unaccounted for, it can happen anywhere, anytime, again.
Silence is complicity.
Silence is complicity.

The LHC bench held earlier this year that such cases should ordinarily be heard by a single judge.
The IHC’s detailed order, authored by Justice Mohammed Azam Khan in a criminal appeal, elaborates the constitutional and statutory basis for assigning National Accountability Bureau (NAB)-related cases to division benches of two or more judges.
“Proceedings under the National Acco­untability Ordi­nance are not routine writs or criminal matters; they concern institutional accountability, protection of public money and constitutional guarantees of fair trial,” the ruling emphasised.
The court argued that accountability proceedings involve complex constitutional and statutory questions of public importance and therefore require adjudication by more than one judge to ensure consistency, fairness, and institutional confidence.

IHC mandates division benches for NAB cases, contradicts LHC ruling

The judgement examined Article 192 of the Constitution, which it said empowers each High Court to frame rules for distributing business between single judges and larger benches.
 
 

The IHC observed that the NAO, as a special law dealing with public office holders, falls into a category of cases with statutory intricacy or greater public consequence that warrants the scrutiny of more than one judge.
Referring to Article 192 and the Islamabad High Court (Procedure) Rules, the bench stated that the jurisdictional assignment of NAO cases to a division bench is a “constitutional safeguard intended to maintain judicial balance, avoid inconsistency, and uphold the integrity of the accountability process.”
The court also addressed Section 32 of the NAO, which specifies that appeals from accountability courts must go before a division bench. It said this provision reflects the legislature’s intent for higher judicial scrutiny, supporting the principle that all proceedings under the ordinance should be similarly handled.
This interpretation, however, is in direct contrast to an April ruling from the LHC’s Rawalpindi bench, delivered by Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Tariq Mahmood Bajwa.
The judges held that constitutional petitions should be heard by a single judge, citing court rules that allow it unless a law expressly mandates otherwise. They argued that Section 32 of the NAO only authorises division benches for appeals from final judgements, not for initial petitions.
They said that bypassing single judges for such petitions deprived litigants of their right to appeal and contravened Article 10A of the Constitution.

The landmark ruling by Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas settles a long-standing jurisdictional dispute between the two federal regulators and clarifies that the CCP holds statutory authority to ensure fair competition in all sectors, including telecommunications.
The judgement was issued on Saturday in a series of writ petitions filed by major mobile network operators — Jazz, Telenor, Zong and Ufone — challenging the CCP’s show-cause notices and inquiries. The companies had argued that since the telecom industry is already regulated by the PTA under the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organisation) Act, 1996, the CCP could not exercise parallel oversight.
Rejecting this argument, Justice Minhas held that the Competition Act, 2010 gives the CCP exclusive jurisdiction to regulate market competition across all sectors of the economy, without exception.

Court says CCP should act against anti-competitive practices instead

He observed that the PTA’s functions are limited to licensing, tariff approval, spectrum management, and technical regulation — not issues of market dominance or collusive behaviour.
 
 

“The PTA may regulate services, licensing, and technical compliance, but it is the Competition Commission that ensures fair play and prevents abuse of market power,” the judge wrote in his detailed verdict. “The existence of a sectoral regulator does not oust the jurisdiction of the CCP in enforcing the Competition Act.”
The court emphasised that the CCP’s jurisdiction covers all undertakings — whether in telecom, banking, energy, or manufacturing — and that no special exemption exists for telecom operators. Justice Minhas described the CCP as the “federal watchdog for fair competition,” responsible for protecting consumers and markets from anti-competitive conduct, price-fixing, and cartelisation.
He also clarified that the IHC had territorial jurisdiction over the matter since both the CCP and PTA are headquartered in federal capital and the impugned proceedings originated from the CCP’s Islamabad office.
 
 

During the hearings, the CCP argued that the telecom operators’ petitions were an attempt to evade lawful investigation into alleged market collusion and abuse of dominance.
The commission maintained that restricting such matters solely to the PTA would leave anti-competitive behaviour unchecked in the telecom sector.
Justice Minhas endorsed this view, noting that “the presence of a sector-specific regulator cannot create an enclave of immunity from general competition law”. He observed that Pakistan’s legislative framework, modelled on international best practices, envisions coexistence — not exclusion — between the CCP and other regulators.
Concluding the judgement, Justice Minhas reaffirmed that the CCP has the legal and constitutional mandate to regulate competitive behaviour in the telecom sector, while the PTA’s role remains confined to technical and operational regulation.

• Pakistan issues over 2,100 visas to Indian Sikh pilgrims
LARKANA: Amid a festive atmosphere, a special train carrying hundreds of devotees left Larkana on Saturday for Nankana Sahib to participate in the 556th birth anniversary celebrations of Baba Guru Nanak.
A large number of pilgrims from Larkana and Qambar-Shahdadkot districts — including men, women, elders, and children — boarded the special train, as Hindu Panchayat Chairman Harish Lal, along with other community leaders, bid them farewell at the Larkana Railway Station before its departure for Rohri.
Once the special train reaches Rohri, its bogies will be attached to another train bound for the destination.
The devotees are expected to return on November 7 after attending the birthday rituals of Guru Nanak.
 
 

According to the Railway Station Master, the special train carrying 234 devotees left for Rohri under strict security arrangements supervised by Station Master Ayaz Abbasi, with the assistance of district police and railway police.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government has finalised all arrangements for the celebrations taking place from Nov 3 to 6 at Nankana Sahib.
A high-level delegation, comprising Chairman Cabinet Committee on Law and Order Khawaja Salman Rafique, Provincial Minister for Minorities Affairs Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora, and Secretary Home Dr. Ahmad Javed Qazi, visited Nankana Sahib on Saturday to review the preparations.
 






Punjab Minister for Minorities Affairs Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora said the celebrations will begin with the Akhand Paath and culminate with the main event and Nagar Kirtan on November 5 at Gurdwara Janam Asthan.
He said around 30,000 pilgrims, including 2,100 from India, are expected, and all security and hospitality arrangements have been finalised.
Indian Sikh pilgrims have been issued visas  for Pakistan, the first major allowance after travel between the  arch-rival nations was frozen during conflict in May.
While there was no immediate response from New Delhi, Indian newspapers reported on  Saturday that the government would allow “selected” groups to travel for a 10-day festival to celebrate the founder of the Sikh faith.
The Pakistan High Commis­sion in New Delhi had issued “over 2,100 visas to Sikh pilgrims from India”.
Schools closed in Nankana
A three-day holiday has been declared for all schools and colleges in Nankana City from November 4 to 6, while Baba Guru Nanak University will remain closed from November 3 to 6 for the birth anniversary celebrations.
Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique said special hospital wards in Lahore and Faisalabad will be set up to facilitate Sikh pilgrims attending Guru Nanak’s birth celebrations.

• Fawad says leading efforts to pave way for dialogue, get PTI chief released from jail
LAHORE: After PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi was hospitalised in the provincial capital, three former PTI leaders arrived in his hospital room, ostensibly to convince the incarcerated party vice chairman to join their ‘release Imran Khan campaign’ — a move rebuffed by Mr Qureshi.
According to his lawyer Rana Mudassar Umer, former leaders Fawad Chaudhry, Imran Ismail, and Maulvi Mahmood managed to gain access to Mr Qureshi on Thursday when he was alone in his room.
“Shah Mahmood Qureshi was surprised to see them and immediately asked the police on duty to call his lawyer, who had left just a minute ago, and tell him some ‘guests’ had arrived,” Rana Mudassar said, adding by the time he got back, the ex-PTI leaders had already gone. He said the visitors stayed only a little over 10 minutes and left without any political discussion with Mr Qureshi.
The unannounced visit came after one of the three leaders was reportedly denied permission to meet Mr Qureshi.
Sources said the former PTI leaders have also attempted to give the impression that another PTI leader, Asad Umar, was also on board with their decision to launch an outreach campaign for Mr Khan’s release. Mr Umar, however, said he was not part of this group. He said he advised the trio against the hospital visit, as it would create friction in the party, while Mr Qureshi’s family would also be disturbed.
“I am not part of this campaign…a group of politicians is trying to highlight,” he told Dawn. The former PTI leader also clarified his stance in a tweet.
“Though any effort for the release of Imran Khan and other jailed leaders is good, but I am not part of the newly launched ‘Release Imran Khan’ campaign,” he said, adding that he learned from newspapers that he was a part of this campaign led by some former party leaders.
 






Paving way for dialogue
On the other hand, ex-PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry, in a video message, said they were trying to bring the political temperature down in the country and make the release of Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi possible, besides getting the right of bail for political prisoners acknowledged in the country.
He said they were trying to create an environment in which a dialogue could take place. “The political temperature can come down in the country only if the PTI takes one step back and the government takes a step forward.”
He claimed that he had also met Ejaz Chaudhry and other leaders and was happy that they too agreed that the political temperature should come down in the country. He said his group members would meet PML-N senior ministers as well as Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
 


Mr Qureshi’s lawyer, however, termed the remarks by Fawad Chaudhry “deception” and said the former PTI leader did not even visit the incarcerated PTI leadership in the Kot Lakhpat jail, either on Thursday or Friday. The jail trial continued from 10:30am to 4:30pm, he said, questioning the motive behind the hospital trip.
He said PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed and Omer Sarfraz Cheema were united and standing by Imran Khan, who had repeatedly announced that he would not make any deals with the establishment or the government and would fight his cases on legal grounds.
 
 

Besides Mr Qureshi, who is expected to undergo a surgical procedure for gallbladder stones next week, Omer Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed were also hospitalised. According to sources, the home department and jail administration were not offering proper medical services to the incarcerated leaders in Kot Lakhpat jail.
The lawyer said the courts had been ordering the shifting of Qureshi to the hospital for the past six weeks, but the administration was not complying with the directives. Eventually, he said, Mr Qureshi underwent two check-ups and was advised to be admitted to the hospital.
“Qureshi is undergoing different lab tests and is expected to be operated upon during the next week,” the lawyer stated.
He also claimed that Dr Yasmin Rashid was also denied regular physiotherapy sessions despite her medical condition.

KHADIM Hussain

WITH winter setting in across the valley, the nights have turned a little frigid.
On the eastern side of the city, near the mountains of the Koh-i-Mehrdar, lies Marriabad — a Hazara neighbourhood located just outside the cantonment’s boundary walls.
Men and women from the Hazara community can be seen there walking in the evenings, as it is a popular spot for hiking.
Others also frequent the vicinity, to escape the otherwise mundane and hectic city life.
At the foot of the mighty Mehrdar peaks, stands Master Khadim Hussain’s garden of trees, which he has tended virtually single-handedly for years.
Entering this ‘urban forest’ and walking through the trees and plants he has planted, one can feel the air growing pleasantly cool.

Master Khadim Hussain calls this labour of love ‘Gulzar-i-Bakulo’, or ‘Garden of Senior Citizens’, after the men who came together to plant it

When we visit, Hussain is resting on a narrow Persian rug in the middle of his garden, clad in shalwar-kameez and a blue jacket.
“Master” is a euphemism used in Balochistan for teachers, as Hussain is a 66-year-old retired schoolteacher.
In his own words, he is “66 years young”, because most of his friends who helped plant these trees have either passed away, or are too old to work now.
Hussain is left now alone to tend to the garden, which he treats “like my children,” he tells Dawn.
A father of six, two of his children live abroad. Hussain himself recently returned from Finland, where he spent three months with his daughter, who is also a teacher.
“During Musharraf’s rule, some 17 or 18 years ago, a tube well was set up over here,” he recalls, while pointing to towards the end of the treeline.
“So we, a group of 15 Hazaras, came up with idea of planting trees as volunteers to fight climate change even though Balochistan has no role in causing it, since there are hardly any industries here,” he adds.
“I was the youngest among them, and I agreed to join them as well because I was involved in social work too. So I started planting trees after being given one connection from the tube well.”
When the Covid-19 pandemic struck, it claimed the lives of five of Hussain’s elderly colleagues.
He can recall their names on his fingertips — those who were at the forefront of the initiative — and it is in their honour that he has called this bastion of calm ‘Gulzar-i-Bakulo’, or ‘Garden of Senior Citizens’.
When asked why they chose to plant trees here, away from the main settlements of Quetta, Hussain recounts the tragic story behind the idea.
“Ten years ago, when Hazara killings were at their worst, our community became ghetto-ised into Marriabad and Hazara Town.”
He notes that some parts of Quetta had become a “no-go area” for the Hazara community.
 
 

“So we came up with idea to create this place so that our people could come out of the ghetto, breathe fresh air, and find mental relief.”
He says that he loves the trees and the mountains beside them and also it’s a place where there is calm.
“I spend my days here, from 10 in the morning till 8 in the evening. I don’t need doctors. I’ve never been ill. The garden keeps me healthy.”
He has other reasons to spend most of his time with the trees, including the seven cats he is taking care of, away from the human settlements.
This summer, before leaving for Finland, he entrusted the garden to his friends, asking them to water it in his absence.
“They promised they would,” he says. “But when I returned, I found some of the trees dry. They had come only for a few days. The garden was abandoned.”
After a brief silence, he nostalgically recalls his past: “I am 66 now, but I’ve had an unhappy childhood. My parents divorced when I was young, and both remarried. I was their only son, and they left me. I started life from nothing, without even a roof over my head.”
He adds: “I got up on my feet. Today, I water these plants to give shelter to people and birds that come here.”
Once again, after a moment’s silence, Hussain wonders who will take care of his garden once he is no more.

Officials said that adequate arrangements had been made both at the immigration offices and at the exit-zero point to facilitate the return of stranded families, who had been impatiently waiting for the border to reopen since Oct 12.
They added that Afghan nationals holding temporary identity or registration cards, as well as those without any such documents, were allowed to return to their homeland.
However, Afghan nationals possessing valid visas in their passports were not permitted to go beyond the Michni check post. Officials said that the focus was on first easing the burden by sending back “illegal” aliens, while legal cross-border movement would be resumed at an appropriate time.
Local sources said that the majority of the families which were stranded in Jamrud and Landi Kotal were deported from different parts of Punjab prior to the closure of the border.
The local administration had arranged temporary accommodations for returning Afghan families at the NLC terminal in Jamrud and at safe roadside locations in Landi Kotal. Most of these families had been staying inside the vehicles they had hired for their journey back, with very limited resources.
It was also learnt that the Pakistani authorities on Saturday allowed empty vehicles, which had earlier transported returning families of refugees to Afghanistan and became stranded on the Afghan side following the sudden border closure on Oct 12, to return.
The return of families continued late into Saturday, with officials stating that the process would continue in the coming days.

Hamid Khan group won one seat and an independent candidate claimed the remaining position.
As per the unofficial tally, Abdul Rehman Har Bajwa emerged as the top scorer with 1,369 votes, followed closely by Raja Aleem Abbasi with 1,351 votes, Chaudhry Hafeezullah Yaqoob 1,295 votes, Mohammad Zafar Khokhar 1,288 votes and Asif Irfan 1,126 votes.
The candidates backed by the government — Abdul Rehman Har Bajwa, Raja Aleem Abbasi and Asif Irfan — were declared successful.
Chaudhry Hafeezullah Yaqoob, representing the Hamid Khan group, also secured a seat while Mohammad Zafar Khokhar won as an independent candidate.
A total of 21 candidates contested the elections. Under the rules, five candidates securing the highest number of votes are declared members of the bar council.
 
 

As soon as the results were announced, supporters of the winning candidates celebrated their victory on the court premises. They beat drums, chanted slogans and distributed sweets among colleagues and friends.
The polling was held at the Judicial Complex, where 20 polling stations were set up. To ensure transparency and fairness, 20 judges were appointed as returning officers for the electoral process.
Voting began at 9am and continued until 4pm with a one-hour break. Despite the high turnout and intense competition, the election process remained peaceful with no untoward incidents reported.
Strict security arrangements were in place throughout the day with law enforcement personnel deployed at the polling venues to maintain order and facilitate smooth conduct of the elections.
The bar council elections are considered an important indicator of lawyers’ political alignments and often reflect broader trends in national legal politics with the government and opposition-backed groups vying for influence within the legal fraternity.

“Now don’t ask all these questions. Ask such things in private,” he said while responding in an interview on Samaa TV show ‘Mere Sawal’ on Friday, when asked to confirm whether Pakistan had conducted the missile test or not.
The question came in the wake of a “rare lenticular cloud formation” observed over Quetta in the early hours of Tuesday that left the public puzzled over the phenomenon and its origins.
When asked about the matter earlier this week, Asif had dismissed the online chatter of a hypersonic ballistic missile test as mere speculation.
 
 

Citizens had reported sighting the phenomenon around morning prayers from many parts of Balochistan and speculation was rife about the likely cause. Many social media accounts hinted that the cloud formation was the result of a missile test or a new technology tested by the military.
In a post on X later in the day, the Pakistan Meteorological Department said the sight was a “lenticular cloud formation” which was observed early morning over the Koh-i-Murdar region.
“The cloud appeared before sunrise, persisted for approximately 20 minutes, and dissipated just prior to sunrise.”
 






As per the United Kingdom’s Met Office, lenticular clouds are lens-shaped orographic wave clouds that are formed when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.
“These strange, unnatural-looking clouds sometimes form downwind of hills or mountains … They look a lot like the traditional shape of flying saucers in science fiction, and real lenticular clouds are believed to be one of the most common explanations for UFO (unidentified flying object) sightings across the world,” it said.</p><small>2025-11-02 02:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02072653830c7d4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952669/israel-strikes-gaza-claims-returned-bodies-not-of-prisoners' target='_blank'><strong>Israel strikes Gaza, claims returned bodies ‘not of prisoners’</strong></a><br><p>• Hamas insists Tel Aviv declined offer to provide samples for testing
• Says warships opened fire towards shores of Khan Yunis
JERUSALEM: Israel claimed on Saturday that three bodies it received from Gaza the night before were not prisoners held in the Palestinian territory, as a Hamas security source reported fresh strikes in the south.
Despite occasional flare-ups, a fragile truce has been holding in Gaza since Oct 10, based on a US-brokered deal centred on the return of all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead.
Israel’s military told AFP that a forensic analysis revealed that three bodies it received via the Red Cross on Friday were not those of any of the deceased captives still to be handed over as part of the ceasefire deal.
 
 

Hamas’s armed wing said on Saturday that it had handed over bodies it had not positively identified, saying that Israel had declined its offer to provide samples for testing and “demanded the bodies for examination”.
“We handed them over to pre-empt any enemy claims,” the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said.
After the start of the truce, Hamas returned the 20 surviving prisoners still in its custody and began the process of returning the remains of the dead.
Of the 17 bodies returned since the start of the ceasefire, 15 were Israelis, one was Thai and one was Nepalese.
Israel has accused Hamas of not returning the dead prisoners quickly enough, but the Palestinian group says it will take time to locate remains buried in Gaza’s ruins.
In its statement on Saturday, the Al-Qassam Brigades called on mediators and the Red Cross to provide the “necessary equipment and personnel to work on recovering all the bodies simultaneously”.
Hamas and Israel, meanwhile, have traded accusations of breaking the ceasefire.
A Hamas security source told AFP on Saturday that Israel had carried out several air strikes in the south at dawn, and that “warships opened fire towards the shores of Khan Yunis”.
Earlier in the week, the Israeli military launched its deadliest night of bombing since the truce after one of its soldiers was killed in south Gaza, with the territory’s civil defence agency reporting more than 100 people killed.

Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed early on Friday morning to continue a ceasefire between the two countries following a rapid deterioration of ties and a brief conflict along their shared border last month.
The Istanbul talks followed a sharp escalation in tensions that saw Pakistan launch Oct 9 airstrikes on Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan sanctuaries in Afghanistan, triggering Oct 11 border clashes that continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on Oct 18-19. The Istanbul agreement came after days of deadlock that nearly brought the process to a halt, with mediators pulling both delegations back to the table even as Pakistan’s team had already begun preparations to return home.
Meanwhile, an uneasy peace persists between Pakistan and India after their May conflict earlier this year that led to a United States-brokered ceasefire. Since then, Indian political and military leadership, including chiefs of the military branches, have continued to make aggressive statements, repeating terrorism allegations that Pakistan has repeatedly refuted and also warning of “geographical changes” in the course of any future conflict.
“If there is a need for evidence, then we have it, about what involvement India has in terrorism [in Pakistan] and how it wants to keep us busy on two fronts: the eastern and western,” said the defence minister while talking to Geo News today.
He added that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “silenced” after the defeat dealt to India during the May conflict and expressed hope that talks with Afghanistan would reach a reasonable conclusion.
“Everyone is onboard — politicians, the establishment and the Pakistani nation — that an immediate solution to the Afghanistan issue is very necessary, which is that terrorism from Afghan soil should be completely stopped,” said the minister in reference to the country’s western neighbour.
Asif said the preferable solution would be for both states to maintain a civilised relationship.
The second round of negotiations with Afghanistan produced a three-point understanding — the continuation of the ceasefire, the establishment of a monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace, and penalties for violations.
The operational details of that mechanism are expected to be finalised when the “principals”, senior representatives from both sides, meet again in Istanbul on Thursday.
Earlier today, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that a fisherman from Pakistan was arrested by the Indian Coast Guard and was coerced into carrying out tasks for the neighbouring country’s intelligence agency.
A few days ago, Asif had stated that India was waging a “low-intensity” war against Pakistan from Afghanistan, adding that New Delhi was trying to “settle the score” after facing defeat in the four-day conflict with Islamabad in May.
Information ministry rejects Mujahid’s remarks about deporting security threats
Separately, the information ministry rubbished remarks by Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid about details of a prisoner exchange scheme in the Istanbul talks.
Ariana News reported that he claimed Pakistani was informed in the talks that the Islamic Emirate was willing to deport people Islamabad considered a security threat but Pakistan did not accept the offer.
It added that he said that Pakistan requested the Afghan side to control such people within Afghanistan instead of deporting them.
Responding to the development, the information ministry said it “rejects deliberate twisting of facts” by Mujahid.
“Pakistan had demanded that terrorists in Afghanistan posing a threat to Pakistan be controlled or arrested. When the Afghan side said that they were Pakistani nationals, Pakistan immediately proposed that they be handed over through designated border posts, consistent with Pakistan’s long-standing position.
“Any claim to the contrary is false and misleading.”
 






Asif also slammed the “malicious and misleading” comments by Mujahid, saying: “Let it be categorically stated that there exists complete unanimity of views among all Pakistanis, including the country’s political and military leadership, regarding Pakistan’s security policies and its comprehensive approach toward Afghanistan.”

Chaudhry, who had remained in jail for months after the removal of the PTI government in April 2022, after his release, had condemned the May 9 violent protests by the party’s supporters and, through a post on X on May 24, 2024, had himself announced to part ways with former premier Imran Khan.
The PTI had “completely disassociated” itself from him in December 2024, stating that he was not authorised to issue statements to the media or participate in TV talk shows on behalf of the party.
Talking to Dawn on Saturday in his hometown of Jhelum, Chaudhry said: “I am a politician by birth and I believe in a political solution to political issues. Confrontation and endless confrontation see no light at the end of the tunnel.”
 
 

The former information minister said that he had categorically pointed out during the early days of turmoil that the current party leadership did not have the ability to secure Imran’s freedom, and his remarks were bitterly criticised.
Chaudhry said that winning Imran’s freedom was always his main concern, and that’s why he was again forced to issue a statement that the path of reconciliation, shunning confrontation and “giving a shut-up call to the self-centred social media working from offshore destinations” was the panacea to the party’s current ills.
He said that many party leaders who met Imran in jail agreed, and “those who matter in PML-N, they also have the same line of thinking”. Chaudhry said that engaging with the government and establishment was the need of the hour, and he reiterated that he was making sincere efforts to find a political solution.
The former PTI spokesperson said he had advocated his position about pursuing engagement over confrontation in a meeting with Imran in Adiala Jail.
He remarked that those who were raising the political temperature from the PTI’s end on social media were doing no favours to the party and were jeopardising the party’s future for their own interests.
Chaudhry further said that the operators of the party’s social media accounts were no doubt attracting viewership by “airing volatile controversies and by playing with the emotions of the party workers”, but he said this was not the way and not appropriate to pave the path for Imran’s release.
He said the PTI was a political party and it had a future to engage in politics at the national level, adding that “pouring fuel on the fire with every new attractive video or so-called analysis” was shrinking political space at the national level.
When asked if he was still in the PTI, Chaudhry instantly replied, “If I were out of PTI, I would have been a minister like many who deserted Khan during hard times.“
Chaudhry’s remarks come in the wake of reports from Daily Ausaf and The Express Tribune that said, citing sources, senior politicians who were part of the PTI’s “old leadership” were planning to relaunch a political movement calling for Imran’s release.
The media reports had claimed that Chaudhry and Asad Umar, former Sindh governor Imran Ismail, former MNA Mahmood Moulvi, and ex-Punjab Assembly speaker Sibtain Khan were expected to lead the initiative once released. All of them, except for Sibtain, had parted ways with the PTI following the May 9 riots.
According to the ET report, sources said the veteran leaders intended to bring on board other experienced political figures from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh. “The movement will pick up real pace after Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s release, when the old guard will be seen back in active political action,” a report quoted a source as saying.
The reports came after Chaudhry and Ismail posted near-identical statements on X yesterday, saying they had not only met Qureshi, who was hospitalised recently, but also party leadership and workers imprisoned at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail.
PTI’s Sheikh Waqas rubbishes notion of old leaders leading any effort
Meanwhile, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram downplayed the reports of the ex-party stalwarts playing any role to play in the future in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’.
“This is not a new thing that [news] comes about, such people who left the party. In the last year, there have been many attempts to sell this narrative from such characters, and it has not gotten any support.
“Such attempts were also made at Adiala … but there was no support for such narratives from Khan’s side, and I think when they were disappointed from there and saw the mood ahead of Sohail Afridi becoming the chief minister, so they [turned] towards Kot Lakpat.”
He said there were a “few people who want to remain relevant because they are not part of any party anymore”. “Everyone has a shop to sell, but that has no link or impact on our party,” he said.
Questioned about an opinion in the party to lower the political temperature, Akram resolutely said: “There is only one thinking in the PTI: whatever Imran Khan says, will happen.

The man was charged with participating in a criminal terrorist organisation and financing a terrorist enterprise, the National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor’s Office (PNAT) said.
The suspect, who was arrested in Lyon last week, was placed in pre-trial detention.
“He is suspected of having been in contact with IS-K (Islamic State in Khorasan),” the anti-terrorism unit said.
The man is suspected of “sending funds” and helping translate and relay “the propaganda of this terrorist organisation”, PNAT added.
The IS-K, the militant group’s branch in Afghanistan, also operates in Pakistan and former Soviet countries in Central Asia, including Uzbekistan.
The group has been responsible for deadly attacks in Afghanistan and Russia, including an attack on a Moscow concert hall in March 2024 that killed 150 people.
According to French daily Le Parisien, the Afghan, who arrived in France several years ago, was arrested by officers from the DGSI domestic intelligence agency when he was already in an administrative detention centre in Lyon.
Le Parisien said that the suspect, already under investigation for glorifying terrorism, was editing and disseminating extremist propaganda on TikTok and Snapchat social networks.
France has been repeatedly targeted by extremist attackers over the past decade, often by individuals inspired by Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State group.</p><small>2025-11-01 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631638-portfolios-assigned-to-newly-appointed-13-member-kp-cabinet' target='_blank'><strong>Portfolios assigned to newly appointed 13-member KP cabinet</strong></a><br><p>

The stampede occurred as worshippers crowded into the Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple in the city of Srikakulam on Ekadashi, a day Hindus consider auspicious, said Pawan Kalyan, the state’s deputy chief minister.
“An inquiry will be conducted into the tragic incident,” Kalyan said in a statement, adding that the temple was run by private individuals. He put the death toll at nine.
Andhra Pradesh Governor S. Abdul Nazeer expressed his “profound grief on the death of nine pilgrims in the stampede”.
As many as 25,000 devotees crowded into the temple, which can accommodate only about 2,000, leading to the crush, state minister Anam Ramanarayana Reddy added, while district officials have been told to provide the injured with medical help.
A total of 18 injuries have been reported so far, the collector and magistrate of Srikakulam district Swapnil Dinkar Pundkar said, while two critically injured patients have been moved to a tertiary care hospital for treatment.
The government will pay compensation of $2,300 to the families of the dead, and $570 to the injured, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on X.
Modi gave his condolences to those “who have lost their near and dear ones”. “I pray that the injured recover soon,” Modi added.
 






Deadly stampedes and crowd crushes are a common occurrence at big Indian gatherings and religious festivals.
In September, at least 36 people were killed after a stampede broke out at a campaign rally of popular actor-turned-politician Vijay in Tamil Nadu state.
And in June, a sudden crowd surge at a Hindu festival in the coastal state of Odisha triggered a stampede that killed at least three people and injured several others.
The previous month, six people were crushed to death in the western state of Goa after thousands gathered for a popular fire-walking ritual.
In January, at least 30 people were killed in an early morning crush at the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu mega-festival in the northern city of Prayagraj.</p><small>2025-11-01 15:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/01191608d1c08d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952570/portfolios-assigned-to-kps-all-male-13-member-cabinet' target='_blank'><strong>Portfolios assigned to KP’s all-male, 13-member cabinet</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government assigned portfolios to the newly formed 13-member all-male provincial cabinet on Saturday.
The 13-member provincial cabinet picked by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi took the oath of office a day ago in Peshawar.
Many on social media were quick to point out that the new KP government lacked female representation.
A notification issued today from the Cabinet Wing of the KP government’s Administration Department said CM Afridi assigned the following portfolios to the 13 members:
Provincial ministers:

Meena Khan Afridi — local government, elections and rural development
Arshad Ayub Khan — elementary and secondary education
Fazal Shakoor Khan — public health engineering
Amjad Ali — housing
Aftab Alam Afridi — law, parliamentary affairs and human rights
Syed Fakhar Jehan — excise, taxation and narcotics control
Riaz Khan — irrigation
Khaleequr Rehman — health
Aqibullah Khan — relief, rehabilitation and settlement
Faisal Khan Tarakai — labour

Aides

Muzzammil Aslam — finance adviser
Taj Muhammad — sports and youth affairs adviser
Shafiullah Jan — special assistant to the chief minister on information and public relations

 






Afridi — who was elected the new provincial chief executive last month — had previously insisted that he would announce his team after meeting incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
However, after repeated attempts to meet the former premier were unsuccessful, Imran’s sister told the newly appointed chief minister he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet.
Opposition members in the KP Assembly were criticising the ruling PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers had also voiced the fear that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
The PTI’s provincial chapter had previously also insisted that members of the previous cabinet with “corruption allegations and bad reputation” should not be part of the new one.</p><small>2025-11-01 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631629-former-sindh-chief-minister-aftab-shaban-mirani-passes-away' target='_blank'><strong>Former Sindh chief minister Aftab Shaban Mirani passes away</strong></a><br><p>

Addressing a press conference in Islamabad alongside Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhary, Tarar said that the Indian media was creating a false narrative in the aftermath of the four-day May conflict with Pakistan.
The minister said that law enforcement agencies had recently apprehended a fisherman named Ijaz Mallah while he was out fishing in the sea.
“In September this year, when he was out fishing, he was arrested by the Indian Coast Guard and after the arrest, he was taken to an undisclosed location and was coerced and forced to do some tasks for the Indian intelligence agency,” he said.
 






“He was told that he would be compensated and if he did not comply, he would have to stay imprisoned for two to three years,” the minister said.
“So this common fisherman was eventually released by the Indian intelligence agency and was sent to Pakistan on a task to procure certain things … which included uniforms of the Pakistan Navy, the Pakistan Army and of Sindh Rangers,” he added.
“He was tasked to procure uniforms with certain nametags, and certain fittings and measurements because this was part of a bigger plan of the Indian intelligence agency to launch a propaganda warfare against Pakistan,” Tarar said, showing pictures of items allegedly recovered from the fisherman.

The minister said that Pakistan’s intelligence agencies were well-equipped to deal with any situation, and put the fisherman in question under surveillance while he tried to procure the items.
“While he was under surveillance, our law enforcement agencies were fully alert and following his trail. He was also told to get Pakistani currency, cigarettes, match boxes, lighters and was asked to specifically procure Zong SIM cards,” he said.
“He procured all these items and he was on his way to India when law enforcement agencies apprehended him from the sea, arrested him and took these items into custody,” the minister said.
“Let me make it very clear that Pakistan intelligence agencies and security agencies are always fully alert and diligent in their duty […] and ready to foil any conspiracy,” Tarar said, after playing a purported video of the arrested fisherman.
The minister noted, “This particular activity could be linked to the naval exercise being carried out by the Indian navy in the Kutch or Gujarat area, the Bujh area. Maybe this was a conspiracy to link this activity to those exercises. This is one possibility.”
 
 

He added that the government was placing the evidence before the entire world so India’s “nefarious designs could be exposed”.
Tarar highlighted that not only were the said items recovered, but the man’s statement was “legally on record”.
“This is part of a greater plan by India to malign Pakistan and to use such propaganda items and disinformation and misinformation, and we have been very active countering the misinformation and disinformation by the Indian media and Indian state,” the minister said.
“Now this is a glaring example of the extent the Indian state is going to to malign Pakistan because they are not able to digest the successes of Pakistan,” he said.
“So this is the kind of propaganda warfare that they resort to, and detailed investigations have been carried out,” he said, adding that Mallah had also confessed to his crimes.
The information minister also highlighted that whenever state elections are about to take place in India, they “try to prepare for those elections well in advance”. He termed the arrest and the foiling of the “conspiracy” a big success for Pakistan’s security agencies.
“After Kulbhushan Yadav, they are now resorting to common fishermen because they can’t risk sending their commissioned officers in the guise of businessmen,” Tarar quipped, referring to an Indian spy caught in 2016 in Balochistan.
 
 

“After this fisherman was caught, maybe they will lower their level further because their capacity will no longer be there to penetrate inside Pakistan,” he added.
The press conference also included foreign media correspondents. After Tarar, Chaudhry briefed the media on the incident’s details in Urdu.
He also said that Pakistani agencies had evidence of the transactions worth “RS95,000” that took place between Indian officials and the fisherman. It was unclear whether Chaudhry was referring to Indian or Pakistani rupees.
The minister of state urged the public to remain vigilant and not be used by someone under pressure or out of greed.
During the press conference, the ministers also played an audio recording allegedly of Mallah and his “Indian handler”, which was recovered via forensics of the fisherman’s mobile phone.
In the purported audio, the person tells Mallah to secure two sets each of uniforms worn by the Sindh Rangers, the Pakistan Navy and the Pakistan Army. He also says he had specified “six names” — two from each of the three security branches — for nametags that Mallah was supposed to procure.
Accepted offer due to fear of jail and for reward: fisherman
The minister then proceeded to play a purported video of the fisherman, in which the man said he was apprehended by the Indian coast guards when he went fishing in August this year.
 


In the video, the man identified as Mallah detailed that he hailed from the Shah Bandar taluka of Sindh’s Thatta district, with fishing being a family profession.
“After catching me, they (Indian coast guards) took me to a jail in an undisclosed location, where I was interrogated by an Indian secret agency’s official,” he said.
The man added that the Indian official told him he could face two to three years in jail for the offence he was held. “He (the official) told me that if I worked for them, then they could let me go,” Mallah said.
“He also offered me money and gifts, so due to the fear of jail and for the reward, I accepted the offer … then he told me that bring so and so items, some uniforms of Rangers, coast guard, the navy and the army,” he added.
 
 

“We also need three Zong SIMs, bring those, and three bills from a mobile shop,” the fisherman quoted the Indian official as saying. The official also instructed him to bring Pakistan-made cigarettes, match boxes and lighters, as well as currency notes of Rs50 and Rs100, Mallah added.
The fisherman said he was set free by the Indian agency, after which he returned to Pakistan and collected the said items. He claimed he sent a picture of those items to an Indian intelligence officer named Ashok Kumar.
“After that, I headed towards the sea in October but was arrested by Pakistani security and other individuals with them,” Mallah said.</p><small>2025-11-01 12:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631615-asif-expects-positive-outcome-from-qatar-turkiye-led-mediation-amid-pak-afghan-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>Asif expects positive outcome from Qatar-Turkiye-led mediation amid Pak-Afghan tensions</strong></a><br><p>
