<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/07122503229cd92.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947207/france-pm-in-final-effort-to-salvage-cabinet' target='_blank'><strong>France PM in final effort to salvage cabinet</strong></a><br><p>France’s President Emmanuel Macron faced growing pressure on Tuesday to resign or hold a snap parliamentary election to end political chaos that has forced the resignation of five prime ministers in less than two years.
The 47-year-old centrist president has repeatedly said he will see out his second term, which ends in 2027.
But resignation calls, long confined to the fringes, have entered the mainstream during one of the worst political crises since the 1958 creation of the Fifth Republic, France’s current system of government.
On Tuesday, as Macron’s outgoing Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu held last-ditch talks to form a new government, his first premier in 2017, Edouard Philippe, said it was time for a new president to break the deadlock.
Speaking to RTL radio, Philippe said Macron should be “leaving in an orderly manner” to allow a way out of the crisis.
‘It’s a mess’
Political turmoil in the euro zone’s second largest economy was front page news across Europe at a time when US President Donald Trump is demanding the continent do more to shore up its own defences and aid Ukraine.
Markets have taken fright, with investors keeping a close eye on France’s ability to cut a yawning budget deficit. French stocks fell 1.4 per cent on Monday and the risk premium on French government bond yields rose to a nine-month high on the crisis.
“It’s a mess. It makes you sad,” said Brigitte Gries, a 70-year-old pensioner in Paris, summing up public consternation.
“We’re becoming a bit of a laughing stock around the world right now,” added taxi driver Soufiane Mansour in the southern city of Montpellier. “We’re a bit of a clown around the world and in Europe, unfortunately.”
Allies round on Macron
Philippe, whom polls show to be the best-placed candidate to lead the political centre in a succession battle, was the second of Macron’s former prime ministers to distance themselves from him in as many days.
Gabriel Attal, another erstwhile Macron loyalist, was blunt in his criticism. He was prime minister for a few months last year before Macron called a snap vote that delivered a hung parliament with three ideologically opposed blocs.
“Like many French people, I no longer understand the president’s decisions,” he said on TF1 TV, after Macron asked Lecornu, who had just tendered his resignation, to go back to opponents for last-gasp talks.
Lecornu, whose 14-hour-old administration was the shortest in modern French history, was given two days to find consensus.
Attal, however, ruled out calling for Macron to resign, someone who took part in a meeting of his parliamentary group said.
Far-right snub talks
Meanwhile, Lecornu held talks with leaders of Macron’s centrist alliance and conservatives, in which they agreed that finding a deal on next year’s budget was a priority.
He will need others, including the Socialists, on board to have the numbers needed to form a majority in the National Assembly — not least to pass a budget for next year.
Lecornu now plans to talk with the opposition in the afternoon and on Wednesday morning, but the far-right National Rally said they saw no point in those talks and would skip them.
Party chiefs Jordan Bardella and Marine Le Pen instead “reiterate their call for the dissolution of the National Assembly,” the RN said.
The RN tops opinion polls, but those surveys show a repeat election would likely produce another divided parliament, with no group holding a majority.</p><small>2025-10-07 13:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/071810271bc4099.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947245/russia-says-it-awaits-clarity-on-possible-us-supply-of-tomahawks-to-ukraine' target='_blank'><strong>Russia says it awaits clarity on possible US supply of Tomahawks to Ukraine</strong></a><br><p>Russia said on Tuesday it was waiting for clarity from the United States about the possible supply of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, saying such weapons could theoretically carry nuclear warheads.
US President Donald Trump said on Monday he would want to know what Ukraine planned to do with Tomahawks before agreeing to provide them because he did not want to escalate the war between Russia and Ukraine. He said, however, that he had “sort of made a decision” on the matter.
Asked about the comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “We understand that we need to wait, probably, for clearer statements, if any come.”
Peskov said that under Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, US practice had been to announce supplies of new weapons only once they had been delivered to Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in comments published on Sunday that if Washington supplied Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for long-range strikes deep into Russia, it would lead to the destruction of Moscow’s relationship with the US.
Peskov said it was important to realise that “if we abstract from various nuances, we’re talking about missiles that could also be nuclear-capable. Therefore, this is truly a serious round of escalation.”
Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 kilometres, so Ukraine would be able to use them to strike targets anywhere in European Russia, including Moscow, if Trump gave the go-ahead to supply them.</p><small>2025-10-07 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/071806411a550c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947244/jaguar-land-rover-to-resume-operations-at-select-uk-factories-after-cyberattack' target='_blank'><strong>Jaguar Land Rover to resume operations at select UK factories after cyberattack</strong></a><br><p>Britain’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), said on Tuesday some factories would restart manufacturing on Wednesday after an almost six-week shutdown following a cyberattack, one of the country’s most disruptive hacks.
To try to help smaller parts suppliers who have been pushed to the brink after weeks without business, JLR also announced it would be providing some companies with up-front cash for parts during the production restart phase.
The luxury carmaker, owned by India’s Tata Motors TAMO.NS, has three factories in Britain, which together produce about 1,000 cars per day, and economists had warned of the impact of a prolonged shutdown on the country’s manufacturing output.
High-profile hacks
JLR was the latest high-profile cyberattack target in Britain this year, and comes after one of the country’s major retailers, Marks & Spencer (MKS.L), lost about 300 million pounds (about $400 million) after a breach forced it to shut down its online shop for two months.
The incidents highlight the vulnerability of global business to increasingly sophisticated and more frequent attacks. Last month, a ransomware attack on check-in services left passengers stranded across major European airports.
JLR, which analysts estimated was losing around 50 million pounds per week from the shutdown, was provided with a 1.5 billion pound loan guarantee by the British government in late September to help it support its suppliers.
Business minister Peter Kyle said in a statement on Tuesday that his focus was on helping JLR resolve the incident and supporting the long-term health of the auto supply chain, which supports over 180,000 manufacturing jobs.
“This is very welcome news for workers and suppliers, but I know many are still under pressure, particularly further down the supply chain,” he said.
Phased restart
JLR said in a separate statement on Tuesday that for the three months to September 30, wholesale and retail volumes dropped 24.2% and 17.1%, respectively, reflecting the impact of the production stoppage, plus the planned wind-down of legacy Jaguar models and the effect of U.S. tariffs.
“It has been a challenging quarter for JLR,” JLR CEO Adrian Mardell said in a statement.
JLR said its engines and battery units would restart work on Wednesday, as well as parts of its vehicle production plant, including its body and paint shops, meaning the return of some of its 33,000 staff to work.
Production lines for the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport vehicles at its main factory in Solihull will start later this week, the company added.
Qualifying suppliers of parts used in the company’s just-in-time production lines will now be paid shortly after the point of order, JLR said, compared to a previous 60-day post-invoice arrangement, helping to allay fears that some smaller businesses could go bust.</p><small>2025-10-07 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0717141319912ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947237/pakistan-to-be-sold-advanced-us-air-to-air-missiles-by-raytheon' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to be sold advanced US air-to-air missiles by Raytheon</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan will be sold Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) by United States defence group Raytheon following a modification in the firm’s contract that included the country in the list of buyers, it emerged on Tuesday.
The US missiles are equipped on F-16 Falcons flown by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF).
A September 30 press release on the contracts issued by the US Department of War for the US Air Force said Raytheon was awarded a $41.6 million firm-fixed-price modification to a previously awarded contract for the enhanced C8 and D3 AMRAAM variants and their production.
It added that the modification brought the total cumulative face value of the contract to $2.5 billion from $2.47bn.
“Work will be performed at Tucson, Arizona, and is expected to be completed by May 30, 2030. This contract involves foreign military sales to United Kingdom, Poland, Pakistan, Germany, Finland, Australia, Romania, Qatar, Oman, Korea, Greece, Switzerland, Portugal, Singapore, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Japan, Slovakia, Denmark, Canada, Belgium, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Italy, Norway, Spain, Kuwait, Finland, Sweden, Taiwan, Lithuania, Isreal, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Turkey,” the contract said.
The May 7 contract for the AMRAAM deal had not included Pakistan as among the list of buyers for the missile.
The same missiles were reportedly used in February 2019, when the PAF conducted Operation Swift Retort and shot down two Indian Air Force (IAF) jets intruding into Pakistani airspace over Kashmir.
Pakistan had bought 700 AMRAAM in January 2007 in what was the largest international order for the weapon at the time.
 
 

The development comes amid improving ties between Pakistan and the US. Of late, it seems that Islamabad and Washington are in lockstep. The positive signals, which began emanating soon after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, seem to be turning into full-blown bonhomie with Pakistan entering a new phase in its economic and strategic partnership with the US.
From acknowledging Pakistan’s counterterror cooperation in the arrest of an IS-Khorasan operative to claiming credit for stopping a nuclear war in South Asia, the country has perhaps featured more in this US president’s day-to-day media interactions than any past ‘commander-in-chief’.
After securing what seems to be a major discount in tariff negotiations, attracting US investor interest in its oil and mineral reserves and signalling that its currency market is receptive to digital assets and cryptocurrencies, Pakistan seems to be in the driving seat as far as South Asia is concerned.</p><small>2025-10-07 13:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0717443144aa937.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947238/52-magnitude-quake-jolts-kps-swat-chitral-districts-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>5.2-magnitude quake jolts KP’s Swat, Chitral districts: PMD</strong></a><br><p>Jolts from an earthquake of magnitude 5.2 were felt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Chitral and Swat districts on Tuesday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
Today’s quake, measuring a depth of 138 kilometres, originated in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan at 4:36pm, the PMD said in a statement.
According to the United States Geological Survey, the quake measured 5.1 and the epicentre was located 9km south-southeast of Afghanistan’s Yangi Qala district.
 
 

The development comes just days after a 4.3-magnitude earthquake was recorded in the Pattan tehsil of KP’s Lower Kohistan district.
Earlier this month, a 3.2-magnitude tremor was felt in parts of Karachi, with its centre 7km northwest of the Malir area.
Residents of KP witnessed tremors multiple times in September; once when an earthquake measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale hit southeastern Afghanistan on September 1.
Days later, a 5.9-magnitude quake jolted several cities of KP — including Peshawar, Mansehra, Hangu, Abbottabad, Swat and Malakand — along with Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
On September 26, a quake of magnitude 5.5 centred in Afghanistan sent its tremors to various KP cities, including Chitral, Peshawar and Swat.</p><small>2025-10-07 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627419-president-zardari-ropes-in-naqvi-to-mediate-between-pml-n-ppp' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari 'ropes in' Naqvi to mediate between PML-N, PPP</strong></a><br><p>

The Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), with around 500 participants from over 44 countries, including Pakistan, attempted to break Israel’s siege on Gaza and distribute humanitarian aid to the malnourished and injured civilians suffering from two years of genocide in the enclave at the hands of Israel.
Former senator Khan’s words rang true from the very beginning of the mission, when two GSF aid boats were struck by incendiary devices in Tunisian waters. The ‘Family’ and ‘Alma’ boats, which held the steering committee of the aid convoy, were attacked on September 8 and 9.
The aid boats were attacked once again on September 23 near Crete; this time, there was international condemnation, with Italy, Spain and Turkiye dispatching warships to aid the boats. The attack damaged the ‘Family’ boat, and some participants had to leave the mission as they could not be accommodated on the other boats.
It is important to note that two days before the third attack, Israel’s official social media accounts had stamped the Hamas label on the aid boats. Tel Aviv had also demanded that the convoy unload its aid at the Ashkelon Marina port, while a post by the Israeli foreign ministry — in a taunting tone — asked if the mission was about “aid or provocation”.
Italy also urged the flotilla to drop its aid off at Cyprus, which would then be handed to the Catholic Church’s Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which would transport it to Gaza.
Reacting to their country’s recommendation, Italian volunteers on the GSF categorically rejected the notion of dropping aid in Cyprus. In a statement, they said that their mission stays “true to its original goal of breaking [Israel’s] illegal siege and delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged population of Gaza”.
It all culminated on October 1, when the boats were about 100 nautical miles from Gaza. Israeli navy intercepted and stormed the vessels, pointing guns and smashing cameras capturing the raid on a livestream.

“Hands up, every last one of you”, and “phones in the water” were some of the orders shouted at the volunteers by Israeli force members. The participants were smeared as “terrorists” by a state which has terrorised not only the people of Gaza, but civilians in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iran and Qatar.
Journalists, parliamentarians, human rights activists, doctors and other unarmed civilians made up the volunteers on the convoy. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, Nelson Mandela’s grandson Nkosi Zwelivelile and French Member of the European Parliament Rima Hassan were some of the more notable figures who took part in the humanitarian effort to reach Gaza.
Before Israeli forces intercepted the boats, the military’s drones were hovering over the aid vessels, and navy ships were conducting intimidating manoeuvres near the aid ships. The volunteers were subjected to water cannons, communication blackouts and threats over the radio in the late hours of Wednesday.

“You are instructed to change your course; any further attempts to sail towards Gaza endanger your safety and place you in an active warzone. If you proceed on your route, we will stop your boat and act to confiscate it through legal proceedings in court,” commanded an Israeli armed forces member with a prominent American accent, addressing Thiago Avila — an organiser on the flotilla — just moments before his vessel was intercepted.
The participants were in international waters when Israel took them captive. Photographs and videos emerged moments after the initial interception of about 13 of the boats, showing Greta Thunberg captured and sitting next to an Israeli soldier. The soldier very performatively gave Thunberg water and a flimsy coat.

Over the following days, all of the 42 aid boats were intercepted. However, one boat, the Mikeno, managed to come very close to Gaza and was about 9.3 miles away from the besieged enclave when Israeli forces intercepted it.
 






According to a statement issued by the GSF, the volunteers were taken to Ashdod Port, where they were “initially processed without legal counsel”. The statement also described the mistreatment suffered by the participants who were “zip-tied and forced to kneel for hours”.
The coalition said that the volunteers were shifted to Ktzi’ot Prison in the Negev desert, “where tribunal hearings began without notifying or allowing their lawyers to attend”.

Footage also surfaced of Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir pointing at the captured flotilla participants as they sat on the floor with their passports in front of them. Ben-Gvir accused the volunteers —who carried baby formula for the malnourished infants of Gaza— of terrorism.
“They did not come for help; they came for Gaza, for the terrorists. These are terrorists.”
The minister also stormed one of the seized boats and claimed not to have found any aid.

On October 5, Lebanese online magazine The Cradle published a post on X quoting Ben-Gvir as saying that he was “proud” of the maltreatment of the flotilla activists.
“I am proud that the flotilla activists are being treated as terrorists. This is my policy,“ the far-right minister was quoted as saying. “I am proud of the prison staff acting in accordance with the policy set by Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi and myself. I was on their ships; I saw neither aid nor humanity.”
Ben-Gvir added that he visited Ktzi’ot Prison and was “proud” of how the flotilla activists were treated as “supporters of terrorism”.
“Anyone who supports terrorism is a terrorist and deserves the same conditions applied to terrorists.”
 






Protests erupted worldwide with demonstrators demanding their governments take action to ensure the safe return of their captured civilians.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack on the Global Sumud Flotilla in a post on X.
“We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release. Their crime was to carry aid for the hapless Palestinian people,” he wrote.
 






In another post, the premier lauded the efforts of Pakistani volunteers onboard the flotilla, including ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan.
 






PM Shehbaz had faced backlash earlier for welcoming Trump’s 20-point peace plan. Subsequently, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, in a press conference, backtracked from the initial support for Trump’s plan and stated that the plan that was made public was not the same as the one discussed with Arab and Muslim leaders.
Dar announced in a post on X that the Pakistan government has been “actively engaged in diplomatic outreach, including through friendly countries, to ensure the safety and early return of all our nationals.”
Jamaat-e-Islami central emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman revealed that in a telephone conversation with PM Shehbaz, he urged “to accelerate efforts for the release and recovery of Mushtaq Ahmad Khan”.
“We made it clear that this is not only a matter concerning Jamaat-e-Islami, but it carries importance for the whole of Pakistan. The Israeli attack on the Global Sumud Flotilla and the arrests are strongly condemnable,” he stated.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the detention of former senator Mushtaq and his fellow participants.
“Food and medicine are not threats. Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla, detaining doctors, activists and Pakistan’s Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, is a flagrant assault on international law and conscience.”
Israel has released and transported around 170 of the detained participants to Turkiye and Spain. As of October 6, 171 more detainees, including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, were deported and have arrived in Greece.

Upon arrival, the released volunteers detailed the torture they were subjected to. While speaking to Anadolu Agency, Italian journalist Lorenzo Agostino said that Israeli forces acted like a “terrorist group.”
“People were kicked. We were left without fresh water for over two days. Overall, they took every opportunity to humiliate any of us.”
Agostino also stated that Thunberg was humiliated and “wrapped in an Israeli flag and exhibited like a trophy”. Other reports which emerged at the time of writing said he had also been beaten and dragged along the ground by her hair.
French activist, Yasin Benjelloyn, who was also interviewed by Anadolu, described how Israeli forces would wake them up every two hours by storming their cells with dogs and snipers.
According to Reuters, Malaysian citizen Hazwani Helmi said that Thunberg was used as a propaganda tool and was mistreated. Helmi added that the Israelis had treated them “like animals”.
Turkish activist Ersin Celik also recounted that the Israelis “dragged Greta by her hair, beat her and forced her to kiss the Israeli flag.”
 






British-Palestinian activist Keiran Andrieu said flotilla members were denied crucial medicine, and appeals for medical help fell on deaf ears.
“Israel treated us terribly. It denied people essential medicine. We were shouting that someone was possibly having a heart attack, they didn’t come, they didn’t care.”

Meanwhile, there are reports that Thiago — who was also released after being detained by Israel —  has been on a hunger and water strike in protest against the denial of essential medicine to fellow activists.
As former senator Mushtaq put it in earlier interviews with Dawn.com, “We are not an army or a military force; we are civilians looking to confront and break the siege.
“In case the Israeli forces attack, we have been told to embody peaceful resistance, stand against oppression and break the blockade peacefully. To put our lives in danger while establishing a humanitarian corridor.”
 






The Foreign Office [FO] had announced on the eve of October 7 that it was working with Jordan to ensure Khan’s release from Israeli detention and safe return to Pakistan.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, through its embassy in Amman, is working tirelessly to secure the safe evacuation of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan,” the FO stated.

After a week of Israeli captivity, former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was released and transported to Amman, Jordan, on the second anniversary of Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced that Khan has been released in a post on X and that “he is safely with the Pakistan embassy in Amman. He is in good health and high spirits.”
Dressed in the same white clothes that other released flotilla activists were seen in, the ex-senator, in a video statement on his X platform, announced his release.
“We were shackled, with our hands tied behind our backs. They blindfolded us, dogs were released on us, and guns were pointed at us,” Khan said, backing the recounts of other released activists.
He added that the treatment of flotilla activists in prison at the hands of Israeli forces was tantamount to torture.
“No access to air, no access to drinking water, no access to medication,” he stated, detailing some of the maltreatment the GSF participants endured.
Khan vowed to continue the fight for Palestinian freedom.
“We will try and save Gaza and will ensure the culprits [for the Gaza genocide] are held accountable. From Adiala Jail to Israeli jails, the efforts for Palestinian liberation will continue.”
While all of this has been happening, Hamas has accepted Trump’s plan on a conditional basis and has agreed to release all the hostages, dead or alive, in exchange for Palestinian captives held in Israeli jails.
The US president has ordered Israel to stop striking Gaza and even claimed that the bombings have stopped in a post on Truth Social. In the same breath, he threatened, “Hamas must move quickly or all bets will be off,” adding that he would not accept any outcome in which “Gaza poses a threat again”.
 


Israel has not stopped the bombings in Gaza, and as of the writing of this article, Israel has killed 24 more people in the enclave. At least 67,139 lives have been snuffed out by Israeli bombardment since October 2023, the true toll likely much higher as Tel Aviv has levelled the small Palestinian territory, home to 2 million people.
Israel may feel that it was successful in intercepting all aid boats headed to Gaza; however, they have just motivated more people to take a stand against the oppression being meted out on the Palestinians.
With its ill-treatment of foreign nationals, Tel Aviv has exposed the true nature of its forces, if the two years of genocide were not already proof enough of the moral compass of the “most moral army in the world”.
The Global Sumud Flotilla has led to more aid vessels being dispatched, carrying medics and aid workers. At least 11 aid boats are sailing to Gaza to break the siege. Civilians have taken it upon themselves to do what their governments cannot: challenge Israel.

The Amendment, which was approved by both houses of parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy.
It took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered the prime minister to appoint the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that led to its establishment.
 
 

It has been challenged by various high court bar associations, the PTI and others.
A CB headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprises Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan resumed hearing the set of pleas today, which were last taken up on January 27.
Today’s hearing
During today’s hearing, three matters were primarily discussed — the constitution of a full court to hear the pleas against the 26th Amendment, objections to the CB and live streaming of the proceedings.
At the outset of the hearing, Justice Aminuddin Khan said the bench would first hear arguments on requests for a full court hearing on the pleas and objections to CB. “We will decide on the matter of live streaming (of court proceedings) later,” he added.
At that, lawyer Khawaja Ahmad Hassan argued that arguments on pleas seeking a full court hearing should be live-streamed so that the public was also made aware of the grounds on which the request was being made. He then urged the court to first hear arguments on requests for streaming the proceedings live.
Justice Aminuddin Khan remarked that matters of the bench were of relevance to the court, not the public. He asserted that the court would first take up the matter regarding the constitution of a full court.
At one point during the hearing, he said, “Things have to be managed. All of us are serving the public, we are all fulfilling our responsibilities.”
The counsel for Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan Vice Chairperson Mustafa Khokhar, Shahid Jameel, informed the court that the SC registrar had raised objections over his client’s plea for a full court hearing.
“We filed an appeal against the objections,” he said, requesting the court to first decide Khokhar’s appeal. He further said that his client had also raised objections over the CB and urged the court to hear it along with the other petitions.
After consultation among the judges, Khokhar’s petition was allotted a number.
The lawyer representing the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government also presented arguments for a full court hearing of pleas.
He clarified that they did not have any objection regarding any of the members of the existing eight-judge CB but wanted a full court to hear the pleas.
During his arguments, Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed contended that every citizen had the right to information. However, neither was the draft of the 26th Amendment made public nor was there a public debate on it, he argued.
He then argued that at least proceedings should be live-streamed for public viewing.
He recalled that the 26th Amendment was approved by parliament “in the darkness of the night”, adding that previously court proceedings had also been streamed live, including those in Zulfikar Bhutto case and the case pertaining to the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act.
He said senior advocate of the SC Makhdoom Ali Khan had declared the 26th Amendment case the “constitutional case of the century”, arguing that a full court or a full CB should hear the case.
 
 

Following his arguments, Justice Afghan enquired, “So you want that apart from the proceedings taking place in broad daylight, they should also be live-streamed?”
To that, Barrister Ahmed said, “The Amendment was passed in the darkness of the night. That is why facts must be revealed to the public.”
Following that, the bench reserved its decision on requests seeking live streaming of the proceedings.
During the hearing, Justice Malik also asked Additional Attorney General Amir Rehman about the government’s stance on the live streaming of court proceedings.
To that, Rehman said the matter was administrative.
“So you will agree with whatever the bench decides?” asked Justice Mazhar.
At one point, Justice Mandokhail remarked, “This is a big case, we will proceed on this in an orderly manner.”
Eventually, the court approved the requests for live streaming the case’s proceedings and adjourned the hearing till 11.30am tomorrow (Wednesday).
The petitions
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary which is a salient feature of the Constitution: namely the provisions for annual performance evaluation of judges of the high court by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the chief justice of Pakistan being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches of the apex court and high courts.
As a consequence, the court should declare that the original Article 175A(3) holds the field and direct the federal government to notify SC’s senior-most judge as CJP in accordance with the original Article 175A(3), the petitioners argued.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) (Amendment) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an unconstitutional amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.
The petitioners also requested the SC for a full court hearing of the pleas instead of a hearing by the CB, which was established under the 26th Amendment.
‘Opportunity lost’
Between January and now, there have been multiple calls for a full court hearing of these pleas.
On August 14, two responses from Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi were uploaded on the court’s website, explaining why he had disregarded a decision made last year by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full SC.
The committee, which met on Oct 31, 2024, under the Practice and Procedure Act (PPA) 2023, was convened by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. In response, CJP Afridi, who chairs the committee, said he did not find it appropriate to call for a full court hearing.
The CJP had argued that such a move would undermine the much-needed spirit of collegiality among judges and expose the apex court to public comment, which, he noted, had regrettably been the case in the recent past.
On Aug 20, Justices Shah and Akhtar wrote a joint letter to the CJP, following the SC decision to make public the Oct 31 committee’s minutes.
In their joint letter, Justice Shah and Justice Akhtar observed: “The challenges to the 26th Amendment continue to remain pending and a golden opportunity to decide them at the earliest instance before the institution as a whole — i.e. the full court as it then stood — has been lost, perhaps irretrievably.”</p><small>2025-10-07 12:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627426-british-police-officers-lost-belongings-recovered-by-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>British police officer's lost belongings recovered by Karachi police</strong></a><br><p>

“This year’s Nobel Prize in Physics has provided opportunities for developing the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement.
The Nobel winners carried out experiments in the mid-1980s with an electronic circuit built of superconductors and demonstrated that quantum mechanical properties could be made concrete on a much larger, macroscopic scale.

Discoveries underpin everyday technologies
Quantum technology is already ubiquitous, with transistors in computer microchips an everyday example.
“My feelings are that I’m completely stunned. Of course it had never occurred to me in any way that this might be the basis of a Nobel Prize,” Clarke told the Nobel press conference by telephone.
“I’m speaking on my cell phone and I suspect that you are too, and one of the underlying reasons that the cell phone works is because of all this work.”
British-born Clarke is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in the US.
Devoret, born in France, is a professor at Yale University and the University of California, Santa Barbara, also in the US, where Martinis is also a professor. Martinis, an American, headed Google’s Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab up until he resigned in 2020.
“It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises. It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology,” Olle Eriksson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said.

Physics second nobel prize awarded this week
The Nobel physics prize is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and includes a prize sum totalling 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2m) that is shared among the winners if there are several, as is often the case.
The Nobel Prizes were established through the will of Alfred Nobel, who amassed a fortune from his invention of dynamite. Since 1901, with occasional interruptions, the prizes have annually recognised achievements in science, literature and peace. Economics was a later addition.
Physics was the first category mentioned in Nobel’s will, likely reflecting the prominence of the field during his time. Today, the Nobel Prize in Physics remains widely regarded as the most prestigious award in the discipline.
Past winners of the Nobel physics prize include some of the most influential figures in the history of science, such as Albert Einstein, Pierre and Marie Curie, Max Planck and Niels Bohr, himself a pioneer of quantum theory.
Last year’s prize was won by US scientist John Hopfield and British-Canadian Geoffrey Hinton for breakthroughs in machine learning that spurred the artificial intelligence boom, a development about which both have also expressed concerns.
In keeping with tradition, physics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week, after two American and one Japanese scientists won the medicine prize for breakthroughs in understanding the immune system. The chemistry prize is due next, on Wednesday.
The science, literature and economics prizes are presented to the laureates by the Swedish king at a ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death, followed by a lavish banquet at city hall.
The peace prize, which will be announced on Friday, is awarded in a separate ceremony in Oslo.

I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest — something I haven’t known in the past eighteen months.”
Final message of Gaza journalist Hossam Shabbat, 23, killed in March by an Israeli airstrike
A journalist is never supposed to be the story. In Gaza, however, the killing of at least 223 media personnel by Israel — from October 7, 2023, to Oct 1 this year — turned them into headlines. Social media shared their names and faces, and mourned the last messages they wrote in anticipation of imminent death, while mainstream media documented the numbers and converted them into bite-sized news for the ease of readers.
In the newsroom, their deaths seemed personal; these were members of our fraternity whom we had never met but relied on their lens and words. Wafa Aludaini was one of them; she wrote for this publication in 2022, titled ‘Killing the truth: Shireen Abu Akleh’s murder is a reminder that Israel will go to any length to silence its critics’.
Aludaini herself was silenced along with her husband, their five-year-old daughter and seven-month-old son on September 29, 2024, when an Israeli airstrike hit their home in Gaza’s Deir Al Balah. My colleague spotted her name in a news report, after which we added her name to the growing list of journalists killed in Israel’s latest and most brutal campaign — one that had all the makings of a genocide from the time it began, but wasn’t referred to as one.
What’s in a genocide
Soon after Hamas’ attack on Oct 7, 2023, and Israel’s immediate onslaught, I remember having discussions with different editors as to when the term “genocide” would apply. As one year passed, we ran the headline: 365 days of genocide on Oct 7, 2024. On Sep 16 this year, a UN commission officially declared Israel’s actions as genocide.
Journalists are not juries or judges; we’re not supposed to hand out sentences or write verdicts. Editorially, we’re supposed to show restraint in using labels or terminologies, and leave these matters to authorities that are tasked to make such deliberations.
Our job is to gather information, as accurately as possible, report on it and offer analysis with the help of experts and people on the ground for consumers of news to make sense of what’s happening.
But Gaza challenged our profession: every action by Israel, such as bombing hospitals and shelters or orchestrating a man-made famine, made us question when journalists are meant to pick a side and when merely reporting is no longer enough.
 
 

As the death toll rose and Israel’s intentions became more and more transparent, Gaza also challenged the legitimacy of the word genocide itself. Polish lawyer Raphäel Lemkin, who coined the word in 1944, made the argument that “the Genocide Convention has a specially great appeal to small nations because each of them can disappear completely under the first genocidal attack”. The Genocide Convention was the first human rights treaty adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1948, and signified the international community’s commitment to ‘never again’ after the atrocities committed during the Second World War.
But all the while the media debated on the timing of using the word, it concurrently broke the news of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, only to follow that up with Hungary withdrawing from the ICC hours after the Israeli leader arrived in Hungary for a state visit. It reported the United States’ declaration on January 7, 2025, that Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) had committed genocide during the country’s civil war, and exactly a month later, on February 7, ran the headline ‘US approves $7.4bn sale of more weapons to Israel used to ravage Gaza’.
For nearly two years, if we don’t count Israel’s action pre-October 7, the law failed the people of Gaza over and over again, and the media documented the world’s helplessness in preventing a genocide from happening — the very first principle of the UN’s ‘Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide’.
In all this time, Palestine’s continued plight has begged the question: what value does a word hold in the face of such hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of international law? Or, more crucially, what good is international law when none of the glaring headlines deterred Israel from carrying out a genocide?
Did journalism fail Gaza?
October 17, 2023, was the first clear signalling of Israel’s intent to wage a deadly war without any concern for civilian casualties: it targeted a UNRWA refugee camp and a hospital. Only 10 days into the war waged by Tel Aviv, the media tried to piece together information coming from both sides, and without actual press vests of their own on the ground.
The New York Times was among the publications that retracted their initial coverage on the Al Ahli Arab Hospital explosion that killed scores of Palestinians. “The Times’ initial accounts attributed the claim of Israeli responsibility to Palestinian officials, and noted that the Israeli military said it was investigating the blast,” read the Times’ editors’ note published on Oct 23 following criticism, adding that the early coverage “relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified”.
 
 

Subsequent investigations into the incident by multiple organisations didn’t offer a conclusion as to whether a failed rocket launch by Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was responsible for the explosion or if it was an Israeli airstrike. I’m not going to go into the details of the investigations (this Forensic Architecture investigation is worth a read), but want to highlight this incident because at the time, I defended the media organisations’ actions since immediate versions of either side cannot be taken at face value in reporting. But the due diligence proved to be limited to this one incident, prompted by the backlash from Israel’s sympathisers.
The overall Western media coverage remained lopsided for the large part, with headlines, including the NYT’s, often declaring that Palestinian civilians were killed but stopping short of saying by whom; news stories using emotive language for Israeli deaths but not for Palestinians’; editors putting ‘Hamas-run’ before all versions of the Palestinian Health Ministry but failing to provide context to Israeli officials’ repeated claims on incidents of civilian deaths; and media organisations silencing journalists who advocated the rights of Palestinians.
Among the journalists silenced was Mehdi Hasan, whose show was cancelled by American cable news channel MSNBC. While Hasan chose not to speak candidly on the matter, the cancellation was linked by media and lawmakers alike to his opinions about the atrocities in Palestine.
Perhaps the biggest betrayal of the fraternity was the lack of outrage by these media organisations at the deaths of Palestinian journalists. The due diligence exhibited during the Al Ahli Arab Hospital bombing wasn’t exercised in these instances, such as when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the five Gaza journalists — targeted in a Quds Today van parked outside a hospital, where the wife of one of the journalists was about to give birth — were “Islamic Jihad operatives posing as journalists”. No further investigations took place into these claims despite systematic campaigns by Israel in place to defame and threaten these journalists, as detailed by Reporters Without Borders.
“There have been few media campaigns or statements of solidarity with Palestinian journalists — compared with similar efforts around […] other western correspondents targeted by US adversaries,” wrote Mohamad Bazzi for The Guardian, noting that “press freedom and protection from persecution, it seems, are limited to western journalists”.
On August 10, 28-year-old Al Jazeera journalist Anas al Sharif was killed alongside four of his colleagues in an Israeli airstrike that targeted a press tent outside a hospital in Gaza. Less than a month before his death, the Committee to Protect Journalists had said it was “gravely worried” about the safety of Sharif, highlighting that he was being “targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign, which he believes is a precursor to his assassination”. Yet, the threats to his life and Israel’s pattern got little to no attention in the Western media, despite hundreds of Palestinian journalists already killed by Israel up to that point. Eleven days after his death, the NYT published an opinion piece with an honest, matter-of-fact headline: ‘He was the face and voice of Gaza. Israel assassinated him.’
Sharif, in the message he prepared for his death, had pleaded “not to let chains silence you”. Perhaps his end was what was needed for the media to start speaking up for him.
 


How Gaza gave new meaning to journalism
Despite the often skewed media coverage, Gaza has shifted the tide of public perception. During the course of the onslaught on Gaza, the media also reported on barriers breaking; the barrier to acknowledging that the destruction was not a result of Oct 7 but had been going on for decades, barriers on Gaza being a regional topic and turning into a global protest movement, and barriers of diplomacy which prevented countries from calling out Tel Aviv’s nefarious plans and accepting the Palestinian state.
We also witnessed barriers guarding media hegemony break; with organisations such as the BBC, once considered credible and honest, coming under intense scrutiny for its evasive framing and questionable editorial judgments. And when the same organisation pulled a documentary on Gaza, it created space for others to step in.
The documentary, titled Gaza: Doctors Under Attack, was subsequently streamed by Zeteo, a news platform launched by Mehdi Hasan after he exited MSNBC, after it was dropped by the BBC. Hasan, along with his team of diverse contributors, from Fatima Bhutto and Bassem Youssef to Cynthia Nixon and Greta Thunberg, positioned Zeteo as a leading platform to talk about Palestine without tiptoeing around Israel’s actions.
Meanwhile, Israeli TV continued its propaganda on the IDF’s so-called operations but Haaretz, the country’s left-leaning and oldest newspaper, still managed to publish some pieces critical of the government, repeatedly calling attention to Benjamin Netanyahu’s tactics of keeping the hostages where they were to be able to pursue his rampage. In the Middle East, where the media is highly controlled by the Gulf states’ official policies, The National pushed the envelope in trying to expose the full scale of Israel’s genocidal acts.
The main source of information, however, remained the brave men and women of Gaza who recorded videos and accounts of the unfolding horror and shared them with the world in real time through social media. People across the world turned to their accounts, followed their stories and came to trust them in the absence of original — and often fair — reporting across mainstream media. Inside newsrooms, they served as inspiration through their commitment in the face of some of the worst atrocities modern history has witnessed. They made journalists like myself question what our profession stands for and how we can use it to amplify their voices to end a genocide which has made us feel helpless at many junctures.
 


“I have seen my colleagues break down and cry at how we’re covering the war,” a peer in BBC London told me in December 2024. I shared how I’ve seen my colleagues tear up at the sheer horror of the information and photos coming out of Gaza. The genocide has been difficult and challenging to cover, to say the least. Footage of parents first retrieving bodies of their children from underneath rubble only to bury them, people moving to ‘safe zones’ and then being bombed, unarmed citizens being burnt alive in tents or killed while out to collect food, doctors breaking down at their helplessness to save lives or even have the equipment to do so — sifting through these footages and information has been heavy on the heart and mind.
But none of this comes even remotely close to the pain and suffering of the people living through a genocide and reporting on it.
And so, I won’t end this piece on the toll it has taken on journalists to cover two years of this genocide. Because a journalist is never meant to become the story — unless you are a journalist in Gaza staring at death and writing your final message.</p><small>2025-10-07 11:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06223156e71cf10.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946555/genocide-101-starving-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Genocide 101: Starving Gaza</strong></a><br><p>
Hunger as policy
The death trap

It starts with the body eating itself, consuming all the energy stored in its nooks and crannies. Then begins the shedding: weight, hair, skin, muscles, colour, sanity. And finally, when months pass, all that remains are shadows of a self that once was. Slowly, the heart and liver stop functioning, and soon after, death descends.
This is the story of two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, who have been stripped of food, water, shelter, dignity and a future. It is a story that started well before the onslaught began on Oct 7, 2023, following the Hamas attack on Israel.
In the two years since, the Israeli military has pretty much flattened Gaza, killing almost 70,000 people, injuring and maiming thousands of others and displacing hundreds of thousands. But some in Gaza consider the deceased lucky — at least they don’t have to witness their loved ones slowly starve to death.
While the signs started showing way back, officially, a famine was declared in the enclave on August 22 this year. According to the Integrated Security Phase Classification (IPC) — a standardised global system for analysing and classifying the severity of acute and chronic food insecurity and acute malnutrition — more than half a million Palestinians are trapped, starving to death, in the Strip.

The declaration was news, but no surprise. For the past two years, the world has witnessed in real time this famine unfold on their mobile and television screens. International human rights bodies had been warning of it for months; resolutions were passed, letters were written, and condemnations were issued. Yet, as hundreds of desperate Palestinians starved to death, the world looked on — some with agonising helplessness, others out of brutal indifference.
As of October 1, at least 455 Palestinians have died of starvation. While most of these deaths are among children and infants, older people are increasingly succumbing to the hunger that Israel has imposed on Gaza. Aid agencies have warned that the meagre amount of aid Tel Aviv is allowing into the enclave will only worsen conditions in the Strip.
“People are literally falling dead from hunger in the streets,” said Hany Abufayez, a writer based in Gaza who specialises in social and political issues. Once a successful businessman, the father of six — four boys and two girls — lost everything in the war. His only asset now is his family; their safety is his top priority.
Under international law, access to food is a “fundamental human right”. But in Gaza, this right has become a choice: death by starvation or death by bombs. “Either we die of hunger in the tents or risk going out in search of food amid killings, bombings and sniper fire,” said Abufayez. His nephew, Fayez Jamal Abu Akar, paid the price: “he went out to fetch food. He was shot in the head, abdomen and leg.”
Stages of starvation
By definition, starvation is suffering or death caused by the lack of food. It occurs over three stages: the first starts as early as a skipped meal, the second comes with a prolonged period of fasting when the body relies on stored fats for energy, and the third and fatal stage is when these fat reserves are depleted. The body consequently turns to bones and muscles for energy.

“Starvation is one of the most barbaric ways to kill someone,” said Dr Fyeza Jehan, professor and chairperson of the Department of Paediatrics & Child Health at the Aga Khan University in Karachi. “It is not sudden … it is prolonged, you are constantly conscious of it, and it is intended to maximise suffering.”
Chronic starvation, the doctor explained, is like the body cannibalising itself. Without access to food, the stomach contracts, leading to severe hunger pangs that occur as the body utilises all of its glycogen stores — the stored form of glucose, primarily located in the liver and skeletal muscles. In adults, the process can last 48 hours, while in children, it is accelerated and can last up to a day.
After two to three days without food, the hunger vanishes, leaving the body behind in what is called the survival mode, and as it happens, the body goes frigid. “It feels like there is no life left in you,” Dr Fyeza said. In a child, this can manifest as a boy or a girl with dull eyes who doesn’t play or talk anymore. For toddlers or infants, their cries dim or just stop altogether.
When weeks pass, these effects worsen in the form of lost weight, thin skin, shrinking muscles, hallucinations and a weak immune system in adults. In these circumstances, even a common cold can lead to severe infections.
In children, prolonged starvation eats up all the fat and protein in their bodies, leaving them with oedema — swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body’s tissues, often affecting the legs, ankles, and feet. Physically, the child loses all colour and embodies a shrunken leaf. At this stage, any infection can cause death.
For Gaza’s children, the signs Dr Fyeza pointed out fit like a glove.
Dr Wesam Amir, a Palestinian medic who left the enclave for safety last year, cannot forget those dull eyes, once sparkling with life and light. “Instead of running around, they now search for a place to lie on; instead of toys, they now ask for bread; many have forgotten what it is like to eat a full meal.”
“Their cries echo in my ears even today … and it breaks me every single time,” he sighed. Dr Wesam recalled the wails of an infant in the neighbourhood where he lived. “The mother couldn’t breastfeed … she was malnourished herself. Her baby would cry with hunger for hours, but there was nothing that could be fed, not even formula milk.”
As months pass without adequate food, a starving adult may still be able to survive. But they are merely a shadow of their former selves; all that remains are bones and skin. Eventually, the heart and liver begin to fail, and the body’s tissues break down. Death is not far away.
Children, on the other hand, rarely ever reach this stage. Their fragile bodies rapidly deteriorate, becoming susceptible to diarrhoea, pneumonia and sepsis. At three weeks, the process of starvation reaches its catastrophic phase, where children get lesions on their eyes and go blind, their hair falls out, and their organs shut down.
“Unable to move, speak or cry out, they draw their last breath,” said Rachael Cummings, humanitarian director at Save the Children. She highlighted that data compiled by the organisation for July showed cases of acute malnutrition in children under the age of five at their clinics across Gaza surged tenfold during the four months of total siege.

Of the 3,533 children screened for malnutrition during the first half of July, 259 were admitted for treatment (7pc) compared to 28 (1pc) in March. The number of children admitted for treatment of malnutrition in the first two weeks of July was close to the total for the whole of June, a trend that is dangerous and unprecedented. “There is a clear correlation here with the start of the total siege at the beginning of March and its knock-on impacts.”
When it comes to grown-ups, research suggests that a healthy adult can survive without food for between one to two months. However, there are no healthy adults in Gaza today — two years of aid being blocked intermittently by Israel has deprived them of conditions indispensable for survival, essentially rendering people in the enclave vulnerable to malnutrition and a host of infectious diseases.
“Imagine that 99 per cent of people here have not eaten a meal containing meat or eggs in over a year or six months,” Khalil Abu Shama, a human rights defender in Gaza, told Dawn.com. His family is very much a part of this percentage.
Shama’s son, Mohammed, especially requires the nutrients. He fractured his right leg during the Israeli bombing of the beachfront Al-Baqa cafe in Gaza City on June 30, in which the military used a 500lb bomb — a powerful and indiscriminate weapon that generates a massive blast wave and scatters shrapnel over a wide area.
“He needs nutritious foods, like meat and eggs, to recover and walk again,” the father said. “But we struggle to provide him with even basic food. The available food consists mainly of canned goods such as fava and kidney beans, peas, some bread, cheese, and a very limited amount of vegetables,” he rued.
But meals in Gaza are no longer about nutrition or flavour; they are now only meant to quell the hunger pangs. Most families survive on one meal a day. As per the recent IPC report, July 2025 was consistent with the exponential rise in acute malnutrition across Gaza. It found that at least 1 in 5 households in the enclave are facing an extreme shortage in their consumption of food, roughly 1 in 3 children or more are acutely malnourished, and at least 2 in every 10,000 people are dying daily because of outright starvation or the combination of malnutrition and disease.

It further reported that in the Gaza governorate, 15pc of households said they have resorted to scavenging through bins for food, adding that at certain points over the past 23 months, people were forced to eat leaves to survive, or scraps that even rats wouldn’t want to eat.
“Breakfast is often a cup of water and, if you are lucky, a piece of stale bread,” described Dr Wesam. “The main meal of the day is usually a thin rice soup made with lots of water and a handful of grains. On other days, it is plain rice with a pinch of salt.” A dish like eggplant stew, he continued, has become a luxury — unseen in months.
“My grandmother-in-law has health conditions that require a special diet, but we can’t provide it. She is so frail, yet she often gives a portion of her food to the children, pretending she isn’t hungry,” he added.
Psychological toll
Beyond the toll and hunger is something grave — it is the erosion of dignity and future potential and the long-term psychological trauma that will haunt generations of Palestinians to come.
“There is … a multi-generational societal impact. The trauma, sense of degradation and humiliation that accompany the experience of famine lives on in the memories of people,” said Alex de Waal, one of the world’s leading experts on famine, in an interview with Anadolu Agency, while comparing starvation in Gaza with the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s, which left a lingering silence and chafed pain for over a century.
“I fear that in the case of Gaza, this sense of trauma, degradation, humiliation, dehumanisation will mean that this is a wound that … will take generations to heal,” he added.
The Palestinian spread, once a symbol of pride for Gaza, was reduced by Israel to stale bread and thin rice soup made of a handful of grains — that too require begging — and dirty water. Some families look at old photos of meals on their phones just to remember what it used to feel like to have a full table and a fuller stomach.
“Managing feels too generous. People aren’t managing; they are barely surviving,” said Dr Wesam. And this affects not just their bodies, but also their behaviours, which become contrary to normal survival instincts, both in adults and children. For babies born in Gaza during the last several months, food is a foreign concept, as many of them have never tasted a hearty meal. This doesn’t just impact them but also helpless mothers, who are malnourished themselves.
“In Nasser, the hospital corridors are lined with women who have just given birth. In six missions to Gaza, I have never seen it like this — new mothers and vulnerable newborns lying on the floor,” said Unicef spokesperson James Elder.
“Three premature babies share a single oxygen source — each breathing for 20 minutes, before giving way to the next. A premature baby, Nada, who was in intensive care for 21 days, is discharged and now waits outside, lying on the corridor floor with her mother. Nada weighs two kilograms, less than half of what she should weigh,” he added.
This hunger, visible across Gaza, is also preventing injured Palestinians from recovering fully, as two years of war and starvation have taken a toll on their immune systems. And contrary to popular belief, refeeding, as Dr Fyeza pointed out, is not the solution.
“At this time, even if aid enters Gaza, the damage has already been done,” she lamented. Palestinians in the enclave are now at risk of the refeeding syndrome — a metabolic disturbance which occurs as a result of the reintroduction of nutrition in people who are starved, severely malnourished, or metabolically stressed because of severe illness.
If food is introduced too quickly, the doctor explained, it can cause serious complications such as an electrolyte imbalance. This happens because of the ways our bodies change when they are deprived of nutrients. When we begin refeeding, they have to change back, but they may not have the resources they need.
“As the body starves, it makes adaptations to maintain life as long as possible. These adaptations mean that if a severely malnourished person suddenly consumes a large amount of food, it may actually kill them,” the IPC report highlighted. Instead, food needs to be introduced gradually and under medical supervision to ensure that this unfortunate consequence does not happen.
“Even if the food comes back, all the effects, especially those on children and their brain development, cannot be undone,” Dr Fyeza said. When the body experiences repeated cycles of undernutrition, it causes chronic health problems. In adults, they manifest in the form of heart diseases and diabetes.

It is, however, the children who suffer the biggest loss. Those who survive will be more susceptible to anaemia, stunting, and poor immunity. Similarly, babies born to mothers who are malnourished are more likely to be smaller, less healthy, and at higher risk of malnutrition themselves. But most of all, this is an entire generation growing up with less capacity, whether it is physical or cognitive.
“The impacts of famine often ripple across generations: children who survive may face lifelong health and developmental challenges, and their own children may inherit increased vulnerability,” said Rachael of Save the Children. “The physical, mental, and social harms of famine are not only devastating in the moment, but they also shape families, communities, and futures for decades.”
“Children in Gaza are systematically being starved to death. This is a deliberate policy. This is starvation as a method of war in its starkest terms.”
What begins as hunger does not end with it — it seeps into memory, body, even the bloodline. In Gaza, starvation has become a legacy written into the next generation.
 


Hunger as policy
 


“They need to starve […] the moment it becomes hard for them, it will also be hard for Hamas. There is no problem bombing fuel and food reserves,” Israeli Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu said, days before a famine was declared in Gaza. Before him, far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also thundered: “Not even a single grain of wheat will enter the Gaza Strip.”
“[…] we should bomb all their generators. If our hostages don’t have electricity, let them have no electricity … we need to explain to him [President Trump] that this aid goes to Hamas, and Hamas are Nazis, and they shouldn’t be given a single grain of food. Not only [should we] not give them, but [we should] bomb all of their food reserves,” Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir posted on X on March 3, 2025.
It is no longer a secret that Tel Aviv is deliberately starving Palestinians, not just since October 2023, but as a systematic policy for almost two decades now. The question is how.
After Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel placed restrictions on everything entering the enclave through crossings controlled by its military. “The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger,” Dov Weisglass, a senior adviser to the then Israeli prime minister had said back then.
Henceforth, Israel began to carefully calculate the amount of food Gaza precisely needed, allowing just that into the enclave. According to files released by the defence ministry two years later, the food calculation had applied the average daily requirement of 2,279 calories per person. An average adult needs 2,500kcal a day.
Even before October 2023, 1.2 million of Gaza’s 2.2 million population was estimated to be facing acute food insecurity, and over 80pc were reliant on humanitarian aid, the Human Rights Watch noted in a report.
Today, Cogat, the Israeli agency that controls aid shipments to Gaza, appears to be following the same policy. The agency’s records show that 319,926 tonnes of aid were allowed into the enclave between March and September, which is insufficient to meet the starving territory’s needs. As per the World Food Programme, Gaza needs more than 62,000 metric tonnes of food every month to cover basic humanitarian needs for its population.
Even if every bag of flour or can of beans were handed out equitably, starvation and hunger in Gaza were inevitable.

In March and April, after Israel resumed attacks on Gaza following the ceasefire violation, the enclave was under a total siege, with no food allowed to enter. By May, Netanyahu succumbed to growing international pressure and allowed only a trickle of aid to enter the Strip, which didn’t prevent but delayed the famine.
Between May and July, a meagre 116,030 tonnes of aid entered Gaza; one-third of the required food never reached the territory. By August, a famine was officially declared. And all of this happened as hundreds of trucks, carrying humanitarian aid sufficient to feed Gaza for three months, waited a few kilometres from the Strip, awaiting Israeli approvals.
“Just outside Gaza, in warehouses — and even within the territory itself — tonnes of food, clean water, medical supplies, shelter items and fuel sit untouched with humanitarian organisations blocked from accessing or delivering them,” said Rachael Cummings of Save the Children.
“The Government of Israel’s restrictions, delays, and fragmentation under its total siege have created chaos, starvation, and death.”

Like a hawk eyeing its prey, Israel has exercised complete control over the aid entering Gaza ever since the beginning of its onslaught on the Strip. A recent analysis of food availability, conducted by the IPC, showed that from October 2023 to December 2024, there was a considerable caloric deficit in the enclave, as only 1,640kcals per person were available every day. By May 2025, this number fell to just 1,400 calories or “67pc of what a human body needs to survive”.
“Before the war, Gaza was receiving about 500 aid trucks daily,” Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson of the Palestine Red Crescent, told Dawn.com. “But the trucks entering the enclave now are in mere dozens, which does not even scratch the surface of its needs.”
“It is a drop in the ocean.”
 


According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, after the resumption of hostilities in March, only 35pc of 1,445 humanitarian missions were facilitated by Israeli authorities, while 810 were impeded or denied. Israel’s recent changes in its policies, requiring all humanitarian trucks to be accompanied by its security escorts, have further impacted humanitarian logistical operations.
The lack of escort capacity has already caused suspensions on some humanitarian supply corridors, while previously authorised items such as nutrition, health, hygiene and water treatment aid face longer delays than food items, noted the IPC report.
Even if aid trucks do manage to cross the rigidly guarded Gaza border, what they carry is rarely ever sufficient to meet the needs of Palestinians. “The goods that come through the crossing are very limited,” said Nour Abu Shammala, a human rights activist and writer in the enclave. “For example, meat of any kind is not allowed in. The reliance remains on canned foods, legumes and cheese.”

“We went through a period where we didn’t have flour or bread … we had to eat rice instead, and we rationed bread carefully to keep some for the next day. At first, breakfast might have been za’atr and olive oil, but even those ran out, so we depended mainly on fava beans,” she recalled.
Other times, the trucks are hijacked and looted or seized by criminal groups supported by Israel to break down civil order in the Strip and prevent aid deliveries, Nour added.

While Palestinians always knew who funded these gangs, mounting evidence has recently surfaced, laying bare Israel’s glaring role in mobilising criminals in Gaza. On June 5, Netanyahu admitted: “The government has activated powerful local clans in the enclave on the advice of security officials.”
Earlier, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that sources in Gaza claimed one such group Bibi referred to consisted of roughly 100 armed men operating with the implicit support of the Israeli military.
The New Humanitarian, a not-for-profit newsroom, described the gangs as “big and very dangerous”. They are especially located in areas where aid is entering or being distributed. “They loot UN trucks, selling the goods at inflated rates — or sometimes the food just disappears altogether … they also steal food directly from other people who risk their lives to get aid from distribution centres.”
What these gangs steal is sold into the market at exorbitant rates; sugar now costs 300 times more than it did before the war, same is the case with flour and beans. As per the IPC report released in August, July food prices in Gaza increased by 25pc to as much as 9,900pc compared to the February ceasefire levels, and by 233pc to 15,285pc compared to the pre-war prices.
The highest fluctuations were seen in wheat flour — which has become both a bane and boon for Palestinians — up to $30 in June and coming back down to around $15 in July.

Qusay Qasem, 22, is among the thousands of Palestinians for whom fetching bread has become a fatal exercise. A resident of North Gaza, which has been declared a combat zone, he has to risk his life every day to secure a piece of bread. But the markets, now merely a remnant of what they used to be before the war, are nearly inaccessible. The IPC has found that Palestinians face extreme challenges reaching markets across the Strip, with 82pc of households in Deir al-Balah Governorate, 76pc in Khan Younis Governorate, 72pc in Gaza Governorate and 66pc in North Gaza Governorate unable to reach markets.
“Instead, I head to aid distribution centres, where bullets pour down on us,” Qasem told Dawn.com. “I have escaped death several times. Yet, I return alive each time because I know my family is waiting for that one sack of flour, that one loaf of bread.”
Bakeries, previously a reliable source of food — particularly bread — for a majority of Palestinians like Qasem, have remained closed since April 2025. Most of them have been bombed, and the undamaged ones are out of reach. Of the 29 bakeries in Gaza, 13 are now in evacuation and militarised zones, while none of the previous bakeries in North Gaza, Rafah, and Khan Younis are accessible due to the movement restrictions imposed by Israel.
Before the war, many Gazans relied on the enclave’s fertile lands for sustenance and livelihood. But two exhausting years of Israeli aggression have snatched that. All that remains is rubble, dust and despair.
According to an assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, Gaza’s agrifood system faces a near-total collapse. About 86pc of cropland has been damaged, with over 91pc land inaccessible to farmers and only 1.5pc of arable land in use. Agriculture previously supplied most of the Strip’s fresh vegetables, eggs and milk. In fact, some of its top exports included strawberries, dates, olives, and flowers.
 
A similar situation persists with livestock, most of which have been killed; only 26pc of sheep and 34pc of goats remain, ceasing the commercial production of poultry, cattle and dairy. With the Israeli ban on access to the sea — the beach that was once a source of solace, laughter and barbeques — over 72pc of fishing assets, including boats, aquaculture, farms and cold storage have been destroyed.
With its 24-month-long aggression in Gaza, Israel has systematically robbed the enclave of its ability to feed itself, forcing Palestinians to now depend almost entirely on irregular food aid and imports. This is not just an erasure of life, but also dignity. And the FAO agrees, explicitly describing Gaza’s crisis as an “entirely man-made catastrophe, driven by access restrictions and bombardment rather than natural causes”.
Families like that of Nour, who still have some financial stability enabling them to purchase food, also face massive hindrances in terms of preparation because of the complete lack of fuel and gas — the latter hasn’t entered the enclave since February 2025. As a result, Gazans must now rely on burning rubbish to light their stoves.
“Staple foods such as lentils and wheat flour, if poorly cooked, are not well digested by the body, reducing its ability to fully absorb and use the nutrients,” the FAO told Dawn.com. Thus, even for households that can sporadically access food, they often lack the means to safely prepare it.
In addition to this, the IPC report highlighted that basic cooking implements continue to be in short supply due to the constant displacement of populations.
Nearly 800,000 Palestinians have been displaced since the end of the ceasefire on March 18, with almost 350,000 since the escalation of May 15 alone. Most of the population has been displaced multiple times across Gaza Governorate, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. Across these governorates, around 20pc or more of the population has been displaced three to six times, with at least 4pc across all three areas displaced seven or more times.

Continued and frequent displacement erodes household capacity to cope as essential assets such as shelter materials, storage items, water, and food may be lost along the journey, especially given the limited notice that people have to evacuate or relocate from approaching hostilities, the report noted.
Before the war, Hani Abufayez was recognised across Gaza as a successful businessman. He ran a consulting office and lived in a villa with his family of eight. Today, he lives in a tent after being displaced not once but at least thrice. “I survive on very little money … my fears grow with each passing day. I fear my family and I could be killed at any moment, or die of hunger.”
“The reality is that Israel has turned Gaza into a death zone where there is no place for life anymore.” It didn’t just rain down bombs on the enclave, but also ran a planned campaign there, using “food and aid as a weapon to humiliate, weaken, displace and kill Palestinians”.
Systems breakdown
The dismantling of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees was a part of this campaign. For decades, Palestinians have relied on the organisation for aid. “It is the only agency with real experience in humanitarian relief,” said Khalil Abu Shama, a human rights defender in Gaza.
“I am considered a part of the third generation of the Nakba of 1948. I completed my primary and preparatory education in UNRWA schools. I grew up witnessing the agency providing its services to refugees in various fields. I completed my studies, and throughout my long career in the field of human rights, there was continuous coordination between us and UNRWA,” he reminisced.
The UNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly on December 8, 1949, to provide basic support, including food, healthcare and education to Palestinian refugees, who were displaced during the Nakba. It supports about six million Palestinian refugees, residing both within and outside Palestine, and provides direct services such as schools, health centres and other social services.
Before Israel launched its offensive in Gaza, about a million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were sheltering in UNRWA schools, clinics and other buildings run by the agency. Meanwhile, nearly the entire population of the Strip relied on it for basic necessities, including food, water and hygiene.
“It was our lifeline, both before the war and especially after Oct 7, 2023,” emphasised Shama.
But just the way it did with everything else, Israel deprived Palestinians of this support as well. On January 30, Tel Aviv banned the UNRWA, months after the Israeli parliament passed two bills: one, barring the agency from activity within Israel and the second banning Israeli authorities from any contact with it, essentially breaking a 1967 treaty that allowed the agency to provide services to Palestinian refugees in areas under Israel’s control.
The action was taken after Israel accused 18 UNRWA employees of participating in the Oct 7 attack on Israel. Subsequently, a probe was launched by the UN, which found that nine workers of the agency “may have” been involved in the attack and no longer work for it. But UNRWA has maintained that Israel never presented any evidence supporting its allegations, adding that it regularly provided Tel Aviv with a full list of its staff members.
The agency has also accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, pressurising them into making false confessions about ties with Hamas. But Netanyahu and his government were adamant on dismantling UNRWA, something they have been advocating for a long time. Israel claims that the UN body “perpetuated” the issue of Palestinian refugees because it allows Palestinians to transfer refugee status across generations, which Tel Aviv refuses to accept.
It is also not a mere coincidence that Israel’s allegations came the same day the International Court of Justice ordered it to prevent genocidal acts and scale up aid to Gaza.
Soon after the Israeli allegations were aired, the US became the first country to announce the suspension of funding to the agency. Canada, Australia, Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, Japan, Austria and Romania soon followed.
What happened next looks like this: Israel made UNRWA vacate all premises in occupied East Jerusalem, cease its operations by Jan 30, and cut short the validity of all visas for UNRWA’s international staff. Basically, the agency was evicted.
“Stopping the UNRWA’s work and placing obstacles in the way of its continued presence in Palestine — especially in Gaza — is effectively a death sentence for large numbers of refugees who have lost everything, including the ability to secure food,” said Shama.
A month later, in February 2025, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — backed by the very powers accused of engineering the starvation — was born. It promised relief. What it delivered, many in Gaza say, was something else entirely.
The death trap
 


 


Dr Sami Alastal, a writer and political analyst based in Gaza, has lost 20 kilos since October 7, 2023. “We do not have any food, and if it is available, it is in very small quantities,” he rued. Yet, he refuses to visit the GHF aid distribution centres.
“It is a scam,” he said. “It is a killing and torture squad disguised as a humanitarian organisation.”
Dr Sami’s sentiments were echoed by a majority of Palestinians Dawn.com spoke to, who, despite the catastrophic levels of starvation and hunger in the enclave, refuse to visit the GHF-run stations. They see the distribution process as “humiliating to our humanity and dignity”.
 


“We live near the Netzarim area, from where we see people heading to aid distribution sites,” said Nour Abu Shammala, a Palestinian human rights activist. “The process of entry and aid distribution is manipulated by the [Israeli] occupation to create chaos, and so for us it is unacceptable.” She shared how these aid distribution sites were located in areas described as “execution grounds” for civilians.
“I heard about the crimes in Netzarim on television, watched them unfold from my house, but never went there myself.”
Qusay Qasem, who has no choice but to visit the GHF centres, calls them traps. “It is akin to walking into your death … at any time, the Israeli military starts indiscriminately firing at us, there are bullets everywhere,” he recalled. “I have seen fellow aid seekers fall dead or wounded as I duck to the ground.”
But even as bullets rain down on him, the 22-year-old Palestinian strives to reach the gates of the centre, his family’s shrunken faces flashing before his eyes. “I have to do it; they wait for a single piece of bread all day.”

This is exactly how Israel plays its game — it’s either death from guns or death from hunger. Here is how it is done:
The journey begins hours before the aid site is set to open, often in early morning hours. The aid seekers are only allowed to bring their vehicles up to a certain point, which is at least 1.5km (a 12-20 minute walk) from the centre, and then cover the remaining distance on foot. This means that once — and if — they manage to secure sacks or boxes of aid, it must be carried back on foot. As the crowd keeps getting bigger, everyone is glued to their spots — unflinching for fear of losing out — waiting for the go-ahead signal, usually the buzz of drones.
As soon as the signal rings through the now flattened Gaza, the walk begins, and, with that, the fear of death fills the air.
“These centres are heavily guarded by the Israeli military, who encircle them with sniper nests, tanks and drones,” said Khalil Abu Shama. “The Israeli military monitors the movement of the crowd, sometimes opening fire even before the go-ahead signal.”
“Every day between 10 and 50 civilians are killed without any clear explanation as to why, except that the occupation wants to slaughter as many people as possible in Gaza,” he added.
On July 19, Israel killed at least 32 Gazans seeking aid near Rafah. According to an eyewitness, the shooting took place near a GHF aid distribution centre, adding that gunfire erupted from soldiers and tanks “as if they were in a battle with us”. Doctors who treated the wounded said they had severe gunshot wounds to the head and torso. The Israeli military, on the other hand, failed to provide any reason for the live fire.

This is not something new for the Israeli military. They have been targeting aid coming into Gaza since the first month of the war. From October 2023 to 2024, Forensic Architecture has documented more than 322 attacks on aid, including workers and civilians, as well as 22 attacks on convoys transporting aid.
Separately, during March and August this year, 64 incidents of the Israeli army opening fire on aid seekers were reported, of which 25 were around GHF centres, 19 in proximity to aid routes and seven during aid diversion.
The vast majority of these shootings weren’t merely a mistake or misunderstanding. A report by Israeli newspaper Haaretz found that Israeli soldiers deliberately shot at unarmed Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza after being “ordered” to do so by their commanders. “We fire machine guns from tanks and throw grenades,” it quoted one soldier as saying.
Another soldier said that between “one and five people were killed every day” where he was stationed in Gaza. “It’s a killing field,” he added.
One of the authors of the Haaretz report, in an interview with Al Jazeera, said that the Israeli military’s orders to open fire on civilians were part of a method to “control” the aid seekers. “It’s actually a practice of … controlling the crowd by fire, like if you wanted the crowd to run off [from] a place, you shoot them at them, even though you know they are unarmed … You use fire to move people from one point to another,” Nir Hasson said.
It almost translates to making Palestinians move to the tune of Israeli gunshots — not just a violation of their humanity but also of their dignity. “It is deliberate … Israel uses food as a tool of pressure,” Nour, the Palestinian human rights activist, pointed out. Meanwhile, Dr Alastal said: “Israel is using the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to establish a military model of aid distribution wherein food is used as a weapon of war.”
The same was also highlighted in the Forensic Architecture report. It explained how, for years, aid in Gaza was distributed through experienced humanitarian organisations such as the UNRWA, equipped to meet the needs of the enclave’s population. But after the war, just like every living thing in the Gaza Strip, these agencies too came under attack.
Between March 2 and May 29, 2025, no aid was allowed to enter Gaza. During this period, Israel attacked aid warehouses and community kitchens, exacerbating the conditions of starvation. When aid trucks were finally permitted to re-enter Gaza at the end of May, ending the nearly three-month blockade, efforts to deliver supplies to warehouses faced significant challenges. To make matters worse, Cogat announced in July that Israel will gradually permit the entry of goods into the Strip under a new “private commercial sector” mechanism, in a bid to “increase the volume” of aid, while reducing reliance on aid collection by the UN and other international organisations.

Simply put, Israel wanted complete control over the enclave. And this is how it was able to weaponise food distribution, ergo: The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Per the FA’s findings, the previous UN-led distribution network in Gaza operated nearly 400 sites, whereas the GHF has only four of what it calls “mega sites”, a majority of which are located in the south, which the UN says is an attempt to relocate Palestinians from the north and depopulate it.
“The military model dismantles the social fabric. In restricting the reach of any form of aid administration to the confines of the four ration stations, this model designates the remainder of the territory as something akin to a governance wilderness.
“In this ungoverned territory, Israel promotes the lawlessness of criminal gangs and proxy forces. The attacks on aid workers, health workers, and community leaders are part of this,” the report noted.
A method of war
In this war, hunger is not incidental — and aid, under the GHF, is not compassionate. A report by the Jewish Voice for Peace lays it bare: from day one, GHF aid sites became kill-zones; “shoot at the crowds to communicate” were the instructions; distribution was concentrated in militarised zones and managed under Israeli oversight.
This is aid designed to humiliate, corral, and control. And so we arrive at the darkest logic: to deliver bread is to own life. Gaza’s hunger cannot be undone by more trucks or rations — it must be undone by undoing the system that made hunger the weapon in the first place.

Starvation in Gaza is not a byproduct of war — it is the method. This isn’t just the story of the last two years — the policy and actions go back two decades. What began as a blockade of goods has become a blockade of existence.
Israel has built a system where food is not distributed but dispensed; where hunger is not a crisis to be solved but a condition to be managed. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the clearest example of this — aid designed not to relieve suffering but to regulate it. Every grain of wheat, every loaf of bread, is counted, rationed, and handed out under watchtowers and rifles.
And still, the Palestinians resist. They refuse to let the act of eating become a performance of gratitude. In their hunger, they assert the one thing Israel cannot occupy — their humanity.
In Gaza today, starvation has a geography, a policy, and an administration. It has checkpoints and drones, and waiting lines. It has signatures and seals. And that is the real tragedy — that the world has watched hunger become a bureaucracy.
History will remember this war not just for the bombs that fell, but for the bread that didn’t.</p><small>2025-10-07 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/07114707df52631.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947200/pm-shehbaz-receives-honorary-phd-in-leadership-governance-from-malaysian-university' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz receives honorary PhD in leadership, governance from Malaysian university</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister She­hbaz Sharif has received an honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy during his visit to Malaysia in recognition of his “outstanding leadership and contributions to nation-building”.
The premier arrived in Malaysia on October 5 for a three-day official visit, during which he snapped up six accords and several trade and bilateral agreements.
According to Malaysian state news agency Bernama, the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) conferred the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Leadership and Governance during a special ceremony held yesterday at its Kuala Lumpur campus.
Dressed in a blue gown on the occasion, PM Shehbaz termed it a “great privilege and honour” to be part of the event and receive the degree from this “great institute of learning”.
He appreciated Queen of Pahang Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah, who is also the IIUM Constitutional Head, for gracing the event.
 






The premier said: “For over four decades, I devoted my humble services to serve the cause of [and] the people of Punjab, the largest province of Pakistan, as their public servant. And now, as the prime minister of Pakistan, and in the line of duty, despite my human failings, I tried my best to serve the people with sincerity of purpose and unwavering commitment.
“I am truly delighted to be associated through this degree of philosophy with one of the most revered seats of learning in the Muslim world and an institution that has championed the integration of knowledge, faith and ethics, and pursuit of excellence,” he added.
The premier expressed the hope that his visit to the varsity would further strengthen the bonds of academic partnership and collaboration between the IIUM and Pakistan’s leading institutions of higher learning.
The prime minister emphasised that leadership was not a privilege but a “sacred trust, amanah, which must be exercised with honesty of purpose, sincerity, justice and transparent accountability before Allah”.
 
 

“History bears testimony that whenever Muslims held firmly to these glorious principles, they not only flourished themselves but also became a source of guidance for humanity around the globe,” PM Shehbaz said.
Highlighting that the Muslim ummah today confronts “formidable challenges [of] conflict, poverty and disunity, he stressed that it was “in these testing times that we need to hold on together to our values and ethics guided by our religion to be able to reclaim our lost place in the comity of nations”.
Addressing the Pahang queen, the premier said Malaysia was blessed with a very young population and noted that “our responsibility as servants and as leaders is to provide them the right platforms to serve the cause of suffering humanity with compassion and with great commitment”.
 






The prime minister read out a few verses of Dr Allama Iqbal and their English version as well. He expressed his wishes for IIUM’s continued success and for a “future of greater unity, brotherhood and very close coordination” for both Pakistan and Malaysia.
In her remarks, the Pahang queen noted that Shehbaz had “served with vision, discipline and compassion” for four decades.
“From your leadership in Punjab to your role as prime minister, you have shown true leadership is not about power but about purpose, about building lives and uplifting communities through education, healthcare and opportunities.”
She highlighted that the Punjab Education Endowment Fund “opened the doors of higher learning to thousands who might never have dreamt of university education”. “That is leadership that touches hearts and transforms futures,” Iskandariah noted.
Recalling that Pakistan was a founding partner of the IIUM, she said Pakistani students and alumni continue to “enrich the university and uphold our shared mission of serving the ummah”.
The Pahang queen also mentioned the Palestine issue, saying “peace on earth and harmony among all mankind” was what “we truly need today with what is happening in Palestine”.
 






In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said it was a “truly humbling experience” to be recognised with the honorary degree.
“With great humility, I accepted this honour on behalf of the people of Pakistan as a symbol of the deep-rooted intellectual and cultural connection as well as people-to-people ties between Pakistan and Malaysia,” he added.
 






In the afternoon, a post on the Pakistani government’s X account said PM Shehbaz had departed for Pakistan after concluding his visit to Malaysia.
 






A day ago, PM Shehbaz and his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim held several meetings during which they resolved to reignite bilateral cooperation and move towards a more aggressive and forward-looking policy, including the possibility of collaboration under the umbrella of the Asean economic bloc.
On the economic side, the premier termed PM Ibrahim’s announcement of the import of Halal meat worth $200 million from Pakistan a “welcome step”.
Gobi Partners shows ‘keen interest’ in Pakistan’s e-commerce sector
Separately, PM Shehbaz held a meeting with a delegation of Malaysian business group Gobi Partners, which “showed keen interest in collaboration in e-commerce and financial technologies in Pakistan”, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.
Addressing the delegation, led by Gobi Partners’ co-founder and chair Thomas G. Tsao, the premier highlighted “immense potential” for enhancing cooperation in various economic sectors between the two countries.
 






He welcomed Gobi Partners’ confidence in Pakistan’s startup ecosystem, assuring the delegation that the government was implementing “focused reforms to support startups and early-stage investors” via facilitating investments and providing better access to infrastructure, the report added.
“Mobilising both domestic and international capital is our priority to develop a sustainable startup ecosystem,” he said.
PM Shehbaz highlighted that the fintech, e-commerce, and IT services sectors form “the backbone of Pakistan’s national development strategy”.
The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening economic and trade relations with Malaysia, saying: “The government is fully committed to creating a business-friendly environment and improving the ease of doing business in Pakistan.”
 
 

Referring to the Pakistan-Malaysia Business and Investment Conference held yesterday, PM Shehbaz said such initiatives were a “welcome step towards promoting business-to-business linkages” between the two countries, Radio Pakistan added.
The prime minister noted that the Special Investment Facilitation Council was providing all possible support and facilities to foreign investors.
He highlighted the importance of the digital economy and expressed Pakistan’s readiness to welcome international business groups and investors with an interest in the country’s growing IT, technology, and artificial intelligence sectors.
Malaysia to expand palm oil exports to Pakistan
The premier’s official visit to Malaysia this week, at the invitation of PM Ibrahim, marks his first since he assumed office in 2024.
This was highlighted in a joint statement issued by Pakistan and Malaysia today, posted by the High Commission of Pakistan in Malaysia on X.
“Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1957, Malaysia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan have built a partnership premised on mutual respect and shared values,” the statement said.
 






It further highlighted the commitments of both leaders to strengthening this partnership via bilateral trade and investment, including Malaysia’s decision to import halal meat from Pakistan that was hailed by the prime minister.
In turn, Malaysia expressed its intention to expand palm oil exports to Pakistan in line with increasing demand, according to the statement.
“Both sides also agreed to further deepen the bilateral defence cooperation, particularly in the field of defence science, technology, and industry, through knowledge and technology transfer,” the statement read.
Besides deciding to explore collaboration in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, the two premiers also agreed to enhance tourism promotion and cultural exchanges from both sides.
The leaders acknowledged the importance of sustainable agricultural practices, energy security and healthcare, agreeing to explore joint research and innovation initiatives as well as partnerships in these sectors.
Furthermore, the two sides noted the cooperation on issues within the framework of international organisations, particularly the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. ’
 
 

Both countries reiterated their shared commitment to “strengthening the solidarity of the Muslim Ummah and upholding the true values of Islam”, calling on the international community to combat “all forms of intolerance”, including Islamophobia and xenophobia.
The leaders also discussed threats to peace and security in the region. In this regard, they both reaffirmed their commitment to a peaceful and stable Afghanistan, as well as condemning the ongoing genocide in Gaza and reiterating their support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the establishment of a Palestinian state.</p><small>2025-10-07 11:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/071326324da2ba0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947213/dg-ispr-says-chinese-weapon-systems-performed-exceptionally-well-during-may-conflict-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR says Chinese weapon systems performed ‘exceptionally well’ during May conflict with India</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that Chinese weapon systems deployed during Pakistan’s four-day military conflict with India in May performed “exceptionally well”.
During the conflict, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar reportedly said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) used Chinese J-10C jets in its response to India’s May 7 attack. A report by The Guardian had noted that Pakistan deploying J-10Cs would “mark the first time the Chinese planes — and the PL-15 missiles they were carrying — have been used in combat anywhere in the world”.
In May, China had expressed ignorance about the use of its jets, saying it was “not familiar with the matter”. In July, however, the Chinese air chief commended the PAF’s “exemplary performance” in the May conflict.
In an interview with Bloomberg, which was held last week and published yesterday, Lt Gen Chaudhry said: “Of course lately, recent Chinese platforms, they’ve demonstrated exceptionally well.”
 






“We are open to all sorts of technology,” he added.
Lt Gen Chaudhry was quoted as saying that Pakistan had recently raised its tally of Indian aircraft shot down to seven — up from a previous count of six.
Recently, United States President Donald Trump also described how he confronted both nations during an active war that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.
The DG ISPR also refuted Indian claims of Pakistan losing any planes.
“Pakistan has never tried to play with figures and facts,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.
Pakistan said it downed six Indian jets in retaliation in May, including the French-made Rafale.
India’s highest-ranking general has acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.
“The conflict marked the largest battlefield deployment of Chinese weaponry in recent history, with the J-10C as well as the PL-15 air-to-air missile seeing live documented fighting for the first time,” Bloomberg stated.
During the escalation, shares of Chinese defence-manufacturing companies rallied as tensions between India and Pakistan boosted the outlook for mainland exporters.
 
 

After the Indian political and military leadership made aggressive statements last week, repeating its terrorism allegations — which Pakistan has repeatedly refuted — the Pakistani military warned on Saturday that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation”.
A day later, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said India faced a “decisive defeat with a score of 6-0” in the May escalation, and “if they try again [to go to fight], God willing, the score will be much better than the last time”.
The May conflict was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
Pakistan had said it downed six Indian planes after the latter carried out deadly attacks in Punjab and Azad Kashmir. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.</p><small>2025-10-07 10:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627406-quadrilateral-meeting-in-moscow-calls-for-stable-terror-free-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Quadrilateral meeting in Moscow calls for stable, terror-free Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>

Mushtaq led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them.
In a post on social media platform X, Dar said, “I am pleased to confirm that former Senator Mushtaq has been released and is now safely with [the] Pakistan embassy in Amman. He is in good health and high spirits.”
He said that the embassy stood ready to facilitate his return to Pakistan at his wish.
“[I] am pleased to extend our gratitude to all our friendly countries who actively engaged and assisted in this behalf,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, Mushtaq also posted a video on his X account in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over.
“I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention.
“During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said.
He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down.
“We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted.
He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention.
 






On Sunday, the Foreign Office (FO) said it was actively engaged with international partners to ensure the “safety and prompt repatriation“ of Pakistanis detained by Israel. With regards to Mushtaq, it had stated: “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, [former] senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.”
On Monday, FO reiterated that it was making efforts for the safe return of the former senator.
“With the invaluable assistance of the Jordanian government, we are hopeful that the process can be successfully concluded within the next couple of days,” the FO had said. It had also expressed deep gratitude to the “brotherly” government of Jordan for “their exemplary cooperation and generous support”.
Pakistan and several other countries had condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the GSF. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also called for the release of those detained by Israel.
On Oct 3, he had assured JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman during a telephone conversation that the government was actively engaged in efforts to secure the safe return of Pakistani nationals, including Mushtaq.</p><small>2025-10-07 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/071226252fe1368.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947205/7-injured-after-blast-derails-4-jaffar-express-bogies-in-sindhs-shikarpur' target='_blank'><strong>7 injured after blast derails 4 Jaffar Express bogies in Sindh’s Shikarpur</strong></a><br><p>At least seven people were injured on Tuesday after a blast on a railway track derailed four bogies of the Jaf­far Express in Sindh’s Shikarpur district, according to officials.
With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Shikarpur Deputy Commissioner Shakeel Abro said, “A blast had occurred on the train tracks at 8:15am. The incident occurred at a distance of 1km from the Sultan Kot railway station.”
He said that the blast had caused the derailment of four bogies. Abro said that seven people had been injured, out of which four had been taken to the Combined Military Hospital, while the remaining three had been taken to the Civil Hospital in Shikarpur.
He said that the Jaffar Express train was bound for Quetta via Jacobabad.
Sukkur Deputy Divisional Superintendent Syed Moalim said that the blast occurred while the train was moving on the track. He said that a crane was being brought by railway officials to put the derailed bogies back on the track.
Sukkur Divisional Transport Officer (DTO) Mohsin Ali Sial told Dawn.com that “passengers were being taken to nearby stations so that work could commence on repairing the track.”
Shikarpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Shahzeb Chachar added that the remaining bogies had proceeded toward Jacobabad. He said that the blast had targeted a single track used by trains going to and from Quetta via Jacobabad.
He maintained that police in Jacobabad and Shikarpur were trying to trace the culprits responsible for the incident.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah condemned the incident. According to Radio Pakistan, Shah sought a report of the incident from the Sindh police inspector general.
He also directed the Larkana commissioner to provide medical assistance to the injured passengers.
In August, no loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan’s Mastung district derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express. The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung’s Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station with 350 passengers on board.
The incident came just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.</p><small>2025-10-07 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627396-supreme-court-allows-live-streaming-of-26th-amendment-case' target='_blank'><strong>Supreme Court allows live streaming of 26th Amendment case</strong></a><br><p>

The development comes against the backdrop of the 7th meeting of the Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan, where countries including India, Iran, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are set to participate to discuss matters related to Afghanistan, as per the Russian Foreign Ministry’s website.
The meeting will be held later today.
In a post on X, Pakistan’s special envoy to Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq Khan, who is currently in Russia, detailed the discussions that took place during the quadilateral meeting, saying, “The participating states unanimously reaffirmed their steadfast commitment to a stable, sovereign, and peaceful Afghanistan, underscoring the necessity of a country free from the scourge of terrorism and external intervention.”
Voicing their concerns over the terrorist groups present in Afghanistan, the envoy went on to say that the participating countries agreed on “enhanced coordination and collaborative action” to fight against terrorism in the region.
 






Separately, Khan, in different meetings with his Chinese and Iranian counterparts, discussed regional security, counterterrorism cooperation, as well as humanitarian concerns in Afghanistan.
With his Iranian counterpart Muhammad Reza Bahrami, Khan held “ in-depth discussions on the latest developments in Afghanistan“, particularly terrorism, as per a statement posted on his X.
“Both sides emphasised the importance of continued dialogue and coordination to address common challenges,” he added.
 






Meanwhile, in a meeting with China’s Yue Xiaoyong, both countries underscored the “importance of a coordinated approach to promote lasting peace and stability in the region,” as per a statement posted on his X.
“The meeting underscored the strong partnership between Pakistan and China in addressing shared challenges and advancing regional development,” he added.
 






The envoy also held discussions with his Russian counterpart, Zamir Kabulov, focusing on measures to promote regional cooperation in Afghanistan.
 






Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan
At today’s meeting, Afghanistan will be represented by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Amir Khan Muttaqi, who left for Moscow on Monday.
The deputy spokesperson for the Afghan foreign minister, Hafiz Zia Takkal, said in a statement that “this marks the first time the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’s foreign minister is participating in the Moscow Format as an official member.”
In July, Russia became the first country to formally recognise the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
According to Takkal, Afghan FM Muttaqi is “expected to present Afghanistan’s position on enhancing relations between Afghanistan & the broader region.”
Muttaqi is also expected to hold a separate meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the event, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.
Their discussions will focus on current issues of bilateral cooperation, she said, adding that the meeting will be held behind closed doors.
“Priority will be given to promoting Afghan national reconciliation and expanding practical cooperation between regional states and Kabul in the political, economic, counter-terrorism, and anti-drug fields,“ she said.
In previous meetings, the Moscow Format Consultations have urged the Afghan government to take “viable and verifiable actions in fulfilling the international obligations and commitments made by Afghanistan to fight terrorism, dismantle and eliminate all terrorist groups equally and non-discriminatory and prevent the use of Afghan territory against its neighbours”.
Pakistan is an active member of the Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan. It has been a part of the format since 2016, when it first began.</p><small>2025-10-07 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627401-ex-senator-mushtaq-ahmad-released-from-israeli-custody-confirms-dpm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad released from Israeli custody, confirms DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>

The first information report (FIR), seen by Dawn.com, was filed by Javed’s friend Hira Babar at Peshawar’s Sharqi police station in the early hours of Tuesday.
Babar claimed in the FIR that she and the PTI activist were heading back after having dinner together on Monday during the latter’s visit to the city when the “abduction” took place.
“Around 10:40pm, we were blocked by a green Vigo while we were heading back after having a dinner outside. We tried to turn back but a white car appeared from behind to intercept us,” she told the police.
“Five men got out and attempted to force Sanam into their car. At this point, we started shouting for help, but the people in the surroundings, which included officers and security personnel, did not intervene,” she said.
“The car took her towards the Red Zone,” Babar claimed.
The FIR was filed under Section 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent to secretly and wrongfully confine person) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Taking notice of the incident, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s spokesperson said that “CM Ali Amin Gandapur has ordered an investigation into the incident,” vowing to arrest those responsible.
“The culprits will be severely punished,” he said, adding that the government was utilising all its resources to find the perpetrators.
Meanwhile, the PTI, in a post on X, decried the alleged abduction as “shameful and deeply disturbing”.
The party maintained that “such actions are a blatant violation of basic human rights and dignity, and they highlight the urgent need for accountability and justice.”
 






Last night, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram had claimed on X that Javed was “pulled out of her car and taken away in front of her friends”.
 






Javed has previously been named in several cases, including over a dozen May 9 cases for which she was incarcerated for a year until the Islamabad High Court (IHC) ordered her release last year in July.
More recently, the activist was again arrested earlier this year for holding a rally and blocking the road outside Aiwan-i-Adl, alongside other PTI members. On May 20, she was booked in a case regarding derogatory posts on social media against the heads of state institutions.
Last month, her sister Falak Javed was arrested by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in a case pertaining to the fake videos of Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari being uploaded on social media.</p><small>2025-10-07 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627393-four-passengers-injured-after-blast-derails-jaffar-express-in-sindhs-shikarpur' target='_blank'><strong>Four passengers injured after blast derails Jaffar Express in Sindh's Shikarpur</strong></a><br><p>

Justice Shakeel Ahmad, a member of the five-judge constitutional bench who dissented from the majority decision on the seniority issue of IHC judges, observed that the transfers not only posed a threat to judicial independence but also revealed procedural irregularities.
 
 

By a three-to-two majority, the Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar-led constitutional bench upheld on June 19 the transfer of three judges to the IHC from three different high courts, ruling that the move fell within the framework of the Constitution. However, the matter was remanded back to the President to promptly determine inter-se seniority among the judges based on their service records.
Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Shakeel Ahmad dissented, describing the permanent transfers from the Lahore, Sindh, and Balochistan High Courts as a development that caused ripples within the judiciary, carried out through a flawed exercise of discretion under Article 200(1) and effectively rendering Article 175A redundant.

What is done once, if it is allowed, may be done again, judge observes

In his 23-page additional dissenting note, Justice Ahmad cited Lord Justice Pearce in the 1966 Liyanage case to stress the gravity of the precedent: “What is done once, if it be allowed, may be done again and in a lesser crisis and less serious circumstances.”
Justice Ahmad asserted that while constitutional provisions must prevail if clearly permitted, any such course must still be restrained through established principles of constitutional interpretation, warning that failure to do so would be a dereliction of duty. “In the larger interest of our country, in fidelity to the rule of law, and in unwavering defence of constitutionalism, it is our bounden obligation to ensure that transient convenience does not become a precedent for permanent erosion,” he stated.
Justice Ahsan’s visit
Meanwhile, Justice Muhammad Ahsan from Supreme  Court of Denmark visited the apex court, as part of his official tour on an invitation of Pakistan’s apex court.
An eminent jurist with a distinguished career in constitutional and administrative law, Justice Ahsan has served in various judicial and academic roles in Denmark and is recognised for his contributions to judicial reform.
He was warmly received by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi.

Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand directed the couple to appear before the court on Wednesday to record their statements under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).

Court summons Imran, wife to record their final statements tomorrow

The case pertains to the alleged retention of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set — comprising a necklace, earrings, bracelets and rings — gifted by the Saudi royal family, which the couple allegedly acquired at a nominal price, causing a substantial loss to the national exchequer.
According to the prosecution, the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m. During the proceedings, the prosecution produced 21 witnesses, including Mr Khan’s former military secretary, who made what the court described as a “damaging” revelation.
The former military secretary testified that the ex-PM had instructed him not to deposit the Bulgari set in Toshakhana and instead retained it.
A key witness, Sohaib Abbasi, admitted to undervaluing the jewellery set at Rs5m “under pressure” from Mr Khan’s former personal secretary, Inamullah Shah.

The nomination letters will be submitted to the secretariats of both houses today (Tuesday).
The decision was taken after the Peshawar High Court vacated the stay orders against disqualification of Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz, former leaders of the opposition in the lower and upper houses of parliament, respectively.
Sheikh Waqqas Akram, the party’s information secretary, told Dawn that the decision had been made on the orders of Imran Khan.

Aleema says only sisters will convey Imran’s messages

He said the letter of nomination for the opposition leader in the NA was submitted on Monday while that for the Senate slot would be submitted on Tuesday.
Asad Qaiser, the former National Assembly speaker, confirmed the decision, but added that nomination letters for both positions would be submitted on Tuesday (today).
Mr Qaiser said both Mr Achak­zai and Allama Nasir Abbas were seasoned politicians and never “compromise on principles”.
“As the country is passing through a crisis, Mr Achakzai is outspoken and is a perfect choice to speak in the lower house on behalf of the opposition.
“Imran Khan’s decision will strengthen the opposition alliance as Mr Achakzai is also head of Tehreek Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP),” he said.
In reply to another question, Asad Qaiser said the decisions were made because stay orders for both Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz were vacated by the PHC.
After the disqualification of Omer Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the PTI chief nominated Mr Achakzai and Azam Swati as opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate, respectively, on Aug 20.
Salman Akram Raja, the PTI’s secretary general, gave his assent to the decision.
Only Imran’s sisters can share his views, says Aleema
Separately, Aleema Khan asserted on Monday that only Imran Khan’s sisters would now carry the responsibility of conveying his messages, as directed by the incarcerated PTI founding chairman himself.
Speaking outside Adiala Jail, she said Imran also warned he may soon be shifted to an unknown location and placed in solitary confinement.
Imran Khan reportedly expressed concern over a campaign targeting the family members, allegedly because his sisters shared his messages with the masses.
“He said others cannot bear the burden of his words,” Aleema said, stressing that the sisters have never interfered in party matters in 30 years and visit jail solely for him.

Some 350 trekkers had reached the small township of Qudang, while rescuers had made contact with more than 200 others still in the mountains, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Sunday. An evening news bulletin on Monday provided no further updates on the rescue operation.
The visitors were in the remote Karma valley, which leads to the eastern Kangshung face of Everest, taking advantage of an eight-day National Day holiday in China, which brought hundreds to the area this week.
“It was so wet and cold in the mountains, and hypothermia was a real risk,” said Chen Geshuang, who was part of an 18-strong trekking team that made it to Qudang.

Locals say blizzard in October is highly unusual; claim to have ‘never encountered such weather’ so suddenly during peak season

The severe weather, which began on Friday evening, was a shocking and dangerous turn for what is normally a peak trekking season.
“The weather this year is not normal. The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly,” Chen said.
Chen’s party descended from the mountains on Sunday and was greeted with sweet tea by villagers after enduring a harrowing evening of heavy snowfall combined with thunder and lightning.
An earlier report by state-backed Jimu News said nearly 1,000 people had been trapped by the storm. Hu­­ndreds of local villagers and rescue teams were deployed to help clear snow blocking access to the area.
The remaining trekkers will arrive in Qudang in stages under the assistance of rescuers organised by the local government, CCTV reported.
The CCTV report did not say if local guides and support staff for the various trekking parties had all been accounted for.
Regional havoc
Snowfall in the valley, which lies at an average elevation of 4,200 metres (13,800 feet), began on Friday evening and persisted throughout Saturday.
The Karma valley, first explored by Western travellers a century ago, is a relatively pristine part of the Everest region. Unlike the peak’s arid north face, it boasts lush vegetation and untouched alpine forests, fed by meltwaters from the Kangshung glacier at the foot of the world’s highest mountain.
It was unclear if trekkers near the north face, which draws large numbers of tourists due to its easy access by paved road, had been affected by the weather.
October is typically a peak trekking season, when skies usually clear at the end of the Indian monsoon, offering clear views and stable conditions. The severe weather has caused havoc across the broader Himalayan region.  To the south of Tibet in Nepal, heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods that have blocked roads, washed away bridges and killed at least 50 people since Friday. Thirty-seven of those people died in separate landslides in the eastern Ilam district bordering India.
A South Korean trekker died in Nepal, and his body was recovered by a rescue helicopter on Monday, said Tulsi Gurung, president of the Nepal National Mountain Guides Association. His guide was rescued.
The hiker, whose name was not released, had climbed the 6,476-metre (21,246-foot) Mera Peak on Saturday.

Markets were abuzz with shoppers, banks were swarmed by cus­­tomers, and roads in major towns, particularly Muzaffa­rab­­ad, rem­ained choked with long qu­­eues of vehicles throughout the day.
Attendance in government of­­fices — thin last week due to the unavailability of public transpo­rt and non-use of official vehicles — was reported to be near normal.
The biggest crowds, however, were witnessed at banks, which had technically remained open during the lockdown, but saw little or no activity. Government and private sector employees thro­n­g­­ed the branches to withdraw their long-delayed salaries, while pensioners stood in queues for cash.
Many ATMs were either empty or out of order, having not been replenished for days due to the uncertain situation. Ironically, fe­­­­deral minister Ahsan Iqbal, a member of the federal negotiating team, was also seen returning empty-handed last Thursday eve­ning after trying his luck at four different ATMs in the capital.
Even those using mobile banking apps faced disappointment as internet and data services had been drastically throttled during the week, disrupting electronic transactions.
 
 

“I had money in my account but no way to access it,” said Rakhshanda Maqbool, a schoolteacher, expressing frustration after finally withdrawing her salary on Monday.
With fresh cash in hand, cro­wds also poured into grocery sto­res and markets, where sales far exceeded the usual day’s turnover. Many households had run out of food supplies during the weeklong closure, while shortages of medicines and household goods had also deepened.
“Today’s footfall was extraordinary,” said Zafar Mir, owner of a local grocery chain. “People were desperate to restock after a week of uncertainty and shortages.”
Pharmacies, though technically exempt from the shutdown, had also remained largely closed. Faisal Javed, owner of a leading pharmacy in Muzaffarabad, said, “We had to call in all our staff to­­day. Many customers prefer buying medicines only from us, and they had been waiting for days.”
Educational institutions, too, regained their usual hustle and bustle, with students returning to classrooms after an unplanned break.
Meanwhile, a meeting of 16 government secretaries was held under the chairmanship of AJK Chief Secretary Khushhal Khan to review implementation of the decisions reached in the agreement between the federal ministers and the JAAC.
“We have already moved a summary for cabinet approval of the agreement,” Mr Khan told Dawn. “A reference has also been sent to the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs for ratification by the federal cabinet.”
He confirmed that all detained JKJAAC activists had been released.

Senior police officials told Dawn a group of armed men stormed into the Qazi Court building in the Maskan Kalat area, about 30 kilometres from Kharan city, at around 11:30am, while the judge was hearing cases.
They held Judge Muha­mmad Jan and other court staff hostage, ransacking records and damaging office furniture and other items on the premises.
“Armed terrorists stor­med into the court and set the courtroom and other sections of the Qazi Court on fire,” Deputy Inspector General of Police for Rak­h­shan region, Abdul Ha­yee Aamir Baloch, told Dawn.
The court building was gutted, and the attackers also destroyed the court’s records.
While fleeing after torc­hing the courtroom and other offices, the assailants kidnapped the judge at gunpoint. “The terrorists kidnapped the Qazi Court judge and also made off with two vehicles, including the judge’s official vehicle and that of a lawyer,” DIG Baloch said.
Security forces, including the Frontier Corps, rushed to the site soon after receiving information about the incident. They cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to trace those involved in the attack and the kidnapping. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident so far.

• Trump looking for swift resolution, but insiders say it may take days to iron out all the details
SHARAM EL SHEIKH / WASHINGTON: Two years since the events of Oct 7, 2023, delegations from Israel and Hamas began indirect negotiations in Egypt on Monday, which the US hopes will bring an end to the war in Gaza.
However, in a surprising turn of events, the White House on Monday appeared not to outright reject the prospect of recognising a Palestinian state in the future.
 
 

The talks between the two sides facing contentious issues, such as demands that Israel pull out of the enclave, and the disarming of Hamas.
Egyptian state TV reported that the talks had begun at the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh.
“I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST,” Trump said in a social media post.
But both sides are seeking clarifications of crucial details, including over issues that have wrecked all previous attempts to end the war and could defy any quick resolution.
Though Trump says he wants a deal quickly, an official briefed on the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he expected the round of talks kicking off on Monday would require at least a few days.
An official involved in ceasefire planning and a Palestinian source said Trump’s deadline to send all hostages back within 72 hours could be impossible to meet in the case of bodies of dead hostages, some of which would need to be located and recovered from burial sites scattered across the battlefield.
A Palestinian official close to the talks was sceptical about prospects of a breakthrough given deep mutual mistrust, saying Hamas and other Palestinian factions were worried that Israel might ditch negotiations once it recovered the hostages.
Negotiators from Hamas will seek clarity on the mechanism to achieve a swap of remaining prisoners — both alive and dead — for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel, as well as an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and a ceasefire, according to a statement put out by the Islamist group late on Sunday.
A thorny issue is likely to be the Israeli demand, echoed in Trump’s plan, that Hamas disarm, a Hamas source told Reuters. The group has insisted it will not disarm unless Israel ends its occupation and a Palestinian state is created.
White House briefing
In a surprising turn of events, the White House on Monday appeared not to outright reject recognising a Palestinian state in the future, after being asked about the matter.
“If Hamas does agree to relinquish power and give it up, cede power to this transitional technocratic government, if that does happen, would the Trump administration then recognise a Palestinian state?” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked during a press briefing on Monday.
“Look, I don’t want to get ahead of the technical talks right now… they’re extremely sensitive,” she responded.
“There’s many things to discuss. Of course, this is hopefully – we expect, and we hope – going to be one of the greatest peace deals this world has ever seen. And the Trump administration is working diligently and working very hard to get there”.

• Minister underscores limited window to support farmers; forms three task forces
• KP minister urges committee to formulate aid package proportionate to provincial NFC shares
• Punjab announces tax break for flood-hit areas, will start handing out compensation cheques to survivors from today
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: A high-powered cabinet committee on agriculture, climate change and flood emergencies on Monday put out in the open a nonchalant approach of the federal ministers and provincial governments towards flood-loss assessment ahead of a support package by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expected by the end of this month.
At the start of the first meeting of the cabinet forum, committee convener Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal was irked by the absence of federal ministers for finance, water resources, housing, climate change and power and their subordinates from the meeting.
Similarly, he also took exception to the lack of representation from Punjab and Sindh, saying he would report this non-serious attitude on such a grave issue to the prime minister.
 
 

Subsequently, the water, climate, power, and housing ministers showed up at the meeting. Sindh was apparently conspicuous by its absence, coinciding with PPP’s walkout from the National Assembly due to a political rift with the PML-N, while flood-ravaged Punjab was represented by a special secretary.
Balochistan’s minister for agriculture was present along with KP’s ministers for agriculture and finance, whose preparedness and contribution were appreciated by Mr Iqbal.
The planning minister deplored that the Rabi season was now starting that offered a window of no more than two weeks for the government to support the flood-affected farmers and lead them towards a new crop with greater financial value. Instead, he suggested the use of canola, priced around $700 per tonne in the international market, compared to $250-300 per tonne for wheat.
KP’s agriculture minister reported that his province was already at the cusp of an olive revolution with the plantation over around 700,000 acres, potentially sufficient to meet all of Pakistan’s requirement within a period of 3-4 years.
The province had also been fortunate to have successful plantation of saffron to follow soon. In the short term, he reported, the KP government was providing free seeds and fertilisers from its own resources and was in touch with the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank for a comprehensive support package for rain- and flood-affected people.
 
 

KP’s Finance Minister Muzammil Aslam proposed that the PM’s package for flood-affected people should not be Punjab and Sindh centric in the name and cost of smaller provinces.
He demanded that it should be proportionate to provincial National Finance Commission (NFC) shares so that gas subsidy for fertilisers was not consumed only in Punjab or for political reasons in Sindh, given the fact that KP ultimately also faced the difficult situation from a ban on the wheat trade. The sources said the planning minister acknowledged that KP’s stance over the past 18 months at all national forums had been from a national perspective and above provincial and political angles.
Mr Iqbal was unhappy to know that despite flood devastations, the Ministry of National Food Security and the provinces had poor coordination over flood losses and both sides were waiting for each other. “We do not have unlimited time to waste while the opportunity is slipping through,” he was quoted as saying.
A representative of the Punjab government reported that the chief minister had been informed about the loss of crops planted on 2500,000 acres and the CM had set a target of wheat sowing over 16.5 million acres, up from 16.25m acres last year. Mr Iqbal hoped this target was also backed by an implementable plan.
The minister assured the provinces that a cabinet committee at the federal level had been constituted by the prime minister for a joint and coordinated plan and did not mean any federal intrusion. At the planning division, “we are here to provide you all a helping hand” for a better response.
Task forces formed
He also formed three dedicated task forces in consultation with the federal ministries concerned and the provincial governments. These task forces will prepare detailed reports within 15 days covering immediate agricultural relief and provision of seeds, climate change impacts and resilience strategies, and strengthening infrastructure to make it climate-resilient in the long term. These reports will be presented to the PM for final consideration.
 
 

He said providing short-term, medium-term, and long-term relief to farmers was the government’s foremost priority. “Provincial governments, in partnership with the federal government, must take swift steps to ensure that affected farmers are compensated and supported for the upcoming Rabi season,” he said, underlining the urgency of supplying canola seeds to farmers within the next 15 days, taking advantage of the soil moisture left behind by the floods. “I have arranged a 5,000-acre canola seed pilot project in Narowal through corporate sponsorship, because we cannot afford to lose time. This is a moment for urgent action—we must not waste it,” he said.
He also indicated the importance of extending interest-free loan schemes to the farmers through financial institutions and to gradually moving towards private insurance mechanisms to protect them from recurrent climate shocks.
It may be noted that the PM had constituted the committee last month to formulate, in collaboration with provincial governments, an agricultural support package to provide immediate relief to farmers affected by the recent floods.
Tax exemption for Punjab
Separately, the Punjab government announced tax exemptions for flood-hit areas, initiating compensation from Oct 7. The Punjab cabinet meeting presided over by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz approved a 171-point agenda, endorsing a series of initiatives mainly focused on flood rehabilitation.
“The distribution of compensation cheques among flood-affected families will begin from October 7,” the CM said. Compensation for damaged houses, livestock losses, and crop destruction was also approved, along with waivers on ‘Aabiana’ and agricultural income tax in 2,855 flood-affected villages in the province.
The cabinet approved the flood relief package under which Rs1 million would be given to the family of a deceased while Rs500,00 and Rs300,000 would be paid to a person with permanent and partial disability, respectively.
“The family of a fully damaged concrete house will get Rs1 million in compensation, while partially damaged concrete house will have Rs300,000. The family of fully damaged mud house will be paid Rs500,000 while Rs150,000 for a partially damaged mud house.”

Informed sources told Dawn that the Prime Minister Office (PMO) reached out on Sunday night to federal officers posted at the provincial capitals to use their good offices in streamlining the progress on pending matters and upcoming targets in line with commitments to the IMF, not only under the EFF but also the climate-related $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility. Similar instructions were also issued to key federal ministries.
The provincial chief secretaries and finance secretaries were directed to submit an update on their implementation status within 24 hours and to provide clear justifications for any unmet targets or delays. Informed sources said the Ministry of Finance had reported to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) that the governments of the larger provinces were not as forthcoming in cooperating on matters related to IMF commitments.
While the provincial governments — particularly Sindh and Punjab — had missed their targets for providing cash surpluses in line with commitments for the period ending June 30, they have also shown signs of lapses in the current fiscal year. Sindh has already announced a budget with a deficit of around Rs40bn. At the same time, Punjab has expressed discomfort with the stringent conditions, citing concerns over self-respect, even in the context of flood-related assistance.

Backlogs risk derailing review ahead of crucial weekend deadline

The PMO has also requested that the provincial bureaucracy share its updated reports with the Ministry of Finance. Informed sources said the IMF had already directed the authorities to put on hold disbursements for development schemes in flood-hit areas until clear need and loss estimates were available. The fund also expects the federal and provincial authorities to remain fiscally prudent.
The IMF has remained firm that flood support would be unacceptable at the cost of cash surpluses committed under the national fiscal pact, one of the key themes of the ongoing programme to ensure primary budget surplus targets. For FY26, Punjab is required to provide Rs740bn cash surplus to the Centre, followed by Rs370bn by Sindh, Rs220bn from KP and Rs185bn from Balochistan.
This comes amid discussions between the IMF and the federal authorities over revisions in macroeconomic indicators to account for flood-related losses. This may involve a downward official revision of the economic growth projection to around 3.5pc from 4.2pc in the budget, and higher than the anticipated inflation, now exceeding 8pc, compared to the budgeted 7pc. That would involve cascading impact on many other sectors, including revenue collection, imports and exports, besides fiscal and current account targets.
Under the national financial pact, the provinces had amended their agricultural income tax regimes to align with federal income tax rules but they appeared unwilling or unprepared, or both, to ensure effective collections by the Sept 30 deadline linked to the end-October structural benchmark.
The provinces were also required to transition the goods and services tax (GST) on services to a negative list, effective FY26, and on moving to a capital-based property tax.
There are several reform measures committed to under the RSF, which involve greater responsibilities for provinces, requiring considerable preparation and homework, although their deadlines have yet to be met. These initiatives pertain to improving water system resilience and disaster response, financing water charges, and enhancing transparency through digitised records, particularly in Sindh and Punjab.
All the provinces had given an undertaking to the IMF that they would not introduce any policy or action that could be considered to undermine or run counter to any of the commitments or policies outlined in Pakistan’s sovereign agreement, as outlined in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.
The Centre had committed that “provinces agree to consult with the IMF through the federal Ministry of Finance before modifying or adopting any measures that could affect or undercut the program specified in the MEFP or which deviates from the goals of the programme”.
