Field Marshal Munir made the remarks during a meeting with the Deputy Ruler of Abu Dhabi and National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, during which they discussed “ways to further strengthen bilateral cooperation across various sectors, particularly in the fields of economic collaboration, investment and security,” according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The two leaders also “exchanged views on regional developments and emphasised the importance of continued coordination to promote peace and stability in the region,” ISPR added.
Field Marshal Munir, during the meeting, “expressed his sincere appreciation and gratitude to the government of the UAE for its longstanding investments and continued support to Pakistan’s economy and security over the decades”.
As per ISPR, the army chief “noted that such support reflects the deep-rooted historical relations between the two brotherly countries and commended the constructive role of the UAE leadership in advancing economic and social development in Pakistan”.
During the meeting, the field marshal reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to continuing joint efforts to “further strengthen this partnership in all fields, in a manner that serves the interests of both brotherly peoples and contributes to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region”.
Pakistan and UAE maintain close bilateral relations. Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a telephone call with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, lauding the Gulf country’s “consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan”.
Last month, Field Marshal Munir met UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at Qasr Al Shati Palace, where the two reviewed bilateral cooperation between the two countries.</p><small>2026-02-16 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16154419fc3663c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973689/pm-shehbaz-in-vienna-on-2-day-visit-presented-guard-of-honour-upon-arrival-at-austrian-chancellery' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz in Vienna on 2-day visit; presented guard of honour upon arrival at Austrian Chancellery</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif began his two-day visit to Austria on Monday, during which he will hold bilateral meetings and delegation-level talks, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said.
The premier arrived in Vienna for the two-day visit on Sunday, at the invitation of Austria’s Federal Chancellor Christian Stocker.
As per a PMO statement, PM Shehbaz arrived at the Austrian Chancellery today, where he was presented with a guard of honour and welcomed by Stocker.







The statement said that the national anthems of both countries were played at the arrival, and both leaders “introduced their respective delegations to each other before proceeding for tête-à-tête and the delegation-level talks, wherein both sides will take stock of the entire gamut of bilateral relations”.
PM Shehbaz also penned his remarks in the guest book at the Chancellery.
The premier is accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and one of his aides, Tariq Fatemi, during the two-day visit.
This visit marks 70 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
In its statement issued on Sunday, the Foreign Office (FO) noted that the trip marked “the first visit by a Pakistani prime minister to Austria in over three decades, the last having been undertaken by the then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1992”.</p><small>2026-02-16 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16144734f871d62.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973658/nothing-to-worry-about-law-minister-allays-concerns-over-imrans-vision-loss' target='_blank'><strong>‘Nothing to worry about’: Law minister allays concerns over Imran’s vision loss</strong></a><br><p>Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Monday allayed concerns over PTI founder Imran Khan’s vision loss, saying that there was “nothing as such to worry about”.
The statement comes days after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that Imran had only 15pc vision left in his right eye, prompting the apex court to form a medical team to examine him before February 16 (today).
Subsequently, a team of five doctors arrived at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday, where the ex-premier is incarcerated, and carried out a detailed eye examination, took blood samples and checked his blood pressure. However, the PTI rejected the check-up conducted without his family and personal physicians.
Addressing Bar Association Ferozewala in Punjab’s Shahdara on Monday, Tarar referred to the “latest report that had to be submitted” regarding Imran’s health.
The minister added that he discussed it with Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan and the “relevant” individuals before coming to the bar association.
Tarar stated: “They said thanks to God, the examination was carried out again on the Supreme Court’s order and there is no such thing about 35 or 25 [per cent].
“If he uses glasses for his eyesight, then one eye is approximately 70pc fine; the other eye is 6/6. There is nothing as such to worry about.”
According to the Cleveland Clinic, having 6/6 vision or 20/20 vision means you see the world with normal clarity and sharpness.
Before commenting on Imran’s health, Tarar stressed the need to “pay attention to our national issues”.
“We took difficult financial decisions, but the fruits of those can be seen now,” he stated, asserting that Pakistan was now “performing way better economically”.
The law minister stressed that political stability was crucial for economic stability. “There is a lot of noise these days that what is about happen and what has been done to the PTI founder,” he noted.
Addressing the PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, Tarar said it was the “first time that a government was taking official measures to deprive the citizens of their rights”.
He then referred to the blockades of major roads and KP’s entry and exit points by PTI protests, which have cut off the province from the rest of the country.

 

“Article 15 [of the Constitution] allows freedom of movement, but the blockage of motorways and GT Road on the official level is unconstitutional,” the law minister pointed out.
He expressed the hope that the PTI would “rectify” the situation itself after looking at the latest report. “Otherwise, the federal government will have to take some action,” Tarar warned.
He further said it was the responsibility of PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, as well as the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, to “ensure that the KP government adheres to the Constitution”.
Imran’s physician urges authorities to allow access
Meanwhile, Imran’s long-time personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf released a video statement, saying that last night he spoke on the telephone to the two Islamabad-based eye doctors who were treating the ex-premier for his eye condition.
He said he asked his colleague, Dr Khurram Azam Mirza, a Lahore-based retinal specialist, to join the phone call.







Dr Yusuf said that the phone call lasted 40 minutes, during which the doctors provided a background of when they first examined Imran, what his symptoms were, details of the treatment prescribed and what the future treatment plan.
“Their latest assessment was yesterday afternoon … they told us that, in their view, Imran had shown significant improvement as a result of treatment and his vision had improved significantly as well,” he said.
“I would be extremely happy if I was able to confirm that this was the case. Unfortunately, because I have not seen him myself and have not been able to participate in his care or talk to him, I am unable to either confirm or deny the veracity of what we have been told,” he said.
Dr Yusuf appealed to the authorities to allow him or Dr Faisal Sultan, ideally both of them, and physicians nominated by Imran’s family to examine the ex-premier and participate in his care.
He also called for Imran to be treated at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, saying that it was “appropriately equipped and of a suitable standard” for treating the PTI founder.
CRVO in Imran’s right eye
Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
Advocate Salman Safdar, who was appointed amicus curiae and met Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 10, last week submitted a seven-page report to the SC regarding Imran’s living conditions in the prison.
In his report, Safdar quoted Imran as telling him that “despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Imran told Safdar that approximately “three to four months earlier, until October 2025, he had normal 6/6 vision in both eyes”.
While his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yusuf had previously been permitted access, “despite repeated requests and a deteriorating ocular condition, no such access was allowed during the relevant period”, the ex-premier was quoted as saying.
A medical report dated February 6 — signed by Pims Executive Director Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander and addressed to the Adiala jail administration — was also submitted to the SC.

 

It stated that a qualified ophthalmologist from Pims conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiala jail of Imran and a “diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made”.
This was then followed by Imran undergoing medical treatment at Pims.
The ex-premier’s family and the PTI have been demanding that he be moved to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital for a comprehensive check-up, with the opposition even staging a sit-in at Parliament House for the past four days.</p><small>2026-02-16 11:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651128-cdf-asim-munir-expresses-gratitude-lauds-uae-for-investment-support-to-economy' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Asim Munir expresses gratitude, lauds UAE for investment support to economy</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement by the police, the blast occurred when a time bomb planted in a motorcycle detonated. A child was among those killed in the explosion.
Police sources said the blast took place near shops located in front of the station. Although police personnel remained unharmed, civilians in the vicinity were caught in the blast. Several of the injured are reported to be in critical condition.
Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) spokesperson, Muhammad Noman Khattab, stated that the victims were brought to District Headquarters Hospital and Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital.
Rescue 1122 officials said emergency teams promptly reached the scene and moved the bodies and injured to nearby hospitals.
Following the incident, a heavy contingent of the Bannu police reached the scene, along with the Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) and the Quick Response Force (QRF).
Police and security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search operation, added the police statement. Evidence is being collected and an investigation has been initiated.
The BDS team also engaged in clearing the affected site “to ensure timely and effective prevention of any possible further threat”, the police statement said.
Meanwhile, Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan visited the hospital and enquired after the injured, it said.
Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security forces coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence.
In January, two boys were injured in an explosion in the Domel area of Bannu, one of whom succumbed to his injuries after two weeks.
Earlier that month, the former nazim of Domel, Fida Muhammad Khan Wazir, was injured in a bomb blast outside his office.</p><small>2026-02-16 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6992507ac2f96.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973497/kp-remains-cut-off-from-rest-of-country-as-pti-continues-protest' target='_blank'><strong>KP remains cut off from rest of country as PTI continues protest</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained cut off from rest of the country on Sunday as activists of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf continued their protest on third consecutive day and blocked all entry and exit points of the province.
The PTI activists have blocked Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway at Swabi’s Anbar Interchange, GT Road at Khairabad Bridge, Dera Ismail Khan-Bhakkar Road, Lakki Marwat-Mianwali Road, Hazara Motorway at Abbottabad-Havelian Interchange, Kohat-Pindi Road near Khushal Garh and Upper Kohistan-Gilgit Karakoram Highway.
Protesters remained present all the time at exit and entry points and did not allow a single vehicle to enter the province, causing serious problems to passengers and motorists destined to Islamabad and other parts of the country.
Former governor Shah Farman, PTI Peshawar district president Irfan Saleem, deputy secretary information Ikram Khattana and other leaders of the party were present at Khairabad Bridge, connecting Attock district of Punjab with KP.

Commuters, motorists face hardships

Protesters have been demanding of the government to shift PTI founder Imran Khan from jail to hospital for treatment of his eye by doctors of his choice.
Speaking on the occasion, Shah Farman said that under Article-4 of the Constitution, no authority could deny treatment of his choice to a patient. He said that the people, who were not allowing treatment of Imran Khan through doctors of his choice, would be responsible if his eye was further damaged.
PTI workers blocked Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway near Swabi Interchange to all types of traffic, vowing to stay on roads till Imran Khan was shifted to hospital for medical treatment.
Vendors were seen selling various eatables while setting up stalls on motorway, converting it into a market. PTI Swabi general secretary Afsar Khan told journalists that they were not ready to go back homes under any circumstances.
“We will continue to sit here and if our demand is not accepted. This protest will continue. The federal government is responsible for the prevailing mess in the country,” he said.
Stranded commuters said that government should take action against PTI workers to open the motorway to traffic because people, especially patients, were facing difficulties.
“Where should we go, who should we beg, who should we ask and who should we request to open the motorway,” questioned Shahzad Khan, a resident of Peshawar.
Uzair Khan, a resident of Gundam who was seriously injured in a firing incident on Saturday, was not allowed to reach a hospital in Peshawar through motorway. The circumstances forced his family to pass through Swabi and Mardan but he did not reach hospital and passed away.
His relatives said that PTI workers were responsible for his death. During the last three days, it has been observed, that there is no rush at daytime at the venue of protest. In the afternoon youth start to arrive at rest area and in the evening there is a lot of crowd on motorway.
PTI workers blocked roads at four key points in Dera Ismail Khan district on Sunday, suspending traffic and causing inconvenience to commuters and motorists.
The sit-ins were held on Bhakkar Road, Multan Road, Chashma Road and CPEC route, bringing vehicular movement to a standstill at these locations. As a result, long queues of vehicles were seen on major arteries.
Witnesses said that several commuters remained stranded for hours, while alternative routes also experienced heavy congestion due to diverted traffic. The protest is being held on the call of PTI central leaders, who have urged workers to demonstrate over the deteriorating health of Imran Khan and demand his immediate release.
The district administration was monitoring the situation while residents called for restoration of traffic flow to ease their hardships.
PTI activists continued protest demonstrations in Lakki Marwat and Karak districts on the second consecutive day on Sunday.
A good number of party workers led by former district nazim Ishfaq Ahmad Khan Minakhel gathered at Darra Tang Point where they closed Bannu-Mianwali road, linking KP with Punjab and Islamabad via CPEC route.
The closure of road on the second consecutive day troubled transporters and commuters as passenger and good transport vehicles queued up on both sides of the main artery.
On the occasion, the former district nazim said that denial of access to healthcare and maltreatment by federal government had led to loss of Imran’s vision. He said that PTI activists had come on roads to hold peaceful protests against the PML-N government, which was responsible for the poor health of their party leader.
In Karak, the PTI workers gathered outside Nashapa oil and gas field and staged a sit-in there. They stopped supply from the oil and gas field as oil tankers could not enter or come out of the area.
An official of district administration confirmed disruption of oil supply from the field. PTI district president Inayat Khattak said that leaders and workers of the party decided in a meeting to shut down oil and gas fields in Makori, Nashapa and Gurguri to record their protest against non-provision of treatment facilities to Imran Khan.

The election was the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina. Rahman is a scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties.
In a statement issued today, the FO said that Iqbal will represent Pakistan at the oath-taking ceremony, which is scheduled to be held on February 17 in Dhaka.







FO added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was unable to attend “due to a prior overseas engagement.”
“Pakistan’s participation in the ceremony reflects its support for Bangladesh’s democratic process and underscores its commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries,” the statement added.
Rahman is the son of former Bangladeshi president Ziaur Rahman and the country’s former prime minister Khaleda Zia. He returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.
On Feb 13, BNP won an overwhelming two-thirds majority in the country’s general elections. The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.
Following the election results last week, President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz extended their felicitations to the BNP and its leader, Rahman, on securing a landslide majority.
President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh. While PM Shehbaz said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership and strengthening the two countries’ “historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations.”</p><small>2026-02-16 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1614235727aa9f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973659/corrigendum' target='_blank'><strong>Corrigendum</strong></a><br><p>A story titled “Imran Khan’s right eye vision ‘improving’, says sister citing report” was published by Dawn.com on February 16.

The sit-in, which began on Friday, was announced hours after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting a strong response from the opposition alliance.
TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Yousafzai, speaking to Dawn, said it was a surprising step that all the routes had been cleared.
On Friday, roads leading to Parliament House were blocked ahead of the sit-in.
“First of all, we are going to have breakfast after four days, as previously we were eating only dates and biscuits and were being forced to drink tap water. It has been decided to merge the sit-in at the Parliament lodges with the one at Parliament House,” he said.
The opposition’s sit-in was initially held at three places, including the Parliament House, led by TTAP head Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. The protest outside the Parliament lodges was led by PTI parliamentarians, while at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, KP CM Sohail Afridi led the demonstration.







“Moreover, as the government is going to file a report regarding Imran Khan’s health in the Supreme Court, we will examine it and will take a further decision,” Yousafzai told Dawn.
Yousafzai stated that the sit-in was going to continue until all demands were accepted by the government.







On Sunday, a team of doctors examined the PTI founder at Adiala Jail and left the premises after around an hour, sources said.
The party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”.
Speaking to reporters earlier on Sunday, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital.
“We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party.
“We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. Moreover, we have also decided to approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Monday to get justice and the right to medical treatment for Imran,” he told Dawn.
A TTAP leader, speaking on condition of anonymity on Sunday, said they had been told the previous night that Imran would be shifted to Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, but later received messages suggesting the sit-in should be called off first.
The TTAP had also alleged that access to food, water and medicines had been blocked for protesters inside Parliament House for a third consecutive day, a day earlier, calling it a violation of democratic and constitutional values.</p><small>2026-02-16 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651111-medical-team-fully-satisfied-with-imran-khans-eye-treatment-says-law-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Medical team 'fully satisfied' with Imran Khan's eye treatment, says law minister</strong></a><br><p>

Naushahro Feroze Senior Superintendent of Police Mir Rohal Khoso told Dawn that all six people who died were travelling in the car, while the trailer’s driver was injured.
He said the accident took place between 5am and 6am, adding that “ostensibly, speeding and brake failure were probable reasons,” but the matter was being probed further.
SSP Khoso elaborated that one side of the National Highway in the district was under construction, which was a “contributory factor behind increasing accidents”.
He stated that, in collaboration with the motorway police, it has been decided to set up five points for checking the speed and fitness of vehicles to control the rise in accidents.
Sindh Inspector General (IG) Javed Alam Odho, in a statement, ordered the Naushahro Feroze SSP to probe the accident and register a case.
Expressing his grief over the loss of lives, IG Odho ordered that legal action be taken against those responsible after determining the causes behind the accident.
Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, with the main reasons including speeding, hazardous overtaking, and disregard for traffic rules.
On Sunday, at least 11 people were killed and eight were injured after a bus collided with a trailer on the National Highway near Tando Masti in Sindh’s Khairpur district.
A day before that, 13 people died in a traffic accident involving an oil tanker and a passenger bus on the M9 Motorway near Karachi.
Crackdown against overloading and speeding ordered
In his statement, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah expressed his grief over the loss of lives in the accident and conveyed his condolences to the bereaved families.
“We share the grief of the bereaved families,” he was quoted as saying in the statement issued by his spokesperson, Abdul Rasheed Channa.
The statement said that the car involved in the incident was heading from Larkana Division’s Nasirabad taluka to Karachi.
CM Murad also issued directives for the strict implementation of traffic rules and regulations.
He ordered the Sindh IG to carry out a “crackdown against overloading and speeding”. He further directed that monitoring and fitness checks of vehicles be made more stringent across the province.
“The protection of the public’s life and property is the government’s top responsibility,” the chief minister noted.</p><small>2026-02-16 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651104-pindi-court-issues-aleema-khans-non-bailable-arrest-warrant-over-repeated-absence' target='_blank'><strong>Court issues Aleema Khan's non-bailable arrest warrant over repeated absence</strong></a><br><p>

On February 12, Imran, currently incarcerated at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, claimed that his right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, following which the Supreme Court (SC) ordered the formation of a medical team to examine him. The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. It was ordered that both the eye inspection and the phone calls be conducted before February 16 (Monday).
Although government figures on Saturday had hinted that Imran would soon be taken to a hospital, no such development had occurred till Sunday afternoon.
According to sources, Adiala’s jail superintendent, however, dismissed the development as a “rumour”, saying that Imran was only being examined and not being taken anywhere yet.
“The medical team will examine Imran’s eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the jail superintendent was quoted as saying by the sources.
At about 5:30pm, sources said that the eye examination, carried out by a team of five doctors, was completed. “A detailed eye examination and blood sampling were carried out, while his blood pressure was also checked,” they said.
“Senior doctors continued the medical examination for an hour,” they said, adding that the medical team was able to start the examination after waiting for two-and-a-half hours.
They said that the team brought eye examination equipment with them and that their report is “likely to be compiled soon”.
Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
On the other hand, shortly after the eye examination was completed, the PTI refused to accept the inspection, saying that without the presence of the PTI family and Imran’s personal doctors, the government’s stance was “deemed malicious”.
“Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan’s eye in Adiala Jail. The government’s claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the PTI said in a post on X.







“This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership. In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan’s family.
“And the family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan’s personal doctors are present during the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification.”
Aleema demands Imran’s treatment as per personal doctors’ advice
Earlier in the day, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said the party would not accept any medical board formed without the approval of the PTI founder’s personal doctors.
Aleema referred to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry’s post from Saturday, which announced that a medical board would be set up. She added, “Secondly, we are hearing in the news that Imran Khan is to be taken to Al Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi.

 

“Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment WITHOUT the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.”
The former prime minister’s sister affirmed: “We do NOT accept any medical board they set up and control! We do NOT accept any reports or results they manufacture.”
She added that the family was “extremely worried as to why they are resisting the selection of specialists advised” by Imran’s personal doctors.
“Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan’s personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan’s family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?” Aleema wondered.







Earlier on Sunday, Imran’s longtime personal physicians, Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, issued a joint video statement, reiterating that the ex-premier needed a comprehensive medical check-up that could be provided at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad.
“In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad,” read the post accompanying their statement.








‘Will continue sit-in to pressure govt’
Meanwhile, the sit-in by the main opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) at Parliament House over concerns regarding Imran’s health entered its third day on Sunday.
The alliance had announced staging the sit-in until the ex-premier was taken to a hospital of his personal doctors’ choice.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday afternoon, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital.
“We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party.
“We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. Moreover, we have also decided to approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Monday to get justice and the right to medical treatment for Imran,” he told Dawn.
He said that the government representatives, throughout the day on Sunday, remained in contact with the PTI and TTAP leadership but could not give a proper response that the demands had been approved.
TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai, while talking to Dawn, said that the sit-ins were being held at all three places, i.e. in the Parliament house, outside the Parliament lodges and at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, where the KP chief minister has been staging a sit-in.
“It is unfortunate that even water and food are not being allowed to reach the Parliament House. We have been eating dates and biscuits. Mineral water has been consumed, so now parliamentarians have been drinking tap water,” he claimed.
Yousafzai said that the strikes will be continued till the outcome. “History is in the making”, he said.
Earlier in the day, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan shared visuals of himself, TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Qaiser and Senator Faisal Javed, among others, sitting at Parliament House.







A TTAP leader, wishing not to be named, told Dawn that things have become more confusing rather than being streamlined.
“Last night we were informed that Imran Khan will be shifted to Shifa International Hospital [in Islamabad], but a demand was made that doctors in the medical board be changed, as including doctors of our choice will give a message that the government has gone on the back foot.
“[Therefore,] we decided to show flexibility and gave names of a few more doctors, and there was an understanding that we will not reveal their names in the media,” the TTAP leader said.
He added: “However, today we have been getting messages that first we should call off the sit-in and then Imran Khan will be shifted to the hospital and a medical board will be announced. How can we call off the sit-in without implementation of our demands?” he asked.
Replying to a question, the leader said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi — who is staging a sit-in at KP House in the capital — also contacted government representatives to make it clear that the situation could go out of his control if the issue was not resolved soon.
He added that the government representatives told them that the interior minister was in Sri Lanka, while the National Assembly and Senate chairs were also abroad, making it “difficult to decide” for the authorities.







In the evening, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) issued a statement, saying that Allama Nasir Abbas was in bad health and that a delegation of parliamentarians had arrived at Parliament House to deliver food to TTAP lawmakers.“Delivering food to parliamentarians is not allowed,” he said. “Female members are also inside, concern has grown.”He added that the delegation was at the door but was not allowed to enter the premises.“An atmosphere of fascism and oppression has been imposed on the country … The public mandate is being insulted,” Abbas added. “The leadership of the party that won 180 seats is in jail … it is unjust to give power to those with fewer seats.”
‘Inhumane, blatant violation of constitutional values’
Earlier, the TTAP said today was the “third consecutive day that access to food, water, and medicines has been blocked for the protesters encamped inside Parliament House”.
“This action is not only inhumane but a blatant violation of fundamental democratic and constitutional values,” it added.
The alliance further alleged that access to medicines was blocked for Senator Abbas, terming it an “extreme and condemnable act”.
“Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression,” the statement read.
The TTAP stated that its leadership was firm on its demands, adding: “History bears witness that yazidi (tyrannical) tricks, sieges and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands. Such tactics only add to the record of cruelty; they cannot silence the voice of truth.”
The TTAP reiterated its “clear demand” that Imran be provided full medical facilities at Islamabad’s Al-Shifa International Hospital, emphasising that providing quality medical facilities to a prisoner was the state’s responsibility, “not a favour”.
The alliance vowed that it would not be “cowed by tactics of oppression, coercion and siege”.







HRCP calls for ‘uninterrupted access’ to treatment
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed “grave concern over reports regarding the deteriorating health of prisoners affiliated with the PTI, particularly” Imran and former Punjab health minister Yasmin Rashid.
In a statement, the HRCP urged the interior ministry, the Punjab Home Department and the relevant prison authorities to ensure that “all such inmates are allowed immediate, independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to prescribed treatment”.
“Their condition must be verified with transparency,” the rights body stressed.
It pointed out: “Denial or delay of adequate healthcare to any detainee violates legal and constitutional guarantees, including under the Prison Rules, as well as Pakistan’s human rights obligations.”







Awaam Pakistan leader Dr Zafar Mirza, noting the government’s assurances and the development of Imran speaking to his sons on phone, said: “The last two days have proven the power of non-violent peaceful protest, as it has before many times in human history.
“Decision to let Imran Khan speak with his sons, move him to hospital, establishment of a medical board, all this has not happened in a vacuum and for nothing.”
However, Dr Mirza stressed that the former premier “still needs access to a personal physician, family, and his cases also need to be heard without politically motivated delays”.
“Awaam Pakistan is fully supporting the dharna (sit-in) as we are standing with the moral principle of human right to health care, and we are standing on the right side of history,” he affirmed.

Al Jazeera reported on Sunday that the Israeli government had approved the proposal to claim large areas of the occupied territory as property of the state if Palestinians could not prove ownership, a move which prompted outcry from Palestinian group Hamas, the Palestinian presidency, and political analysts.
“Pakistan strongly condemns the latest attempt by the Israeli occupying power to convert areas of the Occupied West Bank into so-called state property, and to expand illegal settlement activities,” the statement said.
It pointed out that these steps clearly violated international law and relevant United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, stressing that they “must be rejected” by the international community.







“The occupying power’s continued disregard for international law and its provocative actions undermine the prospects for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region,” it added.
“Pakistan calls on the international community to take concrete measures to end Israeli impunity, and ensure respect for international law,” the statement said.
It once again reaffirmed full support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and for the establishment of an “independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital”.
Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership. International law states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.
Palestinian group Hamas had condemned the decision on Sunday, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.
However, Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz described the move as an “essential security and governance measure designed to ensure control, enforcement, and full freedom of action for the state of Israel in the area”, according to the Jerusalem Post.</p><small>2026-02-16 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651098-woman-smuggled-from-bangladesh-seeks-reunion-with-family-after-40-year-separation' target='_blank'><strong>Woman smuggled from Bangladesh seeks reunion with family after 40-year separation</strong></a><br><p>

Akram and his father, Sajid, allegedly attacked a Hanukkah celebration in December. Sajid was shot and killed by police during the attack.
Akram has been charged with terrorism, 15 counts of murder, dozens of counts of causing wounds to a person with intent to kill and planting explosives.
He appeared in a Sydney court for about five minutes via video link from prison, according to a statement from the court and local media.
The timeline of evidence was also discussed, the court said.
The accused wore a green jersey during the hearing, which dealt mostly with technical matters such as suppressing the identification of some victims, local media said.
He reportedly spoke only one word — “yeah” — when asked by the judge whether he had heard a discussion about the extension of suppression orders.
Akram will next appear in court on March 9.
Speaking outside the court, Akram’s lawyer Ben Archbold said his client was being held in “very onerous conditions”, national broadcaster ABC said.
He also said it was too early to say whether Akram would plead guilty.
The mass shooting sparked national soul-searching about antisemitism, anger over the failure to shield Jewish Australians from harm and promises to stiffen gun laws.
‘Tactical’ training
Police and intelligence agencies are also facing difficult questions about whether they could have acted earlier.
Naveed Akram was flagged by Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019, but he slipped off the radar after it decided that he posed no imminent threat.
Police documents released following the attack said the two had carried out “firearms training” in what was believed to be the New South Wales countryside prior to the shooting.
They said the suspects “meticulously planned” the attack for months, releasing pictures showing them firing shotguns and moving in what they described as a “tactical manner”.
The pair also recorded a video in October railing against “Zionists” while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State terrorist group and detailing their motivations for the attack, police said.
They made a nighttime reconnaissance trip to Bondi Beach just days before the killings, documents showed.
And a few weeks before the Bondi Beach attack, the pair returned to Sydney from a four-week trip to the southern Philippines.</p><small>2026-02-16 07:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651073-planning-minister-to-attend-bangladesh-pm-elects-oath-taking-ceremony-in-dhaka' target='_blank'><strong>Planning minister to attend Bangladesh PM-elect's oath taking ceremony in Dhaka</strong></a><br><p>

The briefing took place during Wapda chairman’s visit to the under-construction Diamer Basha Dam and Dasu Hydropower Projects sites to review construction progress of the projects.
During the visit, the chairman was briefed that RCC works on the main dams of the projects will commence this year, as pre-requisites of the projects are now heading for completion at a faster pace.
During the visit, the chairman directed general managers, consultants and contractors of the projects to adhere to implementation plans in letter and spirit by accelerating the construction work to complete the projects on time.
In the first leg, the chairman had a detailed visit of Diamer-Basha Dam, being constructed on the River Indus, 40 kilometres downstream of Chilas town, and reviewed construction works on major sites including power intake, dam pit, downstream coffer dam, left abutment, flushing tunnel, guide wall, RCC batching plant and laboratory.
The general manager/project director along with the consultants and the contractors briefed the chairman site-wise achievements versus targets. At present, the construction is being carried out on 20 work sites of the project. Excavation work at the left abutment and dam pit (foundation) is substantially completed. RCC trials for the main dam have also been conducted successfully.
With completion of the right abutment’s excavation, placing of RCC for the main dam will start during the current year. Completion of the dam is scheduled in 2030. Later, the chairman had a meeting with local ulema and progress on confidence-building measures (CBMs) for uplift of the people in the project area was reviewed.
The chairman was informed that construction of a cadet college in Chilas has been completed, progress on Harpan Das model village stands at about 61 per cent while levelling of plots and additional works of roads, water supply and sewerage system are in progress.
The chairman was further informed that a contract has also been awarded for water supply scheme in Chilas town while bidding is in progress for construction of a rural health centre at Shatial in upper Kohistan.
In the second leg of his visit, the chairman visited Dasu Hydropower project in upper Kohistan district of KP.
His visit included tour of all key sites, including dam pit, underground power house and underground transformer cavern. The general manager/project director of the project informed the chairman that construction work has continued on 23 work sites of the project.
He was further informed that crushing and batching plants have been completed and they are now in operation. Pouring of RCC for the main dam will start during the current year. The 132 KV transmission line, meant for providing supply of electricity during construction of the main dam, is in the final phase of testing and commissioning, which will be energised within days.
Electricity generation from the project will start in 2028.

He stressed that if corrective measures are not undertaken, the matter would be taken to the “people’s court”.
Speaking at a press conference at the Quetta Press Club on Sunday alongside his lawyer Barrister Muhammad Iqbal Kakar and Prof Hanif Bazai, Mr Lashkari warned that if parliament fails to act, political parties will be forgotten by both history and the people of Balochistan.
He said that in the absence of corrective measures, they would take the matter to the “people’s court” and launch a political, constitutional, and democratic struggle with public support to stop illegal actions.
He said that on March 12 last year the Balochistan Assembly passed the Mines and Minerals Act, transferring sweeping powers over the land and mineral resources of the province to federal government. He said a seven-member committee, headed by a DG-rank officer, had been granted authority to allocate lands and mineral areas — powers that he said directly contradict the 18th Cons­titutional Amendment, which devolves authority to provinces.

Ex-senator Raisani vows to take matter to people’s court if corrective measures are not taken

He expressed concern that political parties, both inside and outside parliament, remained silent on the law despite their responsibility to safeguard the public rights and act as a bridge between the state and citizens.
He said no political party raised objections to the Act, prompting him and his colleagues to mobilise the people on the issue and reach out to political leaders, lawyers, journalists, and civil society to unite against this legislation.
He alleged that deals over Reko Diq had already been finalised and described the Act as a tool to strip Balochistan province of its rights. According to him, behind-the-scenes benefits, including assembly seats and other favours, were secured by some stakeholders.
The former senator said a constitutional petition challenging the Act is currently under hearing in the court, adding that despite an executive order from the Mines Department to suspend the Act, reports of tenders and allotments continue to surface. He claimed that repeated requests for official details have gone unanswered, and even efforts to obtain a copy of the chief minister’s executive order through the courts have seen no progress.
Mr Raisani claimed he did not believe in taking “backdoor routes” to power and said they have approached the courts seeking justice and protection for people’s rights from flawed legislation. He warned that future generations’ survival depended on control over provincial resources and criticised political parties for failing to fulfil their constitutional, political and social responsibilities.
He urged the judiciary to play an effective role and said that if the parliament does not review and amend the law, they will take the issue directly to the masses.

He’s a trained pharmaceutical chemist with an MPhil degree who used to work in the allopathic drug business. Over time, however, he grew disillusioned with what he describes as the “side effects of modern medicines” and turned instead to traditional healing.
He, therefore, enrolled for the Fazil-i-Tibb-wal-Jarahat qualification, hoping to practise Unani medicine.

Fazil-i-Tibb-wal-Jarahat is a government-recognised degree that trains practitioners in Unani medicine, a tradition of healing that has been practised in South Asia and modern-day Central Asia for hundreds of years. It is a healing system that employs herbal remedies to maintain a balance of bodily temperaments, based on Greek, Persian and Arabic influences.
Currently enrolled at a tibb college in Lahore, Ali says recent developments have left students like him questioning whether their education will mean anything in legal terms.
“I have come to know that a new legislation has been proposed, due to which not only will my college be closed in a few years, but there will be a question mark on my degree and licence to practice,” he said while talking to Dawn.
What changed?
The government has recently instructed colleges not to induct new students from the next academic session, giving rise to fears that the proposed merger of the National Council for Tibb and the National Council for Homoeopathy will lead to the closure of institutions that have trained traditional hakeems for decades and leave thousands of practitioners, many of whom are serving rural and low-income communities, without legal recognition.
The fears have become more intense after the health ministry moved to “right-size” its regulatory bodies through an Act of Parliament.

Practitioners say the decision places more than 70,000 hakeems holding the Fazil-i-Tibb-wal-Jarahat qualification at risk of losing their livelihoods and could result in the closure of all 40 tibb colleges currently operating across the country.

According to college administrators, these fears are not speculative but rooted in official instructions already issued by the government.
Professor Imran Lodhi, principal of Rawalpindi’s Ajmal Tibbia College, explained that traditional medicine operates within a distinct legal and educational framework that is at risk of being erased by the proposed merger.
“There are mostly three types of healthcare practitioners in Pakistan, i.e. allopathic, homoeopathic, and hikmat,” he said while talking to Dawn.

Outlining the regulatory distinction underpinning each system, he said that while allopathic practice is being done under the Drug Act 1976, hikmat is being carried out under Pakistan’s Unani, Ayurvedic and Homoeopathic Practitioners Act, 1965.
“Under the Act, regulatory councils, including the National Council for Tibb and the National Council for Homoeopathy, were established,” he said.
Professor Lodhi added that the education pathways for tibb students were already structured and regulated, as there were 40 colleges of hikmat and 140 homoeopathic colleges functioning across the country.
“Hakeems believe they are the only practitioners consistently working in far-flung regions, noting that MBBS doctors, even those from rural backgrounds, rarely practise in their native areas.”
Pakistan Tibbi Alliance General Secretary Hakeem Muhammad Sajjad has formally raised these concerns with the ministries of health and law. In letters, he has urged the government to halt consideration of the draft legislation.
He said the draft law, titled the “National Traditional and Complementary Medicine (NTCAM) Act, 2025”, contains serious gaps that could dismantle the sector.
According to him, the proposed changes stem from broader fiscal reforms driven by international commitments.
“As per the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), all the ministries and divisions have been taking steps for right-sizing,” Professor Lodhi added.
Last year, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the government planned to abolish 150,000 posts as part of IMF-backed structural benchmarks.
‘Unfortunate’ decision
From Lahore, Hakeem Sajjad pointed out that the financial burden of the councils was “minimal” for the government, questioning the logic behind their merger.
Other practitioners warned that the merger could make practice itself impossible.
“It is unfortunate that there are so many departments, which have been using tens of millions of rupees from the exchequer, were ignored, and two councils, which hardly get any amount from the exchequer, are being merged,” said Hakeem Sarfarz Bhatti from Gujranwala.
A senior health ministry officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the policy’s risks but said officials had little room to manoeuvre.
“We know that the decision will create a huge vacuum and administrative issues, but we are helpless. Merging both councils is similar to mixing black tea, coffee and green tea, as their scope and nature of work are different.
He added that internal disagreements between practitioners would further complicate the plan.

“Hakeems and homoeopathic doctors don’t recognise each other, so how will they be placed under one umbrella?” he said.
The health ministry, however, maintains that the process is consultative. According to spokesperson Sajid Hussain Shah, the merger aims to improve standards.
Loss of ‘affordable’ qualification
Akin to practitioners, students have expressed experiencing similar anxiety.
Sameera Kamran, a student at the Ajmal Tibbia College in Rawalpindi, told Dawn that she enrolled believing that tibb colleges offered an affordable path into healthcare, especially for those from lower-middle-income backgrounds. That belief, she said, had now been shaken.
“Annual fees at colleges ranged between Rs 35,000 and Rs 40,000, compared to medical university fees that could be up to five times higher,” she said.
Ijaz Ahmed, a fourth-year student from Narowal, agreed, saying tibb colleges remained the last viable option for many families.
“We have been paying Rs 300,000 for the entire course in colleges, but in universities, students will have no choice but to pay over a million rupees. The government’s move will close the doors to hikmat and shatter students’ dream of becoming tabeebs, especially those who belong to the lower middle class,” he said.
Both students also agreed that rural healthcare would suffer because of the decision.

“The majority of the basic health units (BHUs) in rural areas lacked doctors. So hakeems are providing treatment to the masses. There will be no one to take care of them if colleges are closed,” said Ahmed.
For students like Arsalan Ali, however, the debate remains deeply personal. He says his decision to study tibb was rooted in belief as much as career planning.
“I had decided to return towards the nature as there was a remedy for every disease in herbs. However, after spending over three years, I have been facing uncertainty regarding my future. I fear that soon the name of Tibb-i-Unani (Unani Medicine) will be eliminated from Pakistan, and medicines prepared by different companies will be sold,” he said.
He pointed to neighbouring countries where traditional medicine is actively promoted.
“On the other hand, that business is not only flourishing in India and China, but they have been earning a huge amount of foreign exchange from it. The traditional Chinese medicine is made under the theory of ‘Ying and Yang’, which refers to wood, fire, earth, metal and water,” he explained.
Ali added that Unani practice relies on individualised treatment.
“A number of books regarding human temperament were used by Hakeems, and they prescribe different medicines to different patients having the same complaint,” he said.
‘The last resort’
Patients, too, share stories of reliance on traditional medicine. Awais Siddique, a Lahore resident, recalled seeking help for his wife after exhausting hospital options.
“I had a baby boy after three years of my marriage, but after that, my wife started getting sick. At that time, I was residing in Sheikhupura, so I took her to the hospital, and they gave her some of the medicines due to which my wife started feeling a bit better,” he said.

He said her condition worsened after their second child.
“Later, she was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer, and doctors suggested taking her to Rawalpindi. But they informed me that the bone marrow transplant would cost me Rs7 to Rs8 million. On the other hand, my wife frequently required three to four units of platelets. It was impossible for me to arrange such a huge amount,” he said.
Turning to a hakeem was a last resort, he said.
“So, I went to a hakeem’s clinic, who prescribed three months of medicine, and just after two weeks, my wife’s platelets reached 150,000,” he claimed.
Siddique said the treatment brought “lasting relief”.
“After three months, hakeem sahib told me that my wife would never face the same issue and does not require medicine anymore. She has been healthy for the last two and a half years,” he claimed.
According to the Cancer Research Centre UK, there is no scientific evidence that traditional or homoeopathic treatments can prevent or cure any type of cancer.

Amid the increasing pressure, representatives of the Pakistan Medical Alliance met government officials earlier this month. A delegation, including Hakeem Sajjad, Professor Lodhi, and principals of leading Tibb colleges, held meetings with the Minister of State for Health, Malik Mukhtar Ahmed Bharat, as well as senior officials at the health ministry and the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), to discuss the survival and protection of the Unani, Ayurvedic and Homoeopathic Practitioners Act, 1965.
Until clarity emerges, students like Arsalan continue attending classes with no assurance that the system training them will still exist when they step out to practise.

ISLAMABAD: Carrying the largest outstanding loan portfolio on its books and a negative return on assets, the National Highway Authority (NHA) — the country’s logistics backbone — is the single largest entity bleeding the federal budget, exposing Pakistan to substantial fiscal risk despite the recent doubling of tolls.
The NHA is the “largest loss-maker”, operating on a “structural deficit model and reliant on budgetary support”, the Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) of the Ministry of Finance said in its Annual Aggregate Report on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) for the year ended June 30, 2025.
With accumulated losses of Rs2.074 trillion, the entity that owns and operates all the national highways and motorways accrued around Rs1.004tr in the last three years alone — about Rs295 billion each in FY24 and FY25 and Rs413bn in FY23.
Moreover, it stands out at the top of the SOE list, with the largest accrued financing cost of Rs210bn in FY25, as its toll revenue remains unaligned with debt servicing, leading to fiscal dependence and sovereign guarantee exposure.
“Currently, the NHA holds outstanding loans totalling approximately Rs3.1tr, with an annual debt accretion rate of Rs300bn. This debt portfolio generates Rs98bn in markup, which is expected to rise to more than Rs150bn per annum, creating a substantial credit risk for the government of Pakistan (GoP), which guarantees these loans”, the CMA said.
It said the presence of sovereign guarantees for public-private partnership (PPP) contracts added further financial strain, amplifying the government’s credit risk exposure.
With more than Rs115 billion in loans given by the federal government last year, it is also among the top borrowers. On the other hand, its net assets remained almost static over the last three years, actually declining slightly from Rs5.84tr in FY23 to Rs5.83tr in FY25. Its total equity has been declining over time from Rs2.57tr in FY23 to Rs2.27tr in FY24 and Rs1.95tr in FY25.
Conversely, NHA’s total liabilities have been increasing, making it the single-largest entity to accrue current liabilities. Its total liabilities amounted to Rs3.27tr in FY23, increasing to Rs3.54tr in FY24 and reaching Rs3.88tr by the end of FY25.

 

The CMU observed that National Highway Authority’s 2025 performance underscored its strategic importance yet exposed growing fiscal vulnerability. “Despite an impressive surge in toll revenues and build, own and transfer (BOT) project inflows, the authority continues to operate under a persistent deficit, driven by high depreciation and finance costs,” it said.
Operating income rose sharply to Rs83.1bn in FY25 (against Rs42.4bn in FY24), propelled by the doubling of toll income to Rs64.4bn. However, the overall income of Rs119.7bn remained insufficient against total expenditures of Rs408.1bn. Consequently, the deficit before levy and taxation stood at Rs292.98bn and the deficit after tax at Rs294.86bn, reflecting continued structural stress.
It noted that two critical components eroded National Highway Authority’s profitability. These include depreciation expense of Rs133.8bn, reflecting a heavily capital-intensive asset base and growing maintenance backlog and Rs193.5bn finance cost, up from Rs182bn last year, highlighting the escalating burden of debt and interest rate exposure.
The CMU advised diversification of funding sources through infrastructure bonds targeted at domestic institutional investors and international development markets.
It said the expansion of public-private partnerships for new road construction, maintenance outsourcing and service area development can shift part of the fiscal and operational burden to the private sector while improving efficiency and service quality.
The CMU also called for renegotiating loan terms with lenders to extend maturities, reduce interest rates or convert debt into quasi-equity instruments to create immediate fiscal space.

TOP European government officials who led a smear campaign against United Nations special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, have failed to apologise or withdraw their calls for her resignation, even after multiple reports confirmed the allegations were based on a fabricated quote.
France 24 and Reuters verified that Albanese did not describe Israel as the “common enemy of humanity” during a forum in Qatar earlier this month, an allegation levelled by Israeli officials and echoed by European ministers.
Transcripts of the event show she was referring to a global system of finance and weaponry. Yet diplomats from France, Germany and other nations have so far declined to correct the record.
Amnesty International has demanded that European states immediately withdraw their accusations. Its secretary general, Agnès Callamard, said ministers in Austria, Czechia, France, Germany and Italy had attacked Albanese on the basis of a “deliberately truncated video” that gravely misrepresented her remarks.
“The ministers that have spread disinformation must act beyond merely deleting their comments on social media — as some have done,” Callamard said. “They must publicly apologise and retract any calls for Francesca Albanese’s resignation.”
She described the refusal to issue corrections as political cowardice, pointing to the stark contrast between the speed with which governments condemned a UN expert and their reluctance to hold Israel accountable for actions Amnesty has characterised as genocide and apartheid.
Meanwhile, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation added its voice to the chorus of condemnations. In a statement, the bloc said the allegations were “based on misrepresented and fabricated claims” regarding remarks the rapporteur neither made nor endorsed. The OIC warned that distorting the statements of UN mandate holders risked undermining the integrity of the Human Rights Council.
Albanese also responded to the diplomatic fallout directly. Addressing the controversy, she clarified that her speech in Doha had identified the “common enemy” as the system enabling violence, specifically “financial capital”, “algorithms” and “weapons”.
“A lie was exposed. Instead of retracting it, the SYSTEM that enabled the genocide, attacks the messenger,” Alban­ese wrote on X. “France knows it stepped in something foul, but pride forbids correction.”
She noted that three European governments had accused her with a “virulence” they never applied to the perpetrators of violence in Gaza, where the death toll has reportedly surpassed 72,000.







Legal complaint filed in Paris
Legal pressure is now mounting in France over the government’s refusal to correct its public statements. Middle East Eye reported that Jurdi, the Association of Lawyers for the Respect of International Law, had filed a crime report with the Paris public prosecutor accusing the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, of disseminating false information by a public authority.
Barrot told the French parliament that Albanese had made “outrageous and reprehensible remarks”, claiming she had targeted Israel as a nation.
Jurdi argues that because the verified transcript proves otherwise, the minister’s statement makes up a misrepresentation that could endanger the UN expert’s safety.
Support for Albanese also comes from the cultural sphere. According to AFP, over 100 figures from the entertainment industry — including actors Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon and Javier Bardem — have signed an open letter defending her work. The letter, organised by Artists for Palestine, said the rapporteur was being targeted for her defence of Palestinian rights.

TIRANA: Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama will travel to Washington next week to join the first meeting of US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace”, he told a podcast on Sunday.
“I will be in Washington for the official creation of the peace council and the launch of the activities of this council,” Rama said in an interview with Albanian podcast Flasim.
The board, of which Trump is the chairman, was originally intended to oversee the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip after two years of the Israel-Hamas war, but its charter appears to extend beyond the Palestinian territory.
The first meeting is scheduled to take place on February 19 in Washington.
Permanent members of the “Board of Peace” must pay $1 billion to join, leading to criticisms that the board could become a “pay-to-play” version of the UN Security Council.
Trump launched his “Board of Peace” at the WEF in January, and at least 19 countries have signed its founding charter.
Some countries — including Croatia, France, New Zealand and Norway — have already declined to join it, and others have said they could only consider doing so if its charter were changed.
Rama has previously said his country would not pay to be permanent members of the initiative.
“Albania has the privilege of being a founding state, and it will not contribute financially to join or remain as a permanent member,” Rama said on Sunday.
Romanian President Nicusor Dan also announced on Sunday that he would attend as observer the first meeting of US president’s “Board of Peace”.
“Next week I will take part in the first meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, responding to the invitation addressed by the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump,” Dan wrote on X.
“Romania will have observer status and I will reaffirm our strong support for international peace efforts and our willingness to participate in the reconstruction process in the Gaza Strip,” Dan added on X on Sunday.







Netanyahu won’t attend
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not attend next week’s Gaza Board of Peace summit in Washington, with Foreign Min­ister Gideon Saar set to represent the country instead, officials said.
The statement was issued as Neta­nyahu departed for the US, where he met Trump and signed on as a “Board of Peace” member.
Italy will also participate as an observer in the “Board of Peace”, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni confirmed on Sunday, Anadolu reported.
Speaking in an interview with Italian daily Corriere della Sera, Meloni said Italy had received an invitation to attend in observer status and would respond positively.
She noted that constitutional constraints prevent Italy from formally joining the body.
Meanwhile, Trump asked Hamas to move forward with disarmament under his plan for post-war Gaza, and said peace board members pledged $5bn to the Palestinian territory’s reconstruction. “Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarisation,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, ahead of a Feb 19 meeting of the board in Washington.
He added that member states of the “Board of Peace” had “committed thousands of personnel” to join the International Stabilisation Force.

In a late-night announcement, the petroleum division said the revision followed movements in international markets and recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to the announcement, the ex-depot price of HSD has been increased by Rs7.32 per litre (2.7pc) to Rs275.70 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs268.38 per litre. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
The ex-depot petrol price was increased to Rs258.17 from Rs253.17 per litre, up 2pc. Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
The government is currently charging about Rs105 per litre on petrol and about Rs97 per litre on diesel. Although, general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, yet the government is charging petroleum levy at the rate of Rs79 per litre on diesel and Rs87 per litre on petrol and other high octane products. This also includes Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs17-18 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and HSD are the major revenue spinners with their monthly average sales of about 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes per month compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene. The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through petroleum levy alone in FY2025 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470 trillion during current fiscal year.

JERUSALEM: The Israeli government has approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property”, for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of the international law that states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories, Al Jazeera reported.
The development was annou­nced by Israeli public broadcaster KAN on Sunday when Israeli forces killed at least 12 Palest­inians in less than 24 hours, according to Gaza’s civil defence agency.
The proposal, approved by the Israel security cabinet, was submitted by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defence Minister Israel Katz. “We are continuing the settlement revolution to control all our lands,” Smotrich said.
The Palestinian Presidency slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, Wafa news agency reported.
Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership. International law states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.
However, Katz described the move as an “essential security and governance measure designed to ensure control, enforcement, and full freedom of action for the state of Israel in the area”, the Jerusalem Post stated.
Palestinian group Hamas condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.
In a statement, the group called the approval “a null and void decision issued by an illegitimate occupying power. It is an attempt to forcibly impose settlement and Judaisation on the ground, in flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN resolutions.”
De facto annexation
Analysts describe the move as a de facto annexation of the Palestinian territory, warning that it will profoundly reshape its civil and legal landscape by eliminating what the Israeli ministers cal­led longstanding “legal obstacles” to the expansion of illegal settlements there.
Speaking from Ramallah, political analyst Xavier Abu Eid told Al Jazeera that Israel is “packing annexation into some sort of a bureaucratic move”. He said the International Court of Justice in 2024 said that Israeli actions amount to annexation of the occupied West Bank.

 

“People should understand this is not just a step towards annexation, we are experiencing annexation as we speak today.
What the Israeli government is doing is implanting their political programme — a policy that has already been presented,” he said.
Strikes amid ceasefire
In multiple strikes since dawn on Sun­day, Israeli forces killed at least 12 people, Gaza’s civil defence agency reported.
Despite a US-brokered truce that entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the Palestinian territory, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for violating the agreement.
The civil defence agency said five people were killed and several injured in the attack on a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia, five others were killed and several injured in a separate early morning strike in the southern city of Khan Yunis, and another Palestinian was killed in Israeli shelling in Gaza City. Besides, Israeli gunfire killed one person in Beit Lahia in north Gaza, it added.
“Israel doesn’t understand ceasefires or truces,” said Osama Abu Askar, who lost his nephew in the Jabalia attack.
He said the people were killed as they slept. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 601 Palestinians have been killed since the truce began, while Israel claimed at least four of its soldiers were killed in the same period.

WASHINGTON: After Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir discussed “global and regional security dynamics” with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a senior US diplomat has highlighted Pakistan’s key role in Washington’s global strategy.
US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz highlighted Pakistan’s role in Washington’s global and regional diplomacy.
“We could walk around the world — Kashmir and India and Pakistan — where we faced a very serious nuclear escalation,” he said during the Munich Security Conference, underlining enduring US concerns about strategic stability in South Asia.
Ambassador Waltz also linked Pakistan to multilateral diplomacy. “The United Nations Security Council created the ‘Board of Peace’ — unanimously — with countries such as Pakistan, our friends in the UK, France and others,” he said.
He further highlighted Islamabad’s role in Washington’s engagement with Muslim-majority nations. “…having our goal of a network of friends — Muslim-majority nations such as Turkiye, Pakistan and Indonesia involved,” he said.
In another reference to regional coordination, he added: “…the President [Donald Trump] convened the countries of the region and the Muslim-majority nations, namely Pakistan, Turkiye and Indonesia.”
Earlier, during their meeting, Field Marshal Munir and Secretary Rubio focused on “matters of mutual interest, including global and regional security dynamics and counterterrorism cooperation”, said a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where Field Marshal Munir also engaged with European and international military leaders to discuss pressing security challenges.
In his talks with German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, the Chancellor’s foreign and security policy adviser Gunter Sautter, and Chief of Defence Carsten Breuer, Field Marshal Munir discussed contemporary security threats, bilateral defence cooperation, and the need to promote global peace and security through multilateral dialogue.
The CDF also held talks with Renato Rodrigues de Aguiar Freire, chief of the joint staff of the Brazilian Armed Forces, and Rodolph Haykal, commander of the Lebanese Armed Forces, focusing on measures to enhance bilateral defence collaboration and address regional security challenges.
According to the ISPR, the visit and accompanying engagements were aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s defence ties and expanding cooperation with partner countries on key security issues.

Per a first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn, the incident took place in Jhelum at Mirza’s Qur’an-o-Sunnat Research Academy at the end of a lecture.
According to the complainant Muhammad Kashif Qureshi, a core member of the academy, attendees were returning home after listening to the lecture, but some of them stayed back to take selfies with Engineer Mirza.
“Just then, a man attacked Engineer Mirza by grabbing his collar, throwing punches at him, and removing his turban,” the FIR quoted Qureshi as saying.
“He violently threw his honourable turban onto the ground, strangled him with both hands to suffocate him, and loudly chanted slogans,” he added.
Qureshi was quoted as saying that people present at the site of the incident intervened immediately to protect the scholar.
“We then handed him over to the police on duty to ensure that legal action is taken against the criminal,” he said in his complaint.
District Police Officer (DPO) Jhelum Tariq Aziz Sindhu, while talking to Dawn, said that the police have arrested the alleged attacker and the FIR was filed against him under section 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
“Further investigations about the background of the attacker are underway,” DPO Sindhu added.
The DPO said that a four-tier security of police had been deployed at Mirza’s academy, adding that the police had repeatedly warned him to avoid taking selfies with the strangers entering as audience at his sessions.
The officer added that the scholar had previously been attacked too and was taken into the police’s protective custody last year under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) by Jhelum’s deputy commissioner after an activist of the banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) accused him of blasphemy and registered a case against him. He was later released on bail.
Section 3 of the MPO ordinance gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected persons to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order.
Mirza, a resident of Machine Mohallah of Jhelum city, frequently uploads his lectures and speeches on his social media accounts and has amassed 3.1 million followers on his YouTube channel.
In 2024, he was among 17 clerics whose speeches were banned by then-Jhelum DC during Muharram to prevent any potential sectarian violence.
The popular cleric survived an assassination attempt at a religious academy in March 2021. The suspect was taken into custody, and a case of attempted murder was registered against him.
The cleric had also been booked and arrested by the Jhelum police in May 2020 for derogatory remarks against some religious figures. However, he was later released on bail.</p><small>2026-02-15 18:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/15204119ef6a07e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973450/board-of-peace-members-have-committed-thousands-of-personnel-to-gaza-force-trump' target='_blank'><strong>Board of Peace members have committed ‘thousands of personnel’ to Gaza force: Trump</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Sunday said that member states of the Board of Peace have “committed thousands of personnel” to join the International Stabilisation Force expected to deploy in the Gaza Strip.
In a post on Truth Social, the US president said he would announce this development when the Board meets in Washington on February 19 at the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace.
“We will announce that member states have pledged more than $5 billion dollars toward the Gaza humanitarian and reconstruction efforts, and have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilisation Force and local police to maintain security and peace for Gazans.” Trump wrote.
He also stated that Hamas must uphold its “commitment to full and immediate demilitarisation”.
“The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History, and it is my honour to serve as its Chairman,” Trump wrote.



Earlier this week, Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi confirmed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting in the US, adding that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would also accompany him.
“I can confirm that the prime minister will attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting. He will be accompanied by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister,” Andrabi said during a weekly briefing of the FO.
He added that information about other members of Pakistan’s delegation and its engagements would be shared in due course of time.
The board was initially proposed in September 2025 and formally established last month. Under its charter, the US government serves as its official depository and Trump has designated the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace in Washington as the Board’s headquarters.
A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November last year authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza following a ceasefire that began in October under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas.
However, the ceasefire has remained fragile, with repeated violations by Israel.
Under Trump’s Gaza plan unveiled late last year, the Board of Peace was originally intended to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance following a ceasefire, before being expanded to address global conflicts.</p><small>2026-02-15 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/152031357aea1c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973443/punjab-cm-vows-strict-and-indiscriminate-action-against-price-hikes-hoarding-during-ramazan' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM vows ‘strict and indiscriminate action’ against price hikes, hoarding during Ramazan</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif on Sunday vowed that “strict and indiscriminate action” would be taken against those hoarding or raising the prices of goods during the holy month of Ramazan.
According to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), the first day of Ramazan is “likely to fall” on February 19, 2026. However, the final announcement regarding the beginning of the Islamic holy month will be made by the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, the sole competent authority, based on credible witness testimonies from across the country.
“Exploiting citizens in this sacred month will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” the provincial chief executive said in a post on X.
She added that directives and enforcement measures would be outlined in a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning (Monday).







The Punjab Food Safety and Consumer Protection department (FS&CP), earlier this week, instructed the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (Pera) force to ensure the availability of food items at officially notified prices across Punjab during Ramazan.
Chairing a departmental meeting regarding prices of essential commodities during Ramazan on Monday, FS&CP Special Assistant Salma Butt said the department had completed all preparations ahead of the holy month.
She said the Pera force should take strict legal action against those found involved in overcharging.
Additionally, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced a Rs38 billion Ramazan Relief Package a day prior, which will be disbursed among deserving people across the four provinces as well as the people of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
“Rs38bn will be disbursed through digital bank accounts among 12.1 million families, without discrimination,” said the premier while addressing the ceremony of the PM Ramazan Package 2026.</p><small>2026-02-15 15:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650981-ramadan-2026-islamabad-makes-registration-mandatory-for-street-iftar-arrangements' target='_blank'><strong>Ramadan 2026: Islamabad makes registration mandatory for street Iftar arrangements</strong></a><br><p>
