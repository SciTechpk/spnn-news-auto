The resolution urged the government to ensure a transparent, swift and conclusive investigation into the incidents, and bring the perpetrators, facilitators, and local and international sponsors of terrorism to justice in accordance with the law.
It also called upon the federal and provincial governments to further strengthen intelligence coordination, border security, and counter-terrorism mechanisms, with a special focus on Balochistan.

The two leaders met at the PM House in Islamabad. During the meeting, which CM Afridi said was held at the premier’s invitation, the two discussed issues related to KP’s finances and counterterrorism.
According to a statement reported by state broadcaster PTV News, the prime minister stressed the need for cooperation between the Centre and the provincial government for the progress and prosperity of KP’s people.
“Close and effective communication between the Centre and the provinces is indispensable for national progress and public service,” the premier was quoted as saying.
PM Shehbaz assured CM Afridi of the Centre’s cooperation as per its jurisdiction for KP’s development projects, infrastructure improvement, education, health and job opportunities.







The prime minister termed the KP government’s cooperation in establishing peace in the province as “unavoidable”.
“There is a need to improve the provincial government’s efforts to establish law and order,” he said, urging the KP government to strengthen provincial departments to counter terrorism.
Affirming that both the Centre and the provincial government would continue their efforts to combat militancy, PM Shehbaz said the KP administration should fulfil its constitutional duties to ensure peace and public welfare.
“The provincial government is empowered. Steps should be taken for the health and education of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s people. The federal government has always been striving for the betterment of the KP’s people,” he was quoted as saying.
Noting that KP was an “important unit” of the federation, PM Shehbaz assured CM Afridi that the Centre would “continue its full efforts in accordance with its jurisdiction” for the public’s prosperity.
Highlighting that the federal government was determined to work with all provinces, the prime minister said, “The targets of national unity, stability and prosperity can be achieved effectively through mutual consultation and collaboration.”
Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam were also present during the meeting.
Pending funds among other issues discussed: KP CM
Speaking to the media after their interaction, CM Afridi termed the meeting a “demand of his role”.
Noting that the premier had invited him, the chief minister said he expressed his condolences over the recent spate of attacks in Balochistan and condemned the terrorist act.
“We have always condemned terrorism wherever it has taken place and we will also condemn it in the future,” he asserted.
Asked about a “clarity” in his condemnation of the Balochistan attacks, the KP CM affirmed he had always had that clarity.
“Terrorism has no province or country or religion, and whoever carries out terrorism, we all should condemn it as a Pakistani,” he said.
“Issues concerning our province — whether it is the NFC (National Finance Commission), the CRBC (Chashma Right Bank Canal), NHP (Net Hydel Profit payments) or our other pending funds due on the Centre — were discussed,” Afridi said.

 

He further said that a “joint course of action” to combat terrorism was also discussed.
The PTI leader said no discussions were held regarding him being denied meetings with party founder Imran Khan, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail.
“There were no talks on anything political,” he said.
The chief minister asserted that the KP government had provided Rs26bn from its fund in the merged districts under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP).
Afridi said PM Shehbaz issued directives to Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal to meet Adviser to the KP CM on Finance Muzzammil Aslam later on Monday and make “every possible effort to solve these issues”.
“After this, two to three more meetings will be held,” the PTI leader said, adding that “one to two” meetings would be convened on counter-terrorism as well. “When decisions will be taken, they will be made public to you.”



“Perhaps as a political worker, I would never have sat there. But I deemed it appropriate for my people and my province, where the conditions are getting serious — whether financially or due to decisions made in closed rooms,” he said, adding that the meeting was necessary.
Asked whether the issue of displacement in Tirah or the Rs4bn corruption allegations made against his government were discussed, the KP CM alleged that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had issued a “charge-sheet” against the federal government for corruption to the tune of Rs5,300 billion, referring to its report issued in November.
“Rs4bn is a small amount. They are nothing compared to the sacrifices that my people in Tirah, Kurram and Bajaur are giving,” the chief minister said, adding that objecting to that amount was akin to “dismissing those sacrifices”.
In a post on X shortly after 12pm, PTI’s North Punjab chapter confirmed that CM Afridi had reached the PM House.







Excellent coordination needed between Centre, KP: Muqam
Speaking to the media after the meeting, Muqam welcomed the meeting. “Better late than never,” he quipped.
Noting that the KP CM was also invited previously but he did not come, the minister underscored the need for “excellent coordination” between the Centre and the province.
According to Muqam, it was agreed during the meeting that such communication should be maintained. He further said the point that “speaking against institutions was not right” was also brought up.
Pointing out that the people of KP were badly affected by terrorism, he called for politics to be kept aside and a “collective stance” adopted against militancy.
On CM Afridi’s complaints regarding pending funds, the minister said the federal government had paid all such amounts but if there were differences, they should be sorted out through talks.
Muqam further said it was agreed that there should be consensus between the Centre and KP. The minister also said no political matter, including Imran, was discussed.



KP CM’s attitude must change: Tallal Chaudhry
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said that the meeting between the prime minister and CM Afridi should have happened before.
He emphasised that without coordination between the Centre and a province, the people of that province suffer.
“Better late than never,” Chaudhry remarked, adding: “It was good that they (PM Shehbaz and CM Afridi) met.”
Asked whether the KP CM’s attitude towards the Centre should change, the minister replied in the affirmative.
“It should, otherwise the people of his province would grab his collar. In 13 years of your government in the province, what have you given them? Slogans, songs? Nothing else,“ he remarked.
Responding to another query, the state minister said the National Assembly speaker’s office was open for talks, and a special committee formed for that purpose was also present.
He noted that the opposition had previously abandoned the talks one-sidedly.
When asked about the possibility of allowing Imran — who recently underwent a procedure for an eye ailment — to travel abroad for medical treatment, Chaudhry denied the need for it, saying the PTI founder was “absolutely fine”.
‘Outstanding dues’
Since becoming the chief minister in October last year, CM Afridi has repeatedly accused the federal government of stalling the release of funds allocated for KP.
The meeting comes a week after the KP CM wrote a letter to PM Shehbaz over what he dubbed the Centre’s “persistent failure” to release “constitutionally guaranteed” funds allocated for KP, particularly those committed for the merged districts under the NFC.
Contending that the lack of funds had “now translated into an acute fiscal and governance crisis for the province”, Afridi had demanded the “full and unconditional” release of all outstanding federal dues.
The KP CM maintained that his province was entitled to receive Rs658.4 billion under the NFC, but it had received just Rs604bn so far, leading to a shortfall of Rs54.4bn.
Addressing a jirga in Khyber on Sunday, the chief minister had said he was set to meet the premier in Islamabad on Monday to “plead the case of KP’s rights and secure our outstanding dues”.</p><small>2026-02-02 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02172528608424c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970625/pakistan-team-heads-to-sri-lanka-for-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan team heads to Sri Lanka for T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan cricket team on Monday departed for Sri Lanka for the T20 World Cup, which is set to begin on February 7.
In a post on X, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said that a 15-player squad was departing for Sri Lanka.







“The 15-player national squad includes Captain Salman Ali Agha, Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Mohammad Naeef, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usman Khan, and Usman Tariq,” the PCB said.
It said that the team would rest on Monday and Tuesday.
“The team will play a warm-up match against Ireland on Feb 4,” PCB added.
The T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, is set to begin on Feb 7.
On Sunday, the government gave the go-ahead for Pakistan’s participation in the tournament, but barred it from playing against arch-rival India on February 15.
The announcement came amid uncertainty regarding a possible boycott of the tournament over Bangladesh’s withdrawal following tensions with India.
A government source told Dawn that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh. According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.</p><small>2026-02-02 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02115301170251b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970595/pti-moves-shc-against-alleged-detention-of-workers-in-sindh-under-mpo-seeks-immediate-release' target='_blank'><strong>PTI moves SHC against alleged detention of workers in Sindh under MPO, seeks immediate release</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: PTI on Monday challenged in the Sindh High Court (SHC) the alleged detention of over 180 party workers during raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh under the controversial Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance.
On Sunday, the PTI alleged that the Sindh police carried out pre-dawn raids on the houses of its workers and leaders and picked up around 180 of them. The provincial government has denied the allegations of detention.
A two-member constitutional bench comprising Justice Muhammad Saleem Jessar and Justice Nisar Ahmed Bhanbhro took up the plea for hearing on Monday. Advocate Ali Tahir appeared as the petitioners’ counsel.
However, Justice Bhanbro recused from hearing the case.
Subsequently, the bench ordered the registrar’s office to fix the hearing for Tuesday as the “counsel pleads urgency”, according to a short order available with Dawn.
The case will now be fixed before another two-member bench of the SHC.
The petitioners — PTI Sindh General Secretary Mansoor Ali and Insaf Lawyers Forum President Faisal Mughal — contended that the order issued under the MPO, dated February 1, be declared impugned and sought the immediate release of the party workers.
The petition — a copy of which is available with Dawn — named 14 respondents, including the provincial chief secretary; the additional chief secretary; the inspector general (IG); the Karachi additional IG; the deputy IGs of Karachi’s East, West and South zones; and the SSPs of Karachi’s East, West, South, Central, Malir, Korangi, and Keamari districts.
The petitioners requested the court to declare the MPO orders “unconstitutional, illegal, without lawful authority, void ab initio, coram non judice, and of no legal effect”.
The party alleged in the petition that law enforcement agencies conducted “hundreds of illegal raids, storming into private homes without warrants, often in the dead of night, and abducting citizens without due process”.
It further alleged that during the raids, police personnel “[broke] down doors, vandalised property, and looted personal belongings” in the 180 “documented cases”.
The petition stated that the orders were given without “any disclosed or lawful decision, approval, or satisfaction of the provincial cabinet”, which it said stood in direct violation of Articles 4, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 25 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.”
The petitioners sought that the court declare the “impugned orders constitute a mala fide, colourable, arbitrary and politically motivated exercise of power, issued for an extraneous and collateral purpose, namely the suppression of political opposition and peaceful democratic activity, and not for the genuine maintenance of public order as contemplated by law”.
The petition also stated that the PTI, as a registered and recognised political party, “is constitutionally entitled ot organise, participate in, and carry out peaceful political activity, including meetings, protests, strikes, and political expression”.
It further prayed that the court “set aside the impugned orders in their entirety and suspend their operation forthwith”.
It added that the respondents should be restrained from taking “any action whatsoever pursuant to, in reliance upon, or in furtherance of the said impugned orders”.
The petitioners also requested the court to direct the immediate release of “all persons who have been arrested, detained, restrained, or otherwise deprived of liberty pursuant to the impugned orders, if not required in any other case”.
It further asked that “no fresh detention, arrest, or coercive action be taken against them on the basis of the same allegations, intelligence, or grounds”.
The petition prayed that the court declare the actions taken in relation to the orders “illegal, unconstitutional, without lawful authority, and violative of fundamental rights.”
The petitioners alleged that actions taken against the workers included “warrantless raids, home invasions, arrests, detentions, harassment, intimidation, and the detention of minors, women, and elderly citizens”.
It also sought that the respondents should present before the court the “complete original record, including all summaries, intelligence reports, recommendations, approvals, notes, and decision-making documents allegedly relied upon for issuance of the impugned orders, including any purported approval or consideration by the provincial Cabinet”.
The petitioners requested the court to initiate contempt of court proceedings against the additional chief secretary (home) and declare that he “has acted in willful disobedience and defiance of binding judgments of this honourable court passed in earlier MPO matters, and that the repeated issuance of identical unlawful orders amounts to disregard of judicial authority and prima facie contempt of court”.
They requested the court to ensure that no preventive detention order under the MPO Ordinance should be issued in Sindh without “strict compliance with constitutional requirements, individualised satisfaction, and demonstrable approval of the provincial Cabinet”.
The petitioners asked the court to issue orders “restraining respondents from misusing” provisions under the MPO, particularly, as a “substitute for ordinary criminal law or as a tool for political suppression”.
“Declare that the existence of any alleged alternate remedy under the MPO Ordinance does not bar the constitutional jurisdiction of this honourable court in matters involving deprivation of liberty and mass unlawful detention,” the petition read.
It further said that the court should “grant any consequential, incidental, or ancillary relief necessary to fully restore and protect the fundamental rights of the affected citizens, including protection against re-arrest on the same or similar grounds”.
‘Repression, deception, and abuse of power’
Meanwhile, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh assailed the government for the “arrests”, stating that, “180 PTI office-bearers and workers were arrested and sent to jail under MPO-3 for one month, not for violence, but for announcing a peaceful, voluntary strike on February 8.”
In a post on X, Sheikh claimed that while the government ministers “publicly denied arrests and MPO orders till late night, the detention orders were quietly issued the same night, and detainees were shifted to jail”.
“This is not governance; it is repression, deception, and abuse of power,” he added.







On Sunday, the Sindh government had categorically rejected PTI’s claims, calling them “completely false and misleading”.
Senior Sindh Minister Sharjeel Memon, who also holds the portfolio of information, said no mass arrests or detentions under MPO had taken place.
He told Dawn the PTI statement was based on incorrect information and aimed at creating unnecessary political hype.
“Where’s the list of those arrested? It’s a blatant lie. The PTI is spreading false narratives to build momentum and gain political sympathy for its announced protest planned for February 8,” Memon said.
He added: “The provincial government has not issued any blanket detention orders against PTI leaders or workers and that law enforcement agencies are acting strictly within the law.”</p><small>2026-02-02 12:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02170254fa1d654.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970620/iranian-president-orders-start-of-talks-with-us-local-media' target='_blank'><strong>Iranian president orders start of talks with US: local media</strong></a><br><p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the start of nuclear talks with the United States, the news agency Fars reported on Monday.
Following the Iranian authorities’ response to anti-government protests that peaked last month, Trump has threatened military action and ordered the dispatch of an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East.
While piling pressure on Iran, Trump has maintained he is hopeful of making a deal and Tehran has also insisted it wants diplomacy while vowing an unbridled response to any aggression.
“President Pezeshkian has ordered the initiation of nuclear negotiations with the United States,” the agency reported, citing an unnamed government source.
“The source said Iran and the US will hold talks strictly within the framework of the nuclear issue,” Fars added, without specifying a date.
The report was also carried by the government newspaper Iran and the reformist daily Shargh.
Iran said earlier on Monday it was working on a method and framework for negotiations that would be ready in the coming days, with messages between the two sides relayed through regional players.
“Several points have been addressed and we are examining and finalising the details of each stage in the diplomatic process, which we hope to conclude in the coming days,” foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said, without giving details on the content of any negotiations.
Trump had warned “time is running out” for Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb. But Baqaei said Tehran “never accepts ultimatums” and that he could not confirm any such message was received.
Regional players have pushed for diplomacy to defuse tensions.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was in Turkiye last week and held further calls with his Egyptian, Saudi and Turkish counterparts, he said on Telegram.
“President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal,” Araghchi told CNN on Sunday. “Of course, in return, we expect sanctions lifting. So, that deal is possible. Let’s not talk about impossible things.”
Baqaei said the rallying of neighbouring states around a diplomatic solution demonstrated a fear that any US attack would drag the region into conflict, echoing Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who warned on Sunday that a US attack would trigger a “regional war”.
Ambassadors summoned
The supreme leader also likened the recent protests to a “coup” attempt.
Authorities have said the protests, which were sparked by economic strain and exploded in size and intensity over several days in early January, were “riots” inflamed by its arch foes, the United States and Israel.
Tehran has acknowledged thousands of deaths during the protests, and on Sunday, the presidency published the names of 2,986 people out of the 3,117 whom authorities said were killed in the unrest.
Authorities insist most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”.</p><small>2026-02-02 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/021409347c03c2f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970610/pm-shehbaz-appreciates-partnership-support-from-world-bank-in-meeting-with-president-banga-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz appreciates partnership, support from World Bank in meeting with President Banga in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: World Bank Group (WBG) President Ajay Banga called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday as Pakistan acknowledged the group’s valuable support, which has been instrumental in advancing the country’s economic development and reforms.
According to the PM Office, the prime minister welcomed Banga for his first official visit as the president of the WBG.







The premier appreciated the group for its long-standing partnership with Pakistan and its commitment to supporting the development priorities of the country, especially through the 10-year WBG Country Partnership Framework (CPF).
Shehbaz also appreciated Banga’s leadership in transforming the WBG into a more impactful development partner.
He said that the government of Pakistan was vigorously working on an economic reform agenda, with a multi-pronged, comprehensive, structural, homegrown programme aimed at sustainable economic stability.
The prime minister also appreciated the support of the global financial institution in resilient infrastructure, agribusiness, digital development, energy, human capital, fiscal reforms, and increasing productive private investment for job creation and growth.
PM Shehbaz and Banga reiterated the need to fast-track implementation and ensure strong oversight to deliver impact at speed and scale on Country Partnership Framework (CPF)-aligned priorities. These measures would duly assist the prime minister’s initiative to address and resolve implementation bottlenecks in development projects.
PM Shehbaz also expressed the government’s commitment to structural reforms that would unlock job-rich growth and further strengthen investors’ confidence.
Speaking on the occasion, Banga expressed his gratitude to the prime minister for his reception and hospitality in Pakistan. He commended the government’s ongoing reform efforts and reaffirmed his commitment to deepening cooperation through a One World Bank Group approach.
He said that greater leverage of private resources, in addition to strong coordination with development partners, was necessary to meet the ambition of the government’s reform agenda.</p><small>2026-02-02 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02163601fe2629d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970615/pakistan-launches-first-polio-vaccination-drive-of-2026' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan launches first polio vaccination drive of 2026</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s first polio vaccination campaign of the current year was launched on Monday across the country.
The nationwide drive is being held from February 2 to February 5 in most cities, while Sindh is conducting a week-long campaign until February 8. Strict security measures have been taken in various districts, keeping in view past attacks on polio teams.
First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, in a post on X, said: “The first nationwide polio vaccination drive of 2026 is underway, with health workers going door to door.”
“This campaign is a vital step towards protecting our children and eliminating polio once and for all,” she stressed.
The first lady encouraged all parents with children aged five years or below to ensure their kids receive the vaccine every time it is offered, pointing out that this was the “only way to eliminate polio for good”.







Speaking at the formal inauguration of the drive in Karachi, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah noted that the campaign aimed to vaccinate 10.5 million children in the province.
CM Murad said 80,000 frontline workers would visit all neighbourhoods and added that they would be supported by more than 21,000 law enforcement personnel, including over 1,000 female police constables.
“It is my request to all parents that they administer polio drops to their children aged below five and save them from this debilitating disease,” the chief minister said.
CM Murad went on to urge parents to visit their nearest basic health unit if a polio team did not come to their house. They could also alert the assistant or deputy commissioner that a team had not visited, he added.







“It is a cause of shame for us that there are only two countries in the world where this disease can be found — Afghanistan and Pakistan,” he said.
However, he added, vaccination was the only way to get rid of it.
The Sindh CM also requested those “who have any kind of influence over others”, such as teachers, elected representatives at the town, municipality, or assembly levels, and politicians.
The chief minister also requested religious scholars to play their role in shoring up public confidence in polio vaccination.
“The World Health Organisation (WHO) has certified that these drops do not cause any disease,” Murad pointed out.
“This disease is so contagious that it can spread from one place to another if not eradicated. That is why the entire world has its eyes on Pakistan and Afghanistan,” he added.







The campaign in Sindh will cover 1,490 union councils across 30 districts during which oral polio vaccine drops will be administered to a total of 10.5 million children, including 8.9m children under the age of five years.
In a meeting last week, the CM was informed that the country reported 74 polio cases in 2024, 31 in 2025, and zero cases so far in 2026. Meanwhile, Sindh recorded 23 cases in 2024 and nine in 2025.
State-run APP, citing a press release issued by the Karachi commissioner’s office, said the polio vaccination campaign in the metropolis aimed to vaccinate over 2.1m children.
The report further said 22,000 polio workers, 2,700 area in-charges and 267 UC medical officers have been deputed for the drive in Karachi. To beef up security, over 7,000 security personnel will also be deployed.
Strict security measures
Polio vaccination drives were also launched in other parts of the country on Monday.
In Islamabad, health teams aim to vaccinate 466,000 children across the federal capital, APP reported.
Stringent security measures were taken in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where terrorists have often targeted polio teams.
In the Abbottabad district, 1,768 police officers and personnel were deployed, according to APP.
In addition to providing security to vaccination teams, police will also conduct search operations and establish effective checkpoints in the city and sensitive areas to maintain law and order, the report added.
The Tank district also saw personnel deployed across all areas to provide foolproof security during the campaign.

 

Continuous monitoring, field visits, and close coordination with other law enforcement agencies had been ensured to maintain a safe environment throughout the vaccination drive, APP quoted a police spokesperson as saying.
The Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU) also conducted a thorough sweep of sensitive locations.
Last week, when a high-level delegation from the Gates Foundation visited Islamabad, the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme reiterated its resolve to achieve the Roadmap to Zero Polio 2026.
Meeting the delegation, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had affirmed that the government was implementing a “comprehensive strategy and taking practical actions” to eradicate polio.</p><small>2026-02-02 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02155537367fe22.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970607/militant-violence-surges-in-january-after-december-lull-picss' target='_blank'><strong>Militant violence surges in January after December lull: PICSS</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: After a noticeable decline in violence in December 2025, the first month of the new year witnessed a renewed surge in anti-state violence, leading to higher fatalities among militants, civilians and security personnel, according to official statistics.
Data released by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) shows that combat-related deaths in January 2026 rose by 43 per cent compared to December 2025.
During the month, 242 militants were killed, while 73 civilians and 46 security force personnel lost their lives. Twelve militants were injured, while at least 71 civilians and 52 security personnel were also wounded.
PICSS reported that January saw 87 militant attacks nationwide, marking a 28pc increase from the 68 attacks recorded in December 2025. Of these, 38 attacks took place in mainland Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 20 in the province’s tribal districts (erstwhile Fata), 27 in Balochistan and two in Punjab.
Balochistan emerged as the primary theatre of militant activity as well as security operations. The province reported the highest monthly militant toll since the current wave of militancy began there in 2001.
Although Balochistan experienced relative calm for much of the month, violence escalated sharply during the final two days. Simultaneous attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) on at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security force operations, brought the province into sharp focus.
The month recorded at least three suicide attacks, two of them in Balochistan and claimed by the BLA. The province witnessed the deaths of at least 172 terrorists, most of them during the final two days of January.
Compared to the previous month, civilian deaths increased by 143pc, militant deaths by 35pc and security force fatalities by seven per cent.
Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals.
Punjab reported only two militant attacks; however, security forces carried out a coordinated crackdown across central Punjab, including Lahore, Sahiwal, Pakpattan and Mianwali.
At least 53 suspected militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore. Analysts say these arrests likely disrupted a major militant buildup aimed at targeting the city.

On Saturday, the military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan. 18 civilians and 15 personnel of security forces were martyred in the attacks on Saturday.
In a statement, posted on X, the TTAP condemned the attacks and expressed sorrow with the martyrs. It noted that “a terrorist attack in the province on such a large scale was a failure on the part of the provincial government and LEAs”.







The opposition alliance stated that the series of attacks showed the “extent to which the rule of law has become limited in the province and the lack of concern for the lives and property of citizens.”
“For how long will we turn a blind eye to the fact that the provincial government — which does not have the public’s support — is only interested in prolonging its time in power,” TTAP said.
The opposition alliance maintained that “only governments whose own moral standing was not under question were capable of combating terrorism”.
TTAP reiterated its demand for “free and fair elections” in reference to the 2024 General Elections.
It further stressed that “representative governments were the only solution to the problems, not rulers and systems imposed against the will of the public”.
During the early morning hours on Saturday, multiple terrorist cells attacked more than 10 cities and towns in Balochistan. The targets were primarily security and government installations.
Suicide bombers, including female attackers, were part of the assault force. Security forces engaged the terrorists in gun battles across the province.
During the skirmishes, 15 security personnel were martyred and 18 civilians lost their lives. As the attacks subsided, security forces launched a series of cordon-and-sweep operations to clear towns, cities, and the countryside of terrorist presence.</p><small>2026-02-02 10:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02140455c5af504.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970602/security-forces-kill-22-more-terrorists-in-balochistan-taking-48-hour-total-tally-to-177' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 22 more terrorists in Balochistan, taking 48-hour total tally to 177</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 22 more terrorists during the ongoing security sweeps in Balochistan, taking the tally of terrorists killed over the past two days to 177, said security officials.
Terrorists carried out a large-scale coordinated attack in the province on Saturday. The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan on Saturday, responding to which the security forces killed more than 150 terrorists.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The terrorists were killed overnight as security sweeps continued across the province following Saturday’s attack, with security officials adding that the “noose is tightening”.
Mobile internet services remain suspended
Residents of Quetta and other cities in Balochistan continued to face difficulties on Monday as mobile internet services remained suspended for the third day in a row.
Mobile phone data was suspended in Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Khuzdar, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan and other cities on Saturday.
Balochistan’s Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Hamza Shafqaat told Dawn that the services would remain suspended today, but were expected to be restored tomorrow.
This is not the first time that the government has suspended internet services in Balochistan for security reasons: in November, it suspended mobile internet services in all 36 districts of the province for about a week.

Addressing the media on Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti expressed firm resolve to eliminate terrorists. Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that peace has been established in Balochistan after Saturday’s attacks and security forces were now “engaged in a mopping-up operation”.</p><small>2026-02-02 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648571-rawalpindi-court-issues-aleema-khans-arrest-warrant-in-nov-26-protest-case' target='_blank'><strong>Rawalpindi court issues Aleema Khan's arrest warrant in Nov 26 protest case</strong></a><br><p>

The reopening of the Rafah border crossing will be limited, with Israel demanding security checks for Palestinians entering and exiting. Israel and Egypt were expected to impose caps on the number of travellers.
Israel seized the border crossing in May 2024, about nine months into the Gaza war that was brought to a tenuous halt by an October ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump.
Rafah’s reopening was an important requirement under the first phase of Trump’s broader plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas.
An Israeli security official said that European monitoring teams had arrived at the crossing, which “has now opened to the movement of residents, for both entry and exit.”
Foreign Journalist barred from Gaza
In the first nine months of Israel’s assault in Gaza, launched after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on southern Israel, Palestinians were generally able to flee to Egypt through the Rafah crossing.
Palestinian officials say about 100,000 Palestinians have fled Gaza since the war began, most of them during the first nine months. Some were sponsored by aid groups. Others paid bribes to parties in Egypt to secure permission to leave.
Israel closed the Rafah crossing after its forces swept into the area and also closed the Philadelphi corridor that runs the length of Gaza’s border with Egypt.
The closure cut off an important route for wounded and sick Palestinians to seek medical care outside Gaza. A few thousand have been allowed out to seek medical treatment in third countries via Israel over the past year, though thousands more are in need of care abroad, according to the United Nations.



Despite the reopening of Rafah, Israel is still refusing to allow the entry of foreign journalists, who have been banned from Gaza since the start of the war, which has caused widespread destruction and laid waste to swathes of territory.
Gaza’s about 2 million Palestinians mostly live in makeshift tents and damaged homes, surrounded by the ruins of their destroyed cities.
Israel’s Supreme Court is considering a petition by the Foreign Press Association that demands foreign journalists be allowed to enter Gaza from Israel. Government lawyers have said that letting journalists into Gaza could pose risks to Israeli soldiers, while also highlighting potential risks to reporters.
The FPA rejects this, saying the public is being deprived of a vital source of independent information. It also points to the fact that many aid and United Nations workers have been allowed to enter the enclave since the war started.
Trump’s plan for Gaza, now in its second phase, foresees governance being handed to Palestinian technocrats, Hamas laying down its weapons and Israeli troops withdrawing from the territory while it is rebuilt.
Israel has cast doubt on the prospect of Hamas laying down its arms and some officials say the military is preparing for a return to war.
Since the October deal was struck, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 500 Palestinians, health officials say.
On Saturday, Israel launched some of its most intense air strikes since the ceasefire, killing at least 30 people, in what it said was a response to a Hamas violation of the truce on Friday.</p><small>2026-02-02 08:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648545-burns-or-suffocation-what-caused-deaths-in-gul-plaza-fire' target='_blank'><strong>Burns or suffocation: What caused deaths in the Gul Plaza fire?</strong></a><br><p>

Mandelson, who was dismissed by Starmer as Britain’s ambassador to the United States last year after previous revelations about his connections to Epstein, said he did not wish to cause “further embarrassment” to Labour, the reports said.



“I have been further linked this weekend to the understandable furore surrounding Jeffrey Epstein and I feel regretful and sorry about this,” Mandelson said in a letter to the Labour Party reported by the BBC and other news organisations, which Reuters was not immediately able to obtain.
Mandelson said he believed allegations about financial payments to him by Epstein, which appeared in British media based on files released by the US Department of Justice, were false and he would investigate them.
“While doing this, I do not wish to cause further embarrassment to the Labour Party and I am therefore stepping down from membership of the party,” the letter said.
Mandelson was key to the Labour Party’s electoral success when Tony Blair was prime minister starting in the 1990s.
He came under scrutiny last year after US lawmakers released documents, including a letter in which he called Epstein “my best pal”, leading to his dismissal as Britain’s envoy in Washington.
Mandelson also had a turbulent earlier career in domestic politics. In 1998, he resigned as trade minister over a loan he received from a fellow minister to buy a house amid questions over conflict of interest.
A second stint in the Cabinet also ended in a resignation in 2001 when he was forced out over his alleged involvement in a passport scandal involving an Indian billionaire. He was later cleared of acting improperly.
Mandelson, a former European Union trade commissioner, is on leave of absence as a member of the House of Lords.
Separately, Starmer said on Saturday that Britain’s former Prince Andrew should testify before a US congressional committee, following new revelations about his links to Epstein.</p><small>2026-02-02 06:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/01193545292bf37.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421/pakistan-to-participate-in-t20-world-cup-but-will-not-play-against-india-on-feb-15' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to participate in T20 World Cup but will not play against India on Feb 15</strong></a><br><p>After around a week of uncertainty, the government gave the nod on Sunday to the Pakistan cricket team for participation in the T20 World Cup but barred it from playing against India on February 15, when the Green Shirts are scheduled to play their only group-stage match against the arch-rivals.
“The government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan cricket team to participate in the ICC World T20 2026, however, the Pakistan cricket team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February 2026 against India,” a post of the government’s X account said.







On Monday, Pakistan Cricket Board chief and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the possibility of a boycott of the T20 World Cup loomed over Bangladesh’s withdrawal from the tournament.
After the meeting, Naqvi had said he had briefed the PM on the “International Cricket Council (ICC) matter” and a “final decision would be taken either on Friday or next Monday”.
The meeting took place as questions were raised about Pakistan’s participation in the tournament following the ICC’s decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland.
Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland on January 24, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
The governing ICC had rejected Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.
Hours before the ICC had announced its decision, Naqvi had said that Bangladesh was being treated unfairly and should be allowed to participate in the tournament.
At the time, he had said that Pakistan’s participation was still not confirmed. “The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi had said.
‘Selective participation’
ICC reacted to Pakistan’s and noted in a statement that the Pakistan government had directed its team to “selectively participate” in the global tournament.
“While the ICC awaits official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board, this position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” the statement said.
It added that ICC tournaments were built on sporting integrity, competitiveness, consistency and fairness, and “selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions”.
“While the ICC respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy, this decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan,” the statement read.
“The ICC hopes that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.
“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which should also be the responsibility of all its members including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the statement concluded.
The events underline the current tension in South Asian cricket.
The T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, is set to begin on February 7.
Pakistan have been placed in the same group as defending champions India, but will play all their matches in Sri Lanka under an arrangement brokered by the ICC, allowing them to play at a neutral venue.
Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India played all their matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
As per the compromise, Pakistan are set to play all their matches at the upcoming T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka.</p><small>2026-02-02 06:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648526-bolton-market-fire-station-stalled-for-over-18-months-fire-tender-deployed-for-bilawal-house-security' target='_blank'><strong>Bolton Market fire station stalled for over 18 months</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on Sunday night, the party said doctors had conducted a medical examination of the MQM leader and admitted him to the hospital.
Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.







“Mr Altaf Hussain was taken to the hospital on Sunday evening due to ill health, where after an initial examination, the doctors have admitted him to the hospital,” said the post on X.
The party elaborated that doctors “administered an injection to him, and started an IV drip in view of weakness in his body”.
Doctors will conduct a detailed examination of the party founder on Monday, added the post.







The party founder was also “administered a blood transfusion on Sunday night on the advice of doctors,” a subsequent post on the party’s X handle said on Monday.
In a post on X, London-based senior MQM leader Mustafa Azizabadi said Hussain’s ill health was caused by “severe mental stress and staying engaged in organisational work day and night for 18 to 20 hours”.







Last year, the MQM founder was hospitalised on two occasions within a span of a month.
He was admitted to a hospital in London on July 10 due to “severe illness” and was discharged on July 23 after undergoing multiple tests and blood transfusions.
Hussain was again hospitalised on August 8 and was allowed to leave the next day. Doctors had diagnosed him with severe flu and a chest infection.
The MQM founder had also remained in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Britain, apparently after contracting Covid-19 in February 2021.
Hussain’s political journey
Hussain was born on Sept 17, 1953, in Karachi. He obtained his early education at a public school in Karachi’s Azizabad neighbourhood, a middle-class locality where he spent his early years and his youth.
He later enrolled at the University of Karachi (KU) to study Pharmacy and graduated from the programme in 1979.
His political career began during his student years at KU when he and Azeem Ahmed Tariq founded the All-Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO).
Formed in 1978, APMSO gained a massive following within a short period of time.
Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third largest party in the country.
In the early 1990s, the MQM chief went into exile as the government at the time conducted an operation in Karachi.

 

The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.
Viewed as the man who controlled Karachi from London, Hussain came under fire in May 2013 for his televised speech across Pakistan, where he allegedly demanded the separation of Karachi from the rest of Pakistan if the public mandate of his party was not acceptable to the ‘establishment’. The party later clarified, saying it was taken out of context.
However, the final undoing of the MQM, as it was known, came after Hussain delivered an incendiary speech in August 2016 in which he not only raised slogans against Pakis­tan but also called the country “a cancer for the entire world”. Hours after the speech, MQM workers had attacked the ARY News office in Kara­chi.
Authorities launched a crackdown following the speech, and the MQM’s Karachi headquarters and Hussain’s residence in Azizabad were sealed. Later, Hussain’s own party leaders in Pakistan distanced themselves from him and omitted his name from the party constitution.
In October 2019, Hussain was charged with “encouraging terrorism” by British police over his speech. He was also arrested in the case earlier in 2019 but was released on bail.
After deliberations that spanned three days, a 12-member jury had returned a majority verdict in Rex (crown) versus Altaf Hussain in February 2022, acquitting the MQM founder on two counts of ‘encouraging terrorism’.
The jury found Hussain not guilty on both counts of encouraging terrorism, contrary to section 1(2) of the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006.</p><small>2026-02-02 06:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02085206277d293.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970528/india-unveils-record-85bn-defence-budget' target='_blank'><strong>India unveils record $85bn defence budget</strong></a><br><p>NEW DELHI: India will spend a record amount on infrastructure and defence, the finance minister said in her national budget speech on Sunday, with plans for high-speed rail, submarines and fighter jets.
New Delhi plans to spend $133 billion on infrastructure and $85 billion on defence, a respective rise of around nine and 15 percent compared to last year’s budget.
Data centres, artificial intelligence, and the mining and processing of rare earths will also receive government support, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told parliament.



She said public spending on infrastructure had increased dramatically from around $21 billion (2 trillion rupees) in 2014-15 and that it was now at an “all-time high”.

Rajnath says armed forces would be equipped with fighter jets, drones, ships, submarines and critical hardware

The defence spending hike comes after a four-day conflict with Pakistan last May that killed at least 70 people, and saw both sides make extensive use of drones as well as intense missile and artillery barrages.
‘Best interest’
Defence minister Rajnath Singh described the spending as “unprecedented” and said it would help equip India’s armed forces with fighter jets, drones, ships, submarines and other critical hardware. “It is in the best interest of the nation,” he added. New Delhi is in the midst of negotiating defence contracts with domestic and international suppliers, including France, the United States and Germany.
The world’s most populous country sees massive infrastructure spending as key to sustaining its high growth rate by boosting domestic manufacturing and creating millions of new jobs.
“India is not content with simply being the fastest-growing economy,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after the budget. “India wants to become the world’s third-largest economy.” This year’s budget presents an ambitious roadmap to give new momentum to domestic manufacturing and self-reliance.
Sectors including textiles, pharmaceuticals, electronics and chemicals are primary targets to boost exports, Sitharaman said.
She promised the development of business parks for textiles and chemicals and said $5 billion would be spent on boosting domestic electronics manufacturing.

The two countries maintain friendly diplomatic relations, with Kazakhstan being Pakistan’s top export destination among Central Asian countries.
During the visit, which he will undertake at the invitation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Kazakh president will be accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising senior cabinet ministers and other high-ranking officials.
“President Tokayev is expected to meet with the President of Pakistan, hold talks with the prime minister, and address the Pakistan-Kazakhstan Business Forum.”







Having a unique geographical location, Kazakhstan offers an excellent opportunity for Pakistan to connect to Russian, Central Asian, and Eastern European markets. Kazakhstan, by landmass and resources, is the largest economy of Central Asia.
The foreign ministry said President Tokayev’s visit will provide Islamabad and Astana “an important and timely opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review” of bilateral relations.
The statement added that the two sides will also discuss new avenues for broadening cooperation, particularly in trade, logistics, regional connectivity, people-to-people contacts, and explore collaboration at regional and international forums.
“The forthcoming visit reflects the strengthening bonds between Pakistan and Kazakhstan, their mutual commitment to transforming historic and cultural affinities into robust cooperation, and their common desire for peace and progress in the region,” read the statement.
This visit is seen as a win-win situation by both countries. For Pakistan, it will help Islamabad position itself as a land bridge between Central and South Asia and beyond.

Supreme Court Judge Justice Muh­ammad Ali Mazhar, during hearing of a case on Saturday, said that former chief justice of Supreme Court late Justice Nasim Hasan Shah’s belated admission of coercion in the former prime minister late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s trial, left no doubt in the mind of a sane and prudent person that it was a “judicial murder” and such an admission constituted a violation of his oath. In her statement, Ms Marri said the Supreme Court has categorically held that the trial of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was conducted in blatant violation of the Constitution, due process, and the fundamental right to a fair trial.
“The court’s observations have laid bare how transparency, legality, and justice were deliberately sacrificed under a dictatorial regime,” she added.
She said Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar’s opinion clearly establishes that personal bias and mala fide intent of certain judges fatally undermined the independence of the judiciary, making an impartial verdict impossible.
She said the case was illegally and unlawfully reopened during martial law, solely to serve the personal vendetta of a military dictator, with no legal or constitutional basis.

 

Ms Marri reiterated that the PPP has always maintained that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was not executed by law but murdered through the misuse of the judicial system.
She said a ruthless dictator, aided by his facilitators, weaponised the courts to eliminate the country’s most popular and visionary leader. The PPP leader recalled Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s historic words, “I would much rather be destroyed by a military dictator than by history,” she added.

The 70-and-a-half-year-old president, who breathed his last in an Islamabad hospital on Saturday evening after protracted illness, was accorded a gun carriage funeral — a state honour reserved for figures the state considers of exceptional national importance.
On Saturday, the coffin was transported directly from Islamabad to the president’s ancestral village of Chechiyan, located about 15 kilometres on the outskirts of Mirpur.
On Sunday, it was brought in a large vehicular procession to the Quaid-e-Azam Cricket Stadium in the heart of the city, where it was draped with the AJK’s national flag and placed on a military gun carriage before being taken into the packed ground amid full ceremonial protocol.
In Pakistan, a gun carriage funeral is typically accorded to presidents and prime ministers, chiefs of the armed forces, highly decorated military officers, and, on rare occasions, national figures whose services are deemed extraordinary, symbolising that the deceased is being mourned not merely as an individual but as a national asset.
The funeral prayer was led by Qazi Muhammad Rafique, the spiritual leader of Gulhar Sharif — the most revered shrine in the neighbouring Kotli district — at around 4pm, after which police contingents presented a guard of honour to the late president.
Prominent among the mourners were AJK Prime Minister Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, Acting President and Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, heads of political and religious parties, chief justices and judges of the AJK’s superior courts, cabinet members, the Commander 10 Corps, and other senior military and civilian officials.
Mr Mahmood’s son and cabinet member Yasir Sultan briefly addressed the gathering.
Later, the coffin was taken by ambulance to Chechiyan for burial in the family’s ancestral graveyard alongside his parents.
Acting President Chaudhry Lat­if Akbar, Information and Rel­i­g­i­ous Affairs Minister Rafique Nay­yar and several other cabinet members were present at the burial.
Meanwhile, as the Chechiyan area is home to the renowned shrine of Baba Peera Shah Ghazi (Kharri Sharif) and its annual Urs falls on Feb 2-3, Mr Nayyar directed the administration to observe restraint in view of the AJK government’s three-day mourning for President Mahmood.

New START, the last nuclear treaty between Washington and Moscow after decades of agreements dating to the Cold War, is set to expire, and with it restrictions on the two top nuclear powers.
The expiration comes as President Donald Trump, vowing “America First”, smashes through international agreements that limit the United States, although in the case of New START, the issue may more be inertia than ideology.
Russian President Vladimir Putin in September suggested a one-year extension of New START. Trump, asked afterward by a reporter for a reaction while he was boarding his helicopter, said an extension “sounds like a good idea to me” — but little has been heard since.
Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev, who as Russia’s president signed New START with counterpart Barack Obama in 2010, said in a recent interview with the Kommersant newspaper that Russia has received no “substantive reaction” on New START but was still giving time to Trump.

Trump has insisted on inclusion of China in ‘New START’ accord

A White House official said on condition of anonymity that Trump would like to see “limits on nuclear weapons and involve China in arms control talks.” The way to do that, the official said, Trump “will clarify on his own timeline”. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, which supports reducing nuclear risks, said Trump’s second administration, which has sidelined career diplomats and entrusted decision-making only to a handful of people, is not functioning in a normal way that would allow complex negotiations.

 

Jon Wolfsthal, director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists, said Trump and Putin could pick up the phone and agree immediately at a political level to extend New START.
“This is a piece of low-hanging fruit that the Trump administration should have seized months ago,” he said.
Wolfsthal is among experts involved in the “Doomsday Clock” meant to symbolise how near humanity is to destruction. It was recently moved closer to midnight in part due to New START’s demise.
Trump called in October for the United States to resume nuclear testing for the first time in more than 30 years, although it is not clear he will carry it out.
Russia in 2023 already suspended a key element of New START, allowing inspections, as relations deteriorated sharply with US President Joe Biden’s administration over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Informed sources told Dawn that NFC’s eight technical working groups have also failed to get off the ground. Only two of these groups have met just once over the past two months, while the remaining six have yet to convene at all, since their official notification in the second week of December.
Following the conclusion of the first meeting on Dec 4, representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the provinces had announced a clear timeline: the second NFC meeting was scheduled to take place between Jan 8 and Jan 15, which was meant to kick off a series of regular monthly meetings until the commission finalised its recommendations for the 11th NFC award after a gap of more than 15 years.
These sources said the only group that started quickly after its notification was the one focused on the merger of ex-federally administered tribal areas (Fata) into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and how that merger affects the province’s share in the NFC award.
Led by KP’s Finance Minister Muzammil Aslam, the group, acting on a demand from the Punjab government, asked the federal finance secretary to provide working details showing how the ex-Fata share would cut into the share of other provinces. More than seven weeks later, the technical group is still waiting for those details before it can call its second session.
Another group — on divisible pool taxes — led by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, met once in the final days of January for initial discussions. That group is tasked with formulating recommendations on whether to include any new tax in the divisible pool of resources or exclude any existing one from the pool. The centre has been looking at the legal and constitutional reasoning for removing customs duty from the list of taxes that are shared with the provinces on the argument that international trade is a purely federal subject.
None of the six other groups have held any interaction so far, reflecting little enthusiasm for moving the consultative process forward to update the distribution of common resources among five key stakeholders — the federation and its four federating units.
An official at the Ministry of Finance said the hiatus by the federal government was driven by the back-and-forth foreign visits of Aurangzeb and Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal. But the official added that questions about the lethargy of other working groups — most of them led by provincial finance ministers — should be referred to where it belonged.
However, a provincial chief minister said that at least his group’s meetings, as well as the main NFC meeting, had been hampered by the unavailability of representatives from the Ministry of Finance.
The six groups pertain to vertical distribution of divisible resources between the centre and provinces and composition and utilisation of national debt, both led by the Balochistan finance minister; recommending how to improve the tax-to-GDP ratio, led by the KP finance minister; straight transfers to provinces, led by Sindh; and recommendations for criteria regarding horizontal distribution among the provinces, as well as how to share expenses incurred by the centre in areas under provincial domain — both led by the Punjab finance minister.
At the Dec 4 meeting, Sindh opposed any discussion on expenditures after the issue was raised by the federal finance secretary. Sindh argued that the NFC’s constitutional mandate was limited to the distribution of revenues and that it had no jurisdiction to dictate how provinces or other stakeholders spend the funds once allocated.
The federal government has reportedly sought legal opinion from Pakistan’s attorney general suggesting expenditures could also be deliberated within the NFC forum.
At the inaugural meeting of the 11th NFC, the centre indicated it wanted to mobilise additional consolidated revenues of more than 5 per cent of gross domestic product over the next three years — roughly 6.5 trillion Pakistani rupees per year at current rates — and urged provinces to increase their own revenue contribution to 3pc of GDP.
The provinces were asked to raise those revenues through taxes on property, agricultural income and sales tax on services from less than 1pc of GDP at present, according to the account of the meeting.
The centre framed the higher revenue targets as necessary to stabilise a rising fiscal deficit that has widened by around 3pc since 2010 after a “fiscal imbalance” created under the 7th NFC award. The deficit has climbed from close to 4pc to over 6.6pc, contributing to a massive deterioration in debt-to-GDP ratios.

 

It was announced that the second NFC meeting would be held between Jan 8 and 15, depending on whether working-group reports were ready before Jan 8. Those groups were expected to deliberate on horizontal and vertical distribution of resources, how provinces should advance taxation policies based on the latest experiences, and the impact of debt servicing, poverty and other factors.
A special working group was also agreed upon at the request of KP to examine the fiscal and social impact of the merger of tribal districts and how to proceed with adequate resources.
The 11th NFC was constituted on Aug 22 to deliver a new award governing how federal divisible resources are shared among the federation and the provinces. Its first meeting was originally called for Aug 27 but was postponed repeatedly before finally convening on Dec 4.
The commission operates under terms of reference set out under Clause 2 of Article 160 of Pakistan’s Constitution. Those terms require the 11th NFC to distribute between the federation and the provinces the net proceeds of five major tax categories.
They include taxes on income, including capital value tax and corporation tax, but exclude taxes on income consisting of remuneration paid out of the Federal Consolidated Fund. Also included are taxes on the sales and purchases of goods imported, exported, produced, manufactured or consumed, and export duties on cotton, and such other export duties as may be specified by the president. The list also includes excise duties and any other taxes as may be specified by the president.
Under IMF suggestions, the centre wants provinces to share more expenses for natural calamities — which have become more frequent — as well as some horizontal health programmes and major infrastructure such as dams, highways and motorways, etc.
The centre has also been calling for an end to population-based incentives and for their replacement with social sector performance measures and activation of local governments. Punjab and KP have also informally supported delinking population from the NFC formula.
The NFC is also required to make allocation of resources to meet expenditures related to the Azad Government of the States of Jammu and Kashmir, the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan and the newly merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (erstwhile FATA).
The last major award, the 7th NFC award delivered in 2009, remained effective for 15 years instead of the Constitution’s five-year term. Under that award, the provincial share increased to 57.5pc from about 47pc, and later rose to about 59pc after special allocations to Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh on different grounds. That reduced the federal share to 42.5pc.
In subsequent years, however, the centre imposed a petroleum levy — estimated at about 1.5 trillion rupees — and secured about 1.5 trillion rupees in cash balances from the provinces, effectively reversing the financial balance in its favour.
Provinces, meanwhile, did not deliver on commitments made under the 7th NFC to increase their revenue contribution by 0.5pc of GDP every year, the sources said. A similar commitment by the centre — a 1pc of GDP increase in revenue every year — also remained unfulfilled.
Various quarters, including the finance ministry, the armed forces and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have been calling for rebalancing the transfer of a larger chunk of divisible pool resources to the centre’s favour. The Constitution promises that provincial shares in each NFC award cannot be reduced. The NFC award has to be achieved with the consensus of five parties — the Centre and the four provinces.
At present, provincial governments receive their horizontal shares based on population, poverty, revenue collection and inverse population density. Under that formula, Punjab receives 51.74pc, Sindh 24.55pc, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 14.62pc, and Balochistan 9.09pc.

The initiative aims to provide awareness and information to the masses, including overseas Pakistanis, about private housing schemes in Pakistan.
“With the new online system, anyone, including those abroad, can access layout plans of private schemes in Pakistan and verify plot locations,” NAB Director General Islamabad/Rawalpindi Region Waqar Chohan told Dawn.
Mr Chohan said that PM Shehbaz Sharif will soon launch the system as NAB is ready to activate it.
NAB calls this system a preventive measure against the “land mafia,” aimed at uniting provinces, regulators, and local bodies.
The portal allows the public to verify legal status, layout plans, and land availability of private housing societies, protecting citizens’ savings from fraudulent and unapproved real estate projects.
Under the system, provincial secretaries, regulatory authorities and local governments were formally mobilised to provide verified data regarding private housing societies and their land banks. The portal will serve as a centralised national repository for verified housing data, aiming to prevent fraud by ensuring accountability before losses occur.

• Sharjeel denies mass arrest or issuing blanket detention orders
• Says law enforcement agencies acting strictly within the law         
KARACHI: The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Sunday accused the provincial authorities of arresting nearly 180 activists during nightlong raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh and detaining them under the controversial Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance.
However, the provincial government rejected the allegation and blamed the opposition party for spreading false narratives to build momentum for Feb 8 protest.
The PTI alleged that the Sindh police carried out pre-dawn raids on the houses of its workers and leaders and picked up around 180 of them. 
Later in the evening, the central information department of the PTI issued a statement, claiming that the Sindh government had placed the held activists under one-month detention under the MPO. 
The party described the move as “political victimisation” and alleged that the arrests were carried out across the province to stop its planned protest on Feb 8.
It said the use of MPO against its workers showed that the PPP-led Sindh government was pursuing a “non-democratic agenda” and suppressing political dissent. 
The party said that detaining “peaceful political workers” was a clear violation of the Constitution, the law, and basic human rights.
The statement demanded that the Sindh government withdraw what it called a “black decision” and immediately release all detained PTI workers.
Meanwhile, in a statement PTI-Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh clarified that their Feb 8 strike “is completely voluntary and peaceful, and no call has been given for blocking roads or forced closure”. 
He said PTI’s movement cannot be stopped by arrests and police crackdown.
Sharjeel denies charges
However, Sindh government categorically rejected PTI’s claims, calling them “completely false and misleading”.
Senior Sindh Minister Sharjeel Memon, who also holds the portfolio of information, said no mass arrests or detentions under MPO had taken place. 
He told Dawn the PTI statement was based on incorrect information and aimed at creating unnecessary political hype. 
“Where’s the list of those arrested. It’s a blatant lie. The PTI is spreading false narratives to build momentum and gain political sympathy for its announced protest planned for February 8,” he said, adding: “The provincial government has not issued any blanket detention orders against PTI leaders or workers and that law enforcement agencies are acting strictly within the law.”
The Sindh government, he said, believes in democratic values and the right to peaceful protest.
