Addressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul, COAS Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.
Calling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms.
“The onus of ensuing escalations — one that may ultimately bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region and beyond — will squarely lie with India.”
 


“Should a fresh wave of hostilities be triggered, Pakistan would respond much beyond the expectations of the initiators,” COAS Munir warned.
“With diminishing distinctions between conflict and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India’s geographic warspace.
“The deeply hurting retributive military and economic losses inflicted will be much beyond the imagination and calculation of the perpetrators of chaos and instability.
The army chief declared, “The battle-hardened army, which has fought for over two decades in the sub-conventional domain, has successfully displayed its capabilities in the conventional domain, as well as by delivering a swift and decisive blow to the adversary.”
 
 

“Ever since the creation of Pakistan, the armed forces, with full support of the nation, have defended the external and internal frontiers of the country with unfailing resolve, conviction and pride.
“The most recent display of this spirit and resolve of the armed forces of Pakistan during Marka-i-Haq [and] Operation Bunyanum Marsoos has further strengthened the trust and confidence of the people of Pakistan in the competence and far-reaching capabilities of its armed forces by neutralising all threats with remarkable professionalism,” COAS Munir said, referring to the four-day May conflict with India.
“Downing advanced […] Rafales, targeting multiple bases including S-400s, and showcasing multi-domain warfare capabilities, Pakistan has displayed its capabilities and will to defend,” COAS Munir asserted.
 
 

He further said that “people of hues and colours, age, gender, ethnicity or creed, stood firm and tall like a wall of steel, leading to a renewed spirit of patriotism and national fervour, which prevails across the length and breadth of Pakistan”.
The field marshal stated: “Our collective success has reenergised and strengthened the proud and illustrious memories of our earlier successes. Pakistan once again came out victorious against a treacherous enemy marked by strategic blindness and naivety, and filled with hubris and rhetoric about its misguided hegemonic ambitions.
“India’s eagerness to adjudge culpability, aversion to neutral investigations and staking self-created evidence was indicative of politicisation of terrorism for vested interests of the ruling regime,” he added.
 
 

COAS Munir went on to say, “Pakistan, on the other hand, gained deep admiration of the people of Pakistan and the international community because of the legitimacy and the clear victory against a numerically superior adversary.
“Internally, it has further unified our nation and strengthened our resolve to defend against any threat, whether external or internal. It has reinforced confidence, particularly amongst the youth, that the armed forces of Pakistan are an essential element of national power and trusted with the responsibility to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state.”
The army chief affirmed, “Let me assure the nation that with the help and mercies of Allah Almighty and support of the people, we will not lose an inch of this sacred land.”
He commended the “valour of the people of Pakistan — every soldier, sailor, airman; the brave men, women and children and the elderly who laid their lives during these testing times; and the warriors who fought with the utmost conviction to defend their motherland at all costs”.
“The national leadership, the bureaucracy, scholars, scientists, media, academia, and most importantly, the youth deserve rich tribute for standing firmly against aggression,” the army chief added.
Stressing that the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the “creation and later preservation of this great country deserve the highest recognition”, COAS Munir said: “We owe our deepest respect for the martyrs and their families because of whom we enjoy freedom and independence.”
The army chief also spoke on Pakistan’s economy, hailing the government’s “relentless efforts” for relative stability and noting that positive economic indicators were attracting investments from across the world.
“The treasures hidden beneath our land for decades have started to surface as a silver lining for our bright future. Our vibrant youth, filled with talent, is making marvels in a multitude of domains.”
Choose mutual security over perpetual violence: COAS tells Kabul
The army chief also reiterated Pakistan’s stance that India “continues with state-sponsored terrorism”.
“Our adversary’s use of Fitna al-Hind and Fitna al-Khawarij as hired guns exposes its … hypocritical and heinous face to the world. Equally disconcerting is the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan,” he said.
Urging the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS Munir urged the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”.
 
 

“Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”.
Speaking on occupied Kashmir, the army chief said India’s “oppression and widespread atrocities” there will also come to an end. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s diplomatic and moral support for the Kashmiris’ freedom struggle till the resolution of the dispute in accordance with United Nations’ resolutions.
‘Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser’
During his address, COAS Munir noted that the world was witnessing “increased fragility and volatility, with a discernible shift towards violence as an instrument for attaining political objectives”.
“Amidst the chaos, Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser. Our relations with key global and regional powers, particularly Muslim countries, have further strengthened.”
The army chief stated that Pakistan had persistently “proven to be a key contributor toward peace and stability in the region and beyond”, highlighting Pakistan’s armed forces’ contributions to UN peacekeeping missions.
He also mentioned the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, terming it a “reinforcement and formalisation of Pakistan-Saudi brotherhood and a step towards ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East and South Asia”.
 
 

COAS Munir said Islamabad had also made “humble contributions towards peaceful steering of the negotiations with Iran”, adding that Pakistan’s relations with all Muslim countries were “thriving at an exponential” rate.
Hailing Pakistan’s historic “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership“ with China, the army chief also noted: “Re-energisational and strong and growing relations with the United States of America are an encouraging and welcome development.
He lauded US President Donald Trump, saying that his “personal efforts and strategic leadership to bring peace to multiple conflict-prone areas of the world are really praiseworthy”.
“We will further nurture these relations with key global and regional players for the interest of peace, security, and development.”
 
 

COAS Munir also assailed Israel for its “blatant aggression, genocide and forced displacement waged upon Palestinians”.
Highlighting Pakistan’s “significant” role in the diplomatic efforts to secure the recent peace in Gaza, the field marshal said Pakistan expects the ceasefire to continue, followed by a smooth flow of humanitarian relief and the reconstruction of Gaza.
“Pakistan stands by its principled stance of indispensability of the two-state solution and the need for an independent, sovereign and viable State of Palestine based on pre-1967 war borders, with Al Quds Sharif as its capital,” he reaffirmed.
‘Enemies hellbent upon driving a wedge between people, armed forces’
Addressing the cadets, he highlighted that they were being commissioned into “one of the finest armies across the world, which is second to none, respected by all and sundry”. “This demands your absolute loyalty to [Pakistan, to the armed forces and the sacred task being entrusted onto your shoulders,” he underscored.
“Remember, our enemies are hellbent upon driving a wedge between our people and the armed forces for their ulterior motives. Let me remind them that the bond between the people and the armed forces is unshakable,” the field marshal asserted.
He told the cadets that nothing should be more sacred than the safety and security of the people of Pakistan and no duty more binding than the defence of the country.
“The defence doctrine of Pakistan is predicated on credible deterrence and perpetual readiness, encompassing the full spectrum of capabilities. As a professional standing army, our conventional prowess through constant doctrinal and technological evolution has been optimised into a dynamic, integrated and adaptive force,” the army chief said.
Underscoring the need for intellectual readiness and technological advancements, COAS Munir told the cadets to “embrace innovation, lifelong learning and adaptability to meet modern threats”.
At the outset of his address, the army chief extended his warm greetings and appreciation to the “immaculately turned-out gentlemen and lady cadets for the outstanding display of professionalism and discipline”.
He also expressed his compliments to the cadets from friendly countries of Malaysia, Nepal, Palestine, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Yemen, Mali, Maldives, and Nigeria for “successful completion of the formative training at this prestigious institution”.
“This is a moment of pride for you and all of us, reflective of the strong bond of military cooperation and international camaraderie,” COAS Munir said.
He highlighted that the PMA’s role “as a cornerstone of military excellence has always remained commendable, and the standards exhibited today are no less reflective of the same”.

While there was no official word from the government or military, security sources said Pakistan had again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province, as security sources claimed that precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, reportedly killing dozens of fighters.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended their two-day ceasefire.
In a post on social media platform X late Friday night, the ACB said three players — identified as Kabeer, Sibghatullah and Haroon — and “five other countrymen” from Urgun district were killed and seven others were injured in a strike.
It said the players had earlier travelled to Sharana to participate in a friendly cricket match.
“The ACB considers this a great loss for Afghanistan’s sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family,” the cricketing board said. As a result, the ACB decided to withdraw from participating in the tri-nation series scheduled to be played in November.
Pakistan was set to host the series, which also included Sri Lanka, from November 17 to 29.
Afghanistan’s ace spinner Rashid Khan, in a post on X, said he welcomed the ACB’s decision to withdraw from the upcoming fixtures against Pakistan.
Pak Afghan tensions
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence TTP terrorists in Afghanistan and has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. For its part, Kabul has batted aside accusations of support for militancy, alternating between vehement denials of Afghan soil being used to launch attacks across the border, assurances that have failed to materialise, and simply telling the Pakistani state to negotiate with the TTP.
Tensions have flared between the two countries over the last few days, with Kabul and Islamabad engaging in border skirmishes on October 11. According to the military, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists killed at the border following an attack from the Afghan side.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier in the week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintained that Kabul must “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
Subsequently, Afghan forces struck several Pak­istani posts and the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and artillery pounded Afghanistan’s posts, targeting hostile positions in the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika.
On Tuesday night, fighting flared up again on between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, a temporary ceasefire was then announced. The Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire was implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, and would last for 48 hours.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, however, made it clear on Thursday that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks.
“We decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready,” he said, adding that if the Taliban were serious, they would initiate steps to hold talks.
On Friday, with representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan. It had come after an attack on a military installation in North Waziristan and after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire.
There was no statement from Pakistan’s military, but terrorists linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group had claimed responsibility for the attack on Khaddi Fort in Mir Ali, where a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the main gate of a military camp before attempting to stage an incursion earlier in the day.
Meanwhile, in a telling statement posted to X (formerly Twitter), Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Friday that the relationship with Kabul would no longer be like it was in the past.
 






“There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,” he wrote.</p><small>2025-10-18 07:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18111045ee44978.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949716/finance-minister-briefs-world-bank-president-on-govts-flood-response' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister briefs World Bank president on govt’s flood response</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met with World Bank (WB) President Ajay Banga in Washington and briefed him on the government’s flood response efforts, the finance ministry said on Saturday.
The meeting was held on the sidelines of the plenary meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) in Washington, DC, where Aurangzeb had arrived on Sunday on a six-day trip from Oct 13 to 18.
In a statement issued today, the ministry said that Aurangzeb briefed Banga on the government’s comprehensive flood response efforts and appreciated the Bank’s timely support following the completion of the post-flood damage assessment.
 






The minister also endorsed the proposal of leveraging technology platforms and cooperatives to “effectively reach small farmers and enhance agricultural resilience”, the statement read. Aurangzeb also thanked the WB for “its technical assistance” in developing Pakistan’s tariff policy, it added.
The statement said that Aurangzeb informed Banga about the memorandums of understanding signed with the provinces for the implementation of the Country Partnership Framework (CPF).
He also recalled Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s engagement with Banga during the UN General Assembly (UNGA) session and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to “deepening its partnership” with the WB.
“The minister also requested additional support under the International Development Association (IDA) windows in light of reduced allocations and discussed the importance of adopting a holistic approach towards reforming Pakistan’s gas and power sectors to ensure long-term sustainability and efficiency,” the statement said.
Fitch ratings
In a separate meeting, Aurangzeb sat with officials from Fitch Ratings, thanking the agency for upgrading Pakistan’s credit rating to B- with a stable outlook.
The minister expressed satisfaction that all three major international rating agencies were now aligned in their assessments of Pakistan’s economy, the ministry said.
 






He also briefed the Fitch team on the recently announced Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) with the Fund.
Aurangzeb outlined “Pakistan’s progress on key structural reforms in taxation, energy, privatisation, and state-owned enterprises”.
The statement added that the minister reiterated the government’s commitment to accelerating the privatisation process to enhance efficiency and ensure fiscal sustainability.
Aurangzeb also apprised the Fitch delegation of the government’s ongoing efforts to issue Panda Bonds in the Chinese market and highlighted successful trade and tariff negotiations with the US administration, which he said had led to more competitive tariff rates for Pakistan.
Aurangzeb meets UK minister
The finance minister also met with United Kingdoms Minister for International Development and Africa Baroness Jenny Chapman in Washington.
“The finance minister appreciated the UK’s longstanding development partnership and support for Pakistan’s reform and growth agenda. He particularly acknowledged the continued collaboration on the development of the Digital Dashboard initiative aimed at improving transparency and efficiency in project monitoring,” the ministry said.
 






Aurangzeb also underscored the importance of enhanced consultation with relevant stakeholders in the selection and implementation of development projects to “ensure alignment with national priorities”.
“He emphasised the need for greater visibility and coordination on off-budget projects to improve oversight and outcomes,” it said, adding that both sides reaffirmed their commitment to “further strengthening Pakistan–UK development cooperation”.
Roundtable discussion
Meanwhile, Aurangzeb also participated in a roundtable discussion titled ‘Challenges and Opportunities for the Pakistani Economy through 2025 and Beyond’ that was organised by the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE).
He briefed participants on Pakistan’s recent macroeconomic progress, including the staff-level agreement reached with the Fund and subsequent credit rating upgrades by major international rating agencies.
 






He highlighted the ongoing transformation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
“The minister also provided an update on the pace of privatisation and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to sustaining reform momentum,” the ministry said.
Aurangzeb also noted that recent geopolitical developments were “favourable for Pakistan” and had opened new avenues for economic cooperation and investment, it added.</p><small>2025-10-18 06:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1811031374ccd2c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949713/china-and-us-agree-to-fresh-trade-talks' target='_blank'><strong>China and US agree to fresh trade talks</strong></a><br><p>China and the United States agreed on Saturday to conduct another round of trade negotiations in the coming week, as the world’s two biggest economies seek to avoid another damaging tit-for-tat tariff battle.
Beijing last week announced sweeping controls on the critical rare earths industry, prompting US President Donald Trump to threaten 100 percent tariffs on imports from China in retaliation.
Trump had also threatened to cancel his expected meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.
In the latest indication of efforts to resolve their dispute, Chinese state media reported that Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had “candid, in-depth and constructive exchanges” during a Saturday morning call, and that both sides agreed to hold a new round of trade talks “as soon as possible”.
On social media, Bessent described the call as “frank and detailed”, and said they would meet “in-person next week to continue our discussions”.
 






Bessent had previously accused China of seeking to harm the rest of the world by tightening restrictions rare earths, which are critical to everything from smartphones to guided missiles.
 
 

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also participated in the call, according to the report by Chinese state news agency Xinhua.
Hours before the call, Fox News released excerpts of an interview with Trump in which he said he would meet Xi at the APEC summit after all.
Trump told the outlet that the 100 per cent tariff on goods from China was not sustainable.
“It’s not sustainable, but that’s what the number is… They forced me to do that,” he said.
Coordinated response
The high-level video call came as Washington worked to rally Group of Seven finance ministers in response to the latest Chinese export controls.
For now, the G7 ministers have agreed to coordinate a short-term response and diversify suppliers, the EU’s economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters in Washington.
Speaking after the grouping met this week, Dombrovskis noted the vast majority of rare earth supplies come from China, meaning that diversification could take years.
“We agreed, both bilaterally with the US and at the G7 level, to coordinate our approach,” he said on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank’s fall meetings.
Countries would also exchange information on their contacts with Chinese counterparts as they work out short-term solutions, he added.
German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil told journalists he hopes that Trump and Xi’s meeting can help to resolve much of the US-China trade conflict.
“We have made it clear within the G7 that we do not agree with China’s approach,” he added, referring to the group of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.
IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva also expressed hope Friday for an agreement between the countries to cool tensions.
The US-China trade war reignited this year as Trump promised sweeping tariffs on imports soon after returning to office.
At one point, US-China tariffs escalated to triple-digit levels, effectively halting some trade as businesses waited for a resolution.
The two countries have since lowered their respective levies but their truce has remained shaky.</p><small>2025-10-18 06:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18094536fd3011d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949604/kp-cm-afridi-refuses-to-attend-pms-huddle-on-afghan-refugees' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi refuses to attend PM’s huddle on Afghan refugees</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi on Friday declined to attend a top-level huddle chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to chalk out a course of action regarding the future of Afghan refugees.
However, Mr Afridi was represented by Muzzamil Aslam, former adviser to the chief minister on finance, in the meeting.
In a statement on X, the chief minister said that he had declined to attend a federal government’s meeting about agriculture and Afghan refugees on the ground that attending such meetings without policy guidelines from detained PTI founder Imran Khan would be an insult to people’s mandate.
He hoped that the federal government would resolve the issue of his meeting with Mr Khan and direct relevant authorities to arrange his regular meetings with the party’s founder.
Mr Afridi said that his legal team was approaching the Islamabad High Court and other forums on the matter.
 







Hopes Centre will ensure his meeting with Imran in jail

Earlier in the day, he was denied a meeting with Mr Imran in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. He returned after waiting for permission for over two hours.
Mr Afridi has approached Supreme Court Chief Justice Yahya Afridi through the registrar of the apex court, requesting him to direct the federal government and other relevant authorities to arrange his meeting with Mr Imran.
 
 

The letter, sent by KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel, said that following his election as the chief minister, Mr Afridi was under constitutional and moral obligation to consult Imran Khan for guidance and instruction on urgent and sensitive matters concerning governance and cabinet formation in the province.
“I have already approached the secretary of the ministry of interior and secretary home department Punjab for arranging a meeting Mr Khan; however, despite repeated communications follow-ups, the said meeting has not yet been confirmed,” the letter noted.
It added that Mr Afridi was responsible for the governance and securing the fundamental rights and matters relating to the security situation, formation of provincial cabinet, and critical economic challenges faced by the people of the province.
“There is a pressing need to seek direction from Mr [Imran] Khan regarding these matters and others related to the federation and other provinces,” the letter said. It said that seeking the PTI founder’s directions was extremely essential as the Punjab government had stopped inter-provincial trade of flour and wheat.
Mr Afridi, who took oath of office on Wednesday after several days of deadlock, has yet not to form his cabinet.
Talking to reporters on the Peshawar High Court’s premises here on Thursday, he said that he would announce his cabinet after getting its approval from Mr Imran.
Meanwhile, former adviser to the chief minister Muzzammil Aslam told Dawn that in the meeting with PM, he raised the province’s concerns over the hasty closure of 28 refugee camps in the province, as ordered by the federal government on Monday.
 
 

He said that KP had 38 refugee camps compared to 10 in Punjab and one in Balochistan, so the Centre shouldn’t take any hasty decision on the matter.
Mr Aslam said he also raised the issue of dignified return of refugees as well as business visa policy for Afghan businessmen.
He said that the meeting agreed that KP and the interior ministry would hold a meeting over the repatriation of refugees.

The decision was announced during a Zoom meeting between the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and the private sector, chaired by Member Customs Policy Ashhad Jawad and participated by Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry (QCCI) President Muhammad Ayub Mariani, Chief Collector Customs Irfan Javed, Collector Customs Jameel Baloch, State Bank representative Muhammad Yasir, commerce ministry official Zubair Khan, and other stakeholders.
The meeting focused on addressing long-standing hurdles in Pakistan-Iran trade, particularly issues related to the Electronic Import Form (EIF) and COO.
Speaking on the occasion, Ashhad Jawad said the government was taking all possible steps to promote legal and formal trade with Iran, and that the exemption of 57 items from the COO requirement was an important part of this effort. He emphasised that promoting legal trade was vital for the country’s economic prosperity.
He appreciated the active role of the QCCI and expressed confidence that the new policy would significantly enhance trade relations between Pakistan and Iran.
The QCCI president welcomed the federal government’s decision, saying that the chamber had consistently raised concerns about the mandatory EIF and COO requirements on behalf of the province’s traders.
Mr Mariani urged local traders to take advantage of the new facility and expand trade with Iran. He also disclosed that the QCCI had submitted a second list of 37 additional items to the authorities concerned, recommending their exemption from the COO requirement. “We hope that the second list will also be approved soon.”
Published in Dawn, October 18th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-18 04:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68f2eedb7ec05.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949689/departing-mncs' target='_blank'><strong>Departing MNCs</strong></a><br><p>THE recent exit of the American multinational company Procter & Gamble (P&G) from Pakistan has created a stir in the market — unlike the relatively quiet departure of other MNCs over the past three years.
Since 2022, at least 13 companies have exited the country. Among them are four from the pharmaceutical sector, two each from energy and ride-hailing, and one each from technology and telecom. P&G’s departure is particularly significant as it produced a wide range of consumer goods; Gillette was a subsidiary of P&G, and Gul Ahmed Textile had an export garments division associated with it.
People may attribute different reasons to such exits — Pakistan’s challenging economic climate, security concerns, political uncertainty, delays in price approvals, unethical promotional practices by some local pharmaceutical firms, rampant corruption, and inconsistent utilities.
 
 

However, analysts cite different causes. In many cases, these exits are less about Pakistan and more about global restructuring. Several MNCs are relocating as part of a strategic shift towards operating from regional hubs rather than maintaining facilities in every country, allowing them to benefit from economies of scale. Shell’s departure, for example, was part of its global reorganisation.
Growing competition from local firms, the dominance of the informal sector, and shrinking profit margins have also eroded group performance. Combined with high taxation and a weakening rupee, these factors have contributed to the exodus.

MNCs strove to comply fully with applicable laws.

That said, an exit does not always mean the withdrawal of products or brands. Many companies retain their presence thr­ough a distributor model and continue relying on third-party market research and adv­ertising agencies to promote their brands.
MNCs have played a significant role in shaping and developing the ‘corporate culture’ in Pakistan, particularly in Karachi. Corporate culture can be defined as “the personality of a company” which entails its “shared values, beliefs, and behaviours that shape how employees interact with each other and the outside world”.
The golden period for MNCs in Pakistan was spread over the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s. Unlike local employers, MNCs placed top priority on maintaining emp­l­o­yee relations. Higher employee satisfaction translated into greater productivity and better business outcomes. Customer care was another area of emphasis: companies ensured that clients anywhere in Pakistan had easy access to their representatives for queries and assistance with transactions.
 
 

MNCs introduced professional management systems that were largely absent in local enterprises. These included structured training and development, job des­criptions, performance evaluations, career progression, and policy frameworks for human resources and other departments. Expenditure on employee development was considered an investment — based on the belief that improved knowledge and skills would enhance productivity.
MNCs also strove to comply fully with applicable laws, including labour regulations. They generally supported workers’ right to form and operate trade unions, fostering mutual respect. Because of fair dealings by management, unions would often reciprocate, ensuring a peaceful work environment. Even during the early 1970s — a period of industrial unrest — MNCs largely remained unaffected due to their ethical and transparent practices. The relative stability of the 1960s further encouraged entrepreneurs to invest not only in trade but also in manufacturing.
A notable example is Esso, which established its fertiliser plant in Daharki, Sindh, in 1968. Inc­o­r­porated as Esso Fer­ti­liser Pakistan Ltd in 1965, the plant — then the largest forei­gn in­­vestment in Pakistan — began producing urea in 1968. Later renamed Exxon Che­m­ical Pakistan Ltd (ECPL), it was sold to employees in 1991 through an employee-led buyout. It was regarded as a model company with exemplary management practices and performance.
 
 

Another corporate giant, Imperial Chemical Industries, a British firm, had established a soda ash plant in Khewra in 1944, which became Khewra Soda Ash Company Ltd in 1952. The company was renamed ICI Pakistan Ltd in 1966. It maintained a head office and a specialty chemicals unit in Karachi, produced pharmaceuticals and agrochemical products, and operated a paints plant in Lahore and a polyester fibre plant in Sheikhupura. Later, it set up a Pure Terephthalic Acid plant at Port Qasim, Karachi.
As ICI wound up operations globally, its Pakistan operations were sold in July 2012 to an established industrial group through a consortium led by a dominant cement company. It is heartening that the successors of both ECPL and ICI continue to follow the management systems they inherited from these global corporate giants.

The PTI, the opposition and the governor of KP interpreted the Constitution in their own self-serving ways.
At issue was the legal point raised by the opposition and the governor that the election of the new CM was not possible till the resignation of the then outgoing provincial chief executive became effective after the governor’s ‘verification’ and formal ‘acceptance’.
It is not clear what the opposition thought it would gain by delaying the election when none of the three major opposition parties could agree on a joint candidate to contest the vote against PTI nominees. Nor was any effort, unlike in the past, made to pressure or entice pro-PTI MPAs to defect.
 
 

Defection, in fact, had been made easier by the Election Commission when it declared the pro-PTI MPAs of the Sunni Ittehad Council independent, thus free from any obligation to follow any party’s direction. The opposition, it seems, was misled into playing a game without a plan, probably encouraged by some powerful voices that had publicly ‘rejected’ PTI leader Imran Khan’s choice of Sohail Afridi as the new CM.
There are no constitutional provisions to support the position taken by the opposition and the governor on the issue of the CM’s resignation, and the resignation becomes automatically effective upon being tendered to the governor.
Had there been any doubt about the ‘genuineness’ of the resignation, it was wiped out when the then outgoing CM, Ali Amin Gandapur, publicly announced in the provincial assembly that he had resigned and the ‘joke’ about delaying the election of his successor should come to a stop.

It is unclear how far the new CM’s conduct will be different from that of his predecessor.

The CM’s election in the legislature further sealed the opposition’s fate when the new provincial chief executive was elected by a thumping majority, securing 90 votes in a House of 145. This was an overwhelming mandate as a candidate for CM needed only 73 votes to prove his or her numerical majority.
 
 

In this case, the new CM actually secured 17 extra votes, reflecting that not even a single pro-PTI ‘independent’ MPA wavered by defecting as the practice has sadly been in the past. As another new normal in Pakistani politics, the matter landed in the Peshawar High Court where the chief justice promptly accepted the PTI’s point of view and directed the governor to administer the oath to the chief minister-elect by a fixed time, and nominated, under Article 255(2), the KP Assembly Speaker to conduct the oath in case the governor was unwilling or unable to comply with the court’s direction.
It is ironical that Article 255(2) was amended under the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which gave the power to the provincial high court to nominate someone else to administer the oath if the governor was not available to do so. Earlier, this power to nominate someone else was available with the governor. Had this article not been amended, the opposition and the governor might have delayed the oath-taking by a few more days.
A division bench of the Peshawar High Court also rejected the plea filed by one of the opposition candidates seeking to declare the CM’s election unconstitutional. Understandably, the PTI leadership was profuse in its praise for the judiciary for delivering justice to their party and candidate.
 
 

Fortunately, the governor eventually administered the oath to the CM-elect in the stately Governor’s House though surrounded by a messy crowd which constantly pushed and jostled to get close to the CM. This is how the first phase of the new saga came to an end.
It remains to be seen how far the policy and conduct of the new CM will be different from that of Mr Gandapur, who constantly tried to navigate a balancing act. On the one hand, there were clear instructions from Imran Khan to leave no stone unturned to secure his and his wife’s release, along with that of scores of other incarcerated party leaders, even if it meant violent confrontation with the federal government and its law enforcers.
The former CM had led quite a few rallies to Islamabad — some of them violent; he sounded aggressive most of the time and even threatened to respond, bullet for bullet, if his rally was stopped again. Despite this confrontational posture, he did not cross certain red lines and that might have been his undoing.
For example, he was asked not to let the annual provincial budget 2025-26 pass in the assembly but he justifiably didn’t comply. He also held meetings with the federal interior minister and shook his hand, too, which was criticised in the strongest, even obscene, terms in pro-PTI social media.
 
 

He had practically abandoned the idea of leading assault rallies from KP to the national capital after the violent end of the Oct 24, 2024, rally in Islamabad. He also failed to comply with the wishes of Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan and wife Bushra Bibi. His public criticism of Aleema Khan might have proven to be the proverbial last straw. In short, he was not aggressive enough for the likes of Imran Khan and his family.
The new CM has declared in his post-election maiden speech in the assembly that he is the ‘champion of agitational politics’. Instead of focusing on education, health, development and governance, he said that his top priority was to secure the release of Imran Khan and his wife. This must have gone down well with the PTI leader and his family. He also said in his first speech that he was Pakistani first and Pakhtun later.
One is not sure how much this will calm the nerves of his detractors; we must wait and see if his ‘balancing act’ works better than that of his predecessor.

On Monday, members of the far-right party and LEAs clashed in Muridke, as the state aborted the group’s attempt to march on Islamabad, apparently to protest in front of the US embassy in ‘solidarity’ with Gaza.
From then onwards, the TLP’s leaders have reportedly gone underground, thousands of supporters have been rounded up, while the group’s mosques and madressahs are being seized by the state. Unlike previous clashes between the TLP and the government, this time it appears that the rulers aim to dismantle the religiously inspired party permanently. On Friday, the Punjab information minister said the summary to ban the TLP had been sent to the centre. Earlier, several federal ministers said that the crackdown would not relent. This would be the second ban in the TLP’s turbulent decade-old history.
However, simply publishing a notification in the official gazette may not be enough to deal effectively with the TLP phenomenon. In Pakistan’s history of far-right religious activism, most sectarian and jihadi groups have belonged to the Deobandi or Ahle Hadith schools, while there have also been a few prominent Shia militant groups.
 
 

The TLP, meanwhile, represents the Barelvi school, and has used emotive topics such as blasphemy and other sensitive religious issues to mobilise the public. Its history is certainly problematic. It has on numerous occasions clashed with the law, while its role in organising mobs has also been troubling.
Moreover, it has supported violent campaigns against minority groups, including Christians and Ahmadis, particularly in Punjab, targeting the places of worship of these communities. The TLP is also a major political force, getting millions of votes in the last general elections. Therefore, while an official clampdown may provide temporary relief, it might not produce long-term results.
Banning groups in Pakistan has not proved effective in countering extremist violence. For example, the first major bans were put in place during the Musharraf regime. Many of the groups remain active more than two decades after they were ‘banned’, changing their names several times.
 
 

If the state really wants to address the issue of the TLP and other violent groups, instead of bans, it should focus on prosecuting the leaders and activists who promote and participate in violence and who actively engage in hate speech. Because the state has been weak thus far in enforcing the law, powerful violent groups have gained the confidence to continue with their disruptive activities. Groups must be free to organise, but no one can be allowed to advocate violence against any community, or endorse hate speech.
Moreover, protests must remain peaceful. If the state ‘bans’ groups, then loses interest and starts looking away, these outfits will re-emerge, and the cycle of violence and confrontation will continue in perpetuity.

The National Assembly Standing Committee’s decision came following a briefing given by Pakistan Rail­ways’ officials to the committee about the October 7 attack on the Jaffer Express.
The officials said that Jaffer Exp­ress was targeted with an improvised explosives device on October 7 near Sultan Kot Railways Station in Sindh.
The blast derailed five bogies and damaged the track. Seven passengers, including Pakistan Railw­ays employees, suffered injuries.
The standing committee, chaired by Ramesh Lal in the absence of the chairman, heard updates on the Jaffer Express train blast, encroachments of railways lands and Kara­chi-Pipri freight corridor project.
 
 

Briefing the committee on the freight corridor project, the secretary of Pakistan Railways said the project would start from Keamari, linking Karachi Port to Pipri. On this route, he said, two new railway lines will be laid to connect it with Motorway M-9.
The committee also discussed various aspects of the project. The panel was informed that the terminal will initially operate on a small scale, and the first pha­­se is expected to be co­­m­­pleted within six months.
The committee was further informed that 17 freight trains will operate on a daily basis and the project will cost $400 million.
Divisional Superinten­d­ent of Pakistan Railways in Sukkur brie­fed the commit­tee about encroachments on PR land in Sukkur.
He said that 16,458 acres of land were under operational use, 3,253.233 acres under encroachment, and 457 acres occupied by land grabbers.

The complainant further stated that Mufti Shah Mir and Maulana Ghulam Sarwar were killed by unidentified assailants, but Mr Baloch blamed the FC for their deaths without any evidence.

The interior minister’s remarks came during a meeting with Jamiat Ule­ma-i-Pakistan Secre­tary General Allama Shah Owais Noorani, in which detailed discussions were held on religious harmony, tolerance, and national unit, according to a press release by the Interior Ministry.
Both leaders agreed that “no action would be taken against any innocent person, and all of the innocent will be released,” the ministry said. They also agreed that no madressah [seminary] will be closed down.
 






Mr Naqvi reiterated that those bearing arms against the government will face the law.
“Holding arms against the state can never be allowed,” Mr Naqvi was quoted as saying, adding that the leaders also agre­­ed that “the miscreants will be dealt with strictly.”
Mr Naqvi emphasised that no one will be permitted to take the law into their own hands.
“There is no place for miscreants and extremists in the Pakistan of Quaid-i-Azam,” Naqvi said, adding that elements spreading “unrest, chaos, and extremism will be dealt with with an iron hand.”
 
 

The minister acknowledged the valuable role religious scholars play in promoting interfaith harmony and patience.
He stressed that the promotion of religious education is a collective responsibility and called on all segments of society to ensure lasting peace, tolerance, and harmony.
Allama Noorani, in turn, assured the government of his party’s “full cooperation” in promoting sustainable peace, tolerance, and brotherhood across the country.

However, his father, Assistant Commissioner Ziarat Muhammad Afzal Baqi, is still missing, and authorities are making all-out efforts for his safe recovery.
Police officials said that after his recovery, Mustansar Bilal, the son of assistant commissioner, reached the Zardalo area of Harnai, from where he was taken into protective custody and handed over to the Deputy Commissioner Harnai.
It may be recalled that the assistant commissioner and his son were abducted about two months ago by unidentified armed men while returning to Ziarat after a picnic along with their family. The kidnappers allowed the family members, security guard and driver to go home after setting the official vehicle on fire.
 
 

On Sept 21, reports circulated that the kidnappers had killed AC Ziarat and dumped his body in a mountainous area of Harnai district. An official of Ziarat administration also confirmed that Afzal Baqi had been killed by the kidnappers and even released a photograph purported to be his body.
However, Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti later informed the provincial assembly that the killing of the assistant commissioner was not confirmed, assuring that the government was making all-out efforts for his safe recovery.
Officials said that Mustansar Bilal reached the Zardalo area of Harnai district and informed local authorities about his presence in the area. “Mustansar is safe and sound in the custody of Deputy Commissioner Harnai,” police officials said.
Authorities, however, said that AC Ziarat remains missing and efforts were underway for his safe recovery. They did not disclose how Mustansar Bilal managed to reach Harnai.

• Preliminary damage of this year’s floods put at $2.9bn across sectors
• 1,039 dead, 1,067 injured; surveys to conclude in two weeks
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan suffered more than $30 billion in damages and losses in the 2022 floods but received only $600 million in foreign assistance, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Friday.
Apart from that, all international commitments were loans, most of them repurposed from previous facilities, he said while releasing preliminary estimates for flood-related damages at Rs822bn (about $2.9bn).
“This is an irony,” he said, adding that the global community had pledged a $100bn climate-finance fund but “did not provide even $1bn”.
Therefore, after consultations, the government decided to meet the latest losses through domestic resources rather than “external crutches” despite the around $3bn damages to agriculture and infrastructure on top of human lives following the recent “apocalyptic floods”.
The minister said the surveys for flood losses, including those in the economic field, were currently in progress and would be finalised in about two weeks. He said the preliminary report entailed human losses of more than 1,039 lives and 1067 injuries, besides about Rs822bn damage to infrastructure and agriculture.
 
 

This included Rs430bn damages in the agriculture sector, Rs307bn in infrastructure, besides damage to more than 229,763 houses, including 213,000 in Punjab alone.
Besides, 6,370 houses were damaged or destroyed in Balochistan, 3,677 in Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, 3,332 in Sindh and 3,222 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“At least 6.5m people across 70 districts have felt the brunt, including around 4m temporarily displaced as waters receded and families assessed the wreckage”, he said.
More than 2,811 kilometres of roads were damaged, over 2,200 head of livestock lost, around 2,200 educational institutions affected, more than 250 health facilities impacted and roughly 866 water-infrastructure assets hit, he added.
Crop losses included up to 3.4m bales of cotton, more than 1m tonnes of rice and an estimated 1.3m to 3.3m tonnes of sugarcane, subject to ground verification.
Punjab suffered the most, with Rs632bn of the nationwide Rs822bn tally, the minister said, adding that the provincial chief minister had briefed a meeting chaired by the prime minister on a support package for farmers and families.
On development expenditure, Mr Iqbal said that about Rs40bn had been disbursed under the Public Sector Development Programme in the first quarter, almost 16 per cent higher than last year’s Rs34.8bn.
Addressing progress under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, he said minutes of the recent Joint Cooperation Committee would be finalised by the end of the month and dispelled the impression that tangible progress on the second phase of bilateral economic cooperation was missing in the JCC.
At Pakistan’s request, China had agreed to finance 85 per cent of the Karakoram Highway works linked to the Diamer-Bhasha Dam, with bidding expected to start in about two months, he said.
 
 

The government has designated 2026 as the “year of reform” to modernise the economy, society and politics, the minister announced, aiming to convert recent diplomatic and macroeconomic gains into faster growth through “bold and quick” structural changes.
A three-year reform window would prioritise social, economic and political measures to encourage wealth creation and investment, remove “anti-business bias” and cut red tape and bureaucratic inertia. The prime minister has constituted a high-level forum to present an action plan this year for implementation in 2026.
The minister said that while the National  Institute of Public Administration was being converted into a university to train bureaucracy in line with global standards for economic development and business promotion, many of the social sector reforms were not possible without the full involvement of provinces.

Speaking at the Rome Water Dialogue convened by the Food and Agric­ulture Organisation, he warned that any nation attempting to control transboundary water flows violates international law.
“Any attempt to unilaterally alter transboundary water flows or weaponise water access is not only dangerous but contrary to international norms and sustainable development goals,” Mr Shah said.
Representing Pakistan at the global forum, Mr Shah raised serious concerns about India’s conduct regarding the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), long seen as a successful example of bilateral cooperation.
 
 

“The Indus Waters Treaty has long been considered a model of cooperation, even during times of conflict between Pakistan and India,” he said. “However, India’s recent unilateral actions to suspend treaty-level engagements risk undermining this crucial framework.”
Mr Shah described the IWT as one of the world’s most resilient water-sharing agreements and urged the international community to take note of what he called a threat to transboundary water governance. He called on global stakeholders to ensure that such treaties remain “sacrosanct”.
“The international community (must) act as stewards of peace and justice,” Shah forcefully urged, stressing the importance of the treaty for the well-being of Pakistan’s population.

In addition, security forces claimed to have foiled a terror bid in Bajaur after a large cache of explosives, loaded into a non-Customs paid vehicle, was destroyed in Lowi Mamund tehsil.
In Lakki Marwat, officials said an operation was launched on reports about the presence of militants in the rural area located on the border with Punjab, near Mianwali.
Security forces spotted the terrorist hideout in the forest between Kaichi Kamar and Sultankhel, which was reportedly targeted through a unmanned drone.

Forces foil major terror bid in Bajaur by disabling explosive-laden vehicle

During the operation, eight militants were eliminated and their hideouts were destroyed, while security forces seized a large quantity of arms, ammunition and explosives and launched a sanitisation operation to neutralise any other threats in the area.
 
 

Separately, TTP ‘commander’ Tariq Kochi, who hails from Toi Khula tehsil of Lower South Waziristan, was reportedly killed near the border with Balochistan by unidentified gunmen.
Sources said the incident occurred near the Tesh mountain range, where Kochi and other militants were ambushed by unidentified individuals.
Police said that Kochi had been involved for the past year in multiple incidents of attacks, shootings, and target killings targeting security forces, police personnel, and civilians in the area.
Security forces also claimed to have foiled a terrorism bid by destroying a huge cache of explosives loaded in a car in Bajaur.
A senior police official said that the sabotage bid was foiled in Thangai area at around 11:15 am, when the security personnel targeted a suspected vehicle laden with explosives.
DPO Waqas Rafique said the explosives-laden vehicle was disabled by firing at it, adding that no loss of life was reported.
The official, however, said that an investigation was underway to ascertain who was behind the failed sabotage bid.

Speaking at a signing ceremony, the prime minister described the transaction as “the first drop of rain” in a broader effort to deepen economic collaboration with the United Arab Emirates.
 






The event marked the official transfer of a majority stake in FWBL to IHC under a government-to-government (G2G) framework. The UAE delegation was led by Sheikh Zayed bin Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, chairman of 2PointZero.
The federal cabinet had earlier approved the divestment of the government’s entire stake in FWBL, reportedly valued at $14.6 million (approximately Rs4.1 billion), a figure yet to be formally disclosed.

Buyer to inject Rs6.8bn more to meet capital requirements

In addition to acquiring the bank, IHC will meet the total minimum capital requirement of Rs10bn over five years. As of December 2024, FWBL’s equity stood at Rs3.2bn, with the new investor set to inject Rs6.8bn to bridge the gap.
Privatisation momentum
PM Shehbaz attributed the successful closure of the deal to the “determined and focused” leadership of Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Adviser on Privatisation Muhammad Ali. He reaffirmed his government’s commitment to restructuring state-owned enterprises and enabling private sector-led economic growth.
He added that FWBL’s founding mission — to support women entrepreneurs — would not only be preserved but also strengthened through professional management and targeted investments in sectors such as agriculture and industry.
IHC sees long-term growth
IHC Chief Executive Syed Basar Shueb said the investment signals confidence in Pakistan’s financial sector and reflects a shared vision for long-term development.
“We see strong potential in the country’s financial sector and look forward to supporting the bank’s modernisation journey by leveraging technology, automating banking processes, and advancing the use of AI in financial decision-making,” he said.
According to an official statement, this marks the first bank privatisation conducted under the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Act 2022. FWBL, established in 1989, currently operates 42 branches across Pakistan, serving retail, SME, and corporate clients.

ISLAMABAD: With representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, a telling statement from the country’s defence minister indicated that the gloves were off, as Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack, targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended their two-day ceasefire.
Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province, as security sources claimed that precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, reportedly killing dozens of fighters.
“If someone attacks Afgha­nistan, our forces are ready to respond,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Ariana News. However, Pakistani security sources pointed out that the ceasefire agreement bet­ween the Afghan government and Pakistan did not preclude stri­kes on terror outfits and their hideouts.
 
 

There was no statement from Pakistan’s military, but terrorists linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group had claimed responsibility for the attack on Khaddi Fort in Mir Ali, where a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the main gate of a military camp before attempting to stage an incursion earlier in the day.
Although there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on losses suffered, security sources claimed to have foiled the attack by eliminating all attackers.
The attack began on Friday morning, with local sources describing a massive explosion, followed by heavy gunfire as terrorists attempted to enter the military camp. Sources said that “all four” attackers were killed.
Heavy price to pay
In a telling statement posted to X (formerly Twitter), Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the relationship with Kabul would no longer be like it was in the past. “There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,” he wrote.
Mr Asif accused Afghanistan of “sitting in India’s lap and plotting conspiracies against Pakis­tan”, saying that Islamabad “can no longer afford to have relations with Kabul like in the past”.
“All Afghans on Pakistani soil will have to go back to their homeland,” he wrote. “Now they have their own government [or] caliphate in Kabul. It has been five years since the Islamic revolution… they must live with Pakistan as neighbours.”
 






In the post, the defence minister elaborated on the visits by Pakistani delegations to Kabul and provided figures for acts of terrorism by groups operating out of Afghanistan and the total number of casualties.
Since the Taliban took power in 2021, Pakistani foreign ministers visited Kabul four times; defence ministers and the ISI chiefs visited twice; the special representative and foreign secretaries carried out five visits each; the national security adviser visited once, and the Joint Coordination Committee had eight meetings in the Afghan capital.
He added that there were 225 border flag meetings, 836 protest notes and 13 demarches.
“From 2021 to date: 3,844 mar­tyred (civilians, military, and law enforcement agencies combined). Terrorist incidents: 10,347,” the defence minister listed.
Truce talks?
The fresh exchanges on Fri­day night cast a shadow over the ceasefire, which had been exte­nded just a few hours earlier, as well as the planned Doha talks.
“The ceasefire has been mutually extended by both Pakistan and Afghanistan till the end of the talks in Doha, Qatar. The talks are ready to begin [on Saturday],” a security source said on Friday evening at the conclusion of the initial 48-hour truce, which had been in effect since Wednesday.
The two-day ceasefire was largely observed without violations, but the dialogue initially agreed at the time of its announ­cement, aimed at addressing what Pakistan’s Foreign Office described as a “complex but solvable iss­ue”, failed to take place during that period.
 
 

Earlier in the day, at his weekly media briefing, outgoing Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan reiterated: “Afghanistan has become a central breeding ground for global terrorism.”
He warned the international community against complacency, adding, “We do not have to wait for a big disaster happening at the global scale before we take remedial action. This fire will spread. This has to be stopped.”
 


No bilateral initiative for talks emerged during the first phase of the truce. How­ever, Qatar, which along with Saudi Arabia had pushed both sides to halt hostilities, offered to host their meeting in Doha. The talks, initially slated for Thursday or Friday, were postponed by a day due to logistical issues and reluctance within the Taliban leadership to engage, sources said.
Reports from Afghanistan suggest that the Taliban delegation would include Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub Mujahid and intelligence chief Mullah Wasiq.  Pakistan’s Foreign Office stayed silent on the matter, but a late-evening meeting between National Security Adviser and ISI chief Lt. Gen. Asim Malik and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar suggested that Gen Malik may travel to Doha.
Return of victims’ remains
Earlier on Friday, Afghan authorities handed over the bodies of seven Pakistani citizens — including two security personnel — to Pakistani officials at the border following the deadly Taliban attack in the Chaman sector on Tuesday.
“The Taliban authorities handed over all the seven bodies to Pakistan through Hilal-e-Ahmar Pakistan (Red Cres­cent),” Abdul Wali Khan Ghabizai of the Balochistan chapter of the organization confirmed. He said Taliban officials announced at the Vesh Mandi border post that they were returning the remains of Pakistanis who had died “in the armed clash between two countries.”
The bodies were taken to the District Hospital in Chaman for identification and medicolegal formalities.
“Five bodies were brought to the district hospital Chaman,” said Dr Muhammad Awais, the hospital’s medical superintendent. “Four out of five martyrs have been identified as residents of the border town, while the fifth could not be identified so far.”
Two of the deceased were identified as security personnel — Naik Suleman and Sepoy Sabir — whose remains were later transferred to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta. Officials said that four of the five civilians were killed by mortar shell splinters, while one was hit in the forehead. The victims — identified as Syed Ali Adozai, Muhammad Asghar Ashaizai, Rozi Khan Salehzai, and Nasibullah Salehzai — were local daily-wage workers. They were buried in their native villages Friday evening.
Local residents in Chaman claimed that at least 12 Pakistani civ­ilians were killed earlier in Taliban attacks in Spin Boldak, the first Afghan district across the border.
Responding to reports that bodies of some Pakistani soldiers had been mutilated, the Foreign Office spokesman at the weekly media briefing said, “This kind of savagery, bestiality, is condemnable, and it needs to be condemned in the strongest words possible. This is beyond the pale. It is beyond humanity, and this has deeply offended us and deeply hurt the Pakistani people.” “It is not something to be forgi­ven and forgotten easily,” Mr Khan added.

The court has summoned the defendant to appear on Oct 31 to respond to the allegations.
Syed Muhammad Ali Jafri, a consumer, filed an application through his counsel, Abdul Ahad Khan, under the relevant sections of the Sindh Consumer Protection Act, 2015, before the judicial magistrate of the consumer court (South) against the defendant Mondo Coffee Bar, operating in DHA, Phase-VIII.
The counsel alleged that the café was using the “trademark, design, and logo” of Thailand-based café Mondo Espresso & Tea Bar for financial gain through wrongful means.
After a preliminary hearing, the court summoned the defendant “to appear before this court in person, or by a pleader instructed and be able to answer all material question relating to the complaint, or who shall be accompanied by some person able to answer all such questions on October 31, 2025.”

Consumer court will take up matter against Mondo Coffee Bar on 31st

“You are hereby directed to produce on that day all the documents upon which you intend to rely in support of justification and file your written statement on the date of hearing,” the summons added.
In the application, the counsel claimed that after hearing about the much-hyped coffee shop in the DHA — initially operating under the name Mondo Espresso & Tea Bar and promoted as part of an international coffee chain — which later changed its name to Mondo Coffee Bar, the plaintiff visited the café in May along with a colleague and purchased coffee, believing it to be a branch of the Thailand-based coffee brand.
However, the applicant maintained that he was “astonished and stunned” to learn through social media that the DHA-based café was allegedly “wrongfully, illegally, fraudulently, and without lawful authority” using the brand name and trademark logo of the Thailand-owned Mondo Espresso & Tea Bar.
Referring to the official Instagram page of the Phuket-based café, counsel Mr Ahad submitted that the original café had clarified that the coffee shop operating in Pakistan under a similar name had no association with the defendant, who had allegedly “cleverly stolen” the name, logo, and design closely resembling the original brand.
He added that the defendant was allegedly using coffee cups, takeaway bags, and tissue papers bearing a trademark logo and design strikingly similar to that of the Thailand-based coffee brand.
The counsel argued that the plaintiff fell within the definition of a consumer, while the defendant qualified as a manufacturer, and that coffee constituted a product under the relevant sections of the Sindh Consumer Protection Act (SCPA), 2015.
He added that the defendant’s dishonest acts clearly fell within the definition of faulty and defective services under Section 13 of the Act, amounting to a blatant violation of its provisions.
The counsel further contended that the defendant had allegedly violated Section 21 of the Act, which pertains to false, deceptive, and misleading representation, thereby constituting an unfair practice through false misrepresentation.
He maintained that the plaintiff was therefore entitled to damages, compensation for economic loss, special damages, consequential and non-consequential relief, and a refund of payment.
The counsel pleaded for an award of Rs5 million to the plaintiff as damages for providing faulty and defective services and deceptive marketing.

“Hopefully, they won’t need it. Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over with without thinking about Tomahawks,” Trump told journalists, including an AFP reporter, as the two leaders met at the White House.
Trump added that he was confident of getting Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the invasion he launched in 2022, following a phone call with the Kremlin chief a day earlier.
The US and Russian presidents agreed on Thursday to a new summit in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, which would be their first since an August meeting in Alaska that failed to produce any kind of peace deal.
“I think that President Putin wants to end the war,” Trump said.
But Zelensky, who wore a dark suit for his third meeting with Trump in Washington since the US president’s return to power, demurred, saying that Putin was “not ready” for peace.
Ukraine has been lobbying Washington for Tomahawks for weeks, arguing that the missiles could help put pressure on Russia to end its brutal three-and-a-half-year invasion. But on the eve of Zelensky’s visit, Putin warned Trump in a call against delivering the weapons, saying it could escalate the war and jeopardise peace talks.
Trump said the United States had to be careful not to “deplete” its own supplies of Tomahawks, which have a range of over 1,600 kilometres.
‘Many questions’
Diplomatic talks on ending Russia’s invasion have stalled since the Alaska summit. But Trump, who once said he could end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, appears set on pursuing a breakthrough to follow the Gaza ceasefire deal that he brokered last week.
The Kremlin said Friday that “many questions” needed resolving before Putin and Trump could meet, including who would be on each negotiating team.
But it brushed off suggestions Putin would have difficulty flying over European airspace.
Hungary said it would ensure Putin could enter and “hold successful talks” with the US despite an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes.
“Budapest is the only suitable place in Europe for a USA-Russia peace summit,” Hungarian President Viktor Orban said on X on Friday.
 






Trump frustration
Zelensky’s visit to Washington, Ukraine’s main military backer, will be his third since Trump returned to office. During this time, Trump’s position on the Ukraine war has shifted dramatically back and forth.
At the start of his term, Trump and Putin reached out to each other as the US leader derided Zelensky as a “dictator without elections.”

Tensions came to a head in February, when Trump accused his Ukrainian counterpart of “not having the cards” in a rancorous televised meeting at the Oval Office. Relations between the two have since warmed as Trump has expressed growing frustration with Putin.
But Trump has kept a channel of dialogue open with Putin, saying that they “get along.” The US leader has repeatedly changed his position on sanctions and other steps against Russia following calls with the Russian president.
Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, describing it as a “special military operation” to demilitarise the country and prevent the expansion of Nato.
Kyiv and its European allies say the war is an illegal land grab that has resulted in tens of thousands of civilian and military casualties and widespread destruction.
Russia now occupies around a fifth of Ukrainian territory — much of it ravaged by fighting. On Friday, the Russian defence ministry announced it had captured three villages in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions.</p><small>2025-10-17 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629128-adviser-warns-against-weaponising-water-as-threat-to-global-norms' target='_blank'><strong>Adviser warns against weaponising water as threat to global norms</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier this week, AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed announced that he had resigned from his position, citing “some unavoidable reasons”. However, a senior official at the AJK prime minister’s office told Dawn.com that the resignation had been “received but not yet accepted”.
AJK Finance Minister Abdul Majid Khan and Food Minister Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim announced today they would step down at a joint press conference at the Muzaffarabad Press Club, while Sports, Youth and Culture Minister Asim Sharif Butt sent his resignation directly to the prime minister, opting to stay away from media interaction.
All three were elected on PTI tickets in the 2021 general elections from LA-45 (Valley-VI), LA-38 (Jammu-V) and LA-42 (Valley-III) — constituencies reserved for Kashmiri refugees who migrated to Pakistan after 1947. However, the trio had later joined the faction of PTI defectors led by PM Haq in 2023.
Their resignations came in protest against the agreement recently signed by a seven-member federal government committee and the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC), which, among other matters, addressed the contentious issue of the 12 legislative assembly seats reserved for Kashmiri refugees settled across Pakistan.
Calling the JAAC an “unelected, baton-wielding group”, Khan and Ibrahim said the accord had effectively legitimised an “unconstitutional and morally indefensible demand, reached under pressure and without wider consultation”.
They alleged that the deal violated the fundamental rights of thousands of Kashmiri refugees and struck at the heart of AJK’s constitutional and political framework.
They maintained that the campaign against the refugee seats was a malicious move by a small group of traders and self-styled representatives pursuing narrow interests “under the guise of reforms”.
The real target, they asserted, was not the government but the identity, representation and political recognition of the refugee community that had made immense sacrifices for Pakistan and the cause of Kashmir’s accession.
Both ministers argued that these seats were not a privilege but a historic and conscious constitutional decision, which was part of AJK’s political setup since 1947. The reserved seats, they said, symbolised the constitutional acknowledgment of the sacrifices and long displacement endured by those who lost everything for the cause of Pakistan.
They termed the JAAC’s questioning of these seats’ existence a denial of the pain, identity and political significance of an entire generation exiled for its struggle for accession to Pakistan.
They said they had brought this issue to the notice of the president and prime minister of Pakistan in black and white, and added that they would “knock on all doors to frustrate the designs of the elements hellbent upon creating a wedge between local and migrant Kashmiris and thus damaging the Kashmir cause”.
Khan also shared his two-page resignation letter, in which he reaffirmed his belief in the ideology of the State of Jammu and Kashmir’s lawful accession and integration with Pakistan, in accordance with the wishes of its entire population, including the 2.5 million Pakistan-based refugees.
He said it had become “utterly impossible to continue to serve under the present government, which has failed to effectively defend and protect the constitutional rights of Kashmiri refugees, nor shown the will to assume responsibility or challenge this serious constitutional violation”.
Declaring that he had no moral choice but to resign from the AJK cabinet, effective today, Khan vowed to continue defending the rights of Jammu and Kashmir refugees and to raise his voice for their rightful place in the political and constitutional structures of both AJK and Pakistan.
In his resignation letter, Ibrahim echoed similar views, stating that Prime Minister Haq had failed to stop the “unlawful demand” raised by the JAAC and to protect the rights of around three million Pakistan-based refugees from occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
Both Khan and Ibrahim charged PM Haq of conspiring against the refugee members of the legislative assembly and called upon him to resign from office.
Butt, in his letter, expressed his and his constituents’ loss of confidence in the AJK government in the wake of the agreement, saying he could no longer remain part of it.
Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down at the end of September.
Since then, rival groups staged protests and strikes, trading blame for the violence which marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory.
On October 2, a delegation from the federal government travelled to Muzaffarabad for talks with the JAAC in a bid to put an end to the ongoing unrest in the territory. The agreement was signed after two rounds of talks.</p><small>2025-10-17 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1718303634da4b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949553/trump-says-he-expects-expansion-of-abraham-accords-soon' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says he expects expansion of Abraham accords soon</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said he expected an expansion of the Abraham Accords soon and hopes Saudi Arabia will join the pact that normalised diplomatic relations between Israel and some Arab states.
“I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in. I think when Saudi Arabia goes in, everybody goes in,” Trump said in an interview broadcast on Friday on Fox Business Network.
Trump said he had “some very good conversations” as recently as Wednesday with states that have indicated their willingness to join the accords.
“I think that they’re going to all go in very soon,” Trump said in the interview, which was recorded on Thursday.
The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed the accords in 2020 during Trump’s first term in the White House, breaking a longstanding taboo to become the first Arab states to recognise Israel in a quarter century. Morocco and Sudan followed suit.
Trump, who convened Muslim and European leaders in Egypt to discuss the future of the Gaza Strip on Monday, has presented his plan to end the onslaught in Gaza as the catalyst for a wider regional peace settlement.
He said then that more countries would join the Abraham Accords initiative and even floated the idea of a peace deal between arch Middle East enemies Iran and Israel, telling the Israeli parliament he thought Iran wanted one: “Wouldn’t it be nice?”
Earlier in June, Foreign Mini­ster Ishaq Dar ruled out the possibility of Pakistan joining the Abraham Accords, stating that such a move would effectively mean abandoning the country’s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict and recognising Israel.
“We are not ready to recognise Israel until the two-state solution to the Palestine conflict is accepted,” Dar said. “There is no change in our stated policy on the Palestine issue.”</p><small>2025-10-17 16:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/17181302fcdf95a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949545/at-least-71-new-dengue-cases-confirmed-in-kp-experts-link-rise-to-climate-change' target='_blank'><strong>At least 71 new dengue cases confirmed in KP; experts link rise to climate change</strong></a><br><p>At least 71 new dengue cases were confirmed across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the last 24 hours, according to a situation report issued on Friday by the Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response System (IDSRS) at the Directorate-General Health Services (DGHS).
The report stated that 27 of the new patients were hospitalised, bringing the total number of currently hospitalised dengue cases in the province to 48. So far this year, KP has recorded a total of 3,582 laboratory-confirmed cases, 1,474 hospitalisations, 3,314 recoveries, and two deaths.
Provincial Medical Entomologist at the DGHS Dengue Control Programme, Salahuddin Khan Marwat, told Dawn.com, “Climate change is a key factor in the spread of the disease to new areas.”
Marwat said the current weather conditions, persistent humidity, monsoon rains, and temperatures between 18 to 25 degrees Celsius, have created an ideal environment for mosquito breeding.
“This is why we see a spike in cases in October. The mosquitoes breed rapidly in these conditions,” he said, adding that both very high and very low temperatures slow down their reproduction.
He explained that previously, dengue was confined to districts like Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Haripur, and Abbottabad. “But now, cases have been reported in Chitral. Global warming and increased travel contribute to this spread,” he said.
According to the entomologist, the provincial government has prepared for potential outbreaks by designating 1,500 to 1,600 beds for dengue patients across all districts. “Around 400,000 test kits have also been procured and distributed to district health offices based on need,” he said.
He cautioned, however, against the indiscriminate use of insecticide sprays. “Sprays can kill beneficial insects like honeybees, butterflies, and fireflies and also lead to resistance. Globally, environmental cleaning and prevention of mosquito breeding are prioritised over spraying,” he noted.
Marwat stressed the need for public cooperation to curb dengue spread. “There are about 200,000 houses in Peshawar. If each household spends 20 minutes cleaning water containers and surroundings, we can clean the entire city in a day,” Marwat said.
He added that awareness campaigns, school programmes, and the government’s Dengue Action Plan are already in motion, but community engagement remains the biggest challenge.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Caused by the dengue virus, it leads to high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, rash, and in severe cases, internal bleeding or organ failure, according to the World Health Organisation.
With no specific treatment available, prevention focuses on mosquito control and protection from bites. The disease spreads rapidly in tropical and subtropical regions, often overwhelming health systems during seasonal outbreaks.</p><small>2025-10-17 15:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/171932293a8186b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949557/kremlin-envoy-proposes-putin-trump-tunnel-to-link-russia-and-us' target='_blank'><strong>Kremlin envoy proposes ‘Putin-Trump tunnel’ to link Russia and US</strong></a><br><p>Russia and the United States should build a “Putin-Trump” rail tunnel under the Bering Strait to link their countries, unlock joint exploration of natural resources and “symbolise unity”, a Kremlin envoy has suggested.
The proposal by Kirill Dmitriev, President Vladimir Putin’s investment envoy and head of Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, envisages a construction project costing $8 billion, funded by Moscow and “international partners”, to build a 70-mile (112-km) rail and cargo link in under eight years.
Dmitriev, who has helped spearhead a Russian charm offensive designed to revive US-Russia ties, floated the idea late on Thursday after Putin spoke to US President Donald Trump by phone and agreed to meet in Budapest to seek a way to stop the war in Ukraine.
Musk’s ‘boring company’ proposed as contractor
“The dream of a US-Russia link via the Bering Strait reflects an enduring vision from the 1904 Siberia-Alaska railway to Russia’s 2007 plan. RDIF has studied existing proposals, including the US-Canada-Russia-China railroad, and will support the most viable,” Dmitriev wrote on X.
The Bering Strait, 51 miles (82 km) wide at its narrowest point, separates Russia’s vast and sparsely populated Chukotka region from Alaska. Ideas to link them have been around for at least 150 years. The small Diomede islands, one Russian and one belonging to the US, sit in the middle of the strait, only 2.4 miles (4 km) apart.
Dmitriev, who has struck up a relationship with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, and suggested US energy majors could join Russian projects in the Arctic, proposed that the tunnel be built by The Boring Company, a US tunnel construction company owned by US billionaire and sometime Trump ally Elon Musk.
“Imagine connecting the US and Russia, the Americas and the Afro-Eurasia with the Putin-Trump Tunnel - a 70-mile link symbolising unity. Traditional costs are $65B+, but @boringcompany’s tech could reduce it to <$8B. Let’s build a future together,” Dmitriev wrote to Musk on X.
 






There was no immediate public response from Musk or Trump.
Beyond the tunnel itself, it would cost a huge sum to build and upgrade infrastructure on both sides of the strait. Chukotka’s existing roads and railways are sparse, at best.
Dmitriev said a plan for a “Kennedy-Khrushchev World Peace Bridge” over the strait had been floated during the Cold War. He posted a sketch from that era of the route it might have taken, with a graphic showing the route the new tunnel could take.
“RDIF has already invested in and built the first-ever Russia-China railroad bridge. The time has come to do more and connect the Continents for the first time in human history. The time has come to connect Russia and the US,” Dmitriev said.</p><small>2025-10-17 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629095-pakistan-afghanistan-48-hour-ceasefire-extended' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-Afghanistan ceasefire extended amid reports of Qatar-mediated talks</strong></a><br><p>

On Wednesday, Pakistan’s hopes of a first victory at the World Cup were hit by rain, with their crucial fixture against England being abandoned after a second downpour in Colombo.
Chasing a revised target of 113 to win after earlier rains had reduced the match to 31 overs per side, Pakistan were well on their way at 34-0 in 6.4 overs when rains returned to end any chance of the match being completed — saving England from their first ever loss against the Green Shirts.
Speaking at the pre-match press conference at the R. Pramedasa Stadium in Colombo, Omaima said: “We are not relaxed at all. We have a chance to go [to the] semis if we win the matches, like three matches.
“So maybe the scenario is open, so maybe we will win the three matches, so we have a chance in the semis.”
 
 

Omaima showed glimpses of form in the England encounter, hitting a couple of sublime drives through the covers on her way to an unbeaten run-a-ball 18.
She, along with fellow opener Muneeba Ali, will be pivotal to providing stability at the top for a batting line-up that has failed to cross the 200-run mark in the tournament so far.
“I think the main challenge is to open — play the new ball. If you saw the matches, they are seaming and the pitch is [helping] seam. I’m trying to play the new ball and working on it,” the right-handed batter said of the challenges of opening.
Pakistan’s bowling, however, has been the real positive for the Green Shirts so far — having strong sides like England and Australia 78-7 and 76-7 in back-to-back matches.
New Zealand head coach Ben Sawyer was also wary about the danger posed by the Pakistani bowling at the presser.
“From Pakistan, Yeah. Look, they’ve put some teams in some real tough spots, so I think they had Australia 6 for 60. And then obviously the other night England was 7 for 70. So, their bowling attack is one that we’ve got to be really wary of.
Sawyer also spoke about the improvements seen in the Pakistani top-order in the previous outing against England, saying: “Their top order is, they made a little bit — look like light work of maybe chasing down that total the other night. So, they’ve been impressive.”
The Kiwis also go into the encounter with a washout of their own against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. The match got called off after Sri Lanka scored a daunting 258-6 batting first.
Last week‘s defeat against Australia had left the Green Shirts’ knockout hopes hanging by a thread as Pakistan registered three losses on the trot.
Pakistan will be hoping to register their first win and get on the board on Saturday, and then hope the permutations and other teams’ results go in their favour to make it into the semis somehow — a quintessentially Pakistani World Cup experience.</p><small>2025-10-17 13:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/17174732e866a0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949548/more-than-14m-afghans-repatriated-no-further-extension-by-govt' target='_blank'><strong>More than 1.4m Afghans repatriated, no further extension by govt</strong></a><br><p>A high-level meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, was informed on Friday that as of October 16, a total of 1,477,592 Afghan nationals have been repatriated and the government will grant no further extension.
A drive to expel more than 1.3 million Afghan nationals with Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders, the last category of refugees legally living in the country without visas, has been underway since Sept 1 this year.
According to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the meeting’s attendees were told that only those Afghans who possess a valid Pakistani visa would be allowed to stay in Pakistan and the number of exit points on the Afghan side are being increased to make the repatriation process smoother and faster.
“Officials informed the meeting that harboring Afghan nationals residing illegally in Pakistan or allowing them to stay in guesthouses is a criminal offense, and efforts are underway to identify such individuals. The public will be involved in the repatriation process, and no one will be allowed to violate government policy by providing shelter to Afghan nationals,” stated the statement from the PMO.
PM Shehbaz emphasised that during the repatriation of illegal Afghan refugees, elderly persons, women, children, and minorities must be treated with dignity.
The meeting was attended by Chief of the Staff Army Field Marshall Asim Munir, chief ministers of all provinces except KP, premier of Azad Kashmir, federal ministers and other officials.
Referring to Afghanistan, the prime minister said that senior Pakistani officials, including the deputy prime minister, had visited Kabul multiple times to hold discussions with the Afghan interim government, urging them to prevent Afghan soil from being used for terrorism against Pakistan.
“Pakistan has made serious diplomatic and political efforts to stop the infiltration of militants from Afghanistan,” said the prime minister during the meeting.
“The brave people of Pakistan, who have lost loved ones in the war against terrorism, now ask: how long will the government continue to bear the burden of Afghan refugees?”
The prime minister maintained that the recent attack on the border areas of Pakistan from Afghanistan and support for terrorist infiltration is a “matter of serious concern”.
“The brave armed forces of Pakistan gave a strong and decisive response to this attack. Under the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir, the Pakistan Armed Forces repelled the Afghan attacks. The entire nation joins me in paying tribute to them,“ added Shehbaz.
Concluding the meeting, the premier urged all provinces to extend full cooperation regarding the repatriation of Afghan refugees. The forum also decided that all recommendations presented would be “strictly implemented”.
The UN’s refugee agency had reported that more than 3.5 million Afghans had been living in Pakistan, including around 700,000 people who came after the Taliban takeover in 2021. The UN estimated that half of them were undocumented.
Though Pakistan had taken care of Afghans during the past decades of war, the government is now compelled to say that the high number of refugees is eventually posing risks to national security and causing pressure on public services.</p><small>2025-10-17 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/17173342102ddbd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949546/56-magnitude-quake-jostles-kp-twin-cities-and-other-regions-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>5.6-magnitude quake jostles KP, twin cities and other regions: PMD</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Rawalpindi, Islamabad and other northern areas were jolted by tremors on Friday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
The PMD’s data showed that the quake was registered with a magnitude of 5.6 at a depth of 120 kilometres at 5:15pm. Tremors were felt in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Peshawar, Swat and Chitral.
The PMD stated that the quake’s epicentre was in the Hindu Kush mountains in Afghanistan. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) registered a 4.7 magnitude quake less than 30km from the western Pak-Afghan border, at a depth of 10km at 4:53pm.
However, USGS also registered a 5.5 magnitude earthquake less than 10km Pakistan’s northern border with Afghanistan. This one was registered at 5:15pm at a depth of 10km.

Last week, a magnitude 5 earthquake struck close to Punjab’s Layyah on Saturday night, according to the PMD. The department said the quake occurred 50km east of Layyah at 7:54pm at a depth of 20km.
Layyah Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Waseem Hayat told Dawn.com: “The earthquake was felt in the district but no emergency was reported.’’</p><small>2025-10-17 12:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629086-pmd-rejects' target='_blank'><strong>PMD rejects possibility of coldest winter in Pakistan this year</strong></a><br><p>

“The Punjab cabinet has given its approval for banning the TLP, and this has been forwarded to the Centre. So the legal requirement with regard to the provinces has been fulfilled. The provincial government, after giving its approval, has forwarded the summary to the Centre,” she said at a press conference in Lahore.
Her statement comes a day after the Punjab government decided to ask the Centre to ban the TLP, which had conducted a protest march “in solidarity with Gaza”, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy.
However, on Monday, the authorities launched a pre-dawn operation in Muridke, where the TLP had set up its protest camp on its way to its planned destination. The move by law enforcement agencies had triggered violent clashes, chaos dozens of arrests, resulting in the protest’s premature end.
There have been reports of authorities going down hard on the TLP since.
At the outset of her press conference today, Bokhari, without naming the TLP, also referred to “a protest called in the name of Gaza”, noting that the demonstration was “illogically” held even after a truce to end the Israeli onslaught in the strip went into effect.
She added that the protest had turned “bloody as always”.
“This is not the first time that this party — or I would rather call it a group — has resorted to such acts. Be it 2017, 2019, 2021 or 2022, there have been repeated attempts to paralyse the lives of people and shut the country down,” Bokhari added, apparently referring to the TLP’s previous protests that had turned violent.
“We saw a continuity of those instances this time as well,” the minister added. “The only difference this time was that the state and government together decided that this could not continue anymore. Pakistan cannot afford this anymore.”
The minister emphasised that everybody needed to think about how attempts were made to create chaos in the name of religion.
She further asserted that when the protesters had taken to the streets recently, multiple attempts were made to “engage them”, rejecting the accusations that the relevant authorities had not tried to resolve the issue through dialogue.
“They were engaged repeatedly, and requests were made to them. They were told that people are celebrating in Gaza,” she said, accusing the protesters of setting vehicles on fire and inflicting violence on policemen. “Were they (police personnel and vehicles) a hurdle in the way of resolving the issue of Gaza?” Bokhari raised the question.
Referring to a protest call for today after Friday prayers, she thanked the trader community, transporters and the public for “rejecting the call”.
Earlier this week, a statement by TLP Balochistan president Wazir Ahmad Rizvi had called on protesters to converge on Lahore’s Data Darbar today. Meanwhile, intelligence reports suggested that TLP activists may engage in violent clashes and widespread chaos after Friday prayer.
Separately, a group named Tanzeemat-i-Ahle Sunnat — which is not linked to the TLP — had also given a protest call for today, demanding a judicial inquiry into the Muridke operation.
Meanwhile, a Dawn report said police had planned a crackdown to round up the TLP leadership to scuttle its plans for protests today.
Speaking of the protest call for today, Bokhari had two videos played during the press conference, which she said were from Lahore and Rawalpindi today. In those videos, she said, life could be seen continuing as usual.
“So now, everybody should understand once and for all that they cannot be allowed to paralyse or shut the country down on the pretext of any excuse.”
Bokhari then shared that 1,648 policemen had been injured during last week’s protest, of whom she said 202 personnel were severely injured. “Was it a peaceful protest then?” she questioned.
Before outlining a set of decisions taken by the Punjab government following the protest, she clarified that these measures were not against any “religious party, group or faith”.
“They are against only that extremist group, which has a history of creating a law and order situation in this country. The group that has been involved in inciting people […] and killings.”
Detailing the decisions, she said the Punjab government had forwarded the summary to the federal government for banning the TLP.
It may be mentioned here that the federal government had banned the TLP in April 2021 on the recommendation of the Punjab government under the ATA.
The ban was later revoked in November that year upon the request of the Punjab government, days after a deal was reached with the group to end its violent protest march towards Islamabad.
In a meeting chaired by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab government also decided to seek a ban on the party again and move to place the TLP leadership in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
The Fourth Schedule is a list of proscribed individuals who are suspected of terrorism and/or sectarianism under the 1997 Anti-Terrorism Act.
Mentioning other measures taken yesterday, Bokhari said there would be “zero-tolerance” concerning the use of loudspeakers to “spread hatred or incite others”.
Bokhari further said that cases would be registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) for “uploading hateful content on social media, glorifying the protest and presenting it as a national cause”.
“Some arrests have been made [in this connection],” she said, adding that the “information department will also send a request for action under Peca over a post on [incarcerated PTI founder] Imran Khan’s X account that said 400-600 people had died”.
Again making an apparent reference to the TLP, she said, “All social media and bank accounts of the extremist party will be sealed. A lot of work on this has already been done”.
Moreover, she said, there was a complete ban on the display of weapons and from now on, weapons’ licences would not be issued in Punjab.
“Anyone in possession of illegal weapons is requested to submit them [to the relevant authorities] within a month; otherwise, cases would be registered against them under the terrorism law.
“And those in possession of legal weapons will have to get them registered at Khidmat centres, otherwise legal action will also be taken against them,” she elaborated.
Citing figures of cases of attempts to create anarchy, she said 108 such first information reports had been registered in Punjab in 2025 so far. Of those, she added, 71 were registered under the terrorism law.
“This trend shows that in 2025, a plan was hatched to worsen the situation in Punjab,” she alleged. Apparently referring to the PTI, she said that another party had tried to join today’s protest, the call for which was rejected by the people. “This is a slap for the two extremist groups that called the protest,” she said.
Separately, Pakistan Ulema Council chairman Hafiz Tahir Ashrafi also addressed a press conference where he apparently made a reference to the TLP and its protest last week.
Without naming anyone, he said, “The dialogue was underway till the last moment. The talks were very positive […] but unfortunately, there was no implementation, resulting in the loss of policemen, Rangers personnel, security institutions and the common man.”
He stressed the need to put an end to the trend of violence and thanked all religious scholars who had contributed to attempts of “making peace”.
Punjab IG’s warning
Earlier today, Punjab Inspector General (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar had also warned that no individual or group would be allowed to take the law into their hands.
A post on Punjab police’s account on social media platform X quoted IGP Anwar as saying that his department was actively ensuring the safety of people’s lives and properties, supremacy of law and maintenance of peace across the province.
“Punjab police is standing with civil society and the trader community, who have rejected the call for the protest and strike and expressed their resolve for [maintaining] peace and stability,” the statement quoted the police chief as saying.
It said he “strongly condemned violent protests, arson and illegal activities”, warning that no individual or group would be allowed to take the law into their hands. He also warned that “indiscriminate” action would be taken against those violating the law.
The IGP also assured the full implementation of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure — a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period — to ensure the safety of private and public properties.
The Punjab government had imposed Section 144 across the province yesterday for two days.
 






A subsequent post by the police said security was on high alert across the province on the directive of the IGP.
“Punjab police has further tightened foolproof security arrangements in the province, including Lahore. On the directive of Punjab IGP, instructions have been issued to all field officers to remain on high alert and take immediate measures to ensure the protection of the lives and property of the public,” the statement said.
It added that district police officers, special branch personnel and the counter-terrorism department had been directed “to keep a close eye on suspicious activities”.
 






In another statement posted around noon, police said that the situation was normal in cities across Punjab.
 






In an earlier post specifically mentioning Multan and Bhakkar, a statement quoted IGP Anwar as saying that “under no circumstances will anybody be allowed to take the law into their hands under the guise of protests or strikes”.
 






The IGP had issued similar warnings yesterday as well, saying, “We have decided to treat the violators under anti-terrorism and other heinous charges to take them to the court of law for punishment up to 10 and 14 years.”
Later, a police handout said Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran had reviewed security arrangements in different areas of the city while all divisional superintendents, sub-divisional police officers and station house officers were in the field.
The handout quoted the DIG as saying that security had been increased at all commercial and public spots in the city and that police would not let miscreants “destroy the peace of the city at any cost”.
He said “special security duties” had been assigned to police personnel to ensure peace in the city, while anybody who took the law into their hands would be dealt with strictly.
The handout said he instructed that strict legal action should be taken against those creating a law and order situation under the guise of protests.
On Thursday, four cabinet members also said that the crackdown on TLP office-bearers would continue. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Fed­e­r­­al Information Minister Ataullah Tarar, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf and Min­is­ter of State for Interior Talal Chaud­h­ry described the TLP as a group of anarchists and arsonists that had no political agenda except to challenge the authority of the state.
“The TLP leadership has been deceiving the nation from the very beginning. We were holding talks with them even before the protest march commenced, but they never stood firm on any commitment,“ Naqvi said.
LHC seeks replies from Punjab govt, police
Earlier today, the Lahore High Court (LHC) sought replies from the Punjab government and police on October 23 on pleas filed by the TLP. The pleas seek return of bodies of the TLP’s workers allegedly killed during the law-enforcement operation in Muridke and medical treatment for those injured.
Justice Shehram Sarwar Chaudhry presided over the hearing during which Advocate Naseem Usman represented the TLP.
The petitions, which were accepted for hearing yesterday, contend that the government carried out an operation against the party’s workers who were staging a peaceful march in Muridke. The party claimed that over 600 of its workers had been killed in the operation, while its chief Saad Rizvi and his younger brother also sustained bullet injuries.
It alleged that both Saad and his brother Anas Rizvi, among others, have been abducted by the law-enforcement agencies.
The party further alleges that the authorities refused to hand over the bodies of the victims to their families. It has asked the court to direct the government and police authorities to return the deceased workers’ bodies and ensure that the injured are provided medical treatment at government hospitals.
The pleas also seek directions for the authorities to produce Saad Rizvi and other detained leaders before the relevant court. The TLP further seeks possession of its headquarters on Lahore’s Multan Road, allegedly taken over by the law-enforcement authorities.
