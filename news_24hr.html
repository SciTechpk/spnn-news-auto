Abhishek Sharma was adjudicated player-of-the-match —  scoring 74 runs of 39 balls as he led the Indian effort from the front after getting a reprieve in Shaheen’s second over.
The bitterness between the players, which started with India’s refusal of customary handshakes in the first encounter, continued as Sharma at the post-match ceremony said:  “Today it was very simple, the way they were coming (at) us for no reason, I didn’t like it at all, and this is the only way I could give [an answer] with my bat.”
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking after the match, said, “We are yet to play the perfect game. We batted really well — but I think when it came to the bowling, they took the game away in the powerplay.”
 
 

He said they could have got 15 more runs after being 91 in the first 10 overs, but added that 171 was still a good total.
The Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav appreciated the character shown by his team after being behind in the game after the first innings.

Match report:
The Indian opening batters after early reprieves made a mockery of a decent score by the Pakistani batters as the Men in Blue chased down their highest score against the Green Shirts in men’s T20Is.
In the first innings, the Indian bowlers — barring Shivam Dube — had no answers to the Pakistani onslaught with the bat. The Men in Blue’s fielding was nervy and even worse than their bowling effort, with multiple dropped chances.
Pakistan’s batters smashed both the Indian pacers and the spinners on a dry pitch that got better as the match continued — with India making full use of the easier conditions.

Dube was the only redeeming aspect of the Indian bowling effort, as he got crucial wickets in the middle overs and dried up scoring — Pakistan going 39 balls without boundaries after being in a commanding position of 91-1 after 10 overs.
Nearly all the Pakistani batters had a commendable day with the bat as India were under pressure from ball one with the start Fakhar got. They ultimately got to their highest score batting first against India in men’s T20Is  — on the back of Sahibzada’s 50 and some late-order hitting by Faheem and skipper Salman.
Fakhar’s controversial dismissal was a major talking point, after the southpaw opener was given out by the third umpire caught by the keeper, though visuals showed that there was definitely room for doubt whether the ball carried — which usually goes in the batter’s favour.
But the Green Shirts had continued with their tradition of facing opponents with one hand tied behind their backs. They had picked Hussain Talat in a bid to strengthen their batting — but at the expense of leaving out their big hitters like Hassan Nawaz and Khushdil Shah.
Two out of three Pakistani pacers continued the tradition of Pakistani fastmen troubling Indian batters — with Haris Rauf in particular giving the Men in Blue a run for their money on a placid pitch.

He made a mess of Sanju Samson’s middle-stump and got the Indian skipper out for a duck with his express pace as well — giving away just 26 runs in his four overs.
Pakistan still have one more potential chance of redemption against the Men in Blue — if they build on the positives in this game and play well across both departments to reach the Asia Cup final next Sunday.

That’s a 92m six for Verma, and he follows it up with a flick to the fine-leg boundary.
 






That’s all for today, folks, as India make easy work of this tricky chase.

Faheem comes in to bowl.
Seems a matter of time for India now. Pakistan needed a tight over but Faheem was wayward and was duly dispatched for six on the second ball. 10 runs come off it and India are now nine away from victory.
Over 17 — India - 153/4
16.4: Haris strikes with a jaffa! He delivers an absolute peach of a delivery thats makes a mess of Samson’s stumps!

Pakistan needed a breakthrough, and Haris struck. Samson tried to play across but missed the ball completely and saw his stumps shattered on the fourth ball of the over.
Any hopes of a shift in momentum, however, were quickly snuffed out by Hardik Pandya’s nonchalant flick for four on the first ball he faced. Haris has bowled his quota of four; India need 19 off the last three overs.

Over 16 — India - 143/3
Abrar continues and nearly gets another Indian wicket!
Luck goes India’s way as a miscued shot from Samson lands perfectly between three fielders. Pakistan could’ve done with a wicket there but that’s how the game’s been for them. India need 27 runs from the last four overs to win. Is there a miracle in store for Pakistan?

Over 15 — India - 140/3
Salman turns to Shaheen to be the provider for his side, but Tilak Verma gets his first boundary.
India get eight runs off the over, now 32 runs away from winning — again.

Faheem continues but another wicket proves elusive for Pakistan as the incoming Sanju Samson plays a delightful cover drive for four. India closing in on target with six runs coming off the over.
They need 40 runs off the last six overs. Pakistan need a wicket or two and needed it yesterday!

Over 13 — India - 123-3
Abrar strikes and gets rid of Abhishek! The Indian batter does not bother to look up as he walks off.
Abhishek seemed primed to finish the game single-handedly, but after welcoming Abrar with a six, he went for another and was caught by Haris. India is still on top, but Pakistan have more than a sniff.
Sanju Samson is the next man in for India.

Over 12 — India - 117-2
Faheem comes back in the attack and is immediately lifted down the ground for four by Abhishek. The India opener shows cuts away Faheem for another boundary three balls later. India get 11 off the over and Pakistan need to regain some inspiration.

Over 11 — India - 106-2
Indian skipper Suryakumar is at the crease. He looks tense.
Haris strikes as the Indian captain departs! Suryakumar top-edged that pacey Haris delivery down to third-man, where Abrar held his nerve.
 


The big-hitting Tilak Verma is the next man in for the Men in Blue.
Things get better for Pakistan. A fired-up Haris sends back Suryakumar. The right-armer’s pace proves to be the undoing for the India skipper, who gets a leading edge and is caught by Abrar on the boundary. Haris gives away just one run in the over. Pakistan getting back in the contest.
 



Over 10 — India - 101-1
There is a stoppage in play as Shubman was limping while running.
Faheem wrecks Shubman stumps! Pakistan draw first blood!
Overheard in the newsroom: Is this the start of the Indian collapse?!
Faheem was brought into the attack as Pakistan desperately sought a breakthrough and the right-armer found the perfect line with an inswinger to knock Gill’s off-stump. Suryakumar swings and misses first ball. The question is can Pakistan claw they way back?

A tidy over by Haris — just five off it — but India are cruising to the target.
 



Over 8 — India - 96-0
Saim continues and Gill excels with a reverse hit for four before Abhishek brings up his half-century with a four. Pakistan look bereft of ideas. 11 runs off the over and India closing in on 100 runs.

Over 7 — India - 83-0
Sahibzada returns the favour from the first innings by palming Abhishek over the boundary for six, what could have been a dismissal is another six!
Change of ends for Abrar, but it doesn’t work for Pakistan as Abhishek launches him into the stands on the second ball of the over. Luck also not going Pakistan’s way as Sahibzada helps another big hit from Abhishek over the fence. Runs keep coming for India — and fast. 16 off the over. India firmly in the driving seat.

Over 6 — India - 69-0
The power play has been completely dominated by the Indian batters after an early reprieve.
Saim is brought back into the attack but to no avail as Abhishek hits him down the ground for four and Gill cuts him away for another boundary two deliveries later and finishes it off with another. 14 runs off the over. India firmly on top and Pakistan seem to have no answer.

Over 5 — India - 50-0
The express pace of Haris is something that Indian batters seem to struggle against — let’s see if he can get the breakthrough for Pakistan.
Haris Rauf replaces Shaheen from the other end for the fifth over. Abhishek’s edge on the second ball flies away for four on the second ball and he has an exchange of words with Haris. It’s heated in the middle with both sets of players under pressure to deliver. India seem to be dealing with it better and Gill swats away Haris to finish the over. 12 off the over again.
 



Over 4 — India - 37-0
Mystery spinner Abrar into the attack.
Pakistan continue with spin from the other end as Abrar Ahmed replaces Saim. Abrar kept it tight on the first three balls but Abhishek then cut loose; pulling him for a four and a six. Another 12 runs come off the over. India are off to a fast start and Pakistan need to respond.
 



Over 3 — India - 31-0
2.3: Shaheen nearly had his man! Abhishek is dropped by Nawaz running back. It was a tough chance.
There were some words exchanged after Gill hit the boundary on the final ball of Shaheen’s over.

Could that Abhishek drop be a ‘what if’ moment for Pakistan? Gill powered him down the ground for four off the next ball and then finished the over with a slap for another boundary on the off-side. India get 12 off the over; a breakthrough becomes crucial for Pakistan.
 



Over 2 — India - 19-0
Saim — Pakistan’s highest wicket-taker in the tournament — made a tidy start but was then swept for four by Shubman Gill on the fourth ball, before being cut away for another on the next ball. India get 10 from the over. Pakistan need to make inroads.

Over 1 — India - 9-0
Shaheen bowls to Abhishek Sharma. This is the redemption arc we have been waiting for!
0.1: Shaheen bounces Sharma first ball, but he is up to the task and hits it for six off the very first ball.
Shaheen — the player of the match in Pakistan’s last outing, tightened things up with just three more runs coming in the over.
 



Mid-match analysis by Abyan Amir: The Indian bowlers had no answers to the Pakistani onslaught with the bat. The Men in Blue’s fielding was nervy and even worse with multiple dropped chances!
Pakistan made a mockery of both the Indian pacers and the spinners on a dry pitch that will get better as the match continues — India will be pinning their hopes on dew coming to rescue later in the innings after they had an ordinary day in the field.
Nearly all the Pakistani batters had a terrific day with the bat as India were under pressure from ball one with the start, Fakhar got — getting to their highest score batting first against India in men’s T20Is.
Fakhar’s controversial dismissal was a major talking point after the southpaw opener was given out by the third umpire, and visuals showed that there was definitely room for doubt — which usually goes in the batter’s favour.
This is shaping up to be the redemption bid for the Green Shirts that they needed — and deserved!

Pandya smashes the ball in the ground in frustation as Pakistan continue to pile up the runs!
The last ball of the innings is smacked by Faheem over cover for a tremendous six!
 


Pakistan needed to finish with a flourish, and Faheem’s top edge flew for four on the second ball off the last over by Pandya. The Indian all-rounder then gave away just three runs off the next three balls — one of them a wide — before Faheem ended it with a slash for six. Pakistan will feel they have a defendable total on the board.

Bumrah is back into the attack after being smacked to all corners of the ground in his first spell!

Brain-fade moment for Nawaz as he gets run out in cavalier fashion.
Faheem treats Bumrah with scant regard as he launches that full toss for six over fine leg!
The day continues to get worse for India’s ace pacer.
 






Bumrah was taken apart by Pakistan in his first three overs but found his nagging line in the fourth.
Two searing yorkers were blocked by Nawaz at the start of the penultimate over. Nawaz then gets sloppy with his running to be dismissed. Good thing for Pakistan, though, is that the incoming Faheem wasted no time in getting off the mark and did that with a six off the first ball before being dropped by Gill in the deep.

Go Nawaz Go!
17.1: Nawaz launches Dube for six over wide long-on!
17 of that over!
 


Pakistan finally get a move on with Nawaz, at long last, nailing a big hit. The left-hander started the 18th over by Dube with a six and got two off the next ball. A slash off the third flew for four, and 17 runs came off the over.

16.3: That ball clearly pitched outside leg —but the Indian skipper went up for a review, hoping against hope for some luck!
The boundary drought — lasting 39 — finally ended with Salman smashing Kuldeep for six down the ground.  The spinner burned a review two balls later, trying to get the Pakistan skipper lbw. Salman tried for more big hits, but only succeeded in getting two more runs in the over.
 



Over 16 — Pakistan - 121-4
India keeping things tight. Nawaz fails to get Chakravarthy away, plays four dot balls. Just two runs coming off the over.

Over 15 — Pakistan - 119-4
Sahibzada departs after a valiant effort with the bat!
His dismissal shows that the ball is gripping in the wicket and cutters will be a useful ploy in the second innings.
India’s pressure pays off with Dube accounting for Sahibzada, who was looking to end the boundary drought and only managed to find to India skipper Suryakumar Yadav at mid-off after losing his bat.
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha strides in and needs to give his side a move on. India seems happy giving away the singles as far as there are no boundaries — it’s now 33 balls since the last one.

Kuldeep finally has a wicket as Hussain Talat departs for a scratchy 10 of 11 balls.
The in-form Mohammad Nawaz is the next man in.
Hussain made 10 off 10 before departing when he tried to reverse sweep Yadav. Indian fielders have blown hot and cold during the match. After a lapse allowed Sahibzada to complete two runs, Shubman Gill denied Pakistan a chance to end their boundary drought when he prevented a pull from the incoming Mohammad Nawaz from reaching the fence. Five runs off the over.

Over 13 — Pakistan - 108-2
Dube returns, can he rescue this Indian bowling effort from sinking even further?
India keep Dube on and Pakistan keep the scoreboard ticking with seven runs coming off the over. However, they have not managed a boundary since 21 deliveries now. Both Sahibzada and Hussain will be looking to get a move on now.

Over 11 — Pakistan - 95-2
India finally holds onto one as Saim gets dismissed by Dube.
India brought on Shivam Dube into the attack to quell Pakistan’s onslaught and reaped reward when Saim top-edged to Abhishek, who clung on this time running in from the deep backward square leg. Hussain Talat, making his first appearance in the tournament, got off the mark first ball but then played three dots and didn’t make much of a free hit.
India have a tidy over at last, just five off it.

Pakistan are on the ascendancy and showing it. Sahibzada brought up his 50 with a stunning pull off Axar Patel for six. After the first half of their innings, they’re well and truly on top.
Sahibzada brings up his 50 in style with a gun salute!
Over 9 — Pakistan - 83-1
Saim finally showing a glimpse of his old self and that should make Pakistan happy. He went down the track against Yadav and smashed him over his head for six. Sahibzada did the same and his shot flew over the long -on fence. Pakistan are taking on the Indian bowlers, dispatching the balls on merit, and reaping the rewards. Thirteen runs off the over.

Sahibzada went after Varun and hit the first six of the innings — albeit helped by the long-on fielder. Pakistan continue with their momentum, 10 runs coming off the over.
Over 7 — Pakistan - 61-1
Kuldeep Yadav has for long been Pakistan’s tormentor and so Saim and Sahibzada are naturally wary against playing any loose shots. Five runs of his first over as Pakistan continue their solid start, thankfully.
Over 6 — Pakistan - 55-1
5.2: Sahibzada smacks that short of a length ball by Bumrah with utter disdain for four!
Pakistan are making a statement with this dominating start.
Fakhar’s controversial dismissal continues to be a talking point.
5.5: 50 up for Pakistan as yet another full toss from Bumrah. Driven past him, mid-off runs back and the batters hare back for three. Fifty up for Pakistan!
Bumrah hasn’t had the desired impact for India in his first two overs and has changed ends. It didn’t change anything for him as Sahibzada smashed him to the mid-on boundary for four and then smashed him to the mid-off fence off the last ball. Pakistan are off to a flyer in the powerplay. Thirteen runs off the over and — by the looks of it —  headed to a big score.

Over 5 — Pakistan - 36-1
India bring in spin to stem Pakistan’s run flow, Varun Chakravarthy is into the attack in just the 5th over of the innings.
4.3: The Men in Blue are having a terrible day in the field as Kuldeep drops a sitter and gives Saim another life!
Celebrations in the newsroom as Saim gets an undeserved reprieve. That’s a relief!
India turned to spin after Pakistan made hay against the pacers. Varun Chakravarthy gave just one run off the first three balls he bowled and Saim took him on, an attempted sweep getting a top edge which was spilled by Yadav at fine leg. Pakistan rode their luck and another edge, this time off Saibzada’s bat, flew to the third man fence.

Over 4 — Pakistan - 30-1
Bumrah returns after being hit for 11 by Fakhar in the first over.
3.1: Sahibzada gets his first boundary, pulling Bumrah away with utter disdain.

TV replays show Fakhar seemingly upset about the TV umpire’s call. To be fair, it wasn’t clear where the ball bounced, but the TV umpire seemed to believe it bounced on the glove.
3.4: Bumrah gets smashed for four by Sahibzada, pressure on the Indian pacer as it’s a no-ball above waist height.
Sahibzada gets on the act, pulling Bumrah away for four to start the over and then slapped a full toss — adjudged to be above waist height— to the mid-wicket fence. Current run rate is a neat 9.00. Pakistan have a start and now needs to capitalise on it.

Over 3 — Pakistan - 26-1
2.2: Fakhar hits Pandya for four now!
 


2.3: Fakhar is out after nicking off Pandya, but that seemed like it bounced in front of the keeper’s gloves, a controversial call by the umpire. India draw first blood.
2.5: Saim finally ends his own personal boycott of the Asia Cup with a sublime boundary off Pandya.
Fakhar started the over by slashing Pandya to the point boundary, but India were soon up in celebration as the left-hander was caught on the next ball. The ball seemed to have died on its way to Samson’s gloves but the TV umpire — controversially — adjudged that it bounced off the keeper’s glove and into his hand. Saim Ayub belatedly got his first runs of the tournament, pulling Pandya away on the second ball he faced.

Over 2 — Pakistan - 17-0
1.1: Fakhar dances down the wicket to greet Bumrah and got two.
1.3: Fakhar flicks Bumrah for four, who’s under pressure from the get-go! First boundary for Pakistan.
1.4: Fakhar smashes Bumrah down the ground after dancing down the wicket. Fakhar is off to a flyer!
Fakhar shows his intentions from the start. A slow outfield prevented him from starting off with a four, but he found a boundary with a flick on the legside on the third ball and then danced down the track and dispatched Jasprit Bumrah to the long-off fence on the next ball. Solid start from Pakistan

Over 1 — Pakistan - 6-0
Pakistan shuffle batting order, with Fakhar Zaman opening instead of Saim Ayub.
The newsroom wanted Shaheen Afridi to open, so they are a bit disappointed.
0.3: The Men in Blue have given Pakistan their first chance as Abhishek Sharma drops Sahibzada at deep third-man.
0.4: Shouts of shot as Sahibzada launches Pandya down the ground, but it doesn’t go far! 2 runs taken.
Pakistan 6/0 Sahibzada gets lucky as he’s dropped by Abhishek Sharma on the third ball of the match. The Pakistan opener looked to go after Hardik Pandya, hitting him down the ground the next ball. Pakistan will be relieved they’ve ended the first over with no losses and six runs on the board.

Anthems
The Pakistani anthem is played first as the anthems are played without any incident, unlike last Sunday’s encounter.

Build-up to the high intensity clash
The Green Shirts have a chance at redemption as they face India again today in Dubai for the Super Four stage of the Men’s Asia Cup after their last game was marred by a controversy spiralling from the neighbouring team’s refusal to shake hands with their opponents.
The Group A clash between the fierce rivals last Sunday — their first meeting since the four-day military conflict between them in May — ended on a bitter note when the Men in Blue refused to shake hands with the Green Shirts after winning the game. There were no handshakes between the captains at the toss either.
According to Reuters, Indian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for today’s clash, which is scheduled for 7:30pm PKT at the Dubai International Stadium.
Match referee Andy Pycroft, whose removal was sought by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) over the controversy but was denied by the International Cricket Council (ICC), is still scheduled to officiate today.
 
 

Asked about the handshake issue and Pycroft’s presence yesterday, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav changed the subject, saying, “It will be a good contest between the ball and the bat”.
He added: “Close your room, switch off your phone and sleep. I think that’s the best thing to shut the noise. It’s easy to say, but sometimes it is difficult.”
India won all three of their group games, narrowly edging out a brave Oman by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi on Friday, as well as beating Pakistan by seven and the UAE by nine wickets respectively.
Suryakumar, who had seemingly politicised last Sunday’s victory by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, said: “I have been very clear with all the boys. I think it’s very important if you want to do well in this tournament and going forward.
“We will have to shut a lot of noise from outside and take what is good for you.”
Despite India’s triumph in their previous encounter, Suryakumar insisted past results would count for nothing when the rivals meet again in today’s Super Four match.
“I feel our preparation has been really good leading into the tournament. We have also had three good games, so we are actually focusing on what we can do best,” he added.
 
 

“We want to follow all the good habits that we have been doing from the last two or three games. We take it one game at a time. It doesn’t give us an edge that we have played them once, and we had a good game. We have to start from scratch.”
Pakistan had cancelled their pre-match press conference yesterday, making it the second consecutive time that they did so following the handshake incident.
Last night, PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi met with the Green Shirts in Dubai as they participated in warm-up exercises for today’s match.
 






Handshake ruckus
Earlier this week, the situation escalated to the point that the PCB was even mulling its participation in the Asia Cup after the ICC rejected its complaint seeking the removal of Pycroft, who PCB said told captain Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with his Indian counterpart before the match.
 
 

However, the situation was finally settled when, just before Pakistan’s match against the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday, the PCB said Pycroft “apologised” to the Green Shirts’ manager and captain over the ruckus resulting from “miscommunication”.
Nevertheless, the tournament still had lingering disputes; the ICC reportedly took exception to the PCB recording Pycroft’s “apology” meeting with Pakistan team officials. The event had been marred by controversy before it even began, with calls for a boycott of the game from across the border.</p><small>2025-09-21 23:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/220154372c69548.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943715/asia-cup-five-key-takeaways-from-pakistans-rematch-against-india' target='_blank'><strong>Asia Cup: Five key takeaways from Pakistan’s rematch against India</strong></a><br><p>Most of us Pakistan fans may not admit it, but we hope. We hope against hope when our team takes on India. Before the first ball is bowled, we tend to somehow forgo a few harsh realities and the reality that underlines all of them; India are way better.
“Farq hai yaar (there’s a difference),” as my colleague put it right after Tilak Varma clattered Shaheen Afridi past deep square-leg for a four to wrap things up. “It’s a gulf in fact, a huge gulf of quality,” he concluded.
His short analysis summed up Sunday’s Super Four fixture, which India comfortably won by six wickets with seven balls to spare. Pakistan genuinely came back stronger, impressing with the bat early on, but the “gulf” glared the brightest when Indian openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill were at the crease.
Indispensable Abhishek, Gill
With their opening partnership of 105 off 59, Gill and Abhishek — the two friends from the Indian Punjab — set the match aside for India, neutralising Faheem Ashraf and Haris Rauf’s decent show with the ball that came later on.

The openers’ ability to play the field made Pakistan’s bowlers look ordinary in the first half of India’s chase as they once again put on display their wide range of shots.
 
 

When Pakistan bowled even slightly short, Abhishek and Gill jumped back into their respective creases and bashed away through the leg-side and square through the off-side.
When the Pakistan bowlers pushed it fuller, the duo would use their powerful wrists to clear the boundary.
It wasn’t all about power for Gill and Abhishek; they had enough presence of mind to find gaps with pure timing and placement. Applying that kind of world-class skill, they combined to hit 14 fours and five sixes — all of the maximums hit by Abhishek.
Spinners fold under pressure
While the pitch didn’t offer much to the fast bowlers with the new ball, it had enough for the spinners in it, and taking nothing away from Gill and Abhishek, Pakistan spinners Saim Ayub and Abrar Ahmed were poor.
They were clueless against the Indian openers, failing to find the right lines and lengths on a consistent basis, bowling too short or too full and lacking in pace variation good enough to pose any threat to the batters.
Abrar.  who came into the match with an economy rate of less than four in the Asia Cup, gave away 10.50 an over on Sunday – a total of 42 runs in his four overs. Saim — more of a part-timer — on the other hand, had the opportunity to add to his better show with the bat earlier, but leaked a mammoth 35 in these three overs.
By the time Abrar and Saim were pulled out of the attack, India had completed more than half of the job.
Middle-order blunders
Despite getting more than a decent start as Pakistan cruised at 91-1 — thanks to Sahibzada Farhan’s fifty and impressive contributions by Fakhar Zaman and Saim — Pakistan struggled massively to continue the momentum from early on. Why though?
A middle-order incapable of attacking stroke play. The national side before this match had gone with Hasan Nawaz as their only middle-order pinch hitter — yes, his form, like all his colleagues, wasn’t the best — but replacing him with Hussain Talat, a totally different breed of a batter — was a highly questionable move from the Pakistan team management.
 






The left-hander returned a paltry 10 off 11, and the decision to send Mohammad Nawaz and himself over the likes of Mohammad Haris and Faheem — who have much more of the ability to go big — was criminal by Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha in a period when Indian medium-pacer Shivam Dube flourished.
Nawaz, who seemed completely at sea in front of the Indian spinners, was stuck in his crease, absolutely failing to use his feet, and added 21 off 19.
Salman, meanwhile, avoiding strike in the last over, proving critics right over his place in the Pakistan T20 side, scored 17 off 13.
Confident top-three
Pakistan’s start was refreshing. The side’s openers came into the match with a bad-boy attitude, a kind of naughtiness in their demeanour and smartness to back it up with.
Sahibzada and Fakhar were getting under the skins of Indian stalwarts Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya — at times exchanging words with them on the pitch.

After being dropped by Abhishek at third-man off Pandya, Sahibzada responded with bravery, seeing off Bumrah’s pinpoint Yorkers with equal amounts of precision and forcing the bowler to miss out on the right lengths as the right-hander from Peshawar posted a 38-ball 50.
His hits were clean and oozed with confidence as Fakhar also manipulated the Indian bowlers’ minds on the other end. Had it not been for a clearly wrong decision that went against his way, the seasoned southpaw may have made it slightly more difficult for India to continue their dominance over Pakistan.
Saim, who had started the Asia Cup with three ducks, meanwhile, improved from his past performances to hit 21 off 17 — that straight hit for six off Kuldeep Yadav — underlining his potential. But the left-hander’s contribution came only after he was dropped by Kuldeep when he had only single figures against his name.
Haris, Faheem impress with the ball

Apart from the openers, only Haris Rauf and Faheem Ashraf came up with a fight. Haris, in fact, was continually in the face of the Indian batters despite his team being on the back foot in the context of the match. He backed his aggression up with fiery pace bowling as well, destroying the stumps of Sanju Samson and getting the Indian skipper out for his two wickets and gave away a mere 26 runs in his four overs.
Faheem, meanwhile, gave away 31, but still caused problems for the Indian batters — although that came about too late for Pakistan — especially producing a peach of a delivery to clean up Gill through the gate.
More of that, and at the right time, is required if Pakistan are to make it to the finals. And against Sri Lanka on Tuesday, Salman and co have to prove that they are at least capable of beating decent sides in the world if not the best like that of India.

State television said Sharaa was en route “to the United States of America to participate in the affairs of the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York”, citing a presidency statement.
 
 

Sharaa seized power in December after his rebel group led a lightning offensive that toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad after nearly 14 years of civil war and more than half a century of brutal family rule. He is set to speak at the UN General Assembly in New York, the first Syrian leader to do so since Nureddin al-Atassi in 1967.
Sharaa has undergone a dramatic transformation since taking power, meeting foreign leaders such as US President Donald Trump in Riyadh and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on his first trip to the West.
In a pre-recorded interview broadcast on Sunday, Sharaa told US broadcaster CBS that “President Trump took a big step towards Syria by lifting the sanctions with a quick, courageous and historic decision”.
“He recognised that Syria should be safe, stable and unified.” Trump lifted most US sanctions on Syria, which date back to the Syrian war and earlier, in the spring.
Sharaa added that anyone seeking to maintain sanctions on Syria would be “would be complicit in killing the Syrian people once again”.
 


He moreover criticised the international community for failing to halt the brutalities committed by Assad’s government.
He said, “We should be the ones asking others: why did you stand silent as these terrible crimes were taking place in Syria?”
Syria-Israel talks
The Syrian leader remains under UN sanctions and a travel ban due to his past and must request exemptions for all foreign trips. His foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani, is already in Washington for an official visit.
Shaibani’s office said he held a series of meetings since his arrival, including with US senators and state department officials.
He also met with the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, as the international community presses Syria’s new authorities to protect minorities in the multi-confessional country, which has seen sectarian bloodshed in recent months.
A foreign ministry official had said Shaibani aimed to discuss ongoing negotiations with Israel and the lifting of the remaining US sanctions on Syria.
Syria and Israel remain technically at war, but opened direct negotiations after Assad’s overthrow, and Syrian and Israeli officials have met on several occasions.
The foreign ministry official had said Syria expected to finalise security and military agreements with Israel this year, in what would be a breakthrough.
Israel has demanded a demilitarised zone in southern Syria.
Last week, Sharaa said Syria was negotiating with Israel to reach a security agreement that would see Israel leave the areas it had occupied in recent months.
Syria to select new parliament on October 5
Meanwhile, Syria is set to hold the selection process for a transitional parliament on October 5, in accordance with a constitutional declaration announced earlier this year, the electoral commission said today.
The People’s Assembly of Syria was dissolved by Sharaa and the upcoming legislature, which will serve for a five-year transitional period, will comprise 210 lawmakers.
Of these, 140 will be designated by local committees supervised by the electoral commission and 70 will be directly nominated by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.
The process will be held on October 5, “in the electoral districts of Syria’s provinces”, the commission wrote on its Telegram channel. It did not specify if all provinces would take part.
In late August, the government announced that the selection would be delayed in the Druze-majority province of Sweida — the site of deadly clashes in July — and in the Kurdish-held regions of Raqa and Hasakeh, due to the security and political situation.
The system for appointing the interim parliament has been a target of major criticism by the opposition and civil society groups, which have denounced the concentration of powers in the president’s hands and insufficient representation of the country’s ethnic and religious minorities.
According to the constitutional declaration adopted in March, the transitional parliament will have a renewable mandate of 30 months. It will exercise its role until a permanent constitution is adopted and new elections are held.</p><small>2025-09-21 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624870-ziarat-assistant-commissioner-son-killed-a-month-after-abduction' target='_blank'><strong>Ziarat assistant commissioner, son 'killed a month after abduction'</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement from his office, CM Bugti said that the killing could not be condemned enough and hailed Baqi as a “dutiful, hardworking and capable officer who discharged his responsibilities with honesty and integrity”.
“The martyred Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Afzal sacrificed his life while fulfilling his responsibilities and will live on in the hearts of the people,” the statement read.
While paying tribute to the martyred AC and his son, he said that their deaths would not be in vain.
“[The CM] made it clear that the killers of innocent people and enemies of peace will never be able to escape their fate,” the statement read. “The sacrifices of the martyrs are a beacon [of] light in the journey of establishing peace and stability in Balochistan.”
The AC and his son were kidnapped in August by armed suspects while on a picnic in the Zezri area, Ziarat Deputy Commissioner Zakaullah Durrani said.
According to Durrani, Baqi and his son were taken to an unknown location after the suspects stopped the vehicle at gunpoint and ordered everyone to abandon it before setting it on fire. They released Afzal’s gunman, driver and other family members but forced the official and his son to go with them.
The DC said on August 13 that a search operation by security forces was active in the area for to recover AC Baqi and his son and that elders from different tribes were also contacted to use their influence to get the officer released.
According to Durrani, no organisation or group claimed responsibility. The local administration had announced a Rs50 million reward for providing information about the whereabouts of the kidnappers.</p><small>2025-09-21 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/212051007d8361f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943699/trump-vows-to-defend-poland-baltic-states-if-russia-escalates' target='_blank'><strong>Trump vows to defend Poland, Baltic states if Russia escalates</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Sunday said he would defend Poland and the Baltic states in case of an escalation from Russia, following Moscow’s incursion into Estonia’s airspace.
Asked whether he would help defend the EU members if Russia intensifies hostilities, Trump told reporters: “Yeah, I would. I would.” Estonia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday following Friday’s incursion.
Three Russian MiG-31 fighters violated Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland, triggering complaints of a dangerous new provocation from the European Union and Nato, but a denial from Moscow.
Italian F-35 fighters attached to Nato’s air defence support mission in the Baltic states, along with Swedish and Finnish aircraft, were scrambled to intercept the Russian jets and warn them off.
Asked whether he had been briefed on the situation in Estonia, Trump answered in the affirmative and added: “We don’t like it.” His statement came about two weeks after some 17 Russian drones violated Polish airspace, in an incident that Trump then sought to downplay.
“It could have been a mistake,” Trump told journalists on September 11.</p><small>2025-09-21 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/21192114d0a2b4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943686/uk-australia-and-canada-formally-recognise-palestinian-state' target='_blank'><strong>UK, Australia and Canada formally recognise Palestinian state</strong></a><br><p>Britain, Australia and Canada on Sunday recognised a Palestinian state in a seismic shift in decades of Western foreign policy, triggering swift Israeli anger.
Portugal was also to recognise Palestinian statehood later on Sunday, as Israel came under huge international pressure over the conflict in Gaza triggered almost two years ago by the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.
“Today, to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two-state solution, the United Kingdom formally recognises the State of Palestine,” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a message on X.
 






Britain and Canada became the first G7 countries to take the step, with France and other nations expected to follow at the annual UN General Assembly, which opens Monday in New York.
“Canada recognises the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the State of Palestine and the State of Israel,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote on X.
 






Meanwhile, Australia announced it “formally recognises the independent and sovereign State of Palestine”, according to a post on X by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
“In doing so, Australia recognises the legitimate and long-held aspirations of the people of Palestine to a state of their own,” Albanese said in a statement as his country joined other major Western nations in increasing pressure on Israel to end the conflict in Gaza.
“Today’s act of recognition reflects Australia’s longstanding commitment to a two-state solution, which has always been the only path to enduring peace and security for the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples.”
 






It is a watershed moment for Palestinians and their decades-long ambitions for statehood, with the most powerful Western nations having long argued it should only come as part of a negotiated peace deal with Israel.
 
 

Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said that Britain, Canada and Australia’s recognition of a Palestinian state was a necessary step toward lasting peace in the region.
Welcoming the move by the three countries, Abbas said, “It constitutes an important and necessary step toward achieving a just and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy,” according to a statement by his office.
Abbas also called for a ceasefire in Gaza.
“He emphasised that today’s priorities are achieving a ceasefire, allowing humanitarian aid to enter, securing the release of all hostages and prisoners, ensuring Israel’s complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, enabling the State of Palestine to assume full responsibilities, advancing recovery and reconstruction and halting settlement activity and settler violence, “the statement added.
A senior Hamas official hailed the three nations’ recognition of a Palestinian state, describing it as a victory for the rights of Palestinians.
“These developments represent a victory for Palestinian rights and the justice of our cause, and send a clear message: no matter how far the occupation goes in its crimes, it will never be able to erase our national rights,” Mahmud Mardawi told AFP.
But the move puts those countries at odds with the United States and Israel, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacting angrily and vowing to oppose it at the UN talks.
Calls for a Palestinian state “would endanger our existence and serve as [an] absurd reward for terrorism,” Netanyahu said on Sunday.
A growing number of longtime allies have shifted positions, as Israel has intensified its Gaza offensive, vowing to eliminate Hamas.
The Gaza Strip has suffered vast destruction, a spiralling death toll and a lack of food that has sparked a major humanitarian crisis since the start of the conflict, which has drawn an international outcry.
‘Special burden’
The UK government has come under increasing public pressure to act, with thousands rallying every month on the streets. A poll released by YouGov on Friday showed two-thirds of young Britons aged 18-25 supported Palestinian statehood.
Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy acknowledged at the UN in July that “Britain bears a special burden of responsibility to support the two-state solution”.
Over a century ago, the UK was pivotal in laying the groundwork for the creation of the state of Israel through the 1917 Balfour Declaration.
Three-quarters of UN members already recognise Palestinian statehood, with over 140 of the 193 having taken the step.
Starmer said in July that his Labour government intended to recognise a Palestinian State unless Israel took “substantive” steps, including reaching a ceasefire in Gaza, getting more aid into the territory and confirming it would not annex the West Bank.
 
 

Starmer has also repeatedly called on Hamas to release the remaining hostages they captured in the 2023 attack, and is expected to set out new sanctions on the Palestinian group.
Lammy told the BBC on Sunday that the Palestinian Authority — the civilian body that governs in areas of the West Bank — had been calling for the move for some time, “and I think a lot of that is wrapped up in hope”.
“Will this feed children? No, it won’t, that’s down to humanitarian aid. Will this free hostages? That must be down to a ceasefire.” But he said it was an attempt to “hold out for” a two-state solution.
Palestinian foreign minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin told AFP last week: “Recognition is not symbolic. It sends a very clear message to the Israelis on their illusions on continuing their occupation forever,” she said.
‘Worrying evolution’
Hamas’s 2023 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed at least 65,208 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.
Portugal said that it would also formally declare its recognition in New York on Sunday.
“By acting now, as the Portuguese government has decided, we’re keeping alive the possibility of having two states,” Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said.</p><small>2025-09-21 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/21114533f788db8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943645/pm-shehbaz-to-attend-meeting-of-select-muslim-leaders-with-us-president-trump-in-new-york-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to attend meeting of ‘select’ Muslim leaders with US President Trump in New York: FO</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will be among the attendees of a meeting of “select” Muslim leaders with US President Donald Trump in the coming week on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session in New York, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Sunday.
“The prime minister will also participate in a meeting of select Islamic leaders with US President Trump to exchange views on issues pertaining to regional and international peace and security,” a statement issued by the FO said.
 






The meeting of Muslim leaders with Trump could be the first instance of PM Shehbaz directly interacting with the US president since the latter assumed the top office in his country in January. Earlier, he met Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal General Syed Asim Munir in June, marking the first time a US president has hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House unaccompanied by senior civilian officials.
On his visit to New York, the PM would be leading Pakistan’s delegation to the “high-level segment” of the UNGA from 22 September 2025, the FO said, adding that he would be accompanied by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other ministers and senior officials.
At the UNGA session, PM Shehbaz “will urge the international community to resolve the situations of prolonged occupation and denial of the right to self-determination,” particularly in India-occupied Kashmir and Palestine.
“He will draw attention of the international community towards the grave crisis in Gaza and call for decisive action to end the suffering of the Palestinian people,” the FO stated.
“He will also highlight Pakistan’s perspective on the regional security situation, as well as other issues of international concern, including climate change, terrorism, Islamophobia, and sustainable development.”
The FO, in its statement, said PM Shehbaz would attend several “high-level events” on the sidelines of the UNGA session, including important meetings of the UN Security Council, a high-level Meeting of the Global Development Initiative (GDI), and a special high-level event on Climate Action, among others.
Further, during his visit, he will meet several world leaders and senior UN officials to exchange views on issues of mutual interest.
“He will also underline Pakistan’s resolve to work with all UN member states to uphold the UN Charter, prevent conflict, foster peace and promote global prosperity in Pakistan’s current role as a member of the Security Council,” the FO added.
FO highlighted that the PM’s participation in “this biggest annual gathering of global leaders” would showcase Pakistan’s “strong commitment to multilateralism and the United Nations”. It would also reaffirm “Pakistan’s longstanding contribution towards the shared objectives of peace and development,” it said.
Trump’s upcoming meeting with Muslim leaders, including PM Shehbaz, follows significant developments in the Middle East.
Earlier this month, Israel, a US ally, targeted top Hamas officials in Doha, Qatar, killing five of the group’s members and a Qatari security officer.
The attack drew widespread international condemnation, including from Gulf monarchies allied with the United States, which is also an ally of Qatar.
Subsequently, Arab and Muslim leaders called for a review of ties with Israel at an emergency Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation joint session held in the Qatari capital. The event was co-sponsored by Pakistan. A joint statement from the summit also urged “all states to take all possible legal and effective measures to prevent Israel from continuing its actions against the Palestinian people”.
For his part, Trump — who had a dinner with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in New York following the Israeli attack in Qatar — made careful remarks before the Arab gathering as Washington’s two powerful Middle Eastern allies faced a worsening rift.
The US president had initially rebuked Israel over the attack, saying he was “very unhappy” about it. However, later US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was “not going to change the nature of our relationship with the Israelis”.
Some analysts are of the view that Israeli aggression against Qatar has cast a shadow on US credibility in the Middle East as Arab nations look elsewhere for protection from Israel.
This week, PM Shehbaz and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.</p><small>2025-09-21 14:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/21164031f37648f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943671/three-afghans-among-seven-terrorists-killed-in-di-khan-operation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Three ‘Afghans’ among seven terrorists killed in DI Khan operation: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Seven terrorists were killed, including three “Afghan nationals”, by security forces during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the operation was carried out in the Kulachi area upon the presence of “khawarij”.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and [as a result], seven Indian sponsored khwarij, including three Afghan National khwarij and two suicide bombers, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.
The statement added that Pakistan expects the interim Afghan government, run by the Afghan Taliban, to uphold its responsibilities and deny the use of its soil to carry out acts of terror.
Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have soured over the use of the latter’s territory to stage attacks. Earlier this week, Pakistan warned the UN Security Council that terrorist groups operating from sanctuaries inside Afghanistan pose the gravest threat to its national security. Kabul denies the allegations.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
 






Earlier this week, security forces killed 31 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, the military’s media wing said on Monday.
“On 13-14 September, 31 khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in [the] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the ISPR said in a press release.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.</p><small>2025-09-21 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/211744439207e34.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943679/afghan-govt-spokesperson-says-leaders-shouldnt-make-provocative-statements-stresses-need-for-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan govt spokesperson says leaders shouldn’t make ‘provocative’ statements, stresses need for talks</strong></a><br><p>The spokesperson for the Taliban government in Afghanistan Zabiullah Mujahid has said that leaders should refrain from making “provocative” statements and that his country could not be held responsible for attacks taking place in Pakistan.
Mujahid’s remarks come as Pakistan continues to raise alarm over terrorist outfits, particularly the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), using Afghan soil to carry out attacks across the border. Islamabad has repeatedly urged Kabul to choose between maintaining ties with its neighbour or harbouring terrorists, but Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations.
He made these remarks during an interview with Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies. According to Gul, the interview — conducted in the Pushto language — was recorded during his recent visit to Afghanistan’s Kandahar province.
 


During the interview, Gul sought proposals from Mujahid to address recurring problems, such as the issue of TTP or “the negative propaganda in the media that harms and poisons the relations” between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The spokesperson was also asked whether he felt the need for some sort of “joint mechanism” on such matters.
In his response, Mujahid emphasised that leaders should avoid making “provocative” statements. If statements having “threatening” undertones were issued, “we cannot stop” others, he asserted. The Taliban government spokesperson went on to say that “giving statements to the media, spoiling the environment and taking military action is unwise”.
Instead, he stressed that talks should be held. “There should be more visits, which would create trust on both sides,” Mujahid added.
He said his government was “unhappy with the current environment and propaganda that was happening presently” as it was not in the interest of either Pakistan or Afghanistan.
Mujahid also highlighted that attacks by militants and terrorists in Pakistan were not a recent occurrence. “It has been happening since 2003.”
“Then Pakistan should take steps to foil such attacks”, he said. “Islamabad should also share information with Kabul so that we can make efforts to counter these threats as well.”
But, at the same time, Mujahid added that Afghanistan could not be held responsible for bomb blasts in Bannu or any other area of Pakistan.
“Pakistan should ensure its own security,” he asserted, further recommending that Islamabad and Kabul should engage in talks to discuss the reasons behind the issue of terrorism.
“You should take us into confidence if you believe that you face threats from [an entity] in Afghanistan.”
Mujahid’s remarks follow a recent statement by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in which he issued a stern message to Kabul, saying that Afghanistan must decide whether it stands with Pakistan or the TTP. The premier’s statement had come after he attended the funeral of 12 soldiers in Bannu, who were martyred during an exchange of fire with terrorists in  South Waziristan.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks.
Gul also raised this issue during his conversation with Mujahid with respect to the strained ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“Pakistan seems to have drawn a red line as far as the TTP’s presence in Afghanistan is concerned,” Gul said, adding that this was seen as the main reason for growing tensions between the two countries. Gul asked Mujahid whether he agreed with this.
Mujahid, however, clearly stated that the TTP was Pakistan’s “internal issue”.
“Pakistan should find a solution to this problem,” he said, adding that Islamabad should not spoil its ties with Kabul over this matter.
He also assured that Afghanistan was making efforts to make sure that “no one uses its soil against any other country”.
“No armed person can go to Pakistan from Afghanistan […] The terrain in some areas is difficult, and some people may be able to take advantage of it.
“We should find a solution to this problem through negotiations and Afghanistan should not be blamed for it […] We do not want fighting, bloodshed and difficulties in Pakistan.”
Earlier in the interview, when asked what messages he and the Islamic Emirate had for those in Pakistan, he said he wanted to convey to leaders and officials that “Afghanistan wanted brotherly ties and that any issues between the two countries should be resolved through negotiations”.
“Levelling allegations and making threats spoil the environment, which further complicates matters,” he said.  The spokesperson also called for reforms in policy and urged religious scholars in Pakistan to play a role in maintaining good ties between the two countries.
Lastly, he said, he had a message for the people of Pakistan.
“My final message is for the people of Pakistan. Afghans do not want lawlessness in Pakistan. Afghanistan does not want difficulties in Pakistan […] Afghanistan wants normalisation of ties with Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-09-21 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/211828193bd2896.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943681/modi-urges-indians-to-get-rid-of-foreign-products-amid-strained-us-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Modi urges Indians to get rid of foreign products amid strained US ties</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a public address on Sunday, asked citizens to stop using foreign-made products and instead use local ones, pushing for a self-reliant campaign when trade ties with the United States have soured.
After US President Donald Trump imposed a 50 per cent tariff on imported Indian goods, Modi has been urging the use of “Swadeshi”, or made-in-India goods. His supporters have started campaigns to boycott American brands, including McDonald’s, Pepsi and Apple, which are hugely popular in India.
“A lot of products we use daily are foreign-made, we just don’t know … we will have to get rid of them,” Modi said in an address to the nation ahead of Monday’s implementation of widespread consumer tax cuts.
“We should buy products that are made in India,” he added, without naming any country.
 
 

India’s population of 1.4 billion is a major market for American consumer goods, often purchased from US online retailer Amazon. Over the years, the reach of US brands has expanded deep into smaller towns.
Modi also asked shopkeepers to focus on retailing made-in-India products, arguing that this will boost the country’s economic growth.
In recent weeks, many companies have increased the promotion of local goods.
India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal is expected to visit Washington soon for trade talks, a trip that would take place amid efforts to ease strained bilateral ties.</p><small>2025-09-21 13:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/21150010b1e2869.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943642/us-deal-on-bagram-base-not-possible-says-afghan-taliban-official' target='_blank'><strong>US deal on Bagram base ‘not possible’, says Afghan Taliban official</strong></a><br><p>An Afghan Taliban government official said on Sunday that a deal over Bagram air base was “not possible”, after US President Donald Trump said he wanted the former US base back.
Trump threatened the country on Saturday with unspecified punishment, just days after he raised the idea of the United States retaking control of the base while on a state visit to the United Kingdom.
“If Afghanistan doesn’t give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!” the 79-year-old leader wrote on his Truth Social platform.
Trump, who has previously said he wants the United States to acquire territories and sites ranging from the Panama Canal to Greenland, has appeared focused on Bagram for years.
Asked on Saturday whether he would send in US troops to retake the base, Trump declined to give a direct answer, saying: “We won’t talk about that.”
“We’re talking now to Afghanistan and we want it back and we want it back soon, right away. And if they don’t do it — if they don’t do it, you’re going to find out what I’m gonna do,” he told reporters at the White House.
On Sunday, Fasihuddin Fitrat, chief of staff of the Ministry of Defence, said “some people” want to take back the base through a “political deal”.
“Recently, some people have said that they have entered negotiations with Afghanistan for taking back Bagram air base,” he said in comments broadcast by local media.
“A deal over even an inch of Afghanistan’s soil is not possible. We don’t need it.”
Separately, the Afghan Taliban also issued an statement, saying: “In accordance with Islamic principles and grounded in its balanced, economy-oriented foreign policy, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan seeks constructive relations with all states on the basis of mutual and shared interests.”
The statement said it had been “consistently communicated to the United States in all bilateral negotiations that, for the Islamic Emirate, Afghanistan’s independence and territorial integrity are of the utmost importance”.
It added: “ It should be recalled that, under the Doha Agreement, the United States pledged that ‘it will not use or threaten force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan, nor interfere in its internal affairs.’ Therefore, it is necessary that they remain faithful to their commitments.
“Accordingly, it is once again underscored that, rather than repeating past failed approaches, a policy of realism and rationality should be adopted.
Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.”
 






‘Re-occupying Bagram might end up looking like re-invasion’
Bagram, the largest air base in Afghanistan, was a linchpin of the US-led war effort against the Taliban, whose government Washington toppled following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.
US and Nato troops chaotically pulled out of Bagram in July 2021 as part of a Trump-brokered deal with the Taliban.
The loss of crucial air power saw the Afghan military collapse just weeks later and the Taliban sweep back to power.
Current and former US officials privately caution that re-occupying Bagram air base in Afghanistan might end up looking like a re-invasion of the country, requiring more than 10,000 troops as well as deployment of advanced air defences.
Experts say the sprawling air base would be difficult to secure initially and would require massive manpower to operate and protect.
Even if the Taliban accepted the US re-occupation of Bagram following negotiations, it would need to be defended from a host of threats including the terrorist Islamic State and Al Qaeda militants inside Afghanistan.
It could also be vulnerable to an advanced missile threat from Iran, which attacked a major US air base in Qatar in June after the United States struck Iranian nuclear sites.</p><small>2025-09-21 12:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624802-police-probe-killing-of-three-transgender-persons-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Police probe killing of three transgender persons in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

Friday’s changes to the prized H-1B visas, which included a new $100,000 fee, rattled the tech industry and left US companies scrambling to figure out the implications.
Hasty clarifications from the White House that the new charge would be a one-off payment rather than the annual fee announced by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday only added to the uncertainty.
The fee change rattled students like Kashyap, who hoped to get into an American university and from there into the US jobs market.
Kashyap, a 21-year-old from the southern Indian tech hub of Bengaluru, had pictured himself going to a top-tier American university, with Stanford his goal.
“Back when the fee was lower, it was still something that you could pin hopes on; it would be easier to convert the student visa to an H-1B,” Kashyap told AFP.
“I am very disappointed… my main dream is derailed as things stand now,” he said.
H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills — such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers — to work in the United States, initially for three years but extendable to six.
The United States awards 85,000 H-1B visas per year on a lottery system, with India accounting for around three-quarters of the recipients.
Lutnick detailed the new measure as he stood beside Donald Trump in the Oval Office, where the US president also introduced a $1 million “gold card” residency programme he had previewed months earlier.
Several leading companies quickly advised their employees holding H-1B visas not to leave the country while they figured out the implications. Some who had already boarded planes disembarked for fear they might not be allowed to re-enter.
The American dream
Data released by the US Department of Homeland Security showed there were 422,335 Indian students in the United States in 2024, an increase of 11.8 per cent on the year before.
India’s IT industry association Nasscom said soon after Friday’s initial announcement that it was concerned by the new visa measures.
It said “business continuity” at technology companies would be disrupted, and was quick to point out how Indian IT firms contributed to the US economy and were “by no means” a security threat.
Shashwath VS, a 20-year-old chemical engineering student in Bengaluru, said the new fee was too high for companies to think about sponsoring a foreign candidate.
“I will now explore other countries… going to the US was a priority for me, but not anymore,” Shashwath said.
He said many like him might try to find places elsewhere, such as Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
Indians, he said, “contribute significantly to the American economy — be it students who go there or people who work there”.
“So they (the US) will also be hit, in one way or the other.”
Immigration crackdown
Trump has had the H-1B programme in his sights since his first term in office, and the current visa iteration has become the latest move in a major immigration crackdown in his second term.
Silicon Valley companies rely on Indian workers who either relocate to the United States or come and go between the two countries.
India’s own vast outsourcing industry has also depended on the work permits for decades, even though that has softened in recent years.
Industry leader Tata Consultancy Services alone received approval for more than 5,000 H-1B visas in the first half of the 2025 fiscal year.
Sahil, a 37-year-old senior manager at an India-based consultancy firm, returned from the United States last year after living there on an H-1B visa for almost seven years.
“I can tell every second or third person in the IT sector dreams of settling in the US or visiting to work,” he said.
“We will see fewer Indians migrating to the US in the future. That possibly means those people will now start looking at other countries.“</p><small>2025-09-21 12:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/211616367cc7536.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943670/bodies-of-3-transgender-individuals-found-in-karachis-memon-goth' target='_blank'><strong>Bodies of 3 transgender individuals found in Karachi’s Memon Goth</strong></a><br><p>The bodies of three transgender individuals were recovered from Karachi’s Memon Goth on Sunday, police and rescue officials said.
The bodies were discovered shortly after midnight on Sunday in the Memon Goth area of Karachi, according to Edhi Information Centre.
“The bodies were found riddled with bullet holes,” the Edhi Centre said in its statement, adding that the deceased were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medicolegal formalities.
Police also confirmed the incident, with city police official Javed Ahmed Abro telling AFP, “We are still in the process of confirming their identities. It is too early to determine the motive behind the killings.”
Malir’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dr Abdul Khaliq Pirzada arrived on the scene and issued strict instructions to the concerned deputy superintendent of police and station house officer, issuing immediate orders to arrest the criminals, according to a spokesperson for the Malir District Police.
“On the instructions of SSP Malir, special teams are working to investigate every aspect of the incident on technical grounds,” the spokesperson added.
“The SSP Malir has also formed joint special teams of the police for the early arrest of the accused, which are investigating every aspect of the incident meticulously.”
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has issued orders to the inspector-general of police for the immediate arrest of the killers, according to a notice issued by the CM House today.
“The murderers of transgender persons should be arrested at all costs, and a report should be submitted to me,” the chief minister instructed.
“Transgender persons belong to the oppressed section of society that we all have to respect and honour. The state will not tolerate the killing of any oppressed and innocent citizen,” he added.
A spokesperson added that the chief minister had sought details of the incident.
Karachi’s deputy mayor, Salman Abdullah Murad, contacted the SSP seeking an inquiry report on the murders and demanding the killers’ arrest.
“The murder of three transgender persons in Memon Goth is shocking,” Murad said. “Those involved … should be arrested and given the strictest punishment.”
Although exact figures are not available due to severe underreporting, human rights groups such as Amnesty International say there has been a concerning rise in violence against trans people in Pakistan.
“When hate speech and campaigns are carried out so openly, outcomes like this are inevitable,” Shahzadi Rai, a trans activist and government-appointed local councillor in Karachi, told AFP.
“Even though the state and police are on our side, killings are still occurring, which indicates that deep-rooted hatred against transgender people persists in our society.”
A research report jointly compiled this year by Blue Veins and the National Commission on Human Rights found that many transgender individuals in Pakistan experience social exclusion, including rejection by families, employment discrimination and violence, pushing them further into vulnerability.
In July, armed motorcyclists killed a transgender person in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand division. The same month, another transgender person was shot dead by unidentified persons in the Tehkal area of Peshawar.
Last year, two transgender persons were stabbed to death in Mardan by assailants, who fled the scene after committing the crime, according to the police.</p><small>2025-09-21 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624797-seven-indian-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-di-khan-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Seven Indian-sponsored terrorists killed in DI Khan IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The hacking incident hit check-in and boarding systems provider Collins Aerospace, owned by RTX, disrupting operations on Saturday at London’s Heathrow, Berlin Airport and in Brussels, where passengers faced long queues, dozens of cancellations and delays.
Disruption had eased significantly by early Sunday despite some continuing delays, airport officials and data showed, while regional regulators said they were investigating the origin of the hacking incident.
The disruption is the latest in a string of hacks to hit sectors from healthcare to autos. A breach at carmaker Jaguar Land Rover halted production, while another caused Marks & Spencer losses in the hundreds of millions of pounds.
RTX called the incident a “cyber-related disruption” and said it had impacted its MUSE software, which is used by several airlines. RTX was not immediately available for comment on Sunday.
Berlin Brandenburg Airport said on Sunday that problems persisted, but that it was working with the company to resolve the issue. A manual workaround is in place, and there are currently no major delays or cancellations, it added.
Brussels Airport said in an update to passengers on Sunday that the cyberattack was having a “large impact on the flight schedule”, causing delays and cancellations of flights.
Heathrow said early on Sunday work was continuing to recover from the check-in system outage. It added that “the vast majority of flights have continued to operate”.
An analysis by aviation data provider Cirium said delays at Heathrow were “low”, Berlin had “moderate” delays, while Brussels had “significant” delays, but that they were decreasing.</p><small>2025-09-21 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/21141427efd264c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943654/three-sanitation-workers-die-while-cleaning-manhole-in-karachi-edhi' target='_blank'><strong>Three sanitation workers die while cleaning manhole in Karachi: Edhi</strong></a><br><p>Three sanitation workers died as they fell into a manhole while cleaning it in Karachi’s Usmanabad neighbourhood, Edhi officials said on Sunday.
Deaths from falling into open gutters and manholes frequently occur in Pakistan, particularly in major cities like Karachi, where poorly managed drainage systems, missing or broken covers, and inadequate lighting in congested neighbourhoods often put pedestrians in danger. The gutters are filled with toxic sewage and lack oxygen, making it easy to suffocate or drown within minutes.
“Four people fell into a drain near Siddique Wahab Road while cleaning it, three of whom lost their lives, while another remains unconscious,” the Edhi statement said.
The deceased have been identified as 22-year-old Vishal, 19-year-old Shahir, and 42-year-old George. The fourth man — identified as 26-year-old Faisal — was rushed to the Civil Hospital’s Trauma Centre, while the bodies of the deceased have been shifted to an Edhi morgue.
Police surgeon Sumaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the workers “expired in a manhole while cleaning it,” adding that the families have refused a post-mortem.
As per DIG South Syed Asad Raza, “the workers were hired by Union Council chairman Javed, and were working on the drain since 1am.” He added that, “when one of the workers lost consciousness while cleaning, two workers entered the manhole to pull him out..but both fell unconscious later.”
The workers were hired for a wage of Rs15,000, according to DIG South.
On Friday, three private sanitation workers were asphyxiated in the underground septic tank of a cattle farm in Faisalabad.
On September 11, two sanitation workers died after inhaling toxic gases while cleaning a company’s underground tank at Port Qasim, according to police and rescue service officials, while in June, five men, including a sanitation worker and two brothers, died under similar circumstances while cleaning an underground water tank in Karachi’s Ibrahim Hyderi.</p><small>2025-09-21 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624769-pm-shehbaz-to-attend-select-muslim-leaders-meeting-with-trump-on-unga-sidelines-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to attend meeting of 'select' Muslim leaders with Trump on UNGA sidelines: FO</strong></a><br><p>

Police officials said that 70 lawyers were nominated in the case, along with 150 to 200 unidentified persons, in an FIR lodged at the Secretariat Police Station on the complaint of IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Shah Gillani.
After registration of the case, the police obtained arrest warrants. Later, separate police teams raided different places, including the residences of 11 lawyers nominated in the FIR.
By evening, 17 raids had been conducted in the capital, but all remained unsuccessful as the nominated individuals had gone into hiding to avoid arrest.
Footage from CCTV cameras installed in and around the IHC and Constitution Avenue was also being obtained and examined to identify others involved in the clash.
 
 

According to the FIR, Advocate Gillani went to the parking area outside the IHCBA office, where he spotted 60 to 70 people dressed in lawyers’ uniforms along with 150 to 200 unidentified persons. They were chanting slogans against the IHC chief justice, state institutions and the army.
Advocate Gillani asked the lawyers to refrain from such acts, but the mob ‘attacked and manhandled him’. They also allegedly ‘verbally abused’ him and threatened him with dire consequences.
Office-bearers and staff of the IHCBA rescued him, after which the group dispersed.
In a post on her X account, Shireen Mazari stated that at 1am a heavily armed police party from the Secretariat Police Station surrounded her house and asked for Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatha.
“They were not there and we informed them. Police said there was an FIR against them and they should report to the police station, and then they left,” she wrote.
 






In another post, Ms Mazari said that all videos of the IHC protest clearly showed the FIR charges were false, adding that eyewitness accounts also confirmed this.
“But the persecution of Imaan and Hadi has become a daily routine by the state. Ironic that PTI lawyers’ support got the IHC bar president elected,” she added.
Reportedly, lawyers had staged a protest on the IHC premises to oppose the suspension of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from judicial work.
However, tension flared when, after the demonstration, PTI-affiliated lawyers confronted the IHCBA president.

The petition was filed by citizen Ghulam Murtaza Khan through Barrister Zafarullah Khan Advocate, stating that the dissemination of “provocative and malicious” content from the account of a convicted prisoner is unlawful and contrary to prison rules.
The petitioner requested the court to direct the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to conduct a thorough investigation to determine who has been operating the PTI founder’s account while he remains incarcerated.
 
 

The petition further sought directions for blocking and removing such content from social media platforms.
It also called upon the court to instruct the jail superintendent to ensure that the prisoner is not allowed to access or operate social media in violation of jail regulations, terming such activity “unconstitutional and illegal.”
In addition, the petitioner asked the court to restrain PTI from redistributing or promoting any posts originating from the founder’s account during his imprisonment.

The IMF team is scheduled to visit Pakistan on Sept 25 to review the country’s performance under the $7 billion EFF arrangement, covering the first half of 2025. The review will assess Pakistan’s progress in meeting key economic targets for the March-June quarter.
Based on Topline’s estimates, Pakistan is likely to meet the IMF’s QPC, including targets related to net international reserves and swap positions. The primary balance numbers for FY25 are also well within the IMF’s projections, the report noted.
In addition to fulfilling IMF-mandated reforms, Pakistan is actively seeking foreign investment in emerging sectors such as offshore drilling, mining, and Web 3.0 technologies. A key milestone in this effort was the Pakistan Mineral Investment Forum 2025, held in April, which drew over 5,000 delegates from more than 50 countries.

Fund mission to assess economic performance from 25th as floods and inflation pressures persist

The report also highlighted renewed interest from the United States in Pakistan’s offshore hydrocarbon resources, which could play a crucial role in the development of the country’s untapped natural resources. The Reko Diq mining project, a flagship initiative, is expected to reach its financial close in the coming weeks.
However, Pakistan is also grappling with severe floods and heavy rains, affecting much of the country except for a few regions like Balochistan and Azad Kashmir. While the central bank has noted that the intensity of the current floods is less severe than past events, Topline cautioned that the floods could temporarily disrupt economic reforms. The report added that Pakistan’s resilient economy should recover from the impact in the near term.
The floods are expected to increase relief spending and further strain government revenues, leading to a projected rise in the fiscal deficit for FY26. Topline has revised its fiscal deficit forecast to 4.8 per cent of GDP, up from an earlier estimate of 4.1pc.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is now expected to collect Rs13.6 trillion in tax revenues for FY26, down from the earlier target of Rs14.1tr. This revision reflects a slower economic recovery and the expected impact of the floods on GDP growth.
GDP growth is now forecast to be between 2.75pc and 3.25pc, down from the previous range of 3.5pc to 4pc. Agriculture growth has been downgraded to 2.6pc, following expected crop losses of 15pc for rice and 10pc for cotton due to the floods.
The current account deficit is expected to remain within the 0-0.5pc range of GDP. Topline has revised its import growth forecast to 10pc (from 9pc), while lowering its export growth projection to just 1pc (from 4%). However, remittances are expected to grow by 6pc, with any higher growth in remittances acting as a positive offset to the current account deficit.
 
 

The report also indicated that the central bank is likely to maintain the policy rate unchanged through FY26, revising its previous assumption of a potential rate hike.
This shift is attributed to risks stemming from food inflation due to the floods, rising import bills, and geopolitical uncertainties, including recent tensions in Israel and Qatar, which could affect oil prices.

National Food Security and Research Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, in a statement on Saturday, highlighted that the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) has accredited the Citrus Research Institute’s post-entry quarantine facilities. This accreditation paves the way for the introduction of new, disease-resistant, and seedless kinno varieties that offer higher yields and greater consumer appeal.
Mr Tanveer emphasised that citrus, especially kinno, is a symbol of Pakistan’s agricultural strength. He noted that the government’s efforts are not limited to expanding fresh fruit exports; equal emphasis is also being placed on promoting seedless kinno and value-added citrus products such as juices, concentrates, and essential oils, which have higher market value internationally.
 
 

The government is also focusing on capacity building for growers and exporters through training programmes and workshops.
These initiatives aim to equip stakeholders with modern agricultural techniques and ensure compliance with international export requirements.

Introduces measures to boost global recognition of citrus

Furthering its international engagement, the minister pointed to Pakistan’s recent meeting with a Russian delegation in Islamabad as an example of expanding cooperation to strengthen citrus exports. In addition, more laboratories have been accredited across the country to speed up the testing and certification processes for agricultural products.
In a bid to facilitate farmers and exporters, the government has established a temporary outpost in Sargodha, Pakistan’s primary citrus-producing region. This facility will provide on-the-spot support and ensure the timely processing of export consignments.
The minister reiterated the government’s commitment to boosting citrus exports, particularly kinno, and ensuring that Pakistani citrus products maintain their presence in traditional markets while also reaching new destinations. These markets include Central Asia, Russia, the Middle East, Africa, and the European Union.
He also commended the DPP’s efforts in streamlining export procedures, such as reducing unnecessary testing for pesticide residues in kinno shipments.
Furthermore, the registration of new exporters for markets like Uzbekistan and other Central Asian countries is expected to broaden market access and create new trade opportunities for local farmers and exporters.

She claims to have been falsely implicated for political reasons.
Through her Advocate Sameer Khosa, Ms Shah argues that she had no involvement in the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squad vehicle near Jinnah House during the riots.
She maintained she was not named in the FIR, nor was she implicated throu­­gh supplementary statements.
No identification para­­de was conducted to establish her presence at the scene.
 
 

The trial, held inside Kot Lakhpat jail, resulted in 21 acquittals out of 51 accused, with 12 declared proclaimed offenders. Ms Shah was among the 18 convicted, recently sentenced to five years in prison and fined Rs100,000.
The appeal highlights that the prosecution’s case relied solely on her social media activity post-May 9, 2023.
However, the trial court scrutinized her entire online data without legal basis, terming the charges “defective, vague, and unsustainable.
The appeal stresses that the judgement was “assu­mption-based” and lacked credible evidence linking Shah to the alleged offenses.
Her legal team urged the Lahore High Court to set aside the Sept 9 verdict of the anti-terrorism court and acquit her of all charges.

The recommendation appears in the US Department of State’s 2025 Fiscal Transparency Report, released on Friday. The annual report reviews the openness of budgetary practices worldwide, assessing how governments publish, audit, and manage public funds.
“The military and intelligence budgets were not subject to adequate parliamentary or civilian public oversight,” the report stated in its Pakistan section. It added that “steps Pakistan could take to improve fiscal transparency include… subjecting the military and intelligence agencies’ budgets to parliamentary or civilian public oversight”.
The report also urged Pakistan to ensure the timely publication of its executive budget proposal. “The government… did not publish its executive budget proposal within a reasonable period,” the assessment noted, calling for earlier release of the document to enable informed debate and scrutiny.
 
 

On debt disclosure, the report found that “the government made only limited information on debt obligations, including major state-owned enterprise debt, publicly available.” It recommended “disclosing detailed information on government debt obligations, including for state-owned enterprises”.

Fiscal Transparency Report commends Pakistan’s audit institution, says it ‘meets international standards of independence’

While highlighting these shortcomings, the State Department acknowledged progress in other areas. It noted that Pakistan’s “enacted budget and end-of-year report [were] widely and easily accessible to the public, including online,” and that budget information was “generally reliable and subject to audit by the supreme audit institution.”
It also praised the independence of Pakistan’s supreme audit institution, saying it “met international standards of independence” and published audit findings within a reasonable period.
The report further observed that Pakistan “specified in law or regulation, and appeared to follow in practice, the criteria and procedures for awarding natural resource extraction contracts and licences,” and made “basic information on natural resource extraction awards publicly available”.
This year’s assessment echoes concerns raised in previous State Department reports, which have repeatedly pointed to gaps in debt transparency and the lack of legislative oversight of defence spending.
The report comes as Pakistan grapples with severe budgetary pressures. The government presented its budget for the fiscal year 2025-26, totaling Rs17.57 trillion. Of this, Rs9.7tr has been allocated for debt servicing, while Rs2.55tr has been set aside for defence — a nearly 20 per cent increase compared to last year.
The US recommendations are aimed at bolstering public trust and international confidence in Pakistan’s financial management at a time when external financing and investment remain critical to economic stability.
 
 

The 2025 Fiscal Transparency Report is a global assessment, evaluating fiscal practices in 140 governments and entities. It examines whether countries publish executive budgets in a timely manner, disclose debt obligations (including state-owned enterprises), maintain independent audit institutions, and ensure that sensitive spending — such as defence and intelligence — is subject to legislative or civilian oversight.

The civil defence agency said 11 were killed when warplanes struck the Dughmush family in the city’s Al-Sabra neighbourhood.
The assault came as 10 countries including Australia, Belgium, Britain and Canada are scheduled to formally recognise an independent Palestinian state on Monday, ahead of the annual gathering at the UN General Assembly.
Israel’s intensified military demolition campaign targeting high-rise buildings in Gaza City began this week alongside a ground assault.
 
 

Its forces, which control Gaza City’s eastern suburbs, have in recent days been pounding the Sheikh Radwan and Tel Al Hawa areas from where they would be positioned to advance on central and western parts of the city, where most of the population is sheltering.

Hamas warns lives of Israeli prisoners are in danger due to massive bombardment

Israel’s military estimates it has demolished up to 20 tower blocks over the past two weeks and believes some 350,000 people have left Gaza City since the start of this month. Another 600,000 or so remain, however.
 
 

Included in that tally are some of the Israeli prisoners being held by Hamas.
The group’s military wing released an image of the prisoners on Telegram on Saturday, warning that their lives were at risk due to Israel’s military operation in Gaza City.
In almost two years of fighting, Israel’s bombardment has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, spread famine, demolished most structures and displaced most of the population, in many cases multiple times.
Israel says the “war will end only if Hamas surrenders”, frees Israeli prisoners, disarms and disbands. Hamas says it will not disarm until a Palestinian state is established.
A total of 48 of the 251 Israelis taken prisoner on Oct 7, 2023, are yet to be released, but 28 are thought to be dead.
Hospital director traumatised
As Israel presses on with its offensive to capture the territory’s largest urban centre, Palestinians are going through unimaginable trauma.
The director of Al Shifa hospital was shocked and devastated when two victims killed in a strike were delivered to his ward: his brother and sister-in-law.
“I was shocked and devastated to see the bodies of my brother and his wife,” said Mohammed Abu Salmiya, who was working in the emergency department of the territory’s main hospital at the time.
“Anything is possible now, as you receive your dearest ones as martyrs or wounded,” he said. “The occupation’s crimes continue, and the number of martyrs keeps rising.”
A journalist saw ambulances with sirens blaring into the hospital compound, bringing more bodies of people killed by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza City.

• Says health, construction and agriculture sectors could lose over $1.5tr
ISLAMABAD: The World Economic Forum (WEF) warned in a fresh insight report that climate change, if left unaddressed, could result in 14.5 million excess deaths and trillion of dollars in economic loses by 2050, concentrated in the world’s most disadvantaged regions and populations.
The report, “Building Economic Resilience to the Health Impacts of Climate Change,” says deaths from extreme weather events in those regions have been about 15 times higher over the past decade.
It also warns that climate-health impacts threaten business resilience and that today, less than 5 per cent of global adaptation funding targets health protection. “This is a dangerous gap that also presents an opportunity for private-sector action,” the report said.
 
 

The WEF defines a Climate and Health Business Framework and applies it to four highly exposed sectors to identify specific climate-health risks and opportunities.
In food and agriculture, the report says an estimated 24m additional people will face hunger by 2050 and that agricultural workers are expected to face growing climate-health risks. It estimates a likely, mid-range scenario of $740 billion in worker-availability losses between 2025 and 2050.
“Businesses that invest in resilient and precision agriculture practices and modified working practices will be best positioned to meet growing global needs for consistently available, healthy foods,” the report said.
In the built environment, the forum notes that more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas and that most buildings and infrastructure are poorly adapted for climate extremes such as heat and air pollution.
 
 

Construction workers are particularly vulnerable; the report projects a likely, mid-range scenario that the industry will lose at least $570bn in worker-availability losses between 2025 and 2050. It says climate-resilient design and retrofits have the potential to safeguard communities and economy.
The health and health-care sector is expected to face at least $200 billion in worker-availability losses in a likely, mid-range scenario from 2025 to 2050 and to bear an additional $1.1 trillion treatment burden due to climate change by 2050, the report says, underscoring the need for a shift toward preventive care.
“There is tremendous opportunity for companies to lead this transformation and build resilience by creating new climate-resilient medicines and robust care pathways, and improving public-health engagement,” it said.
Climate change is also driving up claims in health, life and casualty coverage. The report cites Swiss Re forecasting 0.75pc excess mortality annually by 2050.
Meanwhile, it notes, only about 8pc of people in low-income communities are covered by health insurance. Insurers, the report says, can support and accelerate resilience by offering innovative products, improving forecasting capabilities and incentivising risk reduction.
Taken together, it says, worker-availability losses across food and agriculture, the built environment and health and health care are projected to exceed $1.5 trillion between 2025 and 2050, underscoring the magnitude of the climate-health challenge.
While institutions in each sector can act, the report stresses that no sector can tackle the challenge alone.
“Success depends on enabling coordinated action — through supportive policies, interoperable climate-health data systems and innovative financing to mobilise capital,” it said. Those foundations, the WEF added, can help ensure long-term, scalable resilience.
The report highlights practical measures that can reduce illness and mortality in vulnerable regions: providing workers with medical care, implementing cooling solutions and modifying work practices. It also calls for expanded investment in research and development to advance science and develop solutions for climate-linked health challenges.
“By investing in research, businesses can help identify the root causes of climate-health risks and develop new treatments, technologies and preventive strategies,” the report said.

Over the past weeks, the PPP chairman and senior leaders have encouraged the use of the flagship income support initiative to provide relief to thousands of citizens affected by the monsoon floods. Earlier this week, its vice president, Sherry Rehman, had “strongly and repeatedly” advocated the use of BISP for the purpose in a Senate committee meeting.
On Saturday, another PPP leader Humayun Khan urged the government to do the same. His statement came days after PML-N leader and PM’s aide Rana  Sanaullah expressed apprehensions about the BISP, calling it unviable for a cash-strapped government. Rana Sana said the BISP could not be  continued in its current form — it either needed to be wrapped up or be  completely revamped.
The PML-N leader had suggested ‘Benazir Rozgar Scheme’ or ‘Hunarmand Scheme’ would be a more effective way to provide skills and employment opportunities to its beneficiaries instead of a monthly stipend. He had said the matter would be discussed in parliament, claiming that even some PPP leaders were also in agreement with this proposal.
In a statement on Saturday, PPP Secretary General Humayun Khan reiterated his party’s demand that relief activities should be fast-tracked through the BISP, named after former premier late Benazir Bhutto.
He said that the federal government should provide immediate financial assistance to the flood-affected families through the BISP. He emphasised the BISP was a “proven, transparent, and efficient mechanism capable of delivering direct support” to the country’s most vulnerable populations.
“In these critical times, the affected families are in desperate need of urgent support. BISP is the most reliable platform for ensuring swift and fair distribution of relief funds,” he said. The PPP leader urged the government to put aside political differences and act purely on humanitarian grounds, ensuring that relief efforts were carried out without delay or discrimination.
“This is not the time for political point-scoring. It is a time for solidarity and action. The government must mobilise all available resources to assist those in need through BISP’s transparent system,” he added.
At least 910 people have lost their lives in the torrential rains and flash floods across the country since June 26, according to the National Disaster Management Authority, APP reported on Sept 8. It was reported that 1,044 people were injured, 7,850 houses were destroyed, and 6,180 livestock were killed.

• Mills barred from using wheat for manufacturing poultry feed
LAHORE: The Punjab government has stepped up measures, including geotagging of stocks, to avert a potential wheat crisis in the province after floods in the eastern rivers washed away farmlands and destroyed stockpiles in its central districts.
The move comes amid restrictions on the interprovincial movement of the commodity by the provincial government, which has raised prices in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by up to 68 per cent, also prompting protests by Sindh and KP.
Sources told Dawn that the decision to restrict the wheat trade was taken to ensure an ample supply of the grain in the province and to avert a looming crisis. Besides this measure, the Punjab Price Control and Commodities Management also decided to start geotagging and physically verifying wheat stocks in warehouses across the province.
 
 

Its secretary Dr Kiran Khurshid notified a four-member departmental monitoring committee led by Deputy Secretary Shazia Rehman to collect data from all districts in collaboration with the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (Pera) and the food directorate. Through this practice, the wheat stocks stored in government and private warehouses will be registered to meet the food crisis feared in the aftermath of the floods.
Dr Khurshid said her department would implement the government policy to avert the unpredictable and unforeseen crisis post-floods. She said people had lost massive wheat stocks in the recent floods and now it was the government’s responsibility to take care of its citizens.
She said the price control and commodities department was geotagging wheat warehouses to gather information about the actual stocks and resources for predictive analysis and anticipative planning.
“The geotagging is just an intervention, not a solution,” she said, adding that it would take time to trace wheat.
She said the department had established a strategic management wing (SWM) to digitise the department’s assets, resources and activities of the department’s eight directorates. “All the scattered information would be available for the department and higher authorities in one dashboard for monitoring and taking informed decisions,” she said.
 
 

The Punjab Home Department, at the request of the price control department, had also imposed Section 144 and prohibited the mills in the province from using 10,184 metric tonnes of wheat for feed manufacturing.
Interprovincial curbs
Sources said the provincial government was keeping a strict check on the movement of wheat at the exit points of the province. They claimed that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had made it clear that her foremost duty was to stave off a food crisis in her province and ensure that the citizens got their due wheat share through government packages or other means.
She had also been quoted as saying that some four million people had been affected by floods and the executive machinery needed to ensure the availability of wheat for the flood survivors.
The price control secretary, Dr Khurshid, also acknowledged that Punjab was monitoring the wheat movement at the Sindh and KP borders because “businessmen would always like to sell their commodities, where they would get a better price”.
“In this situation, the government’s role is to ensure that wheat stocks in the province meet the needs of its people. It will be insane if the government lets its wheat go to other provinces at a lower price and later purchase it at a higher cost for its own people,” Dr Khurshid said. It may be mentioned that the government had not purchased wheat and there were no hefty stocks in government warehouses.
Meanwhile, the department arrested 107 profiteers, fined 12,043 profiteers, and registered cases against seven individuals. In the matter of over-charging in wheat flour prices, the department officials arrested 18 officials, registered cases against four individuals and fined 1,074 persons. In a crackdown on hoarders, the department has already recovered 334,000 metric tonnes of wheat across the province.
These measures helped increase wheat stocks in flour mills by 165,000 metric tonnes this month alone.
Additionally, the grinding of 360,000 metric tonnes of wheat has ensured a steady supply of flour and brought down wheat prices from Rs3,800 to Rs3,000 per 40kg.
