The premier expressed these views during the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, which is led by US President Donald Trump, in Washington.
“The people of Palestine have long endured the illegal occupation and immense suffering. And, to achieve long-lasting peace, it is very important that ceasefire violations must end to preserve life and advance reconstruction efforts,” PM Shehbaz emphasised in his address.
“The people of Palestine must exercise full control of their land and their future, in line with the UN Security Council resolutions,” he added.







PM Shehbaz further said, “We must work together towards a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination through the establishment of an independent, sovereign, and contiguous state of Palestine in line with relevant resolutions”.
He expressed the hope that under Trump’s “visionary and dynamic leadership, we will ensure a just and lasting resolution to the issue of Palestine”.
“Today is a day which will mark a place in the annals of history, that through your efforts, through your untiring support and great efforts, long-lasting peace in Gaza will be achieved. [It will be your legacy] in all times to come,” PM Shehbaz said, addressing Trump.
The meeting in Washington was held months after the board was initially proposed in September 2025. It was formally established last month.
Under its charter, the US government serves as its official depository and Trump has designated the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace in Washington as the Board’s headquarters, where today’s meeting was held.
A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November last year authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to establish an International Stabilisation Force in Gaza following a ceasefire that began in October under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas.
However, the ceasefire has remained fragile, with repeated violations by Israel.
Earlier in his speech, PM Shehbaz said while addressing Trump that “may God reward you and make you successful in your efforts to bring lasting peace in Gaza”.
“We deeply appreciate your unique initiatives and your dynamic leadership in advancing peaceful solutions to conflicts across the globe. Your bold diplomacy has surely brought calm to many international serious hotspots.
“Your timely and very effective intervention to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan potentially averted the loss of tens of millions of people. You have truly proved to be a man of peace. And let me say you are truly a saviour of South Asia,” PM Shehbaz said.
Trump praises PM Shehbaz, CDF Munir
Speaking before PM Shehbaz, Trump mentioned him, as well as Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir, at the meeting.
Trump said he had been endorsing candidates in the US, but now he was also endorsing foreign leaders, and went on to name PM Shehbaz among the leaders he was acknowledging at the meeting.
“Prime Minister Sharif — I like this man — of Pakistan. Because there was some fighting going on when I got to know him and your Field Marshal, great general, great Field Marshal, great guy.
“I got to meet the prime minister, and he said in front of our Chief of Staff Susie Wiles … that ‘you know nobody knows this, but I believe that President Trump saved 25 million lives when he stopped the war between us and India’,” Trump recalled.

 


Addressing PM Shehbaz, he added, “You made that statement … it was really a beautiful thing.”
Referring to the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May 2025, he said: “That war was raging, planes were being shot down.
“And it was Pakistan and India, and I got on the phone with both of them. And I knew them a little bit. I knew Prime Minister Modi very well, actually. I got to know Pakistan through a little trade. They were trying to make too good a deal, and I got a little upset with them.
“In the end, they got what they wanted, and they made a good deal, and I got to like them — the prime minister, the Field Marshal, who is a tough man, a tough, good fighter, a serious fighter.”
Trump said he called both Pakistan and India after he got to know about the May conflict, during which “many planes were shot down”.
“I called them and said listen, I am not doing trade deals with you two guys if you don’t settle this up. And they said, ‘No, no no!’ That was both of them … And they do a lot of business with the US and they softened up all of a sudden. A little bit of a pullback by one and then the other, and all of a sudden, we worked out a deal,” Trump said.
He added that he had also warned the two countries of imposing a 200 per cent tariff if they continued to fight.







“One of them, I won’t say which one, said ‘No! You can’t do that’. They both wanted to fight, but when it came to losing a lot of money, they said, ‘We don’t want to fight.’
“And we solved that … in two to three days,” Trump continued, before he thanked Shehbaz.
“That was a very big deal; people have no idea. A lot of them say they weren’t fighting. [But] they were fighting. Eleven jets were shot down, very expensive jets,” he added.
Trump said he believed “a lot of progress was made in the relationship”, adding that Modi was a “great man and a great guy”.
‘Big day’
Trump began his address by saying that “this is a big day”.
“Lots of people watching, especially from other countries […] We have a large group of leaders, and the ones who aren’t here are watching on Zoom. I hope they enjoy it,” he added.
The US president further said, “What we are doing is very simple — peace. It’s called the Board of Peace, and it’s all about — an easy word to say, but a hard word to produce — peace.
“We are going to produce it. We have been doing a really good job, and some of these leaders that are with us have helped me very much.”
He then went on to reiterate his claim of settling eight wars.
“And I think a ninth … turned out to be a tougher one. I thought that was going to be the easiest one. But, with war, you never know what’s easy and what’s not so easy. But, we have had a great relationship, and I became friendly with so many of the people.
“And I appreciate you being here. These are great people, these are great leaders,” he added.
Trump said the Board of Peace was one of “the most important and consequential things I think that I will be involved in”, again reiterating his claim of settling wars.
He said, “Some of which were 32, 34 or 37 years long. That’s a long time. [But] we ended it within about two days, each one of those. But, we have some other work to do, and we are getting it done.”
On the Gaza issue, he said it was “very complex”, commending US envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, among others, for an “amazing job” in this connection.
He then went on to say that the Board of Peace was “the most consequential board”.
“Certainly, in terms of power and in terms of prestige, there has never been anything close because these are the greatest world leaders,” he said, adding that almost everybody had accepted the invitation to join the board, and those had not would do.
“Some are playing a little cute. This doesn’t work. You can’t play cute with me,” he remarked.
“They are all joining, most of them immediately. A few of them we don’t want because they are trouble. Take care of them,” he added.
Trump then again asserted that the Board of Peace was the “most prestigious ever put together. You know, I have seen great corporate boards. I have seen some great boards, period. It’s peanuts compared to this board. Because we have virtually everyone who is the head of a country”.
He thanked the leaders attending the meeting for travelling long distances, saying that “we work together to ensure a brighter future for the people of Gaza, the Middle East, and the entire world”.
Trump noted that the Board of Peace comprised mostly leaders from the Middle Eastern countries and “countries all over the world”.
“And they have been generous with money also … And there is nothing more important than peace, and there is nothing less expensive than peace. You know when you go to wars, it costs you a hundred times what it costs to make peace,” he added.
Trump first proposed the Board of Peace when he announced his plan to end Israel’s war in Gaza. He later made clear the board’s remit would be expanded beyond Gaza to tackle other conflicts worldwide.
The Board of Peace includes Israel but not Palestinian representatives and Trump’s suggestion that the Board could eventually address challenges beyond Gaza has stirred anxiety that it could undermine the United Nations’ role as the main platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution.
“We’re going to strengthen the United Nations,” Trump said, trying to assuage his critics. “It’s really very important.”
Trump says prospects of deal with Iran will be clear in 10 days
The Board of Peace meeting came as Trump threatens war against Iran and has embarked on a massive military buildup in the region in case Tehran refuses to give up its nuclear programme.
Trump said he should know in 10 days whether a deal is possible. “We have to have a meaningful deal,” he said.
The event had the feel of a Trump campaign rally, with music blaring from his eclectic playlist from Elvis Presley to the Beach Boys. Red Trump hats were given to participants.
PM Shehbaz lands in Washington
PM Shehbaz arrived in Washington DC on Thursday on an official visit to the United States, at the invitation of Trump to attend the meeting.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier as part of the Pakistani delegation.

 


Apart from attending the Board of Peace meeting, PM Shehbaz is also expected to hold meetings with senior US officials during the visit.
According to an official statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the visit reflects Pakistan’s inclusion in the Board of Peace, its “effective role for the promotion of global peace” and what it described as the country’s growing diplomatic outreach.
“In addition to attending the inaugural session of the BoP, the prime minister will also engage with senior US leadership, as well as his counterparts attending the meeting,” said a press release by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) dated Feb 18.
It added that the occasion would provide an opportunity for discussions on bilateral matters, as well as global issues of mutual concern.

Addressing a press conference in Lahore, Bugti stated that his resignation had already been submitted to the prime minister.
Blaming the sports board for the crisis, he said funds allocated for the Pro League were released to the PSB but were not managed properly, resulting in logistical problems during tours of Argentina and Australia.
Bugti maintained that the federation had shared schedules of the tours in advance and that financial control rested with the PSB.
“After seven years, Pakistan hockey finally got a chance to play in the Pro League, but due to a lack of funds, we struggled to meet obligations,” he said, adding that he personally paid $3,720 to clear outstanding hotel dues in Argentina.
He also called for an independent inquiry, stating that the committee formed by the PSB had acted as “judge and jury”.



Referring to internal matters, he alleged that the team captain had pressured players by showing them messages from influential figures, after which the federation imposed a two-year ban on Ammad Shakeel Butt.
Regarding funding, he said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had allocated Rs250 million for hockey, which was released to the PSB. “Despite this, the hockey federation faced major logistical challenges abroad,” he added.
He concluded by saying that mere resignation was not sufficient. “Pakistan’s reputation has been damaged, and accountability must be ensured.”
Naqvi meets hockey players
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, met the hockey players.
A statement posted on the PCB’s X account said the players shared with Naqvi the “unpleasant incidents” during the FIH Pro League, and the PCB chief expressed regret over the “ill treatment” of the players.
“[We] will accommodate the hockey players in every way,” the statement quoted Naqvi as assuring.
According to the statement, he also assured full cooperation to “streamline matters of hockey” and issued directives to arrange tickets, kits and hotel accommodation for the players for World Cup qualifiers in Egypt.
He said the camp for the hockey players would start from tomorrow (Friday) and directed that all arrangements for the training camp should be completed by tonight, according to the statement.
The statement said he also instructed that the PCB should get the injured hockey players treated immediately, asking the players to focus only on their game.
“Pakistan’s respect is above all. We will not allow the tarnishing of its honour under any circumstances,” he said.
According to the PCB statement, Naqvi also handed over cheques of Rs1 million each to the hockey players — a reward which was announced for them for finishing as runners-up in national hockey tournaments.
“The hockey players thanked Naqvi for meeting and encouraging them,” the statement said.







Naqvi earlier also said in a post on social media platform X that he would not become the PHF president but “we will assist players till this turmoil ends”.







It was later reported that the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination’s (IPC) federal secretary, Mohiyuddin Ahmed Wani, had been appointed as the ad-hoc president of PHF.
Wani said after his appointment that the governance mechanism of PHF would be improved and “in next six week, we will prepare a business plan for the PHF, and we will take steps to run this federation on professional grounds”.
“There is no shortage of resources, but the PHF is facing financial management issues. We will work on this,” he said and added that he would ensure free, fair and transparent elections of the PHF.
Bugti’s resignation follows a public row between the PHF and the PSB over alleged mismanagement during the national team’s participation in the second leg of the FIH Pro League in Hobart, Australia.
The Green Shirts returned to Lahore after suffering defeats against Germany and Australia, ending a winless campaign.
While the PHF maintained that logistical and financial responsibility rested with the PSB under Senate committee directives, a PSB official countered that sufficient funds had been provided and questioned the federation’s handling of arrangements.
PM Shehbaz had taken notice of the matter and ordered an immediate inquiry, while Federal Minister Rana Sanaullah constituted a committee to investigate the issue.
Both sides have welcomed the probe, though observers have called for a neutral and independent investigation to ensure transparency.

Pakistan, however, was not named among the five nations who have committed troops for the International Stabilisation Force, which will be tas­k­ed with securing reconstruction zones and supporting a post-conflict governance arrangement in Gaza.

 

Trump brought together allies from around the world — many authoritarians, with few Western democrats who traditionally ally with the United States — to hail his peacemaking at the first Board of Peace meeting.
Presiding with a gavel over the meeting in the gleaming Washington building of the former US Institute of Peace, which has been gutted and renamed after the 79-year-old Republican, Trump hailed the “powerful people” who joined his board.
“We will help Gaza. We will straighten it out. We’ll make it successful,” Trump said, holding up a document with pledges before the disco beats of his adopted theme-song “YMCA” came on the speakers.
“We will make it peaceful, and we will do things like that in other spots. Spots will come up, things will happen,” Trump said.
Troops pledges
The Board of Peace came together after the Trump administration, teaming up with Qatar and Egypt, negotiated a ceasefire in October to halt two years of devastating Israeli onslaught in Gaza.
The plan’s second phase calls for the disarmament of Hamas.
In a first for an Arab country, Morocco announced it was ready to send police as well as officers to the nascent International Stabilisation Force.
The force’s American commander, Major General Jasper Jeffers, said that Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Kosovo were also sending troops and announced that an Indonesian officer would serve as his deputy.
Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, earlier said it was ready to send 8,000 troops — nearly half of the 20,000 sought.
Trump hailed Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who attended, calling the former military officer accused of human rights abuses in East Timor a “tough cookie.”
Nickolay Mladenov, a veteran Bulgarian diplomat named high representative for Gaza by the United States, also announced the beginning of recruitment for a post-Hamas police force in Gaza and said 2,000 people had applied in the first hours.
Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi was also asked about the ISF and Pakistan’s view on it during a weekly briefing in Islamabad today.
In response, he said: “We understand that a decision is awaited on the contours of the mandate of the International Stabilisation Force, and till such time, we’re not in a position to take any decision on this matter.
“We have identified our red lines quite explicitly. The deputy prime minister and the foreign minister has done so here from this platform, and elsewhere. Pakistan can be part of a peacekeeping mandate, but we would not be part of any disarming/ demilitarisation mandates. This discussion at [the Board of Peace meeting in] Washington might take place today. We will update you as and when these developments take place.”
For his part, Trump said during the moot in Washington that he hoped the use of force to disarm Hamas would not be necessary. He said Hamas had promised to disarm and it “looks like they’re going to be doing that, but we’ll have to find out.”
Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, representing Israel at the meeting, demanded disarmament of Hamas and “a fundamental deradicalisation process” in Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Israel that Hamas will be disarmed one way or the other. “Very soon, Hamas will face a dilemma - to disarm peacefully or disarmed forcefully,” he said.
In Gaza, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said any international force must “monitor the ceasefire and prevent the (Israeli) occupation from continuing its aggression”. Disarmament could be discussed, he said, without directly committing to it.
Gaza reconstruction
Trump, who has sharply curtailed foreign aid, said the United States would contribute $10bn to the Board of Peace. He also announced that contributing nations had raised $7bn as an initial down payment for Gaza reconstruction.
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates each promised at least $1bn. White House Press Secretary said more than $6.5bn was pledged, presumably excluding Trump’s offer.
Trump also said FIFA will raise $75 million for soccer-related projects in Gaza and that the United Nations will chip in $2 billion for humanitarian assistance.
“Together we can achieve the dream of bringing lasting harmony to a region tortured by centuries of war, suffering,” said the realtor-turned-president, who has spoken improbably of building tourist resorts in Gaza.
Trump did not explain exactly where the money would go and whether Congress had approved the contribution he announced for the institution, which has drawn criticism for its opaque nature.
Trump will wield veto power over the Board of Peace and can remain its head even after leaving office, while countries that want to stay on permanently rather than enjoy a two-year stint will need to pay $1bn.
Critics say the Board of Peace remains vague, including how it would interact with existing institutions, including the United Nations, to which Trump has drastically cut support.
“It’s a confused mix of ambition and narcissism, unleavened by any effort at intellectual coherence,” said Bruce Jones, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

According to a statement by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted an IBO last night on the reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“During conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, four khawarij were sent to hell,” ISPR said.
It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, who “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
It said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. It said that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.
In separate statements, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari commended the security forces for the operation, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
“The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in this war against terrorism,” the report quoted the prime minister as saying.
PM Shehbaz expressed the government’s firm resolve to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism in the country.
The prime minister said that security forces “continue to achieve significant successes under the Azm-i-Istehkam vision”, according to the report.
In a separate statement, President Zardari said, “The relentless efforts of the security forces and law enforcement agencies under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam are commendable.”
The president reaffirmed the nation’s resolve to continue the fight against terrorism until its complete eradication.
He reiterated that the entire nation stands united with its security forces in safeguarding the country’s peace and stability.
The operation in Lakki Marwat has been conducted days after a terrorist attack, involving an explosive-laden vehicle, on a checkpost in KP’s Bajaur district, martyred 11 security personnel, as per ISPR.
12 terrorists were eliminated after security forces retaliated and “engaged the fleeing khwarij with precision,” ISPR said.
KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.
This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.</p><small>2026-02-19 17:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/192004026567ac1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974378/pakistan-us-sign-pact-to-redevelop-new-yorks-roosevelt-hotel' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US sign pact to redevelop New York’s Roosevelt Hotel</strong></a><br><p>The finance ministry said on Thursday that Pakistan and the United States had formally launched a strategic economic initiative, including collaboration regarding the operation, maintenance, renovation and redevelopment of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York.
In a statement, the ministry said that the initiative would include collaboration with the US General Services Administration (GSA) for the redevelopment of the hotel.
“This engagement was negotiated and stewarded by US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff under the leadership of President Donald J. Trump,” it said.







“To advance this partnership, both governments have signed an MoU formalising their cooperation,” the ministry added.
The statement said the MoU was signed by GSA Administrator Edward C Forst and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and was witnessed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Witkoff.
“It establishes a structured, time-bound framework for joint evaluation of the technical, commercial, and economic parameters of cooperation, reflecting a shared commitment to transparent, disciplined, and mutually beneficial progress,” the statement said.
The statement noted the Roosevelt Hotel’s prime location in Manhattan and the complexity of New York zoning and municipal process, saying the “institutional coordination aims to reduce execution risk, enhance regulatory clarity, and maximize transaction value”.
“Such facilitative frameworks are consistent with international practice in cross-border real estate and infrastructure projects,” it added.
“The objective remains to secure maximum value for this property in alignment with the government’s privatisation strategy while strengthening Pakistan-United States economic ties,” the statement concluded.

 

The GSA primarily manages federal property and procurement for US government agencies, and its publicly stated mandate does not typically include commercial redevelopment of foreign state-owned assets. It was not immediately clear under what authority the agency would facilitate the project.
Named after former US President Theodore Roosevelt, the century-old property in midtown Manhattan is seen as one of Pakistan’s most valuable foreign assets, which it acquired in 2000. Faced with mounting losses, the over 1,000-room hotel was shut in 2020, and has also operated briefly as a migrant shelter.
The hotel is located near marquee New York destinations such as Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, and Fifth Avenue, placing it in one of Manhattan’s most valuable commercial zones.

According to the HEC, the directive applies to all public and private sector higher education institutions, and universities have been instructed to incorporate the compulsory AI course into their curricula without any delay.
The commission said that every undergraduate and postgraduate degree programme will include a mandatory three-credit-hour course on AI.
According to details, the course may be offered as an elective subject, an interdisciplinary course, or as a supporting subject within the programme structure.
It further emphasised that integrating AI into academic curricula will not merely be an addition but a necessity in today’s rapidly evolving world.
“In the fast-changing landscape of the 21st century, Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a revolutionary force,” the HEC said.
It added that the inclusion of AI education aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills required to effectively use such tools in their respective fields, enhancing their academic and professional capabilities.</p><small>2026-02-19 15:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19202506f3539ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974381/india-to-make-rafale-jets-with-france-in-boost-to-defence-ties-macron-says' target='_blank'><strong>India to make Rafale jets with France in boost to defence ties, Macron says</strong></a><br><p>France and India are entering a new era of defence cooperation with plans to jointly produce Rafale fighter jets as well as helicopters, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday, adding France also hopes to sell more submarines to India.
India’s expected order for another 114 Rafales is a “new step forward” in defence ties between the two countries and France hopes to see this replicated with submarines as well, Macron told reporters at the end of a three-day visit to India.
“On Rafale, what we want to do is expand. India confirmed a few days ago its willingness to command a new bunch of Rafales … 114 … and to co-produce in India,” Macron said.
The Defence Acquisition Council of India’s defence ministry last week gave initial clearance to acquire 114 more Rafale jets for the air force, besides other planes and missiles, months after the worst fighting in decades between India and Pakistan.
So far, India has purchased 36 Rafales for its air force and ordered another 26 marine versions of the jet for the navy.
Details of the Rafale deal, including plans for co-production, expected to be sealed after technical and commercial negotiations, are yet to be made public.
Indian media reports have said that the 114 jets manufactured by Dassault Aviation are expected to cost 3.25 trillion Indian rupees ($35.65 billion).
They have also reported that up to 90 of the 114 jets could be produced in India with a joint venture partner who is yet to be identified.
“Rafale is absolutely key,” Macron said. “I hope we will do it on submarines. We offered additional capacities.”
The Indian navy operates six French Scorpene submarines and local media reports say there are plans to order more.
On Tuesday, Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the first H125 helicopter assembly line, made in India by a joint venture between Airbus and Tata Advanced Systems, as well as a plan to jointly produce Hammer missiles in India, by Safran and India’s state-owned Bharat Electronics.
Rafale jets flown by the Indian Air Force were in the spotlight during the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May 2025.
In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.

A video of Aina appeared on the social media platform X over the past 24 hours, where she can be seen showcasing both her batting and bowling skills in a street match.







The video captured the attention of Peshawar Zalmi owner Javed Afridi, who said “talent like this deserves the right platform”.
In a post on X, he said that she would be part of the upcoming Zalmi Women League — a platform for girls to “play, inspire, and express their talents”.
“We will ensure she is provided with all necessary cricket equipment and proper facilities so she gets the opportunity she truly deserves to grow and shine and become the next Saira Jabeen,” he said.







The video had also captured the attention of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who said on X, “It is truly heartening to witness such extraordinary raw talent emerging from our soil, a powerful reminder of the immense potential within our youth.”
He said he hoped to see Aina receive the encouragement, training, and institutional support she deserved so her talent “can be fully refined”.
“Our province is brimming with gifted daughters like Aina, whose dreams need only recognition and the right platform. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that no talent goes unnoticed and no dream remains unsupported,” he said in the post, also tagging Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi.







The attention has resulted in Aina pledging to work hard to play for the women’s cricket team.
In a recent video message, she said, “When I grow up, I want to play for the Pakistan women’s team. I want girls from our area to play and move forward.”
She expressed special gratitude to Zalmi owner Afridi for including her in the Zalmi Women League and calling it the “biggest moment” of her life.
“If I am supported, I will work even harder,” Aina said. “I want proper academies and schools in North Waziristan.”
Aina also appealed to the government and sporting bodies to establish quality educational institutions, modern playgrounds, and cricket academies in North Waziristan to help local talent progress.
Meanwhile, according to local residents, Aina has proven that talent does not depend on living in big cities or going to expensive academies.
Speaking to Dawn, a local elder remarked, “She is our daughter. She has brought pride to Waziristan. The government should support such talented girls.”
Many are expressing hope that, with proper guidance and facilities, national and international-level players can emerge from Waziristan.
However, sports infrastructure in North Waziristan remains limited. There are few proper playgrounds and a lack of established cricket academies. Many children are forced to play on uneven grounds without access to coaching or modern equipment.
The state of education also presents challenges. In several areas, school buildings are inadequate, and sports development activities are nearly non-existent.
Local teachers believe that promoting sports at the school level would encourage positive activities and provide constructive pathways for the youth.
Experts argue that sports not only provide healthy engagement for young people but also play a vital role in promoting peace and stability. With improved sports infrastructure, Waziristan could become a nursery of talent.
Aina’s story is not just about the success and recognition of a young girl; it is also a light of hope for an entire region. Her determination and resilience demonstrate that, given the right opportunities, children from Waziristan can one day raise Pakistan’s flag on international grounds.</p><small>2026-02-19 14:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19185154ab19081.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974370/in-pictures-prayers-charity-and-iftar-meals-mark-the-beginning-of-ramazan' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Prayers, charity, and iftar meals mark the beginning of Ramazan</strong></a><br><p>Ramazan is welcomed by Muslims around the world as a sacred month of fasting, reflection and spiritual renewal, observed by more than 1.9 billion people across different countries.
From dawn to sunset, Muslims fast from food and drink, dedicating the month to prayer, charity and community.
Mosques fill for nightly Taraweeh prayers, families gather for iftar meals at sunset, and acts of generosity increase as believers seek spiritual growth and closeness to Allah.
Beyond the physical fast, Ramazan emphasises patience, self-discipline and compassion for those less fortunate, making it one of the most significant and unifying periods in the Islamic calendar.
Here are some glimpses from different countries, including Pakistan, Occupied Kashmir, Palestine, Sudan, Nigeria, Kosovo, Malaysia and Indonesia, capturing how communities welcomed the holy month with prayers, acts of charity, and communal meals.

The incident occurred at a residence in the Gul Rana Colony area of Soldier Bazaar. The injured and the deceased were shifted to Civil Hospital.
Initially, Rescue 1122 put the death toll at 16. However, officials later confirmed that the death toll was 15, while 18 others were injured.
Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Jamshed Asher said the incident occurred at around 4:15am during Sehri, and that the gas explosion took place on the building’s first floor.
East Deputy Commissioner Nasrullah Abbasi told Dawn that the gas explosion occurred at the time of Sehri in a building located in Gul Rana Colony.
He said it was a highly congested locality where a ground plus three-storey building was constructed on 40-45 yards with one small room on each floor. He said that the explosion destroyed the whole building.
Speaking to Dawn, Abid Farooq, an official from the bomb disposal squad, ruled out the possibility of any sabotage. He stated that the incident was caused by a gas leak; the explosion was triggered by someone lighting a match.
He said that the structure in question was a precast building, covered on all four sides with a narrow street. He said that the gas fittings in the kitchen on the first floor were not upto mark, while plastic pipes were installed for providing gas supply everywhere else. Farooq said that an electric gas pump had also been installed.
Quoting residents, Farooq said there was no gas supply in the area for several days but it suddenly increased on Wednesday night.
Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the residents of the building were buried under the rubble after the explosion, adding that the building was in a dilapidated condition.
He said Gul Rana Colony was spread over two streets in the historic Soldier Bazaar area, with no access for vehicles and tools. He said rescue teams could hear the screams of children and women from the debris. Therefore, they avoided using heavy machinery and preferred to carry out rescue work manually, he said.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed that a total of 15 people were brought dead to Civil Hospital Karachi. The police surgeon said most of the deaths occurred due to injuries to the head.
“Some victims were brought with crush injuries while others had multiple wounds,” Dr Summaiya said.
Soldier Bazaar Station House Officer Rizwan Patel said that a first information report of the incident had not yet been registered. He said legal proceedings would be initiated under the directives of higher authorities.
Meanwhile, Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh told Dawn that the search and rescue operation had been completed.
Speaking to the media, COO Shaikh had confirmed that a gas explosion was the cause of the structure’s partial collapse.
He noted that the ground plus two-floor structure had small rooms, and the limited space made the rescue operation challenging.
“This is not a legal building, and the structure is made of individual rooms,” said the senior rescue official, adding that the collapse also damaged surrounding structures.
CM takes notice; temporary rehabilitation ordered
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and expressed sorrow and grief over the loss of lives, said a statement released by the CM House.
The statement added that Murad directed the relevant authorities to “immediately rescue people trapped under the debris” and provide the victims with the “best possible” medical assistance.
Murad also ordered that all possible support be provided to the affected families and instructed the Karachi commissioner to investigate the cause of the incident.







Adviser to CM for Rehabilitation Giyan Chand Essrani, as per a statement from his office, sought reports from Rescue 1122 and the relevant departments over the incident.
“The Rehabilitation Department’s teams are present at the site of the incident to provide immediate relief, temporary accommodation and basic necessities to the affected families,” Essrani said.
He affirmed that his department was working under a “comprehensive plan to provide complete rehabilitation, mental health assistance and necessary facilities” to the affected families.
“The temporary rehabilitation and safe relocation of the affected building’s occupants and nearby residents should be ensured,” Essrani stated.

Condolences
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in their separate statements, expressed their deep grief over the loss of lives in the incident.
In a statement reported by state-run APP, President Zardari conveyed his sympathies to the families of the deceased and directed the relevant authorities to extend the best possible medical care to those injured.
Also directing the acceleration of the rescue operation, the president asked the Sindh government to inspect buildings, ensure the safety of gas cylinders, and strictly enforce building codes.
He said that the provincial government should conduct a thorough investigation into every aspect of the incident and take measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.







In his statement, PM Shehbaz offered condolences to the bereaved families and prayed for the speedy recovery of those wounded.
He directed the authorities concerned to provide all possible medical assistance to the injured.







PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also offered condolences to the families of the deceased, as per a statement issued via PPP’s media cell.
Bilawal stressed the need for effective measures to prevent such incidents in the future, the statement added.







Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also expressed grief over the incident. He directed authorities to accelerate the pace of rescue efforts and ensure proper medical care for the injured citizens, said a statement from the minister’s office.
“All updates and details of the relief work should be regularly reported, the home minister directed,” added the statement.
Conveying his condolences, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said the provincial government shared the grief of the bereaved families.
He urged citizens to be cautious while using gas and to immediately contact the relevant authorities if they suspected a gas leakage.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab also expressed his condolences over the gas explosion, assuring the affected people of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) support.
Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.
But Karachi, home to more than 20m, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.
In July 2025, at least 27 people died and 10 others were injured after a five-storey building collapsed in the Lyari area of the metropolis.
The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure.
In a statement back then, the Sindh Building Control Authority had noted that 588 buildings had been declared dangerous throughout Karachi.
A month later, four workers of the Awami National Party (ANP) were injured, with one of them suffering severe burn wounds, when a gas explosion caused the collapse of their office in Orangi Town.
In June 2024, following the death of 27 persons, including 19 children, in an explosion in a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder filling shop in Hyderabad, the Sindh government had decided to shift all such facilities from residential areas.</p><small>2026-02-19 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19175617dfa01fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974368/pmdc-takes-notice-of-students-death-at-fatima-jinnah-medical-university-advises-varsities-to-hire-mental-health-professionals' target='_blank'><strong>PMDC takes notice of student’s death at Fatima Jinnah Medical University, advises varsities to hire mental health professionals</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) on Thursday took notice of the alleged death by suicide of a medical student from Lahore’s Fatima Jinnah Medical University (FJMU) and sought a report.
Moreover, observing the lack of strengthened student support systems, the council also advised all medical and dental colleges to hire qualified counsellors/psychologists to provide timely guidance, and mental and physical health support to students in distress.
On Tuesday night, a 22-year-old female student allegedly died by suicide after jumping from the fourth floor of a hostel at FJMU. The student in question was a resident of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and was living in the varsity’s government hostel in Lahore.
On Thursday, a letter from the PMDC registrar to the FJMU principal, available with Dawn, stated that in light of the seriousness of the incident and its impact on the student community, the council was directing the college to share a factual account of the incident so that the medical body may remain informed and, if necessary, extend any appropriate support or guidance.
The PMDC directed the principal to share details within seven days; these included the date, time, and brief circumstances of the incident as per institutional records; details of any inquiry or fact-finding committee constituted, including its composition and terms of reference; any initial findings and/or the expected timeline for completion of the committee’s report; steps already taken or planned to strengthen student mental health support and counselling services; and safety measures in the hostel following the unfortunate event.
The letter stated that medical and dental students represented the brightest and most valuable segment of the nation’s future healthcare workforce.
“Incidents of this nature are deeply alarming and highlight the urgent need to strengthen student support systems in medical and dental institutions. The PMDC focuses on protecting and safeguarding the physical and mental well-being of students and ensuring that educational environments remain supportive, safe, and responsive to student needs,” it stated.
Moreover, the PMDC advised all medical and dental colleges to hire qualified counsellors/psychologists to provide timely guidance and mental and physical health support to students in distress. It also advised universities to establish effective student support mechanisms, including confidential counselling services and maintain vigilant monitoring of student wellbeing, with special attention to signs of psychological stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout.
It reiterated that proactive mental health support and timely counselling could play a critical role in preventing such incidents and in protecting the precious lives and future of students.
In January, a student at a private university in Lahore had attempted suicide by jumping from the second floor. A month earlier, a male student at the same university had also ended his life by jumping from the varsity’s fourth floor.</p><small>2026-02-19 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19150658a074934.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974361/police-arrest-king-charles-brother-andrew-over-misconduct-relating-to-epstein' target='_blank'><strong>Police arrest King Charles’ brother Andrew over misconduct relating to Epstein</strong></a><br><p>King Charles’ younger brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein.
Mountbatten-Windsor, celebrating his 66th birthday on Thursday, was arrested and questioned by detectives from Thames Valley Police, which this month said it was looking into allegations that he had passed documents to the late convicted sex offender while working as a trade envoy.
“Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement.
“We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”
The former prince, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, who is in police custody, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and said he regrets their friendship.
But he has not responded to requests for comment since the latest mass release of documents by the US government.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
He becomes the first senior royal to have been arrested in this manner, and presents his elder brother with the biggest scandal of his reign.
“I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” King Charles said in a statement, adding the authorities had the royals’ “full and wholehearted support and cooperation”.
“Let me state clearly: the law must take its course. As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.”
Unmarked police cars
British media published pictures of six unmarked police cars and around eight plain-clothed officers who arrived at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in eastern England, where Mountbatten-Windsor now lives.
Thames Valley Police said officers were also searching a property in Berkshire, where the royal used to live on the king’s Windsor estate until he was forced out amid anger at the Epstein revelations.
While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the royal is suspected of involvement in an offence, it does not imply guilt.
A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which only deals with the most serious criminal offences.
In 2022, the former prince settled a civil lawsuit brought in the United States by the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager.
The police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety.
The former prince was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and was then stripped by his older brother of his titles and honours last October amid further revelations about their relationship.
Epstein files triggered fresh complaint to police
Mountbatten-Windsor had been reported to police by the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic following the release of more than 3 million pages of documents relating to Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.
Those files suggested Mountbatten-Windsor had, in 2010, forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on official trips.
Thames Valley Police and the Crown Prosecution Service have previously said that they were in discussions about the case. Police said allegations of misconduct in public office, which is a ‘Common Law’ offence and so is not covered by written statute legislation, involved “particular complexities”.
Were Mountbatten-Windsor to ultimately face criminal charges, he would join a very small group of senior British royals who have formally been accused of offences.
His elder sister, Princess Anne, was fined for speeding in 2001, and the following year became the first royal to be convicted of a criminal offence in 350 years when she appeared in court to plead guilty to failing to stop one of her dogs, named Dotty, biting two children.
King Charles I was tried for treason in 1649, towards the end of the English Civil War, found guilty and beheaded.
The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking.
Republic has also reported him over allegations that he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010. Thames Valley Police said the force was assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently.
Buckingham Palace has previously said it was ready to support any police investigation, saying the king had expressed “profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct”.
“Their majesties’ thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse,” the palace said.
Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also called for a police investigation into the extent of Epstein trafficking women without proper checks by the authorities through London’s Stansted Airport, saying this had been overlooked by previous inquiries into Mountbatten-Windsor.
Essex police said on Wednesday it was looking into the issue.</p><small>2026-02-19 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19173543ab1d33a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974371/australian-police-probe-threatening-letter-to-countrys-largest-mosque-ahead-of-ramazan' target='_blank'><strong>Australian police probe threatening letter to country’s largest mosque ahead of Ramazan</strong></a><br><p>Australian police said on Thursday they had launched an investigation after a threatening letter was sent to the country’s largest mosque, the third such incident in the lead-up to Ramazan.
The letter sent to Lakemba Mosque in Sydney’s west on Wednesday contained a drawing of a pig and a threat to kill the “Muslim race”, local media reported.
Police said they had taken the letter for forensic testing and would continue to patrol religious sites, including the mosque, as well as community events.
The latest letter comes weeks after a similar message was mailed to the mosque, depicting Muslims inside a mosque on fire.
Police have also arrested and charged a 70-year-old man in connection with a third threatening letter sent to Lakemba Mosque’s staff in January.
The Lebanese Muslim Association, which runs the mosque, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) it had written to the government to request more funding for additional security guards and CCTV cameras.
Some 5,000 people are expected to attend the mosque each night during Ramazan. More than 60 per cent of residents in the suburb of Lakemba identify as Muslim, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
Bilal El-Hayek, mayor of Canterbury-Bankstown council, where Lakemba is located, said the community was feeling “very anxious”.
“I’ve heard first-hand from people saying that they won’t be sending their kids to practice this Ramazan because they’re very concerned about things that might happen in local mosques,” he said.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the recent string of threats.
“It is outrageous that people just going about commemorating their faith, particularly during the holy month for Muslims of Ramazan, are subject to this sort of intimidation,” he told ABC radio.
“I have said repeatedly we need to turn down the temperature of political discourse in this country, and we certainly need to do that,” he said.
Anti-Muslim sentiment has been growing in Australia since the beginning of Israeli onslaught in Gaza in late 2023, according to a recent report commissioned by the government.
The Islamophobia Register Australia has also documented a 740pc rise in reports following the Bondi mass shooting on December 14, where authorities allege two gunmen inspired by the militant Islamic State killed 15 people attending a Jewish holiday celebration.
“There’s been a massive increase post-Bondi,” Mayor El-Hayek said. “Without a doubt, this is the worst I have ever seen it. There’s a lot of tension out there.”</p><small>2026-02-19 12:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/191620026bc2f27.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974367/pti-says-govts-silence-lack-of-clarity-over-imrans-health-only-adding-to-public-unease' target='_blank'><strong>PTI says govt’s silence, lack of clarity over Imran’s health only adding to public unease</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Thursday once again voiced concerns regarding party founder Imran Khan’s health, taking exception to the government’s alleged “silence and lack of clarity” over the matter.
The incarcerated ex-prime minister’s family and party have been raising concerns about his health since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
In a statement on X, the PTI expressed “profound concern over the growing anxiety spreading among the nation regarding” Imran’s health.
“Any ambiguity surrounding the health of a leader who commands the confidence of millions is unacceptable. The government’s silence and lack of clarity have only intensified public unease rather than alleviating it,” the PTI contended.

 

“This is not merely a political matter; it is a test of national trust, human rights, and the government’s responsibility,” the party asserted.
Stating that “any uncertainty regarding his health and safety is intolerable”, it stressed that if the government had nothing to conceal, then there was no justification for “delaying full transparency”.
The party reiterated its demand that Imran’s personal physicians be granted “immediate and unrestricted access so they may conduct all necessary medical examinations, including blood tests and any other required diagnostic procedures”.
“Should any scans or specialised evaluations be needed, he must be permitted to be taken to a hospital or diagnostic centre of their choosing,” the PTI demanded.
It added: “It is the government’s responsibility to provide the nation with clear, verified, and unambiguous medical facts.
“A significant amount of time has already been wasted regarding concerns over Imran Khan’s health,” it insisted, adding that no further delay would be acceptable.







Family members and senior party leaders have repeatedly attempted to meet him at Adiala jail in recent weeks, but most visits have been blocked by authorities.
The SC’s intervention on February 10 allowed PTI lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Imran, with the ex-premier telling the counsel he had “15 per cent” vision left in his right eye. This came after it emerged that Imran underwent a medical procedure on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
A report prepared by a medical board formed by the government that visited Imran on February 15 stated that, unaided, the ex-premier’s right eye had 6/24 partial vision and 6/9 in the left. It said that with glasses, the ex-premier’s vision was 6/9 partial in the right and 6/6 in the left.

 

The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which had staged a six-day sit-in at Parliament House over Imran’s health, also doubled down on its earlier demands on Friday.
These included Imran’s “complete and confidential access” to his personal physicians Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan and copies of his medical tests and diagnostic reports.
Dr Yusuf and Dr Sultan have previously said multiple times that the ex-premier needed a comprehensive medical check-up that could be provided at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad.







Imran’s son thanks ex-cricket captains for humanitarian appeal for jailed father
Meanwhile, Imran’s son Kasim thanked former cricket captains, who issued a humanitarian appeal for his incarcerated father.
In a post on X, he said, “I’m incredibly grateful to all the Test captains who’ve called for fair treatment for my father. It’s heartening to see support from these legends of the game.”







The remarks came in response to an article by England’s Mike Atherton in The Times about the appeal for Imran.
On Tuesday, fourteen former international cricket captains, including Atherton and India’s Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, had called for better prison treatment for Imran.
Former Australia captain Greg Chappell, his brother Ian Chappell and compatriots Allan Border, Steve Waugh, Belinda Clark and Kim Hughes signed the petition.
England’s Nasser Hussain, Mike Brearley and David Gower had also signed, alongside Clive Lloyd from the West Indies and John Wright from New Zealand. The campaign was led by Chappell, a former Australian captain and contemporary of Imran
“As fellow cricketers who understand the values of fair play, honour, and respect that transcend the boundary rope, we believe that a person of Imran Khan’s stature deserves to be treated with the dignity and basic human consideration befitting a former national leader and a global sporting icon,” the appeal said.</p><small>2026-02-19 12:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19141908f89c5f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974357/govt-compensates-families-of-victims-of-islamabad-imambargah-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Govt compensates families of victims of Islamabad imambargah attack</strong></a><br><p>The government is paying compensation totaling more than Rs190 million to the families of 40 people killed in a suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad this month, the Prime Minister’s Office said on Thursday.
The February 6 attack, claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, on the outskirts of the capital was the deadliest in Islamabad since a 2008 truck bombing that killed 60 people at the Marriott Hotel.
“Relief cheques have been delivered to the heirs of 36 martyrs belonging to Islamabad,” PMO said in a statement, adding each victim’s family received Rs5m.
Cheques will also be delivered to four families of victims living outside Islamabad, the statement said.
Although officials have not released a final death toll, the statement marked the first official acknowledgement that 40 people were killed in the blast.
On Feb 11, PM Shehbaz had announced compensation for those martyred and injured in the suicide attack while visiting the site of the attack.
Speaking on the occasion, he said, “These terrorists have no religion, and they have crossed all the limits of cruelty.”
The suicide attack occurred during Friday prayers. The last major attack in Islamabad took place in November when a suicide blast outside a court killed 12 people and wounded dozens, the first such incident to hit the capital in nearly three years.

Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that the government was paying compensation totaling more than Rs19 million. It is, in fac,t paying more than Rs190 million in compensation.

On February 12, PM Shehbaz had announced a Rs38bn Ramazan relief package, which would benefit more than 12 million families — around 36m people — through direct digital payments.
In a post on X, the finance ministry said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurengzeb remotely chaired a meeting of the ECC.
The post said that the ECC approved the “immediate release” of Rs19bn for the prime minister’s package to “ensure timely disbursement of assistance to vulnerable families”.
“The remaining requirement out of the proposed Rs25bn will be released as and when necessary, in line with fiscal space,” the ministry said.







“The prime minister’s Ramazan relief package 2026 is designed to provide targeted cash assistance to low-income households during the holy month, using National Socio-Economic Registry data to ensure transparency and objective beneficiary selection,” the finance ministry said.
It added that the “funds will be disbursed directly through formal banking and digital channels to ensure secure, efficient and dignified delivery”.
The ministry further said that during the meeting, the ECC also granted “in-principle approval for Rs1bn operational expenses, directing that detailed cost breakdowns be shared with the Finance Division to ensure transparency, fiscal prudence, and compliance with financial rules”.
It stressed “balancing swift relief delivery with strong financial oversight” and further noted that “any unutilised funds would be surrendered in accordance with established procedures”.</p><small>2026-02-19 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/191501553c16211.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974359/substance-recovered-from-matiullah-jan-not-ice-ihc-told-during-hearing-of-narcotics-and-terrorism-case-against-journalist' target='_blank'><strong>Substance recovered from Matiullah Jan not ‘ice’, IHC told during hearing of narcotics and terrorism case against journalist</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a dramatic development in the narcotics and terrorism case against senior journalist Matiullah Jan, a forensic report submitted to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday revealed that the substance allegedly recovered from him was not a prohibited drug.
The case — registered at Margalla Police Station on Nov 28, 2024 — had accused the journalist of snatching a government-issued rifle, hitting a vehicle at a police barrier and possessing narcotics.
Initiation of legal proceedings against Jan drew strong criticism from journalist bodies and rights groups, who maintained that he was being targeted for investigating reports of alleged deaths during law enforcement action against PTI protesters in November 2024.
On Thursday, a division bench comprising Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the matter in a packed IHC courtroom. During the hearing, the Islamabad police placed on record a laboratory report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency.
According to the forensic analysis, the material allegedly recovered from the journalist did not contain methamphetamine — commonly known as “ice”.

 

The courtroom was filled with members of the legal fraternity, political workers and journalists expressing solidarity with Jan.
When former senator Farhatullah Babar was spotted in the courtroom, Justice Tahir inquired about his presence. Babar responded that he had come to show support for the senior journalist.
Advocate Rai Hanif Rahi informed the bench that lawyers had appeared in solidarity, while journalist Saqib Bashir submitted that the case had been pursued “as if Matiullah Jan were a drug dealer”.
The advocate further apprised the court that the matter had been fixed before the trial court for framing of charges.
Observing that the forensic findings carried significant legal implications, the bench questioned whether narcotics-related charges could be sustained in the absence of a prohibited substance.
The judges remarked that an appropriate order would be passed and subsequently referred the matter back to the trial court for further proceedings.
A day ago, an Islamabad ATC had rejected Jan’s application challenging the jurisdiction of the court and fixed February 19 (today) as the date for framing of charges.
‘Allegations proven false’
In a post on X after the hearing, Jan said the allegations against him of “smuggling narcotics have been proven false”.
He highlighted that the PFSA report presented before the court “revealed that the substance allegedly recovered from me was not narcotics or ice”.
According to the journalist, the IHC bench asked the prosecution counsel how charges could be framed against Jan in light of the lab report. The court then referred the case to the trial court and directed the state to submit a supplementary charge-sheet, he added.
“On this occasion, in my legal team, I am first grateful to Advocate Imaan Mazari and Advocate Hadi for giving me their full support, who stood by me fully from my arrest until the case was made,” Jan said.

 

“May Allah Almighty grant them release,” he added, referring to the lawyer couple who were convicted in January over controversial social media posts, with their sentencing sparking outrage among rights bodies.
“After that, my current legal team — Advocate Ali Ashfaq, Barrister Abdul Qadeer, Barrister Ahad, Advocate Fayyaz, and my younger brother Advocate Shahid Akbar Abbasi — gave me their full support from the trial to the high court and are still standing with me,” Jan said.
He stated that Barrister Qadeer was representing him in the IHC.
“Finally, thanks to those government and non-government politicians who, immediately after the registration of this fake case, openly declared it wrong and fabricated. By the way, thanks to the lab folks too,” he jested.







The case
On Nov 28, 2024, Jan’s son had posted on X about his father being “abducted from the parking” of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad by “unmarked abductors in an unmarked vehicle”.
Authorities later the same day confirmed he had been booked in a first information report (FIR), which claimed that Jan was found possessing 246 grams of narcotic methamphetamine (crystal meth) when his vehicle was stopped at E-9 in the federal capital. The case was registered at 3:20am, nearly an hour after the alleged incident took place.
Jan was initially sent on a two-day physical remand in police custody by an Islamabad Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC). However, the next day, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) overturned that decision and sent him to judicial custody.
On Nov 30, 2024, the journalist was granted bail by the ATC and subsequently released from the Adiala jail.

 

On Oct 31, 2025 — the day Jan was set to be indicted — an ATC issued a notice to police on the journalist’s application for the provision of case documents.
The FIR invoked Control of Narcotic Substances Act (CNSA) 1997’s Section 9(2)4, which specifies the punishment for possessing or trafficking “more than 100g and up to 500g” of psychotropic substance.
The FIR also invoked Sections 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 as well as Sections 186 (obstructing public servant), 279 (Rash driving or riding on a public way), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs50) and 506ii (threat to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Pakistan Penal Code.</p><small>2026-02-19 10:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19131236ec5090a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974353/demarche-issued-to-afghanistan-over-terror-attack-in-kps-bajaur' target='_blank'><strong>Demarche issued to Afghanistan over terror attack in KP’s Bajaur</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan issued a demarche to the Taliban regime over the use of Afghan soil for a terrorist attack on security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur that martyred 11 soldiers, it emerged on Thursday.
According to a press release by the Foreign Office (FO), the demarche was issued on Wednesday afternoon when the FO summoned the Afghan deputy head of mission.
“Pakistan condemned in the strongest possible terms the vehicle-borne suicide terrorist attack followed by a fire raid on Pakistan military and law enforcement agencies’ posts in Bajaur, carried out by Fitna al Khawarij [or] the TTP,” the statement said.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The FO expressed concern that the group, whose entire leadership is based in Afghanistan, “operates with impunity from Afghan soil”.
It re-emphasised that Pakistan had received repeated assurances from the Afghan Taliban regime, “but, regrettably, with no visible or concrete actions”.
“The Afghan Taliban regime has been told to take immediate, concrete and verifiable measures against all terror groups operating from its territory, including their leadership,” the press release said.
The ministry also “categorically informed” the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan “reserved the right to respond and eliminate any khawarij belonging to the group as well as their affiliates”, wherever they were located, “to ensure [the] safety of its soldiers, civilians and territorial boundaries”.
It is worth mentioning that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Wednesday that Islamabad will not hesitate to launch air operations inside Afghanistan to combat militancy, characterising the current regional instability as the “price we are paying” for decisions made during the 1980s and after Sept 11 terrorist attacks.
Speaking during a visit to Berlin, Asif accused the Afghan Taliban regime of conducting a “proxy war” alongside India against Pakistani interests and said military action would remain on the table until Kabul offered meaningful “assurances of peace”, according to a BBC report.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), a terror attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in Bajaur martyred 11 security personnel on Monday.
The statement added that 12 terrorists were eliminated after security forces retaliated and “engaged the fleeing khawarij with precision”.
President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack and extended condolences to the families of martyrs.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed sorrow at the loss of lives and condemned the attack in the “strongest terms”.
Pakistan had also issued a demarche to Afghanistan in late December, over its failure to rein in terrorist organisations ope­r­ating from Afghan soil, after a deadly attack on a military camp in North Waziristan.</p><small>2026-02-19 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651763-pakistan-issues-demarche-to-taliban-regime-over-terror-attack-in-kps-bajaur' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan issues demarche to Taliban regime over terror attack in KP's Bajaur</strong></a><br><p>

Gates’ absence, followed by another high-profile cancellation by Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, adds to a difficult opening for a summit billed as the first major artificial intelligence forum in the Global South, where India has sought to position itself as a leading voice in worldwide AI governance.
The Gates Foundation said the billionaire will not deliver his address “to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit’s key priorities”.
Only days ago, the foundation had dismissed rumours of his absence and insisted he was on track to attend.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for children’s safety on AI platforms as he addressed the gathering on Thursday, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei.
“We must be even more vigilant about children’s safety. Just as a school syllabus is curated, the AI space should also be child- and family-guided,” Modi said, after standing on stage with top AI executives and posing for photographs with their arms raised in a show of strength.
The photoshoot produced an awkward moment when Altman and Amodei, chiefs of rival AI firms OpenAI and Anthropic, stood side by side on stage but did not hold hands, although the other executives did.
India’s first major AI summit has been marred by organisational lapses that have left attendees shocked and angry over what they described as a lack of planning by the Indian government.
Chaos and traffic snarls
Gates’ cancellation comes after the US Department of Justice released emails last month that included communication between late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the Gates Foundation’s staff.
Gates has said the relationship was confined to philanthropy-related discussions and that it was a mistake for him to meet Epstein.
The summit exhibition halls were shut to the public on Thursday in a surprise move that led to more anger among participating companies that had put up stalls and pavilions. The venue compound was largely deserted after three days of large crowds at the event.
Indian university Galgotias was asked to vacate its stall after a staff member presented a commercially available robotic dog made in China as its own creation, sparking a public uproar.
Police repeatedly shut roads to give preference to VIP movement at the summit, creating chaos in the city of 20 million people. The Indian government has apologised for the inconvenience caused to attendees in the initial days.
But on Wednesday, footage on social media showed scores of attendees at the summit walking for miles in central Delhi as roads were shut, with no availability of taxis and no shuttle services arranged.
Opposition parties attacked the government and the prime minister for poorly managing the global summit.
“How can you expect your engineers, AI guys, to walk such distances…And then we complain that entrepreneurs are leaving India,” said Pawan Khera, the Congress party spokesperson.
Still, there has been more than $100 billion of investment in India AI projects pledged during the summit, including from the Adani Group conglomerate, tech giant Microsoft, and data centre firm Yotta.
The Indian government has said it expects total pledges to exceed $200bn in the next two years, although analysts have warned that the rapid build-out risks straining India’s power grid and water supply.</p><small>2026-02-19 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19122614e294c2b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974351/ihc-issues-notices-to-nccia-on-imaan-hadis-appeals-against-convictions-in-social-media-post-case' target='_blank'><strong>IHC issues notices to NCCIA on Imaan, Hadi’s appeals against convictions in social media post case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday issued notices to the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) on appeals filed by Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, against their conviction in the controversial tweets case.
Justice Muhammad Asif, who heard the appeals, also issued notices on the couple’s applications seeking suspension of their sentence and called for a response from the agency.
The IHC then adjourned further proceedings, observing that a date for the next hearing would be fixed.
On January 24, Imaan and Hadi were handed a total of 17 years in jail on multiple charges under the Prevention of Electr­onic Crimes Act (Peca) by a sessions court in Islamabad, sparking outrage among rights groups, opposition parties, and other segments of society.
The lawyer duo was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment under Peca’s Section 10 (cyberterrorism), five years’ jail under Section 9 (glorification of an offence) and two years in prison under Section 26-A (false and fake information).
All sentences will run concurrently.
Appearing on behalf of the appellants, senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui, along with Zainab Janjua and other members of the defence team, contended that the trial court announced its verdict while a transfer application was still pending before the IHC.
Siddiqui argued that two prosecution witnesses were examined in the absence of the accused and questioned the manner in which the trial judge subsequently expunged a paragraph from the judgment.

 

“Punishment may be awarded ten times over, but a fair trial must first be conducted,” Siddiqui contended, stressing that due process had been compromised.
Justice Asif remarked that notices were being issued and directed that the paper books be prepared.
Siddiqui requested an early date for the hearing of the suspension of sentence applications, pointing that he travelled from Karachi to appear before the court, and sought a Monday or Tuesday date.
The judge responded that an appropriate date would be fixed.
The IHC subsequently issued notices to the NCCIA and sought the agency’s reply before adjourning the matter.
On February 7, the couple had challenged the trial court’s order convicting them. In their appeals, the two contended that the impugned judgment was passed in blatant violation of settled legal principles and mandatory procedural requi­rements.
They argued that the trial court proceeded to pronounce the verdict despite the fact that an application seeking transfer of the case was pending adjudication before the IHC, rendering the decision “unlawful and without jurisdiction”.
Imaan and Chattha’s convictions had sparked concerns from the United Nations Human Rights Office, a team of UN special rapporteurs, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), and a European Union (EU) official.
The case
The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the NCCIA in Islamabad.
The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.

 

It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the banned outfits Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Judge Majoka indicted Imaan and Hadi on Oct 30, 2025 and then issued arrest warrants for the couple on Nov 5, 2025.
Later that month, a court-appointed lawyer for the couple refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.
Subsequently, they were appointed a new lawyer by the court. After multiple hearings and repeated non-appearances, the court cancelled their interim bail on January 14 and days later, reissued arrest warrants for them.
Later, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.</p><small>2026-02-19 08:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/191115575039f37.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974344/white-house-tells-iran-to-do-deal-as-trump-hints-at-us-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>White House tells Iran to do deal as Trump hints at US strikes</strong></a><br><p>The White House warned on Wednesday that Iran would be “wise” to do a deal with the United States as President Donald Trump once again hinted at military action.
The two sides recently resumed indirect talks, mediated by Oman, after Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
“Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with his administration,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.
On Wednesday, Trump again suggested the United States might strike Iran in a post on his Truth Social site, with a US military buildup underway in the Middle East.
He warned Britain against giving up sovereignty over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, saying that the archipelago’s Diego Garcia airbase might be needed were Iran not to agree a deal, “in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime”.
CNN and CBS reported on Wednesday that the US military will be ready to launch strikes against Iran as early as this weekend, though Trump has reportedly not made a final decision yet.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Trump has been briefed on his military options with “all of them designed to maximise damage”, including a campaign to “kill scores of Iranian political and military leaders, with the goal of overthrowing the government”, unnamed US officials told the newspaper.
Earlier on Wednesday, Tehran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran was “drafting” a framework for future talks with the US.
Iran and the US held a second round of Oman-mediated negotiations on Tuesday in Geneva.
Araghchi said then that Tehran had agreed with Washington on “guiding principles”, but US Vice President JD Vance said Iran had not yet acknowledged all of Washington’s red lines.
‘Do not want war’
Speaking on Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted “we do not want war” but suggested Tehran could not give in to US demands.
“From the day I took office, I have believed that war must be set aside.
But if they are going to try to impose their will on us, humiliate us and demand that we bow our heads at any cost, should we accept that?”
Earlier on Wednesday, Araghchi held a phone call with Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
In the call, the Iranian foreign minister “stressed the Islamic Republic of Iran’s focus on drafting an initial and coherent framework to advance future talks”, according to a statement from his ministry.







Tehran has suspended some cooperation with the IAEA and restricted the watchdog’s inspectors from accessing sites bombed by Israel and the United States, accusing the UN body of bias and of failing to condemn the strikes.
Meanwhile, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned that Washington would deter Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons “one way or the other”.
“They’ve been very clear about what they would do with nuclear weapons.
It’s entirely unacceptable,” Wright told reporters in Paris on the sidelines of meetings of the International Energy Agency.
Displays of military might
The Omani-mediated talks were aimed at averting the possibility of US military action, while Tehran is demanding the lifting of US sanctions that are crippling its economy.
Iran has insisted that the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for Tehran’s ballistic missiles programme and support for armed groups in the region to be on the table.
While talks have resumed, the US has also been building up its military forces near Iran.
Washington has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed.
Iran has sought to display its own military might, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps beginning a series of war games on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz.
Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a major global conduit for oil and gas.
On Tuesday, state TV reported that Tehran would close parts of the waterway for safety measures during the drills.</p><small>2026-02-19 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/191210182e2f8a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974349/pakistan-extends-airspace-closure-for-indian-aircraft-until-march-23' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan extends airspace closure for Indian aircraft until March 23</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Wednesday extended the airspace restrictions on Indian aircraft till March 23.
The airspace will remain closed for all Indian civil and military registered aircraft till March 23, the Pakistan Airport Authority (PAA) said in a new notice to airmen (Notam) issued today.
Pakistan’s airspace is divided into two flight information regions (FIRs) — Karachi and Lahore, according to a Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) document from 2022. The Notam applies to both the Karachi (OPKR) and Lahore (OPLR) FIRs.
India and Pakistan have closed their airspaces to each other’s airlines since tensions between them escalated in late April 2025 in the wake of an attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.
New Delhi, without evidence, had alleged that Islamabad backed the attack. Pakistan strongly denied any involvement and offered a neutral probe. Then, in early May, the nuclear-armed nations fought their fiercest military conflict in decades. Pakistan says it downed seven Indian jets during the conflict.
Amid a financial toll from a ban on Indian carriers flying over Pakistan, it was reported in November that Air India was lobbying the Indian government to convince China to let it use a sensitive military airspace zone in Xinjiang to shorten routes.</p><small>2026-02-19 07:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651724-imaan-mazari-hadi-ali-chattha-granted-bail-in-police-scuffle-case' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari, Hadi Ali Chattha granted bail in police scuffle case</strong></a><br><p>

Six survivors were rescued after search teams on skis fought through blinding snow, darkness, treacherous terrain and gale-force winds to reach them in the rugged Castle Peak area near Truckee, California, about 10 miles (16km) north-west of Lake Tahoe.


A rescue team departs to the site of an avalanche in a backcountry slope of California’s Sierra Nevada mountains, where a group of skiers were stranded, in Nevada County, California, U.S. February 17, 2026. —Reuters

The group of 15 skiers, including four guides from outfitter Blackbird Mountain Guides, was heading back to a trailhead in heavy snow after a three-day excursion when the avalanche struck around 11:30am PT on Tuesday.
The surviving skiers, who took refuge in a makeshift shelter constructed partly from tarpaulin sheets after the avalanche, used emergency beacons and text messaging to communicate their location to rescuers.
One of the guides was among the survivors, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a press conference.
Two rescue teams totalling about 50 people were dispatched from the Boreal Mountain Ski Resort and the Tahoe Donner resort’s Alder Creek Adventure Centre and approached the avalanche zone from the south and north.
High risk of avalanche
The rescuers themselves faced life-threatening conditions, with the risk of further avalanches still high after a winter storm dropped several feet of fresh, unstable snow in recent days.
Responders were able to get within two miles (3.2km) of the avalanche site on a snowcat vehicle, then switched to skis to lessen the risk of triggering another deadly slide.
“Extreme weather conditions, I would say, is an understatement,” said Moon, whose office helped oversee the search mission.
An adjacent stretch of the US Interstate 80 highway had been closed during the rescue operation due to zero visibility from the storm.
Bodies of eight skiers were located but will be recovered at a later date when weather permits, while a ninth skier from the group remained missing and was presumed dead, authorities said.

One of the deceased skiers was the spouse of a search-and-rescue team member, authorities said. An injured skier was being treated in a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
The tour group, which included nine women and six men, had been staying at the Frog Lake Backcountry Huts near Donner Summit north-west of Truckee, at about 7,500 feet elevation (2,300 meters). The area is a popular destination for backcountry skiers.
In a typical winter, the mountain receives more than 400 inches (10.16 m) of snow, making it one of the snowiest places in the Western Hemisphere.
Moon said the storm and avalanche danger were predicted and her office was talking with the guide company about its decision to take people out.
The Sierra Avalanche Center extended the avalanche warning it issued on Tuesday, saying a “high” danger might continue throughout Wednesday.
Comparatively high casualty toll
Avalanches have claimed an average of 27 lives each winter in the United States over the past decade, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center, which tallied six US avalanche fatalities so far this season before Tuesday’s disaster.
One person was killed by an avalanche in the Frog Lake area in January.
Tuesday’s calamity was notable for its comparatively high casualty toll. It marked the greatest loss of life on record in the US from a single avalanche since a 1981 ice slide on Mount Rainier in Washington state killed 11 people as they were climbing the Ingraham Glacier, according to the Colorado centre’s director, Ethan Greene.

In 1982, seven people died in a massive avalanche that struck the Alpine Meadows ski resort in California, also near the north-western shore of Lake Tahoe.
Greene said it was far too soon to understand all the circumstances around the latest disaster but noted the heavy snowfall and avalanche dangers were “well forecast.”
Venturing out on skis in avalanche country in the midst of a major storm is “not something we would be advising people to do, especially in a guided group.”
He also said ski groups normally try to limit exposure to a particularly slide-prone section of terrain to no more than one skier at a time so that if one person becomes trapped in an avalanche, others in the group can work to quickly locate and dig out the victim.
Blackbird issued a statement on Tuesday saying it was working with authorities to support the rescue operation. The company referred questions to local authorities on Wednesday.
Blackbird was founded in 2020 and operates in California, Washington state and British Columbia in Canada as well as numerous popular skiing spots abroad, according to its website. The company provides guided ski trips, alpine climbing trips and avalanche education.</p><small>2026-02-19 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19100217d398d67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974341/no-leniency-attaullah-tarar-refutes-reports-of-deal-offered-to-pti-founder-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>‘No leniency’: Attaullah Tarar refutes reports of ‘deal’ offered to PTI founder Imran Khan</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday strongly rejected media speculations regarding any “deal” between the government and incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
In a statement shared on X, Tarar said, “There is neither any deal nor any leniency for Imran.”
He added that any impression of the government granting the ex-premier concessions was “entirely false and misleading”.







“Imran Khan is a criminal convicted by courts, and the reports about  leniency for him are baseless,” Tarar asserted.
“There is no truth in these reports.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and was months ago convicted in another case regarding state gifts. He also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
Tarar’s clarification follows recent statements made by Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah, wherein he said efforts were made to reach a solution, but Imran was not ready for “any deal”.
“He (Imran) is not ready for any deal,” Sanaullah said in an interview with ARY News aired on Wednesday.
“Two very serious efforts were made [and] not only is he not ready for a deal but his demands are such that the current government cannot fulfil them,” he added.
Sanaullah described the PTI founder as having a “non-political attitude” and being “stubborn”. “The way they (PTI supporters) say that he is standing tall,” he quipped.
According to the PML-N leader, “one serious effort” was made between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur in the aftermath of the November 2024 protests.

 

“On the second [effort], I cannot go into details more than this that some individuals had arrived from abroad,” Sanaullah said, adding that they “had links” with Imran.
“They also met with Imran Khan sahib, and as per my information, Imran Khan sahib first agreed with them, but then he stepped back from it.”
In January 2026, Sanaullah had said PTI leaders were seeking dialogue with the government but Imran opposed the move.



On Tuesday, Parliamentary Secretary Barrister Danyal Chaudhry also denied any kind of “deal” with Imran, claiming that the latter wanted a deal and concession since day one.
“We are also ready for talks, but we will not accept any blackmail in this regard. The only reason for sending Imran Khan abroad for treatment can be that, God forbid, he may be suffering from a life-threatening disease that cannot be treated here,” he had said.
His statement came amid concerns raised by the PTI about the party founder’s health after a report submitted to the Supreme Court quoted him as saying he had lost partial vision in his right eye due to an ailment.</p><small>2026-02-19 06:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651718-un-monitor-warns-75m-pakistanis-face-acute-food-insecurity-amid-floods-drought-and-violence' target='_blank'><strong>UN monitor warns 7.5m Pakistanis face acute food insecurity amid floods, drought, violence</strong></a><br><p>

It also submitted that the under-construction thoroughfares were excluded from e-ticketing system till the completion of development work and installation/upgradation of road infrastructure.  
The comments were filed on the behalf of deputy inspector general of police (traffic) in one of several identical petitions filed against implementation of e-challan system in Karachi.  
It further said that the provincial government had already provided relief by allowing 50 per cent discount if the challan was paid within 14 days and traffic courts were also being set up to ensure transparency.  
After taking the comments on record, a two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC headed by Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed adjourned the hearing till March 12 as a provincial law officer sought more time to file comments on the behalf of other respondents.  
Citing the chief secretary Sindh, secretary home department, excise and taxation department, inspector general of Sindh police, DIG traffic police and others as respondents, the petitioners asserted that the Al-based e-challan system was implemented in the city without ensuring necessary road infrastructure, vehicle ownership verification mechanism and other allied facilities.

The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) demanded a higher fuel cost on account of power consumed in January, even though almost 60 per cent of the power was generated from domestic, cheaper sources. Electricity consumption was reported to be around 12pc higher than the same month last year and 8pc higher than December 2025.
Once approved, the power companies would charge an additional amount of about Rs16bn to consumers of all the power companies, including ex-Wapda Distribution Companies (Discos) and K-Electric, in the billing month of March. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has called a public hearing on February 26 to examine the request for fuel cost adjustment (FCA).
The CPPA, which filed the petition for a higher FCA for January consumption, said the power consumption was around 12.1pc higher than the same month of the previous year and about 8pc higher than the previous month, December 2025. The power companies have claimed an average fuel cost of Rs12.18 per unit for January 2026, compared to Rs11.03 per unit of the same month of the previous year and almost Rs2.56 per unit higher than Rs9.62 per unit in December 2025.

CPPA demands higher fuel charges citing 12pc increase in demand

The CPPA reported that 8,762 billion units (gigawatt hours) of electricity were delivered to Discos in January.
The power companies have claimed that the average fuel cost amounted to Rs12.18 per unit in January, against a pre-approved reference fuel cost of Rs10.395 per unit. There is a need for an additional FCA of about Rs1.78 per unit.
The CPPA said about 9,140GWh of electricity was generated in January at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs106.4bn (Rs11.64 per unit), of which 8,762GWh of energy was delivered to Discos for Rs106.7bn (Rs12.18 per unit), leading to a higher fuel cost over what was already charged to consumers in December bills. Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG)- based power generation accounted for the largest share of the grid’s fuel, with almost 22pc.
This was followed by nuclear power with its 17.5pc share. Traditional hydropower generation dipped to just 8pc in the wake of the annual canal closure for maintenance. Third position was secured by imported coal, with a 17.28pc share, followed by local coal with a 15.4pc share.
The share of local gas-based generation stood at 12pc in January, up from 11pc in December. Furnace oil-based generation revived to 3pc, although the fuel has been officially phased out.
Furnace oil-based generation was the most expensive at Rs33.55 per unit, followed by Rs20 per unit from RLNG, Rs13.5 per unit from imported coal, Rs12.74 per unit from local gas, and Rs11.63 per unit from local coal. There was no power generation from high-speed diesel.
The nuclear fuel cost amounted to Rs2.23 per unit in January. The three renewable energy sources — wind, bagasse and solar — together contributed a 4.55pc share to the grid. Wind and solar have no fuel costs, while bagasse-based plants had a fuel cost of Rs10.39 per unit, with just 1.11pc contribution to the grid. Electricity imports from Iran accounted for 0.38pc of the total, with a fuel cost of Rs22.06 per unit.

Headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, a three-judge bench that had taken up a number of cases moved by the PTI founder.
National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Barrister Ali Zafar and others were present inside Courtroom No. 2.
During the hearing, Justice Salahuddin Panwhar wondered why the petitioner had not challenged the ECP notification, which had disqualified him. Justice Kakar observed that it would be better to summon the ECP to explain the disqualification.

Apex court adjourns proceedings in cipher, defamation cases against PTI chief

Sardar Latif Khosa argued that in the concealment of assets case, the sentence awarded to the petitioner was suspended, but not the judgement. Justice Kakar reminded the counsel that he had only requested the Islamabad High Court to suspend the sentence and the high court had granted him the relief.
Mr Khosa contended that he wanted to cite 2019 Nasir Mehmood case in which the SC had held that suspension of sentence would have the same consequence as the suspension of the judgement.
Prosecutor General Islamabad Sarwar Nahang, however, said that the suspension of the sentence and suspension of the conviction were two different things.
Despite reluctance by Mr Khosa, the court asked the counsel to read the particular paragraph from the 2019 judgement, wherein it was held by the SC that unless the conviction was specifically suspended or the appeal was ultimately allowed and conviction as well as sentence were set aside, the conviction of the appellant would continue to hold the field and the disqualification would remain intact.
Justice Kakar observed that the counsel, by invoking a citation against his case, had blocked the way the court was considering to provide relief. “It seems your eyesight has become weak,” Justice Kakar quipped. He added that another way was to listen to the ECP’s point of view to know why the petitioner was disqualified.
The SC then postponed the proceedings for an indefinite period.
The same bench adjourned further proceedings in the cipher case against PTI’s Shah Mehmood Qur­e­shi when Special Prosecutor Zulf­ikar Naqvi sought time to furnish a detailed judgement in the case.
Moreover, referring to a set of appeals against the interim orders in the defamation case, which was mov­ed by PM Shehbaz Sharif aga­i­nst Mr Khan, the court adjourned the proceedings until after Ramazan.
Published in Dawn, February 19th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-19 02:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974290/terrorism-spiral' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorism spiral</strong></a><br><p>WITH a spate of terrorist attacks occurring in the country, a national-level response is required to address the issue. The latest atrocity has occurred in Bajaur, where a suicide bomber reportedly belonging to the banned TTP attacked a checkpost in Bajaur on Monday. At least 12 people were martyred in the incident — 11 security personnel and one minor girl. Meanwhile, on the same day, a motorcycle rigged with explosives was blown up outside a police station in Bannu, causing two fatalities. Furthermore, law enforcers said on Wednesday that terrorists attacked a police station and a customs office in Dera Ismail Khan, martyring a policeman and a customs officer. They added that the terrorists also fired at passenger buses in the area. Several acts of deadly violence have occurred in this area over the past few weeks.
Following the Bajaur attack, the prime minister commented that “under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security forces are gaining major success in the fight against terrorism”. While that may be so, Pakistan continues to pay a high price as it loses security personnel and civilians in frequent terrorist attacks. For example, apart from the latest violence in KP, an imambargah in Islamabad was attacked earlier this month causing major casualties, while only days before the atrocity in the capital terrorists had launched coordinated attacks in Balochistan. Unless the state takes a fresh approach towards terrorism, we may see the same high levels of violence in the current year as we did in 2025. Last year was said to be the bloodiest in over a decade. The threats may be varied — separatist terrorists in Balochistan, religiously inspired elements in KP — but the response must ensure that all violent elements are neutralised, and the state is able to establish peace in the disturbed areas. There has been some welcome recent cooperation between the KP government — which remains the hardest hit province — and the centre in the field of counterterrorism; such efforts must be intensified. A whole-of-nation approach is needed, applying kinetic measures where required, conducting intel-based operations as well as sociopolitical interventions as needed, to defeat terrorism. The federal and provincial governments, lawmakers and the security apparatus, along with CT experts, must put their heads together to arrive at a solution that can bring lasting peace to Pakistan.
