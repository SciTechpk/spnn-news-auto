Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabeehullah Mujahid said in a post on X: “The sound of an explosion was heard in the city of Kabul. However, no one should worry, it is all well and good, the investigation of the incident is underway, no report of any damage has been given so far.”
 






Sources reported a Land Cruiser vehicle was apparently hit in the area of Abdul Haq Square in Kabul.
Afghan media outlet Tolo News reported that, according to locals, the Abdul Haq intersection was closed, resulting in widespread traffic congestion in the area.
AFP journalists reported that two explosions were heard in the capital. The two blasts occurred around 9:50pm local time (10:20 PKT). In the streets of the Afghan capital, numerous security forces were alerted and were searching cars, an AFP journalist saw. Mobile telephone service was down in several neighborhoods.</p><small>2025-10-09 19:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627850-two-explosions-rock-afghanistans-kabul' target='_blank'><strong>Two explosions rock Afghanistan's Kabul</strong></a><br><p>

Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a similar warning in the National Assembly about going after terrorist facilitators “wherever they are”.
The government’s warning came a day after a lieutenant colonel and a major, among 11 security personnel, were martyred in an exchange of fire with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan terrorist group in the Orakzai district.
In his opening remarks during today’s federal cabinet meeting, PM Shehbaz paid tribute to army officers and soldiers involved in conducting operations against terrorists.
He said facilitators were protecting terrorists who were coming from across the border. The premier stressed that the situation had reached a critical point and terrorists would not be spared.
 


PM Shehbaz added that the government’s achievements on the economic and diplomatic fronts would come to naught if terrorism was not eliminated.
Meanwhile, Asif thundered that “enough is enough” and the facilitators of terrorism would have to pay, whether they were present on Pakistani or Afghan soil.
 


Asif reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to defend its territory and defeat terrorism through unity, determination.
He said that the issue of terrorism required a united approach beyond political or regional divisions. “Our focus should be on how to eliminate this menace of terrorism once and for all,’’ Asif added.
Expressing grief over the martyrdom of two officers and nine soldiers, Asif said their sacrifices called for national unity and collective resolve.
Recalling his visit to Afghanistan three years ago, the defence minister said he had raised the issue of cross-border terrorism directly with Afghan authorities. “We candidly told them that their soil was being used for terrorist activities in Pakistan,’’ he said.
The minister said Pakistan had urged Afghanistan to control the militants and dismantle their sanctuaries. ‘‘We asked them to shut down the safe havens and stop providing shelter or support to these groups.’’
The defence minister added that Afghan officials had demanded financial assistance, claiming that with such aid, they could relocate these groups to western provinces away from Pakistan’s border.
However, he said Pakistan had sought a firm guarantee that these militants would not return, a condition the Afghan authorities were unwilling to accept. ‘‘Due to the absence of that assurance, the proposal could not be finalized,’’ he added.
Asif also proposed urgent diplomatic action to curb cross-border terrorism, suggesting that a delegation be sent to Kabul within the next day or two to press Afghan authorities to dismantle safe havens being used against Pakistan.</p><small>2025-10-09 19:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09231917b962cb5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947717/modi-says-he-and-trump-in-call-reviewed-good-progress-in-trade-negotiations' target='_blank'><strong>Modi says he and Trump, in call, reviewed ‘good progress’ in trade negotiations</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he spoke to United States President Donald Trump on Thursday, adding that they “reviewed good progress achieved in trade negotiations” and agreed to stay in close touch over the coming weeks.
Indian commerce ministry officials have said that after the latest meetings of trade officials in Washington, another round of trade negotiations is expected soon in either country.
Trump imposed a 50 per cent tariff on most exports from India, among the highest for any US trading partner. The move impacts about $50 billion of Indian exports to the US, mainly hurting labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery and the shrimp industry.
The tariffs were doubled on Indian goods from 25pc due to New Delhi’s continued imports of Russian oil.
Washington earlier said India’s purchase of Russian oil helped fund Moscow’s war in Ukraine and that New Delhi also profits from it. India had rejected the accusation as a double standard, pointing to US and European trade links with Russia.
To offset the impact of tariffs, Modi cut taxes on everything from shampoos to cars last month in the biggest tax overhaul since 2017, even as India continues to spend aggressively on infrastructure projects.
About one-fifth of India’s total exports in 2024 went to the United States. The new tariffs affect about three-quarters of all Indian goods exported there.</p><small>2025-10-09 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0922550919c8f51.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947576/hamas-and-israel-sign-ceasefire-and-hostage-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas and Israel sign ceasefire and hostage deal</strong></a><br><p>Hamas and Israel signed an agreement on Thursday to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the conflict in Gaza.
Officials on both sides confirmed they had signed the deal following indirect talks in the Egyptian beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The deal’s announcement had been greeted with celebrations among Palestinians and Israelis alike.
The deal includes the release of captives and prisoners as well as a surge of aid into Gaza after more than two years of genocide after Tel Aviv started bombing the Palestinian enclave following Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the ceasefire would take effect once the agreement is ratified by his government, which would convene after a security cabinet meeting today.
An Israeli government spokeswoman, confirming the deal had been signed, said the ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting. After that 24-hour period, the captives held in Gaza will be freed within 72 hours, she said.
A source briefed on details of the agreement said earlier that Israeli troops would begin pulling back within 24 hours of the deal being signed.
An Israeli official said all 20 Israeli captives still believed to be alive in Gaza after being seized by Hamas would be released.
The prisoners released in exchange will not include Marwan Barghouti, one of the most prominent Palestinian prisoners, the spokeswoman said.
Trump said today that disarmament would be part of the second phase of a Gaza deal, with Israel insisting that Hamas must give up its weapons.
“I’m not going to talk about that because you sort of know what phase two is. But … there will be disarming,” Trump told reporters at a cabinet meeting, adding that there would also be “pullbacks” by Israeli forces.
He said he had no view regarding the possibility of a two-state solution and he would follow whatever was ultimately agreed on.
“I don’t have a view. I’m going to go with what they agreed to,” he told reporters. On what Palestinians can expect, he added: “We’re going to create something where people can live … We’re going to create better conditions for people.“
He said that the Gaza captives should be released on Monday or Tuesday and that he hopes to attend a signing ceremony in Egypt. Trump said he believed it will lead to “lasting peace”. “We are getting the hostages back on Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday, and that’ll be a day of joy,” Trump said.
Trump said under the plan Gaza is going to be “slowly redone”, a reference to plans to rebuild the Palestinian enclave. He did not provide details.
While questions remain about what happens in the region in the long term, Trump said he hoped it would lead to “an everlasting peace”.

Key developments

US President Trump says Hamas will release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line
Source says Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners
Trump thanks mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye; earlier said he may travel to Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”; says he thinks captives will probably be released on Monday


Hamas would release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line, Trump had said after talks in Egypt on his 20-point peace plan resulted in a deal.
Qatar had said the deal was the “first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid”.
Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase of a deal, a source within the group told AFP.
The exchange will take place within 72 hours of the implementation of the agreement, which is expected to be signed on Thursday, the source familiar with the negotiations said.
The captives will be released in exchange for 250 Palestinians sentenced to life imprisonment and 1,700 others arrested by Israel since the war began, the source added.
 
 

The Israeli military said that Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir instructed forces to prepare strong defenses and be ready for any scenario and to prepare to lead the operation for the captives’ return with sensitivity and professionalism, following the announcement of the Gaza ceasefire agreement
“I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump said on his Truth Social network.
“This means that ALL of the hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.”
Trump also thanked mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye, adding: “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!”
 






He also told Reuters that a Gaza hostages-for-ceasefire deal hammered out in Egypt represented “a great day for the world”.
“The whole world has come together on this one, Israel, every country has come together. This has been a fantastic day,” Trump told Reuters in a brief telephone interview.
“This is a great day for the world. This is a wonderful day, a wonderful day for everybody,” he said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring the Israeli captives home “with God’s help”.
 






In a separate post on X, he said: “With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home.”
“Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point,” he said, thanking the US president for “his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages”.
 






Trump said earlier that he may travel to the Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”.
In a dramatic moment, AFP journalists saw US Secretary of State Marco Rubio interrupt an event at the White House and hand Trump an urgent note about the progress of the negotiations in Egypt.
“I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday,” Trump said, adding that he was “most likely” to turn up in Egypt but would also consider going to war-torn Gaza.
 






Trump’s plan called for a ceasefire, the release of all the captives held in Gaza, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory.
Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived at the talks earlier.
An Israeli government spokesperson said the captives release was expected to begin on Saturday. Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News’ ‘Hannity’ programme on Wednesday that captives held in Gaza will probably be released on Monday.
 






‘Optimism prevails’
As night fell in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, an AFP contributor described an atmosphere of anticipation before the announcement, with joyful chants of “Allahu akbar”, and some celebratory gunfire into the air.
“We’re closely following every bit of news about the negotiations and the ceasefire,” said 50-year-old Mohammed Zamlot, who had been displaced from northern Gaza.
Hamas had submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants released from Israeli jails in the first phase of the truce.
 
 

In exchange, Hamas is set to free the remaining 47 captives, both alive and dead, who were seized in its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s intelligence chief were also expected at the talks on Wednesday.
Hamas said it would be joined by delegations from Islamic Jihad — which has also held some of the captives in Gaza — as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The negotiations were taking place under the shadow of the second anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed at least 67,183 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, figures the United Nations considers credible.
The territory’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas’s authority, said the bombardment of Gaza had not stopped in the hours before the deal. An AFP journalist in Israel near the Gaza border reported hearing multiple explosions in the morning.
Protests, prisoners
Global pressure to end the conflict has escalated, with much of Gaza flattened, a UN-declared famine unfolding and Israeli captive families still longing for their loved ones’ return.
One key to the negotiations was the names of the Palestinian prisoners Hamas pushed for.
High-profile inmate Marwan Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — is among those the group wanted to see released, according to Egyptian state-linked media.
Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, also said the group wants “guarantees from President Trump and the sponsor countries that the war will end once and for all”.
Arab countries say plan must lead to Palestinian state
The next phase of Trump’s plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British prime minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza’s post-war administration.
Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen.
There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007.
 
 

Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries.
It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza.
Global outrage has mounted against Israel’s assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel calls its actions self-defence after the 2023 Hamas attack.</p><small>2025-10-09 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/092203351be0b87.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947631/ex-senator-mushtaq-ahmad-khan-slams-muslim-nations-for-failure-to-act-during-gaza-genocide' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan slams Muslim nations for failure to act during Gaza genocide</strong></a><br><p>Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who was aboard the Gaza-bound Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) and imprisoned by Israel, criticised Muslim governments across the globe for not putting enough pressure on Israel or taking any action to prevent the ongoing genocide.
Khan led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel GSF, which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them. Khan was detained in Israel for five days before being deported to Jordan.
Appearing on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, the ex-senator slammed the federal government, as well as other Muslim governments, for failing to put pressure on Israel to stop its onslaught in the Gaza Strip. Khan also outlined his experience in Israeli captivity during the interview.
“What I want to ask is that if Sweden’s Greta [Thunberg] can lead the flotilla, then where are the Muslim countries?” he asked. “Why didn’t the people stand up? I am ashamed that 2 billion Muslims could not do anything.
“There were parliamentarians in jail with me. Where were Pakistan’s parliamentarians?”
Speaking about Pakistan’s role in the peace plan, specifically the meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Khan highlighted that the 20-point plan unveiled by United States President Donald Trump was a “project of slavery”.
“Since they (Israel) could not capture Gaza by force, they tried to capture it through negotiations. That 20-point plan was a slap in Hamas’ face,” he emphasised.
He highlighted that the Palestinian Authority’s involvement was also questionable, as they talked about Gaza “minus Hamas” at the UN General Assembly.
“The world order had failed; thus, civilians undertook the mission,” Khan said.
When asked about whether the Gaza peace plan would be successful, the ex-senator replied in the affirmative, adding that the people of Europe and their pressure on Israel would be a contributing factor and that they would be able to bring about a ceasefire.
“Most of the people in this flotilla, 80 per cent, were Europeans and non-Muslims,” Khan explained. When asked about why Europeans were so fervently campaigning for Palestine, the ex-senator explained that they are complicit in decades of oppression by a colonising force.
“On this flotilla, the Westerners decided that they would bring as many Jews on board as possible,” Khan said. “The goal was to show that Zionism is an enemy of humanity and exploits Judaism. The vast majority of Jews do not support Zionists.
“They would use the f-word when talking about Israel,” he added.
The ex-senator also hailed Swedish activist Greta Thunberg as a “hero of humanity” for standing up for the Palestinians.
“Greta … a young girl left the world shaken,” he added. “I will invite her to Pakistan.”
The senator also floated the idea of a new flotilla mission with participants from across the world, but under the leadership of international Islamic civil society members.
“We will make sure that we fly Pakistani flags from the boats,” he vowed. “If the peace plan fails, if a humanitarian corridor is not opened, if the genocide is not stopped and if the culprits of this genocide are not brought to justice, then we will launch our own flotilla ourselves.
Behind bars at Ktzi’ot Prison
Programme host Hamid Mir pointed out the ex-senator’s loss of weight, to which he replied that it was due to a mix of the journey through the Mediterranean and a three-day hunger strike in jail.
“It was a 20-day journey through the Mediterranean to Ashdod Port. We would eat once every 24 hours during the trip, and only ate salan (curry) twice,” Khan said. “There was bread and dates, that was all the food we ate.
“In the Israeli jail, we staged a three-day hunger strike. That contributed to my weight loss,” he added, calling the jail a “concentration camp” with a “torture cell”.
When asked about his faith in accomplishing the mission, Khan said he did not believe it, but was hopeful that “God would provide a path”. The ex-senator added that he had “exposed Israel’s genocidal face to the world” during the mission.
“Malaysia sent the biggest delegation on the flotilla,” the ex-senator said, extending gratitude to Kuala Lumpur for its support. “I went straight to Tunis from Kuala Lumpur; I could not come back to Pakistan because I had several cases against me. I was afraid I’d be stopped at the airport (in Pakistan).”
Khan said that he was part of the Palestine Action Coalition and was representing the Pak-Palestine Forum.
When asked about the raid, Khan said that the participants had been given standard operating procedures in case of boarding or an Israeli attack.
“When we left Crete, we knew that we were in danger of a drone attack,” he explained. He added that there were 50 boats in the flotilla when they left Crete.
“This was a journey of four days and nights, so we expected interception and drone attacks. We were instructed to throw our phones and belongings into the sea so that the Israelis couldn’t get them,” the ex-senator said.
“When I saw the Israeli navy ships up close, they were paper tigers,” he said. “Their entire navy responded and it took them 12 hours to intercept us all.
“My boat, the ‘Allakatalla’ … was the second-last to be intercepted. The last boat was 28 kilometres [from Gaza] when it was intercepted,” he said. “One of the [Israeli] ships was bigger than this building and sailing behind a 12-metre boat; the wake it was creating nearly caused up to capsize.”
He added that when the boat was boarded by Israeli commandos, the participants had been ordered to remain nonviolent and not resist at all. Khan said the Israelis shone bright lights at the flotilla and a team of 12 S-13 commandos boarded the vessel.
“When they were jumping onto our boat, two of them fell over so badly that we were afraid that they would shoot us because they were scared,” Khan remarked. “Their training was awful, no professionalism. If we had 100 boats and we were not exhausted by the trip, they could not have intercepted us.
“The only thing they (the Israeli military) can do is kill babies; they are unable to deal with any resistance.”
Recalling his time in Israeli jail, the ex-senator said that Israeli officials expressed disdain for Palestine and ripped the Palestinian flag hoisted on the boat. He added that they forcefully removed the Pakistani flag.
“We were ordered not to make eye contact with them (the Israelis). I quietly lifted the flag and put it inside the boat,” he recalled. “We were given instructions like ’hands up, lie face down on the ground. They would kick anyone for the smallest thing.
“They assigned two army personnel to each of us. When they asked me where I’m from, I replied that I’m from Pakistan, to which they hurled abuse at me. They were provoking me so that I’d hit them and give them an excuse,” Khan added.
“They kept probing us throughout and went through our documents before putting us in a bus to Ktzi’ot Prison in the Negev Desert, which is infamous for its brutality. We could not see anything from inside the van; there were walls all around.”
When asked about what happened in the prison, Khan said that they were forced to remove their clothes and wear “jail clothes”. He added that they were led to their cells “like detainees at Guantanamo Bay”.
“There were two big cell blocks; 10 rooms on either side in one of the blocks, with a 30-foot walkway in between,” the ex-senator described. “We were locked in cell number 911. We were called ‘troublemakers’; suddenly, people with guns and dogs entered our cells and forced us into a corner.
“They then bound our hands and feet and blindfolded us, before taking us to isolation and then putting us in an open cage outdoors. Our hands were so tightly bound that we could not feel them after two hours. We were not allowed to offer our Maghrib prayers by the guards. We prayed anyway without wudu or prostration.”
When asked about his cellmates, he replied that one was an American policeman, a Swiss senator and people from Europe. There were also two Tunisians and two Egyptians.
The former senator arrived in Islamabad from Jordan earlier today wearing a keffiyeh and was accorded a hero’s welcome, with people showering him with petals and adorning garlands on the former lawmaker.
 
  @dawn.today Former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan landed in Islamabad to cheers and applause on Thursday. Khan was part of the Global Sumud Flotilla's mission to Gaza to distribute humanitarian aid. His vessel was intercepted in the late hours of October 1 and he was taken in captivity along with other participants of the GSF. After a week of Israeli captivity, former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was released and transported to Amman, Jordan, on the second anniversary of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com   

The Pakistan embassy in Jordan, where he was deported to earlier, said late on Wednesday that Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had safely departed for Pakistan.
In a post on social media platform X, the embassy said the former senator had safely departed for Pakistan.
“In accordance with the instructions of the honourable deputy prime minister of Pakistan, the embassy of Pakistan in Amman ensured all necessary arrangements were made for his safe and smooth departure,” it said.
 






The X account for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reposted the embassy’s post.
Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan Ayman Safadi.
According to the foreign ministry, Dar appreciated Jordan’s role in receiving the flotilla’s released detainees and facilitating their return home.
“He also thanked Jordan for its assistance in enabling the return of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan to Amman,” it said, adding that Khan was scheduled to reach Pakistan today.
On Tuesday, Dar had stated that Khan had been released and was safely with the embassy in Amman. He also said that he had spoken to the ex-senator on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia.
“Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,“ he said.
“Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan embassy,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, the former senator had also posted a video on his X account on Tuesday in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over.
“I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention.
“During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said.
He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down.
“We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted.
He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention.

Violence broke out in Punjab late yesterday night, after police launched a crackdown on the headquarters of TLP in a bid to arrest its chief, Saad Rizvi. At least three police constables were reportedly injured in clashes with enraged TLP supporters, who attacked law enforcers with stones and iron rods. Police responded with tear-gas shelling, turning Multan Road into a battleground.
The group had annou­nced plans for a massive anti-Israel demonstration outside the US emb­as­sy in the federal capital on Friday.
Addressing a press conference today in Islamabad, Chaudhry said the speeches by the leaders of the religious party were inflammatory and abusive in nature. “When did the TLP seek permission, when did it give assurances of following SOPs (standard operating procedures),” he aded.
“The people of Palestine do not want sloganeering; they want peace. They want their homeland. Such so-called protests, speeches are not needed.”
Referring to the recent ceasefire agreement in Gaza, Talal said Hamas has accepted the agreement, then “why do those who want to protest not accept peace?”
Hamas and Israel [signed][3] an agreement on Thursday to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the conflict in Gaza.
He added that today, the Jamaat-i-Islami held a student rally near Faisal Mosque in solidarity with Palestine and Gaza; permission for which was granted.
The state minister further said chemicals, gas masks and other supplies were seized from TLP workers which they intended to use during the protest in the federal capital.
Security measures tightened in Rawalpindi following raid on TLP Lahore headquarters
Meanwhile, security in Rawalpindi was heightened as tensions rose in Lahore and the TLP prepared for a large anti-Israel protest in Islamabad.
Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Hamdani chaired an important meeting regarding the law and order situation, a statement from the police said.
 






“No person is allowed to take the law into their hands under any circumstances,” the CPO added, according to the statement. “Blocking any road, traffic or any activity affecting the normal life of citizens will not be allowed.”
The meeting was attended by the senior superintendent of police (SSP) operations, SSP investigation, divisional superintendents, SPs, and sub-divisional police officers.
The CPO reviewed the law and order situation and issued instructions to the officers, the statement said, adding that “violent activity under the guise of protests will not be tolerated.”
“Those who create disturbance in peace and order or violate the law will be dealt with strictly. Rawalpindi Police is determined and ready to deal with any situation. Attack on the lives and property of citizens, property or law enforcement agencies will not be tolerated under any circumstances.”
In view of the situation in the city, hostels and hotels on Murree Road and the surrounding areas have been told to evacuate non-essential people, with only foreigners and patients able to stay.
However, the CPO told Dawn.com that “foreigners, patients, families, and students appearing in exams have been exempted.”
Two TLP workers arrested on Tuesday were produced before a Rawalpindi Anti-Terrorism Court, which remanded them in police custody for 10 days for further investigation.
According to a police spokesman, the two suspects were transporting “dangerous items for a violent protest and rally of a religious political party” when they were arrested by Chaklala police.</p><small>2025-10-09 16:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09203029b237acf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947639/26th-amendment-case-order-for-formation-of-full-court-can-be-issued-using-judicial-powers-cb-told' target='_blank'><strong>26th Amendment case: Order for formation of full court can be issued using judicial powers, CB told</strong></a><br><p>Senior lawyer Munir A. Malik contended on Thursday that an order for the formation of a full court could be issued using “judicial powers” as an eight-member Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) heard pleas against the contentious legislation.
The Amendment was passed by the parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence.
The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The CB hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
 
 

Today’s hearing — which was streamed live — began at 11:30am and was adjourned at around 1pm. Malik, the counsel for the Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA), presented his arguments. Former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Abid Shahid Zuberi also began his arguments and is set to continue them on October 13 (Monday).
During the hearing, judges questioned whether the CB had the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, while Malik contended that it could do so through a judicial order. Justice Aminuddin and Mandokhail raised questions over suggestions to exclude judges appointed after the Amendment from a full court bench, if formed.
During yesterday’s hearing, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan had requested the formation of a 16-member bench to hear the pleas, as per the number of SC judges at the time of the 26th Amendment’s passage.
Several judges, including Justice Aminuddin, observed that the 26th Amendment was currently part of the Constitution. Some judges questioned whether the CB had the power to form a full court, while Justice Ayesha noted there was no restriction on issuing a judicial order for that.
The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the legality of the 26th Amendment.
The case was initially taken up in January, and after the CB’s approval of petitioners’ request for it, the proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel.
 


The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Malik voiced his support for the arguments presented by LHCBA counsel Hamid yesterday. At this, Justice Mandokhail asked him whether he also backed the statements about “keeping the points of the 26th Amendment aside”.
Justice Mazhar also noted that Hamid had asked the court to ignore the Article 191A introduced in the 26th Amendment, under which the constitutional benches were formed in the apex court.
 
 

Malik then replied that a full court “existed before the 26th Amendment”. He contended that the CB was “formed within the Supreme Court” and requested that a bench comprising all SC judges hear the pleas.
“Yes, absolutely. This order can be issued using judicial powers,” the BHCBA lawyer said in response Justice Mandokhail asking if the CB had the authority to form a full court.  “Everyone is obliged to follow a judicial order under Article 191A,” the counsel added.
At this point, Justice Ayesha asked whether there was any “obstacle” in constituting a full court bench. Justice Mazhar also wondered about the CB’s powers.
The BHCBA lawyer responded that “it did not matter whether the current bench was a regular one or Constitutional, the current bench could decide on who will hear the case”.
Justice Ayesha then asked Malik if he wanted the CB to issue orders for a full court using its judicial powers. “You are depending on the same amendment that you are challenging. This court has said numerous times before not to depend on the challenged amendment but on the original Constitution,” she remarked.
The counsel contended that judicial powers and judicial jurisdiction were two different things. “The Supreme Court is the full court. The Constitutional Bench is a crafted department of the Supreme Court.”
Justice Mandokhail then observed that, as per Article 191A, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) nominated the judges for the CB and it had the authority to nominate all apex court judges for the CB. Giving an example, he asked whether the CJP could say “no, this case will be heard by a full court” if the JCP decided a five-member CB.
 
 

Malik replied by saying that any kind of bench could issue a judicial order and there were no obstacles for it.
Here, Justice Ayesha wondered if a full court could be constituted in the presence of the 26th Amendment. “If we have to consider the judicial powers, then do we not have to look at Article 191A?” she asked.
The BHCBA counsel stated that he considered the CB a bench of the apex court.
At one point, Justice Hilali and Mandokhail had a brief exchange over who should be part of the bench hearing the petitions taken up.
Justice Hilali questioned how the current bench could decide its own jurisdiction. “We will need to return to before the amendment in the Constitution and review why the 26th Amendment was done. In my opinion, those judges who were appointed after the 26th Amendment should not be part of the bench,” she added.
At this, Justice Mandokhail quipped: “We are from before the 26th Amendment [but] were the new judges appointed after being brought from some other country?”
Justice Mazhar also observed that the Amendment was “not related to the new judges, the number of judges has not changed”. Justice Mandokhail highlighted that four judges elevated to the SC in February had remained high court chief justices.
 
 

Justice Hilali then clarified, “I did not say so with sinister thinking. An impression is being given as if I said so with malicious thinking.”
Justice Mandokhail remarked, “Judges are honourable; they should not be thrown under the bus.
“In every meeting of the Judicial Commission, the chief justice and I demanded that all judges be included in the Constitutional Bench. Will you be satisfied in such a situation?” he asked Malik, who reiterated that both regular bench and the CB had judicial powers.
Justice Mandokhail then told Malik to keep aside the matter of the bench’s jurisdiction and suggest a “way through which all judges can sit on the bench”.
He also raised the question of whether the CJP would lead that bench or the head of the CB.
Justice Aminuddin, who chairs the CB, then asked: “Should we then remove the judges [appointed] after the 26th Amendment from the bench?”
Justice Mandokhail wondered, “Has it ever happened that a judge came to the Supreme Court and then went back?”
Justice Aminuddin added another question: “What will happen to the judges included in the current constitutional bench?
“We have also faced a lot of verbal abuses,” he lamented.
There are currently 13 members in the CB — including Justices Hashim Khan Kakar, Salahuddin Panhwar, Shakeel Ahmad, Aamer Farooq and Ishtiaq Ibrahim, who were appointed to the SC in February.
 
 

Addressing the BHCBA counsel, Justice Mandokhail remarked, “It seems you do not trust the current constitutional bench judges. Whether willingly or not, Supreme Court judges have accepted the 26th Amendment.”
At this point, Malik concluded his arguments and ex-SCBA president Zuberi came to the rostrum.
In his arguments, Zuberi asserted that it was “not necessary” for all SC judges to be a part of a full court. “Available judges can also complete the quorum in a full court.”
Justice Hilali asked him whom the CB could order to form a full court, to which Zuberi replied that the bench could issue the directives to the Practice and Procedure Committee, which has the authority to form benches for cases.
Upon being asked about whether he wanted the full court based on the judges present prior to the 26th Amendment or after it, Zuberi voiced his request for the former. “There was a full court present before the Amendment,” he contended.
Subsequently, the CB adjourned the hearing till October 13 (Monday), when the former SCBA head is expected to continue his arguments.
The petitions
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
 
 

The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-09 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627802-time-for-decisive-actions-against-terrorism-warns-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Time for decisive actions against terrorism, warns PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

Yet the agreement signed after indirect talks in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, a favoured location for Middle East peace conferences over the decades with a patchy record of success, is only an initial phase involving a ceasefire, a handover of captives held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners inside Israel and a partial withdrawal of Israel from the enclave.
Plenty of pitfalls remain after negotiators left for later discussions about some of the thornier issues on which previous initiatives have foundered, such as the full extent of an Israeli withdrawal, the disarmament of Hamas, how to guarantee that fighting will not resume after this phase — and who could provide such a guarantee.
Have the guns fallen silent?
 
 

Not yet. Trump demanded Israel halt its bombing when Hamas first indicated partial acceptance for his 20-point plan on Friday. That has not happened. Scores of Palestinians have been killed since then in airstrikes and shelling, particularly in and around Gaza City, the focus of a recent Israeli offensive.
However, the bombardment has been more sporadic since Trump declared a deal had been secured a day ago, prompting celebrations in Israel, where families of captives were jubilant in Tel Aviv’s so-called hostages square, and in Gaza, where people gathered among the ruins even as blasts could be heard.
How does this differ from ceasefires that collapsed?
While this is a partial deal, a notable difference from previous ceasefire arrangements is that there is no deadline for reaching a full deal. It does not set a deadline of a few weeks, after which hostilities could resume if talks falter.
The jury is still out on whether that makes this deal more durable. There are those among Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s religious nationalist coalition who are already talking of more fighting. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a staunch opponent of any concession to Palestinians, has called for Hamas to be destroyed after the captives are returned.
But on this occasion, Trump has been far more vocal in his determination to hold feet to the fire on both sides, leaving less room for Israel to relaunch its offensive or Hamas to delay, even if past experience counsels caution over too much optimism.
Trump announced his plan standing next to Netanyahu in Washington last week with what seemed a “take-it-or-leave-it” offer for Hamas. Yet when Hamas gave only a partial acceptance, Trump immediately demanded Israel stop bombing. And as the days ticked by in the Sharm el-Sheikh talks, he warned Hamas “all hell, like no one has ever seen before, will break out” if it did not sign up.
By stamping his authority, Trump may have gone some way to answering the key question of who will guarantee this deal does not collapse at the next hurdle.
So what happens next?
The timeline is emerging but still seems fluid.
Netanyahu’s office said the ceasefire would take effect once the agreement is ratified by his government, which would convene after a security cabinet meeting today.
An Israeli government spokeswoman said a ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting. After that 24-hour period, the captives held in Gaza will be freed within 72 hours, she said.
A source briefed on details of the agreement said earlier that Israeli troops would begin pulling back within 24 hours of the deal being signed.
Humanitarian aid to Palestinians should then start to flow. Calling for full access for humanitarian workers in Gaza, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the United Nations was ready to help and “prepared to move now”.
Trump’s plan also calls for an international stabilisation force, which could start taking shape after a meeting of European ministers and top officials from Arab states in Paris today. They were also due to discuss issues such as future governance of Gaza, aid, reconstruction and demilitarisation.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s office said Trump was expected to be in Jerusalem on Sunday.
What are the political calculations facing Hamas and Israel?
Both Israel and Hamas have shown a readiness to respond positively to pressure from Trump and others, but each side faces their own political calculations.
For Netanyahu, agreeing to the plan seems based on a calculation he can stay on the right side of the US, Israel’s vital ally, and win over an Israeli public desperate to see an end to the conflict, while conceding as little as possible to avoid alienating his religious nationalist coalition partners. The 20-point plan, for example, offers a possible pathway, albeit highly conditional, to a Palestinian state although Netanyahu has said that will never happen.
Hamas has dropped its opposition to any deal that was only partial because of the risk of fighting resuming once captives were handed over. It has also signed up to a deal calling for demilitarisation, which it had repeatedly rejected.
Under pressure from Arab states and Turkiye, alongside Trump, Hamas may have had little choice but to accept. But it may be calculating that Trump’s determination is the best guarantee that the fighting will not resume for now, while the talks in Sharm el-Sheikh have put the group at the negotiating table to shape the future for Palestinians even though the deal seeks to sideline it.</p><small>2025-10-09 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627807-ex-senator-mushtaq-ahmad-quits-jamaat-e-islami' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad 'quits' Jamaat-e-Islami</strong></a><br><p>

A hidden camera captures the fleeting moment, offering rare evidence that one of the country’s most elusive wild cats still survives.
The caracal, a medium-sized wild cat native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and South Asia, is now critically endangered in Pakistan. Wildlife experts warn that habitat loss, increasing human intrusion and retaliatory killings have pushed the species to the brink of local extinction.
“Local people either kill the cat to protect their sheep, goats, deer and other small animals, or in retaliation for its preying on small livestock,” wildlife expert Saeedul Islam told Anadolu.
Hunting for the illegal pet trade poses another threat.
“This has left the animal’s population in only a few hundred, not even a thousand, in Pakistan,” he said.
Javed Mahar, conservator with the Sindh Wildlife Department, said the caracal still exists in parts of Sindh and other provinces, but that the absence of official data makes it difficult to assess its population.
One estimate puts the number between 100 and 200.
Typically nocturnal and highly secretive, the caracal is a solitary carnivore that preys on birds, rodents and small mammals. It is known for its long legs, tufted ears and remarkable hunting agility.
The species is near extinction in North Africa, critically endangered in Pakistan and endangered in Jordan, though populations remain stable in parts of central and southern Africa.
New hopes for survival
 
 

In Pakistan, the species clings to survival in Punjab’s Cholistan Desert, Sindh’s Kirthar Range and the highlands of central and southern Balochistan, said Zafeer Ahmad Shaikh, head of the Indus Fishing Cat Project (IFCP), a wildlife conservation group active in the region for more than four years.
Conservationists recently recorded a caracal on the southern outskirts of Kirthar National Park near Karachi, offering rare visual evidence that the once widespread species still exists there.
“We spent weeks trying to spot this rare species, which we thought no longer existed in this part of Pakistan,” said Zohaib Ahmad, one of the conservationists who set up a camera trap after reports of a caracal crossing a nearby road in daylight in January.
“This is the first camera-trap record of a caracal in years,” he told Anadolu. “It offers firm evidence that caracals are still present in Pakistan.”
The footage, recorded by IFCP, shows an adult male caracal wandering through the hilly terrain of Kirthar National Park. Out of about 400 clips collected from that camera over two weeks, it was the only one showing a caracal, Shaikh said.
Another recent sighting involved a juvenile killed by local residents in the same area, he added.
Pressures driving decline
Jamshed Chaudhry, a World Wide Fund for Nature Pakistan official, said caracals are rapidly losing their natural habitat due to farmland expansion, urban development and overgrazing, all of which make it harder for them to find food and shelter.
“Caracals are also struggling to survive as their prey — rodents, birds and reptiles — are declining due to habitat loss, overgrazing and hunting, leaving them with little to no food,” Chaudhry told Anadolu.
He added that roads cutting through caracal habitats pose another danger, as the cats are most active at dawn and dusk, when drivers are less likely to see them in time.
While not common, Chaudhry said, the species is sometimes hunted for its skin or captured for the illegal wildlife trade, adding further pressure to an already small population.
The caracal receives limited legal protection in the country and little focused conservation attention, allowing its decline to go largely unnoticed.
The species has largely remained outside mainstream wildlife protection programmes, though WWF-Pakistan and other groups have occasionally recorded its presence during biodiversity surveys in Cholistan, Thal and parts of Balochistan.
It is protected under the Sindh Wildlife Act, which bans poaching and hunting, though enforcement remains a challenge.
Ecological balance
Experts stress that the caracal plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance.
“Their regulation of prey species is essential for sustaining biodiversity and the overall health of the ecosystem,” Chaudhry said.
Mahar echoed the view, explaining that the caracal helps maintain the prey-and-predator balance in ecosystems.
As a predator, it regulates populations of its prey, including rodents and small mammals, a natural balance that prevents overgrazing, crop loss and the spread of disease.
“Protecting caracals, therefore, not only conserves a unique and graceful predator but also ensures the stability of entire ecosystems they are part of,” Chaudhry said.</p><small>2025-10-09 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09190812b040d4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947690/imran-chose-afridi-to-enable-and-support-terrorism-in-kp-tarar-alleges' target='_blank'><strong>Imran chose Afridi to enable and support terrorism in KP, Tarar alleges</strong></a><br><p>Minister for Infor­mation Attaullah Tarar on Thursday claimed that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) Sohail Afridi has been nominated as the new chief minister for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to “support, promote, and enable” terrorism in the province.
Yesterday, PTI’s Ali Amin Gandapur said he has resigned from his role as the KP CM while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Afridi to assume the role of provincial chief executive.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today along with Ikhtiar Wali Khan, the coordinator to prime minister on information for KP affairs, Tarar maintained PTI “enables terrorists”.
“These handful of terrorists are enabled by a person sitting in jail who is the chief sponsor of terrorism,” the information minister claimed, saying that PTI founder’s support for terrorists is evident from old interviews.
Tarar said the contention with Ali Amin Gandapur was that he does not do what he’s told, i.e., “enable and support terrorists and prevent actions against them”.
Referring to Afridi as a “fugitive” and “criminal-minded”, the information minister further said he has been brought in to support and give a free hand to terrorists in KP.
“Let me tell this with clarity to the KP govt and PTI,” he said. “Pakistan’s security policy is made in Islamabad and will continue to be so. It will not be made in Kabul. We will not allow terrorists to take full control.”
Tarar alleged that PTI and its founder caused great damage to the country when they “brought in and settled terrorists” in the country, adding that PTI has been in governance for the past 12 years in KP and terrorism has again peaked.
The information minister also referred to the verdict in the London high court earlier today, which ruled against YouTuber and former Pakistan Army officer retired Major Adil Farooq Raja in a high-profile defamation case filed by retired Brigadier Rashid Nasir, a former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officer, saying that the verdict was a “win for Pakistan”.
Meanwhile, Ikhtiar Wali said KP is “Pakistan’s most sensitive province”, besieged by terrorism from one side and bad governance from the other.
‘Flawed policies, mistaken priorities’
Shortly before the press conference, a post on Imran Khan’s official X account said that the complete eradication of terrorism in Pakistan, including KP, is “impossible without dialogue among four key stakeholders”, namely the KP and Afghan governments, the people of the tribal areas, as well as the Afghan people.
“The flawed policies and mistaken priorities of the mafia presently imposed on the nation have led Pakistan, especially Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, into an alarming and unprecedented wave of terrorism,” the PTI founder said. “Even though two months still remain, this year Pakistan has witnessed a record number of terrorist incidents, resulting in an enormous loss of life on a scale difficult to find precedent for.”
Yesterday, eleven military personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation in KP’s Orakzai district, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations. Referring to the incident, Imran in his tweet said that he was “deeply saddened by the loss of precious lives”.

In August, Imran had said the party should not go into by-elections triggered by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) disqualifying a large number of PTI members and leaders in relation to their involvement in the May 9, 2023, riots and that its lawmakers should leave all parliamentary standing committees, including the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
PTI lawmakers subsequently began resigning from the membership of parliamentary committees and also Senate standing committees. Whether Punjab lawmakers would do so was not decided at the time.
However, speaking to the media today outside Adiala Jail after meeting Imran, Barrister Gohar said: “Khan has issued a direction regarding Punjab. We have 107 MPAs in Punjab and we have around 14 standing committees. Khan has also issued the directive for Punjab that our party members will resign from the memberships and chairmanships of standing committees, the way we have in the National Assembly and Senate.”
Questioned about speculation of him being removed as the party chairman a day after Ali Amin Gandapur was told to step down as the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, Gohar rubbished the entire matter as “just rumours” and said the party was stable with no issue over the chairmanship.
“There is no issue of my chairmanship.’’
On developments about the KP chief minister’s position, Gohar said Imran praised Gandapur as ’’one of my few loyal allies“ and that he was a strong party member but the PTI founder had a strong stance regarding terrorism that any operation against it without a political strategy would fail.
“Whatever operation you carry out, any collateral damage in it further radicalises people. That is why, Khan said that our party, government and province cannot afford this so we were wanting some drasitc change.”
He said Imran wished for the transition in the KP government to be completed as quickly as possible, adding that the cabinet would continue but the party founder would finalise the names once the new government was formed.</p><small>2025-10-09 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/091917315a67e26.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947700/nepra-imposes-rs25m-fine-on-k-electric' target='_blank'><strong>Nepra imposes Rs25m fine on K-Electric</strong></a><br><p>The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has ordered Karachi-based distribution company K-Electric (KE) to pay a fine of Rs25 million within 15 days over its failure to fulfil its responsibilities.
A Nepra notification available with Dawn.com stated that the penalty was issued over a nationwide power breakdown in January 2023.
Nepra noted that KE attempted to restore electricity amid a major power breakdown in January 2023 through ‘black start facilities’, which are used to restore power in the event of a blackout at KE plants, but attempts failed due to frequent tripping.
“Repeated failed attempts on the black start facilities of most of the power plants in the licensee’s (KE) fleet and their frequent tripping indicates the lack of mock testing of the black start facility by the licensee,” the notification read.
“The mock testing is a crucial step for the preparation of the licensee and all relevant stakeholders to handle a blackout scenario, as it ensures the healthiness of [the] black start facility.”
KE responded by attributing the power grid collapse to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company’s (NTDC) own power network.
“The authority (Nepra) has gone through the submissions of the licensee and observes that the licensee’s response attempts to justify the power breakdown on [January 23, 2023] by attributing the primary cause to disturbances in NTDC’s 500 kV network, which led to a cascading failure in its own system,” the notification read.
“While it is true that interconnected power systems are vulnerable to disruptions in the larger grid, the licensee’s argument that its stability is entirely dependent on NTDC’s network raises concerns about its own preparedness as a vertically integrated utility,” the authority stated.
Nepra observed that KE failed to perform its operations in accordance with Section 14B(4) of the Nepra Act, Rule 10(6) of the Nepra Licensing (Generation) Rules, 2000 and Clauses OC 8.1.1, 8.1.4, 8.2.1 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 of the Grid Code, imposing a Rs25m fine which would be payable within 15 days.
Failure to pay would lead Nepra to “recover the amount due under Section 41 of the Nepra Act, read with relevant provisions of the Fine Regulations, 2021, as arrears of the land revenue”.
Reacting to the development, the KE spokesperson in a statement termed the penalty “surprising”.
“K-Electric is currently reviewing the honourable authority’s detailed decision and will determine the future course of action accordingly,” the statement by the power utility added.</p><small>2025-10-09 14:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627785-pm-shehbazs-general-assembly-speech-most-viewed-among-world-leaders-on-uns-youtube' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz's General Assembly speech most viewed among world leaders on UN's YouTube</strong></a><br><p>

The coalition allies have been trading barbs over how the PPP and PML-N have been providing aid to victims of the recent floods. The bad blood escalated to the point that leaders from both sides hold daily press conferences to take potshots at each other.
In a post on X, the PPP confirmed the telephone call had taken place and that the country’s political situation, foreign policy and flood aid were among the topics of discussion.
 






The war of words between the two sides expanded to water rights on the Indus River as Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself.
 
 

Last week, she said at a public address that she would not apologise for her remarks and censured the PPP for hurling “wrongful criticism” at the Punjab government over its handling of the floods.
In response, the PPP, the ruling party in Sindh, has had lawmakers walk out of the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe.
Concerted efforts have been made by leading figures, such as the PM and President Asif Ali Zardari, who have stepped in to defuse tensions, with the latter also calling on Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to play his role for a possible rapprochement.
A PML-N delegation, comprising Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Speaker of the National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq, headed]5 to Nawabshah by special plane on Wednesday night, according to a statement from the Presidency.
While speculation has been rife over what actually sparked the bad blood between both parties, the events of Wednesday night clearly indicated that the disagreement had caused enough ‘trouble in paradise’ for the ruling party to dispatch its ‘A-Team’ in an attempt to win over President Zardari.
Naqvi — who was earlier summoned to Karachi by the president to help — was also present in the meeting.
While there were no details given by either side about the emergent meeting with President Zardari, many observers believed that the decision to send a team to mend fences with the PPP leader must have been endorsed by Nawaz Sharif after his younger brother prevailed upon him to help bring down political temperatures.
Before the PML-N dispatched its top men to Nawabshah, ostensibly to negotiate a rapprochement, background discussions with PML-N and PPP leaders indicated that the tiff was quite serious, and “anything but scripted”.
The development came swiftly on the heels of an announcement by the PPP that it would convene its Central Executive Committee — the party’s top decision-making forum — on October 18 to discuss the political situation in the country.
That the meeting was being called on the anniversary of the Karsaz bombing that targeted the late Benazir Bhutto’s homecoming parade in 2007 was being seen as quite significant, leading many to believe that the party may arrive to some momentous decision at the gathering.
Amid these tensions, the PPP is said to be receiving several proposals — from all quarters — about potentially reviewing it’s support for the PML-N in the Centre. Even in Punjab too, a proposal was floated that the PPP, with around a dozen seats in the Punjab Assembly, should sit on the opposition benches.
But as things stand, there seems to be little chance of the two allies disbanding their relationship, as those who have brokered this alliance will not allow it, insiders opined.</p><small>2025-10-09 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627774-pm-shehbaz-bilawal-talk-over-phone-after-pml-n-ppp-truce' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz, Bilawal talk over phone after PML-N, PPP truce</strong></a><br><p>

The high-level business delegation from Saudi Arabia, led by Saudi-Pakistan Joint Business Council Chairman Prince Mansour bin Mohammad Al Saud, arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday to discuss trade, investment and collaboration.
The development followed Pakistan forming an 18-member committee to oversee bilateral economic engagements and negotiations with the kingdom. Last month, the two countries also signed a mutual defence agreement, pledging a joint response to any act of aggression.
A press release issued today from the CM Secretariat said the delegation was welcomed at CM House by Shah and provincial ministers. It added that the delegation included over 30 prominent businessmen and investors associated with the energy, infrastructure, agriculture, livestock, mining, construction, logistics and investment sectors.
Representatives of the Pakistan Business Council, Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) and the Saudi Embassy also attended the meeting.
On the occasion, two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were signed, marking significant progress in K-Electric’s ownership and future collaboration framework.
The first MoU was signed for the sale and purchase of shares in KES Power Ltd. The second MoU was signed between K-Electric Limited and Trident Energy Ltd to explore strategic cooperation and investment opportunities in Pakistan’s power sector.
“These agreements reflect growing international investor confidence in Pakistan’s energy market and a renewed commitment to enhancing power generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure in the country,’’ a press release from the CM Secretariat said.
“Sindh CM highlights 12 priority investment sectors of Sindh. Saudi companies invited to invest in agriculture, energy, infrastructure, logistics and industrial projects,” the press release said.
 






It said the chief minister acknowledged the historical and brotherly relations between the two countries.
“Sindh is ready to become the gateway for Pakistan’s economic development. We have digitised land records and simplified investment procedures. Investor-friendly and reform-oriented environment is Sindh government’s priority.”
‘‘Our partnership with Saudi Arabia is very important for the economic future of the region. Sindh government is fully aligned with the goals of Saudi Vision 2030,’’ the press release quoted the chief minister as saying.
He pointed out that the Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway presented investment opportunities and invited the delegation to participate in Karachi’s Blue and Yellow Line transit systems.
Joint ventures in the fisheries and livestock sectors were also offered to the Saudi delegation, along with an invitation to participate in the establishment of special economic zones.
The chief minister and the Saudi delegation agreed to establish joint working groups, with Shah saying that different sectoral working groups were necessary to ensure continuity of cooperation.
 






‘‘Sindh government is working in full coordination with federal institutions. The Sindh government has close links with the Federal Ministry of Investment, Special Investment Facilitation Council and Trade Development Authority of Pakistan so that foreign investors will be provided with complete facilities from feasibility to practical implementation,’’ CM Shah said.
The press release added that promoting cooperation between the public and private sectors was also discussed.
Prince Mansoor thanked CM Shah for hosting him and said he had come with the delegation to establish a “new partnership’’ between the two countries.
He said sub-committees would be established for each sector and investment would be initiated to promote funding inflows.
Pointing out Karachi’s status as a port city, the Saudi prince said there were “great investment opportunities here’’ while CM Shah said the Sindh government had opened its doors for investment and all possible cooperation would be extended to Saudi investors.
Addressing the delegation, CM Shah said bilateral relations had gained a new dimension with the Saudi-Pakistan Joint Business Council, adding that the country’s relations with Sindh would also further strengthen.
 






He invited Saudi investors to explore long-term partnerships in Sindh under public-private partnerships, government-to-business and business-to-business models, emphasising collaboration for innovation, technology transfer and industrial growth.
 






On the occasion, two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were signed, marking significant progress in K-Electric’s ownership and future collaboration framework.
The first MoU was signed for the sale and purchase of shares in KES Power Ltd. The second MoU was signed between K-Electric Limited and Trident Energy Ltd to explore strategic cooperation and investment opportunities in Pakistan’s power sector.
“These agreements reflect growing international investor confidence in Pakistan’s energy market and a renewed commitment to enhancing power generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure in the country,’’ a press release from the CM Secratariat said.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in mutual economic interests, strategic military cooperation, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with the kingdom being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
In February, Riyadh signed a $1.2 billion deferred oil facility, releasing $100 million monthly until February 2026. Islamabad is also seeking a rollover of $5bn Saudi loans — $2bn maturing in December 2025 and $3bn in June 2026 — at a concessional four per cent interest rate.
Last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Riyadh was “central to Pakistan’s economy” as he met Saudi Crown Prince Moha­m­med Bin Salman on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh.
The government is seeking large investments in state-owned enterprises and the development of a petrochemicals plant, according to a Reuters report.
Riyadh has also shown interest in mining in the past, including in buying part of the Pakistani government stake in the multibillion-dollar Reko Diq copper mine being developed in Balochistan.</p><small>2025-10-09 13:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09164256b95c662.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947682/hungarian-writer-krasznahorkai-wins-2025-nobel-prize-in-literature' target='_blank'><strong>Hungarian writer Krasznahorkai wins 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature</strong></a><br><p>Hungarian writer Laszlo Krasznahorkai won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature, the award-giving body said on Thursday.
The prize is awarded by the Swedish Academy and is worth 11 million crowns ($1.2 million).
Established in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel, the prizes for achievements in literature, science and peace have been awarded since 1901.
“The Nobel Prize in Literature for 2025 is awarded to the Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai for his compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art,” said Mats Malm, Permanent Secretary at the Swedish Academy.
 






Past winners of the 11 million Swedish crown ($1.2 million) literature prize include French poet and essayist Sully Prudhomme, who bagged the first award, American novelist and short story writer William Faulkner in 1949, Britain’s World War Two Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1953, Turkey’s Orhan Pamuk in 2006 and Norway’s Jon Fosse in 2023.
Last year’s prize was won by South Korean author Han Kang, who became the 18th woman, the first was Swedish author Selma Lagerlof in 1909, and the first South Korean to receive the award.
Over the years, the choices made by the Swedish Academy have drawn as much ire as applause.
In 2016, the award to American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan sparked criticism that his work was not proper literature, while Austrian Peter Handke’s prize also drew criticism in 2019.
Handke had attended the funeral in 2006 of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, seen by many as responsible for the deaths of thousands of ethnic Albanians who were killed in Kosovo and the displacement of almost 1 million others during a brutal war waged by forces under his control in 1998-99.
Prizegivers have also in the past been accused of being snobbish, of having an anti-American bias and of ignoring some of the giants of literature, including Russia’s Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy, France’s Emile Zola and Ireland’s James Joyce.</p><small>2025-10-09 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/091220262772e94.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947651/afghan-fm-amir-khan-muttaqi-on-first-india-visit-since-2021' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan FM Amir Khan Muttaqi on first India visit since 2021</strong></a><br><p>Afghanistan’s foreign minister arrived in India on Thursday for talks aiming to foster economic ties with New Delhi in the first such visit by a leader of the group since it seized power in 2021.
The six-day trip by Amir Khan Muttaqi highlights the Taliban’s efforts to spur engagement with regional powers to secure eventual diplomatic recognition.
He is set to meet Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and other officials to discuss a range of political, economic and trade matters.
“We look forward to engaging discussions with him on bilateral relations and regional issues,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X welcoming the minister.
 






Muttaqi is also expected to speak with Indian business representatives, visit the ancient monument to love, the Taj Mahal, and a historic Islamic seminary, media said.
He arrives in New Delhi after talks in Moscow with diplomats from Afghanistan’s neighbours, who appeared to unite against US President Donald Trump’s stated aim of taking over the Bagram military base near Kabul, the capital.
Russia is the only country to have yet recognised the Taliban administration, whose members are under UN sanctions including a travel ban and asset freeze, including Muttaqi, who got a temporary exemption to visit India.
Historically, India and Afghanistan have had friendly ties but New Delhi does not recognise the Taliban and shut its embassy in Kabul after the US withdrawal from the war-shattered country in 2021.
New Delhi opened a small mission a year later to ease the way for trade, medical support and humanitarian aid, while its senior officials have held two-way talks with Taliban leaders.</p><small>2025-10-09 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/091607563f63d62.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947680/uk-signs-468m-deal-to-supply-india-with-missiles' target='_blank'><strong>UK signs $468m deal to supply India with missiles</strong></a><br><p>Britain said on Thursday it had signed a £350 million ($468m) contract to supply the Indian army with UK-manufactured lightweight missiles, as part of a deepening weapons and defence partnership between the two countries.
The announcement came as British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was visiting Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in Mumbai, where the pair hailed the potential of the commercial links from their months-old trade deal.
In its statement on the defence deal, the British government said the new contract for Lightweight Multirole Missiles made by Thales in Northern Ireland would secure 700 jobs at a factory which currently makes the same weapons for Ukraine.

“The deal paves the way for a broader complex weapons partnership between the UK and India, currently under negotiation between the two governments,” it said.
Starmer has, over the last 12 months, thrown his weight behind Britain’s defence sector to try to drive higher economic growth, pledging to up spending in line with Nato targets, as well as focusing on winning exports, such as a recent $13.5 billion frigate contract with Norway.
Britain also said on Thursday it reached a new milestone with India on a tie-up for electric-powered engines for naval ships as both countries signed the next phase of a deal, worth an initial £250m.
Modi hails Indian dynamism, UK expertise
Starmer’s visit, accompanied by the largest-ever business delegation, “reflects the new energy and broad vision” in the partnership, Modi said after talks with the British prime minister.
“India’s dynamism and the UK’s expertise together create a unique synergy,” Modi said, speaking in Hindi.
“Our partnership is built on trust … it is a clear reaffirmation of our shared commitment to … build a brighter future for the people of both our nations.”
Starmer said the focus of his visit was about doubling down on the potential of the trade deal, expected to take effect within a year.

“When we leave India tonight, I expect that we will have secured major new investments creating thousands of high-skilled jobs in the sectors of the future.”
An Indian foreign ministry statement said the two sides agreed to set up an India-UK connectivity and innovation centre and a joint centre for AI, and unveiled a critical minerals industry guild to bolster supply chains and promote green technologies.
They also announced joint investment in a climate technology startup fund and set up new collaborations on health and renewable energy, an offshore wind task force, and a health research partnership, among other things, it said.

But the two countries do not agree on everything.
After Modi wished Russian President Vladimir Putin a happy birthday on Tuesday, Starmer joked to reporters that he would not be doing the same, given Britain’s strong backing for Ukraine and condemnation of Russia over its invasion.
Britain says it respects India’s strategic independence and Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander, a former trade minister who joined the delegation, told reporters the issue had not prevented Starmer from leveraging close ties with Modi to expand the UK economy.
Separately, Modi said flying instructors from the Indian Air Force would serve as trainers with the Royal Air Force, as part of their agreement for cooperation in military training.
New Delhi has for decades been dependent on Moscow for much of its military hardware but has slowly moved away in recent decades to buy from France, Israel, and the US.

Britain said two UK universities had been given approval to open new campuses in India, which it said would help the UK expand its influence “without adding pressure to domestic migration figures”, as the government tightens rules around international students and has said more Indian visas weren’t on the agenda for talks.</p><small>2025-10-09 12:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09153303b71915a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947671/uk-court-rules-against-youtuber-adil-raja-in-defamation-case-by-retired-army-officer' target='_blank'><strong>UK court rules against YouTuber Adil Raja in defamation case by retired army officer</strong></a><br><p>A London high court has ruled against YouTuber and former Pakistan Army officer retired Major Adil Farooq Raja in a high-profile defamation case filed by retired Brigadier Rashid Nasir, a former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officer.
The defamation suit was filed in August 2022, but was made public in April after the respondent stirred another controversy in Pakistan over his allegations targeting leading film and TV actresses.
On Thursday, the court found Raja’s allegations of corruption, electoral interference, and human rights abuses against Nasir to be “false and baseless”, ordering him to pay £350,000 in damages and legal costs.
Justice Richard Spearman KC delivered the judgment, ordering Raja to pay £50,000 (around Rs20 million) in damages and approximately £300,000 (around Rs110m) in legal costs.
The court also directed Raja to publish a summary of the verdict on all his social media platforms, confirming that his claims against Nasir were untrue. In addition, he must apologise and give a written assurance that he will not repeat the allegations.
The case was based on nine social media posts and videos in which Raja accused Brig Nasir of corruption, political interference, and misuse of authority. He alleged that Nasir influenced court proceedings, interfered in elections and engaged in political dealings on behalf of senior military officials — claims that the court found to have no factual basis.
Justice Spearman noted that Raja failed to provide credible evidence or reliable sources to support his statements.
He also observed that the three witnesses presented by Raja — journalist Shaheen Sehbai, former PTI leader Shahzad Akbar, and Syed Akbar Hussain — did not provide testimony that substantiated any of the allegations.
Following the ruling, Adil Raja expressed his disappointment with the judgment.
“Today is a disappointing day,” he wrote on X. “The judge was not with us.”
He added: “Our resolve is undeterred despite today’s setback. Our struggle for democracy in Pakistan will continue. The people of Pakistan are witnesses to the facts on the ground, and their determination for freedom remains rock solid. Our mothers and sisters who have faced brutality and torture with courage in their eyes know that we are fighting for them.”</p><small>2025-10-09 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09162601567faec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947681/otis-pays-penalty-as-pakistan-held-by-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Otis pays penalty as Pakistan held by Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Otis Khan missed a penalty as Pakistan played out a goalless draw against Afghanistan at the Jinnah Stadium in Islamabad on Thursday, securing their first point in the third round of qualifying for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup.
Nolberto Solano’s side had the better of the opportunities against the jaded visitors, who only arrived in Islamabad less than 24 hours before kickoff due to a prolonged visa problem.
However, the hosts weren’t able to capitalise on the chances — notably Otis’ opportunity when he blazed his spot-kick over the bar midway through the second half — in front of a fervent home crowd.
 






The draw meant Pakistan and Afghanistan both got off the mark in Group ‘E’, and they trail joint-leaders Syria and Myanmar by five points.
Syria were hosting Myanmar later on Thursday in a clash between two teams
with maximum points from their two games.

Convergent evolution, or convergence, refers to the repeated, independent emergence of the same trait in two or more lineages of species during evolution, often indicating functional adaptation to specific environmental factors.
The research team uncovered the critical role of high-order protein features in adaptive convergence.
Despite the significant evolutionary distance between bats and toothed whales, both species have independently developed the ability to perceive their environment through echolocation.
The research team, led by Zou Zhengting, proposed a computational analysis framework named “ACEP”. The core innovation of this framework lies in its use of a pre-trained protein language model.
“A protein language model can understand the deeper structural and functional characteristics and patterns behind amino acid sequences,” Zou explained.
“This work not only deepens the understanding of the laws of evolution of life but also demonstrates the strong potential of AI technology in resolving complex biological issues,” Zou said.
“We hope to achieve broader and more effective application of AI technology in evolutionary biology in the future.”</p><small>2025-10-09 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627735-willingly-or-not-sc-judges-have-accepted-26th-amendment-justice-mandokhail' target='_blank'><strong>Willingly or not, SC judges have accepted 26th Amendment: Justice Mandokhail</strong></a><br><p>

Italy was the scene of some of Europe’s biggest pro-Palestinian protests last weekend, as Israeli forces continue their offensive in Gaza.
Hundreds of thousands of people gathered across Italy in anger at Israel’s actions, and calls for the country to be barred from international sport have grown louder.
 






The protests were in response to Israel’s military operation in Gaza, which was sparked by the attack by Hamas fighters on October 7, 2023, on Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip.
During Friday’s massive strike action in support of the Palestinians, demonstrators went to the Italian national team’s training centre in Florence to demand the match against Israel be called off.
As of Tuesday only around 4,000 tickets had been sold for the game in Udine, a small city in Italy’s far north-east, which was picked specifically to help limit the potential for disorder.
Udine was the venue when Italy — who face Estonia in Tallinn on Saturday — last hosted Israel, in the Nations League in September 2024. That match passed off largely without incident, albeit surrounded by a massive security operation which included soldiers on the roof of the stadium.
But the threat of much bigger and more disruptive protests led Udine’s mayor Alberto Felice De Toni to ask for the match to be postponed.
‘Very sad’
This week Italy’s coach Gennaro Gattuso said the situation in Gaza was “very sad” and lamented a difficult atmosphere for a match which will be key to Italy’s hopes of avoiding missing out on a third straight World Cup.
 
 

“There will be 10,000 people outside the stadium and 5-6,000 inside it… I would have preferred to play a home match in front of an enthusiastic crowd like we did in Bergamo (where Italy beat Estonia 5-0) a month ago,” Gattuso said.
His task was already complicated enough without the external political pressure of playing Israel, as direct qualification for the World Cup is seriously in doubt.
Only the winner of the five-team group is guaranteed an automatic spot and Italy sit second, level on nine points with Israel and six behind leaders Norway, but with a game in hand on both.
However Norway’s far superior goal difference — they have a 16-goal advantage over Italy — means Gattuso’s side can only top the group if they win all four of their remaining matches and Erling Haaland and company slip up before they travel to the San Siro next month.
That leaves second place and a spot in the play-offs as the likely route to the World Cup, a tournament in which Italy haven’t played a knockout fixture since winning it in 2006.
Italy exited at the qualification play-off stage for the last two World Cups, failing to reach the 2022 edition in Qatar despite being reigning European champions.</p><small>2025-10-09 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/091406271a8b3ff.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947664/maritime-ministry-launches-rs90m-project-in-bid-to-protect-sea-turtles-from-shrimp-trawling' target='_blank'><strong>Maritime ministry launches Rs90m project in bid to protect sea turtles from shrimp trawling</strong></a><br><p>In a bid to conserve marine biodiversity, Pakistan has launched a project — estimated to cost Rs90 million — to protect sea turtles during shrimp trawling using Standardised Turtle Excluder (TEDs), the maritime affairs ministry said on Thursday.
Sea turtles along Pakistan’s coast face many anthropogenic threats, including habitat degradation, plastic pollution, and entanglement in fishing gears such as deep-sea trawlers. Pakistan’s shrimp exports to the US have been banned since 2017 because fishermen were not using the TED in their nets, endangering turtles.
A TED is a specialised mechanism fitted into shrimp trawl nets that allows sea turtles and other large marine animals to escape while retaining shrimp, the statement said.
“Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has announced the launch of a PKR 90 million initiative aimed at protecting sea turtles during shrimp trawling operations, as part of broader efforts to sustain marine biodiversity and ensure the long-term health of ocean resources,” a statement from the ministry said.
It added that the project aimed to distribute and install TEDs at zero cost to fishermen.
“Shrimp trawling often results in the capture of large quantities of non-target marine species. When sea turtles become trapped in nets, they are unable to surface for air and can drown,” the statement quoted the maritime minister as saying.
The project will also feature “capacity-building workshops, hands-on training for trawler crews, and data collection to monitor the devices’ impact on shrimp catch efficiency and net performance,” the statement read.
The minister stressed that TEDs “would significantly reduce the accidental capture of endangered sea turtles, mitigate concerns from fishermen over shrimp loss and net damage, and pave the way for Pakistan to regain US certification —  essential for resuming shrimp exports to the American market.”
 
 

“The project aligns with Pakistan’s international commitments on marine sustainability and biodiversity conservation, ensuring compliance with global seafood traceability and sustainability standards,” Chaudhry was quoted as saying.
This initiative will showcase Pakistan’s commitment to responsible marine resource management, enhancing its reputation in the global seafood trade, Chaudhry added.
Pakistan currently sells shrimp at a comparatively low rate of about $2 per kilogram, the minister said, noting that with TED compliance and improved international certification, the price could rise to $6 per kilogram, unlocking new opportunities in lucrative markets including the US, EU, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
He urged the Karachi Fisheries Harbour Authority, Sindh Fisheries Department, and Marine Fisheries Department to ensure immediate and full TED compliance, both at sea and at dockside, the statement read.
Cautioning about risks associated with non-compliance, the minister said, “One hundred per cent TED compliance and credible enforcement will be ensured.
Meanwhile, on the economic front, Pakistan’s current shrimp exports are around $100m per year, Chaudhry said, stressing that investing in TED compliance could “potentially triple export volumes and open access to premium markets such as the European Union and Canada.”
“The project is being supported by the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), Pakistan Fisheries Exporters Association (PAKFEA), Sindh Trawler Owners Fisheries Association (STOFA), Karachi Fish Harbour Authority (KFHA), Sindh Marine Fisheries Department (SFD), and Fishermen’s Cooperative Society (FCS),” the statement read.
According to a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) study from 2012, around 30,000 sea turtles were annually caught in the tuna gillnet fisheries of the country.
Entanglement in fishing nets is the most serious threat to marine turtles. It was estimated that about three per cent of entangled turtles were dying due to drowning or mishandling onboard fishing vessels.</p><small>2025-10-09 09:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627725-gandapurs-fall-after-crossing-paths-with-imrans-wife-and-sister' target='_blank'><strong>Gandapur's fall after crossing paths with Imran's wife and sister</strong></a><br><p>

Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
DI Khan Regional Police Officer (RPO) Ashfaq Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that a police checkpoint in DI Khan’s Khutti area was attacked by terrorists from multiple sides.
When asked to confirm if the checkpoint in charge — identified as Ahmed Nawaz — was seriously injured during the attack and later succumbed to his injuries, Anwar said, “Yes.”
Funeral prayers for the deceased were offered today at the Ijaz Shaheed Police Lines, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
In attendance at the funeral were: RPO Ashfaq Anwar, District Police Officer Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmad, SPs of CTD, investigation, city, and headquarters, officers of security forces, police officials, and the family members of the martyr, according to APP.
The attack comes on the same day a major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in DI Khan, the military’s media wing said.
Last week, a soldier was martyred and another was injured when unknown assailants opened fire on them near Bannu.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies.
According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.

The development comes a day after the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 11 security personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred in an exchange of fire between the forces and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists in KP’s Orakzai district.
According to the ISPR’s statement issued today, security forces carried out the IBO on Wednesday on the reported presence of “khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij” in the Daraban area of DI Khan.
Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP.
During the operation, the ISPR said, seven “Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell” due to effective engagement by security forces’ troops.
However, during the intense exchange of fire, 30-year-old Major Sibtain Haider, a resident of the Quetta district, embraced martyrdom. “A brave officer who was leading his troops from the front, having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat.”
The ISPR said weapons and ammunition were found in the custody of the slain terrorists, who had been “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies, as well as [the] killing of innocent civilians”.
A sanitisation operation was being carried out to “eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area”, the ISPR statement said.
It added that the “security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave sons further strengthen our resolve”.
President Asif Ali Zardari lauded the security forces’ successful operation in Daraban, DI Khan and paid rich tribute to Major Sibtain Haider for his “valour and sacrifice, saying the nation’s resolve to end terrorism remains unshakable”, a statement posted on the presidency’s X account said.
 






Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to martyred Major Sibtain Haider, according to a statement posted by his ministry on X.
 






State-run APP reported that KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also lauded security forces for the successful operation and paid them rich tribute for their “courage and professionalism in eliminating terrorists who pose a threat to peace and stability in the region”.
Expressing grief over the martyrdom of Major Sibtain Haider, he extended condolences to his family and prayed for the “elevation of his ranks in Jannah”.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Subsequently, amid rising terror attacks, the government labelled the group as Fitna al Khwarij and directed the use of the term khariji for attackers.
Islamabad has also raised concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan, maintaining that they have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan. It has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks.
Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism.  In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
After Tuesday’s IBO in Orakzai, a statement from the ISPR said the participants at the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference held at General Headquarters expressed their resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of “Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the Fitna al Khwarij and Fitna al Hindustan.
Last month, after 19 soldiers were martyred in KP in multiple incidents, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had said that the  “Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khwarij or stand with Pakistan”.</p><small>2025-10-09 07:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/091133139e65318.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947647/commonwealth-says-time-taken-for-election-reports-varies-following-concerns-over-delay' target='_blank'><strong>Commonwealth says time taken for election reports ‘varies’ following concerns over delay</strong></a><br><p>Foreign observation mission Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has clarified that the time taken to write and release its reports “varies considerably” with each group and that the report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections was finalised by the end of that year.
The COG report, released to the public on September 30, had been the subject of some controversy after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had buried the report after finding the polls to be riddled with problems. According to the letter of transmittal appended to the report, it was submitted by the COG to the Commonwealth secretary general on Nov 20, 2024.
“The length of time taken to write COG reports, and similarly, the finalisation and release of the publication, varies considerably with each COG. Other factors affecting the release dates include legal challenges and disputes. In this case, a comprehensive report of over 160 pages was finalised by the end of 2024,” the Commonwealth said in a statement on Tuesday.
It added that its secretariat first shared the report earlier this year with Pakistani government and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), encouraging a “domestic mechanism which convenes all electoral stakeholders to address the recommendations in the COG report”.
 
 

“Subsequently, the secretariat sought information on the status of action taken. This process was necessary for any further steps with regard to the internal process for releasing the report,” the statement added.
“It was then decided that the Pakistan COG report, along with two other outstanding reports of elections in 2024, would be released at the end of September. This timeline was made available to the media, when contacted, and the report was duly published on September 30 along with other reports,” the Commonwealth said.
On the same day the COG released its Pakistan report, it also made public the reports for Mozambique and Botswana — almost 11 months after both of them were held in October 2024.
“The Commonwealth Secretariat is guided by, and is deeply committed to, the values of the Commonwealth Charter, which are shared by all our member countries,” the statement stressed.
The body cited the 2018 Revised Commonwealth Guidelines for the Conduct of Election Observation in Member Countries, as per which the reports are “shared with the member government, Election Management Bodies (EMBs) and with other stakeholders” first and “thereafter, the report is made public”.
 
 

“We strongly encourage all stakeholders to use the report constructively, in service of the people of Pakistan. As we have stated in earlier statements, we remain ready to support any mechanism aimed at strengthening democracy in Pakistan, for the benefit of all its citizens,” the Commonwealth said.
“We will continue to partner with stakeholders to ensure that COG reports are released in a timely manner,” it added, affirming its commitment to transparency while adhering to the sequence of release as outlined in the 2018 Revised Guidelines.
The statement comes after 130 activists, lawyers and journalists wrote a letter to the Commonwealth Secretariat on October 2, expressing concern over the “extraordinary” delay in the report’s publication and noting that election reports were usually published routinely without any delay.
In its report, the COG had noted the denial of an election symbol to the PTI, the consecutive convictions of the party’s founder Imran Khan and limitations on the freedom of assembly, adding that such conditions “consistently limited one party’s ability to contest the election on a level playing field”.
 
 

It also mentioned the Forms-45 controversy, saying it reviewed documentation suggesting that Form-45s may have been altered to change the total number of votes received by candidates.
Commenting on the Commonwealth’s latest statement, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said: “The Commonwealth Guidelines clearly state that election reports must be issued in a ‘timely manner, initially to key national stakeholders and then made public’ and specifically identify all ‘political parties taking part in the elections’ as key stakeholders.
“This was not done,” he said.
 






At the time of the 2024 elections, a team of inter­national observers from the Commonwealth had expressed their satisfaction at the poll­ing exercise and pla­yed down suspension of mobile cellular services in the country.
COG Chairperson Dr Goodluck Jonathan, who was chairing the observer mission, shared the group’s preliminary findings days later and noted the impact of legal decisions on some candidates’ ability to run for office in the days leading up to election day.
“We call on all those with grievances to address disputes through prescribed election dispute resolution mechanisms,“ he said.</p><small>2025-10-09 07:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627720-security-beefed-up-in-rawalpindi-amid-tlps-islamabad-march-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Security beefed up in Rawalpindi amid TLP's Islamabad march plan</strong></a><br><p>
