The attack comes a day after the government launched the final polio campaign of 2025, which is set to run until December 21.
Public Relations Officer (PRO) police, Israr Khan, confirmed to Dawn that two people, including a passerby and a policeman guarding the polio team, were killed in the attack on Tuesday afternoon in the Thangi area of Salarzai.
Khan identified the martyred cop as Constable Sajad Ahmed, who passed away after sustaining critical injuries, while another civilian was “shot dead by the armed men when he attempted to chase after the assailants.”
“Local residents also confirmed the account, while the assailants managed to escape,” Khan said, adding that the police had launched a search operation.
He also confirmed that no polio workers were harmed in the incident.
Polio vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by militants, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan. In 2024 alone, 20 people were killed, and 53 were injured during anti-polio campaigns in KP.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack, expressing grief over the death of the police constable, state broadcaster PTV reported.
He vowed to “bring the perpetrators to justice,” stressing that the campaign will continue until the virus is eradicated from the country.
The premier also prayed for the “speedy recovery of the injured”.







In October, a Levies constable deployed for the security of a polio team was killed when unidentified assailants opened fire on him in Swat.
According to official data cited in a November 9 report, a total of 96 people had been killed by alleged terrorists in KP since 2012 until then, including 61 policemen, 27 health workers and five civilians.
Also, 170 people, including 124 policemen, 28 health workers and 21 civilians, had been injured in attacks on polio teams. During this period, 32 health workers, three civilians and one policeman were kidnapped during vaccination campaigns.
Of the people who were subjected to violence in the shape of death, injuries and kidnapping, 283 were men and 18 women.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases this year, with the highest number of cases in KP at 19.
Challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed the progress of eradication efforts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-12-16 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639741-attack-on-polio-team-in-bajaur-kills-two-including-cop' target='_blank'><strong>Attack on polio team in Bajaur kills two including cop</strong></a><br><p>

He was 86 years old.
His grandson, columnist Hassan Kamal Wattoo, posted about the former CM’s demise on social media platform X.
“With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of my beloved grandfather, Mian Manzoor Ahmad Wattoo,” he said, adding that funeral prayers would be held at the Wasawewala stadium in Okara at 2pm tomorrow.







President Asif Ali Zardari expressed deep grief over his demise, a post on the Presidency’s X account said.
It added that the president paid tribute to Wattoo’s “invaluable public service, role in strengthening democracy, and contributions to national unity”.







State-run APP reported that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condoled his death, saying in a statement that “services of late Manzoor Wattoo for the country’s politics will always be remembered”.
The deceased politician belonged to the PPP and also served as federal minister for Kashmir affairs during the 2008-2013 PPP-led coalition government.
Wattoo’s profile
Wattoo hailed from Deepalpur in Punjab’s Okara district and had decades of experience in politics. He was born on August 14, 1939.
The politician was first elected chairman of the Okara district council in 1983 and became a member of the Punjab Assembly in 1985. He was also elected speaker of the assembly at the time.
In 1988, Wattoo was again elected as an MPA (independent) and soon joined the Nawaz Sharif-led Pakistan Muslim League, which was part of Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) at the time. This time too, Wattoo became speaker of the house.
In 1993, he was elected as MNA and MPA from the IJI’s platform but opted to remain in Punjab, becoming speaker for the third time in a row.
After the 1993 election, Wattoo dislodged the provincial government of PML-N’s Ghulam Haider Wyne through a vote of no-confidence and became the chief minister with PPP’s support.
The PPP, which had been unable to recapture Punjab, had to accept Wattoo as chief minister in exchange for the PML-Junejo’s support for it in Islamabad. Back then, Wattoo had with him just 17 MPAs in the provincial assembly against the PPP’s 92.
After Wattoo had a fall out with PPP in 1995, then-prime minister Benazir Bhutto installed Arif Nakai, another PML-Junejo man, as the new chief minister.
The same year, he formed PML-Jinnah after parting ways with his cousin, Hamid Nasir Chattha, who wanted to become president of PML-Junejo.
In 1996, Wattoo became MNA from the PML-Jinnah platform. He faced corruption references and was convicted in a case. Wattoo was in jail for a few months and was later moved to the Punjab Institute of Cardiology on health grounds. His hospital room was declared sub-jail and he stayed there for over two years.
After his acquittal, he joined Pakistan Muslim League – Quaid (PML-Q) during the regime of former military ruler Pervez Musharraf. He was considered to be a close friend of the former president and had agreed to merge his PML-Jinnah into PML-Q on Musharraf’s advice.
He later joined PPP just after getting elected as an independent candidate in the 2008 general election, which he won from both NA-146 (Okara-IV) and NA-147 (Okara-V). Wattoo decided to retain the NA-146 seat and his son Khurram Jehangir was later elected on a PPP ticket in the by-election for NA-147.
Wattoo was made PPP’s central Punjab president in October 2012. He also served as federal minister for Kashmir affairs during the 2008-2013 PPP-led coalition government.
Wattoo was known for being a master of the art of carving his way out to important positions in nearly every setup and his elevation to the PPP’s command in Punjab was shocking to many among the party’s provincial cadre.
Wattoo joined the PTI in September 2018, after he violated the PPP discipline by contesting the July 25 general election as an independent candidate against the party nominee.
Last year, he rejoined the PPP.

The death toll in one of Australia’s worst mass shootings stands at 16, including 50-year-old Akram, who was shot by police. The man’s 24-year-old son and alleged accomplice, identified by local media as Naveed Akram, was in critical condition in hospital after also being shot.
Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana state. Australian police said both men had travelled to the Philippines last month, the father on an Indian passport and the son on an Australian one.
“The family members have expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalisation,” Telangana state police said in a statement.
The purpose of the trip is under investigation, officials said, adding it was not conclusive whether they were linked to any terrorist group or whether they received training in that country.
Telangana police said the factors that led to the radicalisation of the two gunmen “appear to have no connection with India or any local influence in Telangana”.
In its statement on Tuesday, Telangana police said Sajid Akram visited India on six occasions, mainly for family-related reasons, since he migrated to Australia in 1998.
There was no “adverse record” on him before he left India, the statement added.

Sajid and his son Naveed, who allegedly killed 15 people and wounded dozens of others at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s Bondi Beach, arrived on November 1 with the southern Philippine province of Davao listed as their final destination.
The father and son spent nearly the entire month of November in the Philippines, Manila’s immigration department confirmed on Tuesday, with the father entering the country as an Indian national.
“Sajid Akram, 50, Indian national, and Naveed Akram, 24, Australian national, arrived in the Philippines together last November 1, 2025 from Sydney, Australia,” immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval told AFP, adding they departed on November 28.
Australian police said on Tuesday both men had travelled to the Philippines last month and the purpose of the trip is under investigation. Philippines police have said they are investigating the matter.

 

Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate in the Philippines and have wielded some influence in the south of the country. They have been reduced to weakened cells operating in the southern Mindanao island in recent years, far from the scale of influence they wielded during the 2017 Marawi siege.
“Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State, allegedly committed by a father and son,” Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said at a news conference.
“These are the alleged actions of those who have aligned themselves with a terrorist organisation, not a religion.”

 

Police also said the vehicle which is registered to the younger male contained improvised explosive devices and two homemade flags associated with ISIS, or Islamic State, a militant group designated by Australia and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
The father and son allegedly fired upon hundreds of people at the festival during a roughly 10-minute killing spree at one of Australia’s top tourist destinations, forcing people to flee and take shelter before both were shot by police.
Some 25 survivors are receiving care in several Sydney hospitals, officials said.
Australian PM says ‘Islamic State ideology’ drove Bondi Beach gunmen
The father and son were driven by “Islamic State ideology” when they fired on crowds at Bondi Beach, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday.
“It would appear that this was motivated by Islamic State ideology,” Albanese told national broadcaster ABC.
“With the rise of ISIS more than a decade ago now, the world has been grappling with extremism and this hateful ideology,” he said in a separate interview.
Albanese said Naveed, reportedly an unemployed bricklayer, had come to the attention of Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019 but was not considered an imminent threat at the time.
“They interviewed him, they interviewed his family members, they interviewed people around him,” Albanese said.
“He was not seen at that time to be a person of interest.”
Memorial of flowers
Israeli Ambassador Amir Maimon visited Bondi on Tuesday and urged the Australian government to take all required steps to secure the lives of Jews in Australia.
“Only Australians of Jewish faith are forced to worship their gods behind closed doors, CCTV, guards,” Maimon told reporters in Bondi, after laying flowers at the temporary memorial and paying his respects to the victims.
“My heart is torn apart … it is insane.”
A string of anti-Semitic incidents in Australia has unfolded in the past 16 months, prompting the head of the nation’s main intelligence agency to declare that anti-Semitism was his top priority in terms of threat to life.
At Bondi, the beach was open on Tuesday but was largely empty under overcast skies, as a growing memorial of flowers was established at the Bondi Pavilion, metres from the location of the shootings.

Bondi is Sydney’s best-known beach, located about 8.2km (5 miles) from the city centre, and draws hundreds of thousands of international tourists each year.
Olivia Robertson, 25, visited the memorial before work.
“This is the country that our grandparents have come to for us to feel safe and to have opportunity,” she said.
“And now this has happened right here in our backyard. It’s pretty shocking.”
Ahmed al Ahmed, the 43-year-old Muslim father-of-two who charged at one of the gunmen and seized his rifle, remains in a Sydney hospital with gunshot wounds.
He has been hailed as a hero around the world, including by US President Donald Trump.
A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$1.9 million ($1.26 million).







Tougher gun laws
Australia’s gun laws are now being examined by the federal government, after police said Sajid Akram was a licenced gun owner and had six registered weapons.
Akram received his gun licence in 2023, not 2015 as had been earlier stated, police said on Tuesday.
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said gun laws introduced by the previous conservative Liberal-National coalition government following the Port Arthur massacre needed to be re-examined.
Former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, who introduced the gun restrictions in 1996, said on Tuesday he didn’t want to see gun law reform become a “diversion” from the need to tackle anti-Semitism.
Albanese had let the Jewish community down, Howard told reporters.
“He should have done more to fight anti-Semitism, a lot more,” he said.
The 15 victims ranged from a rabbi who was a father of five, to a Holocaust survivor, to a 10-year-old girl named Matilda Britvan, according to interviews, officials and media reports.
Two police officers remained in critical but stable condition in hospital, New South Wales police said.
Matilda’s aunt has spoken publicly of her family’s heartbreak, saying they were devastated by her death.
“I am beyond belief that this happened. I look on the phone and I am hoping it’s like a little big joke, not real,” Lina Chernykh told 7NEWS Australia.</p><small>2025-12-16 12:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639720-former-punjab-cm-manzoor-wattoo-passes-away' target='_blank'><strong>Former Punjab CM Manzoor Wattoo passes away</strong></a><br><p>

Ahmed was identified on social media as the bystander who hid behind parked cars before charging at the gunman from behind, seizing his rifle and knocking him to the ground. The act saved several lives, authorities have said.

“I think he’s a role model for us all and it really encompasses the Aussie spirit and I’m incredibly proud to live in the area and I think everybody is, it blows me away, absolutely blows me away,” said Adam Pogorzelski, a local resident in Ahmed’s neighbourhood, in the suburb of Sutherland, about 26 kilometres from the centre of Sydney.
Ahmed, a father of two, remains in a Sydney hospital with gunshot wounds. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited him earlier on Tuesday and told media that Ahmed will undergo more surgery.
Ahmed has been hailed as a hero around the world, including by US President Donald Trump who said Ahmed was “a very, very brave person” who saved many lives.
A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$2 million.
A 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son allegedly carried out the attack at a Jewish celebration on Sunday afternoon, killing 15 people in the country’s worst mass shooting in almost 30 years.
“I was actually proud when I saw it, I thought to myself, wow is that Ahmed, because I know him, then I looked at it twice and then I realised it was him …,” said a 20-year-old worker at a neighbouring chemist who did not wish to be named.“What he did was unbelievable.”</p><small>2025-12-16 10:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16134800ee5ca53.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961456/ihc-dismisses-justice-jahangiris-objections-on-cj-dogar-led-division-bench-hearing-fake-degree-case' target='_blank'><strong>IHC dismisses Justice Jahangiri’s objections on CJ Dogar-led division bench hearing fake degree case</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has turned down Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s objections on a division bench, led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, hearing challenges to the legitimacy of his law degree and appointment as a judge, it emerged on Tuesday.
The objections were raised by Justice Jahangiri, also an IHC judge, during the hearing of the petition challenging his qualification on Monday, with CJ Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan presiding over the proceedings.
The same bench previously also barred Justice Jahangiri from judicial work in September in the case, but the order was later set aside by the Supreme Court (SC).
Justice Jahangiri had appeared in person before the bench yesterday and presented his arguments.
A court order issued after the hearing, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said he had raised preliminary objections on the constitution of a division bench instead of a single bench to hear lawyer Mian Dawood’s petition.
Moreover, Justice Jahangiri “expressed his no confidence” in the bench on the ground of filing of an intra-court appeal against CJ Dogar in the SC, the order stated.
The court, however, observed that “on the administrative side, keeping in view the sensitive nature of allegations of having an invalid/ fake degree having been levelled against a sitting judge of this court, it was deemed conducive, proper and in the fitness of things to constitute a division bench to hear this case instead of a single bench”.
It further said, “Even otherwise, the constitution of benches to hear cases, is the sole prerogative of the chief justice.”
The court also noted that “it is not a first instance of this kind wherein the division bench has been constituted to hear a certain petition”.
Based on these observations, the court turned down Justice Jahangiri’s objection to the constitution of the division bench to hear the case for “having no force”.
On Justice Jahangiri expressing a lack of confidence in CJ Dogar on the basis of an appeal filed against the latter in the SC, the court observed that the plea had been dismissed by the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) on November 24.
In July, Justice Jahagiri, along with four other IHC judges, filed an intra-court appeal against the SC’s constitutional bench decision of upholding the seniority of the IHC that raised Justice Dogar to the top.
The five judges requested the SC not to consider Justices Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Asif as judges of IHC until they took fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194.
The intra-court appeal was fixed before the FCC following its establishment under the 27th Constitutional Amendment and eventually dismissed for non-prosecution.
Highlighting the plea’s dismissal in its order for Monday’s hearing, the IHC also cited various previous SC orders.
It noted that in the case Asif Ali Zardari vs The State (PLD 2001 SC 568), the SC had upheld that the “judge of a superior court is a keeper of his own conscience and it is for him to decide whether to hear or not to hear a matter before him”.
“In ‘Ms. Benazir Bhutto vs The President of Pakistan’ (1992 SCMR 140), the issue of transfer of case before the judge on the basis of bias was explained, and it was observed that there is a marked distinction in the approach on the question of bias between a case of a judge of a subordinate court and a case pertaining to a judge of a superior court in as much as in the former case, the superior courts do grant transfer applications on the ground of a judge having personal, pecuniary or proprietary interest in the subject matter whereas in the latter case, the Supreme Court does not grant transfer application on the above ground for want of power,” the IHC observed.
Moreover, it recalled that in M.H.Khondkhar vs The State (PLD 1966 Supreme Court 140), the SC held that an application for transfer “does not lie at all against a judge of the high court”. And in the same context, the SC “has already passed an exhaustive order in the case titled Muhammad Azam Khan Swati vs The State and another (2023 P Cr.L.J. 350)”.
In light of these rulings, the IHC also turned down Justice Jahangiri’s objection pertaining to a lack of confidence in Justice Dogar.
According to the court order, Justice Jahangiri also informed the court during Monday’s hearing that “no record relating to this case was provided to him” and requested time to engage the services of a private counsel and to obtain copies of the case.
At that, the court directed the Higher Education Commission (HEC) to provide Justice Jahangiri with its report on the matter along with annexures.
During a hearing of the case on December 8, the HEC, in its detailed report submitted to the IHC, endorsed Kara­chi University’s (KU) findings that the LLB degree of Justice Jahangiri was obtained through unfair means.
“The office is also directed to do the needful in this regard and provide copies of the instant petition along with annexures and reports of the HEC as well as of KU to the respondent,” the court order from Monday’s hearing said.
The court also summoned the KU registrar in person along with a record of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree at the next hearing on Dec 18 (Thursday).
The case
The controversy surrounding Justice Jahangiri’s law degree originated from a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations.
Subsequently, a complaint pertaining to his allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council — the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges — last year in July and a petition challenging his appointment was also filed in the IHC earlier this year by lawyer Mian Dawood.
The controversy has followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
Justice Jahangiri was also one of the six IHC judges who wrote to the SJC last year, alleging interference in judicial affairs by intelligence agencies. The letter sparked a wider debate on judicial independence and led to demands for an inquiry.</p><small>2025-12-16 10:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/161433530774ef2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961457/pia-says-flight-schedule-affected-in-4-punjab-cities-due-to-dense-fog' target='_blank'><strong>PIA says flight schedule affected in 4 Punjab cities due to dense fog</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) said on Tuesday that dense fog had affected its flight schedule in Lahore, Multan, Sialkot and Faisalabad, affecting both domestic and international operations.
In a statement, the spokesperson for the national carrier urged passengers travelling domestically and internationally to obtain the latest information about their flights before leaving for the airport.
The spokesperson said that temporary changes were made to the schedule to ensure passenger safety and to avoid unnecessary delays in flight operations.
He said that dense fog affected visibility significantly, creating challenges for aircraft during landing and takeoff. He added that passengers could contact the PIA helpline for updates on the status of their flights.
According to the weekly weather outlook issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department, cold and dry weather was likely to expected in most parts of the country on Tuesday.
“Moderate to dense fog/smog is likely to persist over Punjab, upper Sindh and plain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” it said.







Last week, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) had forecast heavy smog and fog across Punjab from Dec 12 to 16 (Tuesday) and urged citizens to adopt precautionary measures.</p><small>2025-12-16 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639693-ihc-orders-to-re-record-witnesses-statements-in-imaan-mazari-controversial-tweets-case' target='_blank'><strong>IHC orders to re-record witnesses' statements in Imaan Mazari controversial tweets case</strong></a><br><p>

The development comes as several media bodies have condemned the government’s unannounced restriction on advertisements to Dawn Media Group’s TV and radio outlets — imposed after curtailing ads to its flagship newspaper — and called on the authorities to immediately rescind the ban.
“The HRCP expresses grave concern over the rapidly shrinking space for independent and critical news reporting in the country, including the reported 13-month ban on government advertisements to the Dawn Media Group, which has recently been extended to Dawn News and CityFM89,” the commission said in a post on social media platform X on Tuesday.
“This is ironic, given that Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Dawn, championed press freedom,” it said.







The commission added that the selective withdrawal of state advertising, which constituted public funds, had increasingly been used as a “coercive instrument to pressure media organisations, influence editorial choices and penalise critical journalism”.
“We reiterate that freedom of expression and democratic accountability cannot survive where economic coercion is used to discipline the press,” it said.
The HRCP also urged the government to end such “discriminatory practices and restore an enabling environment for free, independent and responsible journalism”.
Last week, the Council of Newspaper Editors (CPNE) said Dawn was among Pakistan’s most respected media outlets, and stopping the release of government ads to the group amounted to financially crippling the organisation.
The All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) also spoke out against the stoppage of government ads to the group’s outlets, saying it was “dismayed”.
The Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) slammed the ban on ads for Dawn Media Group outlets as well, saying it had always resisted “using advertising as tools to control media and free expression”.
The Joint Action Co­­mmittee (JAC), comprising re­­presentatives of multiple journalist bodies, also criticised the restriction, saying the government was using official advertising as a tool to pressure media organisations.
Earlier this year, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) noted in its ‘Islamabad Declaration’ that Dawn has been denied advertisements by the federal and Punjab governments since October 2024 “because of its professional and critical approach in reporting and editorials”.
This was not the only way in which authorities have tried to obstruct Dawn’s reporting — after the so-called ‘Dawn Leaks’ saga, the paper’s circulation was blocked in large parts of the country, especially the cantonment areas.</p><small>2025-12-16 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639664-fake-degree-case-ihc-dismisses-justice-jahangiris-objections-to-cj-dogar-division-bench' target='_blank'><strong>Fake degree case: IHC dismisses Justice Jahangiri's objections to CJ Dogar, division bench</strong></a><br><p>

IHC’s Justice Mohammed Azam Khan passed the directives while hearing a petition filed by Mazari challenging the trial court’s November 19 order, when the court had recorded the testimonies of all prosecution witnesses. Chattha had appeared before the court while Imaan’s lawyers had marked her presence. The court, however, had ordered the prosecution to proceed with the witnesses’ testimonies.
On Tuesday, IHC’s Justice Khan observed that witnesses’ statements should be recorded again and said that the case was being referred back to the trial court without touching its merits.
During the hearing, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad told the court that senior advocate Faisal Siddiqui had submitted his power of attorney but was busy with cases in Lahore, seeking a hearing after court vacations.
He also pointed out that the Supreme Court (SC) had directed an early decision in the matter, though no specific timeframe was fixed. Last week, the apex court had stayed trial proceedings against the two until their pending appeals were decided by the IHC.
Meanwhile, the prosecutor, Raja Naveed, maintained that the complete record was available before the court.
Azad then argued that the accused were entitled to full protection under Article 10A (right to a fair trial) of the Constitution and raised the objection that the record had not been properly provided. He contended that the issue had been raised at the previous hearing as well.
During the hearing, the court also questioned whether the statement of the four witnesses had been recorded in the absence of one of the accused. At this, the prosecutor responded by saying that the conduct of the accused was also a relevant factor.
Defence counsel Azad insisted that witness statements must be recorded in the presence of the accused and sought time until Monday.
Subsequently, the court issued directives to the trial court.
The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
The complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.</p><small>2025-12-16 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16113520908469e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961446/10-people-among-passengers-kidnapped-by-katcha-area-dacoits-from-quetta-bound-bus-rescued-police' target='_blank'><strong>10 people among passengers kidnapped by Katcha area dacoits from Quetta-bound bus rescued: police</strong></a><br><p>Ten people among those who were kidnapped by Katcha area dacoits from a Quetta-bound bus near Ubauro in Sindh’s Ghotki district have been recovered, Sukkur police said on Tuesday, adding that an operation for the rescue of the remaining passengers was under way.
Around 15 dacoits had attacked the bus on Monday night and kidnapped several passengers after injuring the driver.
A statement from the office of Sukkur Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) captain (retd) Faisal Abdullah Chachar today said that 10 of the kidnapped passengers had been rescued in an overnight operation under the DIG’s command.
“Police and Rangers personnel rescued 10 of the abducted passengers after an exchange of fire [with the dacoits] in Sonmiani,” the statement said.
Quoting the rescued passengers, it added that at least two dacoits were injured during the operation.
“All routes leading to the Katcha area were blocked, preventing the bandits from taking the hostages there,” the statement said, adding that the blockade was still in place and would continue “until all bandits are eliminated”.
It further stated that the dacoits were being chased and “the fight with them is ongoing” for the recovery of the remaining passengers.
Meanwhile, the rescued passengers were taken to safe locations.
The attack
According to some videos shared on social media after 9:30pm on Monday, a passenger said a Sadabahar Company coach departed for Quetta from Sadiqabad at 8pm.
When it reached near the Murid Shaikh area near M-5 Motorway, it took a turn towards Guddu at the Punjab-Sindh border. Some 65kms from the area, the dacoits intercepted the coach and started firing.
They entered the bus after smashing the windows and asked the passengers to leave the coach, but did not harm the female passengers.
It was reported that the dacoits had kidnapped 25 passengers, but the number of abducted passengers has not been confirmed by police yet.

 

Katcha is the area of land running along the Indus River, which is divided between Punjab and Sindh. The region is notorious for banditry.
For decades, dozens of bandit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets, brutal killings and robberies on major highways occur frequently.
PTI leader’s condemnation
PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, in a statement, condemned Monday night’s incident and  called into question the efficiency of Sindh and Punjab police.
“More than twenty citizens were kidnapped; now their bids will be put up,” he said, stressing that the rulers were “failing” to protect their citizens.
He noted that Katcha areas had been declared “no-go” areas. Sheikh called for the immediate release of all the hostages.</p><small>2025-12-16 07:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/161210437131728.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961448/security-beefed-up-for-ashes-adelaide-test-after-bondi-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>Security beefed up for Ashes Adelaide Test after Bondi shooting</strong></a><br><p>Police armed with rifles will be part of a beefed up security presence at the third Test between Australia and England at Adelaide Oval after the Bondi Beach shooting attacks, officials said, while flags will be flown at half-mast.
South Australia state Premier Peter Malinauskas said extra measures would be in place for the Ashes clash that starts on Wednesday, although there was no intelligence pointing to an elevated threat level.
“Given the events that have occurred in Sydney, there will be additional protocols put in place at Adelaide Oval,” he said late Monday.
“This is done only as a precautionary measure, but it is appropriate that we are in an increasing sense of alertness just at the moment.”
An attack by a father and son on a Jewish celebration at Sydney’s Bondi Beach on Sunday killed 15 people with dozens injured.One of the assailants was killed, while the other is in a critical condition in hospital.South Australia Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said special security-response police, armed with rifles, would be present in and around the Adelaide Oval during the Test.
“There’s a balance between the concern about police officers carrying rifles in and about the community, balanced with the need for us to be able to effectively respond to an event, should an event occur and these officers are specifically trained for that purpose,” he said.
“There’s no intelligence at this time to indicate that there are any increased levels of threat or security risks around the cricket or any other community event,” he said.
Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board released a joint statement to pay tribute to the Bondi Beach victims, saying they were “horrified”.
“All of our thoughts are with the victims, their friends and families, the Jewish community and the people of Australia at this deeply distressing time,” they said.
“Our condolences go out to all those affected.”
There will be a moment of silence observed before the Test and players from both sides will wear black armbands.
“While sport can seem insignificant at times like this, we have the unusual opportunity to bring millions of people together to pay tribute, to console and to contemplate what we want our nation to be,” said Cricket Australia chief Todd Greenberg.
“We will continue to look at ways cricket can support and honour those who have been affected by the Bondi shootings and thank those who provided assistance during and since this tragedy.”</p><small>2025-12-16 07:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16114346f8bedd7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961445/pakistan-seeks-oil-deal-with-russia-as-energy-ministries-hold-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks oil deal with Russia as energy ministries hold talks</strong></a><br><p>Russia and Pakistan are in talks on a potential oil-sector agreement, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told RIA news agency in remarks published on Tuesday.

“At present, the issue is being discussed by the energy ministries of both sides.”
Russia also discussed upgrading a refinery in Pakistan with Russian companies involved, Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev had said in November.

In the deadliest terror attack in the country’s history, at least 144 people ─ mostly schoolchildren ─ were killed when heavily armed militants stormed the army-run public school on Dec 16, 2014. Seven soldiers of the Special Services Group and two officers were among the wounded.

 

In a message posted on his X account, PM Shehbaz said, “Today, we commemorate the martyrs of the APS Peshawar tragedy — the innocent children, teachers and staff whose sacrifice is forever etched in our national conscience.
“Their sacrifice remains a constant reminder of our collective responsibility to defeat terrorism,” the premier stressed.
“The Pakistani nation will always stand united, firm and unwavering in its resolve to eradicate the scourge of terrorism,” he added, praying for the families of the martyrs.







In his message, President Asif Ali Zardari remembered the sacrifices of the children and the staff, vowing to stand with the families of the martyrs.
“Today, we remember the innocent children and staff of the Army Public School whose lives were taken in the brutal terrorist attack on December 16, 2014,” he said in a message posted by his spokesperson on X.
“Their sacrifice remains a solemn reminder of the heavy price our nation has paid in the fight against terrorism,” the president said.







He vowed to stand with the families “who continue to bear this pain with courage”.
“The nation will always honour the resilience of the APS families who transformed their grief into strength for Pakistan,” he stressed. He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to eliminating terrorism, stating that the country’s resolve remained “absolute”.
“There can be no soft corner for terrorists or those who support, finance, shelter or justify them,” he said, emphasising that “there can be no negotiations with those who raise arms against the state or target our children”.
“We strongly condemn Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan,” he went on to say.
The evidence of its involvement in efforts to destabilise our country is well documented. Pakistan will continue to expose these hostile activities and will defend its people with full resolve,” he said.
The president warned terrorists’ “apologists, facilitators, and supporters” that the armed forces will not “spare them and will defeat terrorism, no matter what political, ideological or fake religious garb they try to shroud themselves in”.
President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence services “whose efforts have prevented many such tragedies.”
“We will continue to pursue every terrorist and every facilitator until justice is done,” he added.
“The memory of the APS martyrs strengthens our resolve. Pakistan will never allow the enemies of peace to succeed,” the president concluded.</p><small>2025-12-16 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639639-pakistan-renews-pledge-against-terrorism-on-11th-anniversary-of-aps-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan renews pledge against terrorism on 11th anniversary of APS attack</strong></a><br><p>

A CTD official and a civilian lost their lives and three other police personnel injured in a heavy exchange of fire took place as the armed robbers atte­mpted to loot two other banks, including National Bank of Pakistan, in Chitkan Bazaar.
Officials said over 50 heavily armed men arrived in the area in several vehicles and barged into three banks in the main bazaar area and looted millions of rupees after holding the security guards and staff hostage at gun point. 
After looting three private banks, the armed men then attempted to enter the NBP and another bank. In the meantime, officials said, police and CTD personnel reached the site and challenged them. 

Police claim to have foiled two more bank heists 

“Armed men used heavy weapons in the gun battle and lobbed grenades, which continued for at least an hour,” SSP Dost Muhammad Bugti said, adding police and CTD officials returned fire.
During the exchange of fire, the CTD official, Dura Baloch, and the civilian, Amanullah, emb­r­aced martyrdom and three other cops suffered injuries, while armed robbers fled, police said.
“The armed men belonged to a banned militant organisation,” an official of the local administration said on the condition of anonymity.
According to some media reports, armed men looted around Rs190 million from three banks. Security officials said that an operation was launched in the area to trace out the armed gang. However, no arrest was reported till filing of this report on late Monday night.
Eyewitness account said the bodies and injured were shifted to Panjgur district hospital. Two CTD and police personnel were shifted to Karachi as they rece­ived serious injuries, they said.
While lauding the timely and courageous response of the law enforcement personnel, Baloch­istan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti said CTD and police personnel demonstrated exceptional bravery and professionalism in safeguarding the lives and property of citizens.
The chief minister paid tribute to martyred CTD constable Dura Baloch, saluting his courage, sense of duty, and supreme sacrifice. He said the sacrifices of brave sons like Dara Khan would never be forgotten and that the nation remains indebted to the blood of its martyrs.
Expressing heartfelt condolences to the family of the martyred civilian, the chief minister prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the deceased. He reiterated that there was no place for terrorists and criminal elements in Balochistan and vowed that the state would continue operations against anti-state elements with full force.
Mr Bugti emphasised the sacrifices of security forces for the restoration of peace and order would not go in vain and assured that the protection of life and property of the people would be ensured at all costs.

Representatives of multiple bu­­­siness bodies urged the Sindh government to intervene and address the situation stemming from the stri­­ke, which has a crippling impact on industrial production and supply chains.
In a letter to the Sindh chief minister, Overseas Investors Chambers of Commerce Industry (OICCI) Secretary General Abdul Aleem said the situation was a very serious concern for the industry and commerce in the country.
He said he had raised this matter on Dec 12 with the Punjab and Sindh chief secretaries, but it partially eased the situation in Punjab only. However, the situation in Sindh and Karachi port, inward and outward movement of goods, has remained unchanged, he added.
“Many of our members have reported that trucks from Punjab are still unable to enter Karachi and port operations have also been severely constrained, and several major manufacturing facilities are now at imminent risk of shutdown,” he informed the Sindh CM.

Sindh CM urged to intervene to address issue as cargo unions announce nationwide boycott on 19th

“One OICCI member reported production lines shutdown this morning, with some others anticipating closures between tomorrow (Tuesday) and Wednesday,” he said, adding that “OICCI members further report that essential raw materials and finished goods are stranded across highways”.
According to Pakistan Vanas­pati Manufacturers Association (PVMA) Chairman Sheikh Umer Rehan, the supply of edible oil, ghee and essential daily-use commodities has been affected, while the transportation of industrial raw materials has come to a halt.
Mr Rehan warned the suspension of raw material supplies could paralyse the production process, leading to severe repercussions for the economy. He said the delivery of imported goods had come to a complete standstill, resulting in consignments being stuck at ports and exposing businesses to substantial financial losses in the form of demurrage and detention charges.
Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers General Secre­tary Wajid Bukhari said the goods transporters’ strike had a crippling impact on industrial production and supply chains. Prolonged disruption could result in layoffs, wage losses for workers, and long-term damage to Pakistan’s industrial credibility, he feared.
He urged the federal and provincial governments to engage in talks with the transporters, review the Motor Vehicle Ordinance 2025, and ado­pt a balanced approach that ens­ured road safety without paralysing the industry and production.
The current wave of protests by transporters began in response to the enforcement of the Motor Vehicle Ordinance 2025 on Dec 8, under which traffic auth­orities imposed increased fines, strict penalties, vehicle impoundment, and FIRs against drivers and transport operators. Trans­po­­rt unions argue that the ordinance has been implemented without adequate consultation and has made routine transport operations financially unviable.
While negotiations temporarily eased tensions in some areas of Punjab on Dec 13, major transport bodies, including the All Pakistan Transport Federation and allied goods transport associations, have now announced a nationwide wheel-jam strike on Dec 19 after expressing dissatisfaction with government assurances.
Transport leaders have warned that unless controversial clauses of the ordinance are withdrawn or substantially revised, goods and passenger transport across the country will remain suspended.

During the massacre, 147 people were killed, including 132 students and 15 staff members, while 180 others were wounded in the attack on December 16, 2014.
The siblings and parents of the martyred students and staff members assembled on Shami Road and walked to the school, raising slogans and demanding justice for their martyred children.
The parents also lit candles at the Shuhada Monument inside the school and offered prayers for the martyred students.

Shuhada APS Forum President Ajoon Khan told Dawn that despite 11 years having passed since the massacre, justice has not been delivered to the bereaved families.
He demanded that the authorities punish those advocating for the resettlement of the terrorists involved in the incident, and said a judicial inquiry should be conducted into the matter.
Khan further demanded that the report of the judicial commission, which probed the APS massacre on the Supreme Court’s directive, be shared with the parents.
Regarding activities for the 11th anniversary, Khan said that a main function would be held at the APS campus in the morning, while parents would light candles at the Shuhada APS Monument near the Archives Library on Sher Shah Suri Road.
In response to the brutal attack, the government in January 2015 launched the National Action Plan (NAP) — introducing a series of kinetic and non-kinetic measures to counter terrorism, one of which was the decision to try terrorists in military courts. In 2021, the PTI-led government decided to review NAP.
A judicial commission report submitted to the Supreme Court in 2020 highlighted the belated response to the terror attack, while acknowledging that further devastation was foiled by Mobile Vigilance Team-2 (MVT) and the Quick Response Force (QRF).
The commission also made certain recommendations, including medical and psychological treatment of the injured and the martyrs’ close relatives, as well as provision of free education to the injured and the martyred students’ siblings.</p><small>2025-12-16 03:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16075007bd54699.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961401/after-two-decades-gilgit-baltistan-to-have-local-government-polls-on-feb-14' target='_blank'><strong>After two decades, Gilgit-Baltistan to have local government polls on Feb 14</strong></a><br><p>GILGIT: After a gap of 20 years, the Gilgit-Baltistan chief election commissioner on Monday announced the holding of local government (LG) elections in the region for February next year.

He said LG elections had not been held in the region for the past 20 years and that their conduct would help resolve public issues at the grassroots level, enabling citizens to secure rights at their doorsteps.
CEC Khan described LG elections as a milestone for strengthening democratic institutions and promoting development in the region, saying local governments play a key role in any democratic system.
He said the elections would provide people with an opportunity to directly participate in decision-making and local development, adding that the election commission was determined to hold the polls in a clean, transparent, fair and lawful manner.

Meanwhile, the GB Election Commission has convened the MPC at 11am on Dec 18 (Thursday) at its secretariat to consult political parties on the holding of general elections scheduled for Jan 24.
CEC Khan expressed the hope all political parties in Gilgit-Baltistan, or their authorised representatives, would participate in the conference. The purpose of the meeting was to seek views, suggestions and guidance on key electoral matters to make the process more effective, transparent and in line with democratic principles, he added.
He asked the leaders of all political parties to attend the consultative meeting and share their valuable views and suggestions with the election commission. He reaffirmed the commission’s determination to ensure the conduct of free, fair and transparent elections with the cooperation of all stakeholders.
Due to harsh weather conditions in the region, sources said, political party leaders had already opposed the holding of the general elections on Jan 24.
While the MPC is expected to demand a delay in the polls until May, the election commission in such scenario is considering to hold the general and local government elections simultaneously, the sources added.

In a late-night announcement, the Petroleum Division said the revision followed movements in international markets and recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to the announcement, the ex-depot price of HSD has been reduced by Rs14 per litre (5pc) to Rs265.65 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs279.65 per litre. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD.
Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells, threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Transporters had already increased their fares based on an approximate Rs27 per litre increase between May and August, and have not reversed them despite a Rs9 per litre cut.
The ex-depot petrol price was kept unchanged at Rs263.45 per litre. Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government is charging Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs82 per litre on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and an Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs16-17 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and HSD are the major revenue spinners with their monthly average sales of about 700,000 – 800,000 tonnes per month compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene. The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy alone in FY2025 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470 trillion during the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-12-16 02:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16073513d5e7d8e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961376/rate-cut-too-meagre-to-address-major-challenges-industry-leaders-complain' target='_blank'><strong>Rate cut too meagre to address major challenges, industry leaders complain</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The decision of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to lower the policy rate by 50 basis points to 10.50pc drew mixed reactions on Monday, with a foreign investors’ body welcoming it while the country’s wider business community criticised it as marginal and ineffective for boosting local production and exports.
The Overseas Investors Cham­ber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) viewed the rate cut as a prudent measure.
“The State Bank has taken a cautious and measured step to ease financing conditions,” OCCI’s Secretary General and Chief Executive Abdul Aleem said.

 

Mr Aleem said the unexpected reduction is positive and will help stimulate business activities by lowering borrowing costs while preserving overall economic stability.

MNCs’ association terms SBP move ‘cautious’ for fostering stability

He added that the chamber notes that a gradual approach “allows businesses to plan investment decisions with greater confidence and helps ensure that the impact of ease remains aligned with sustainable economic growth objectives”.
However, local business leaders expr­essed immediate and deep disappointment, arguing the minor adjustment fails to address the severe challenges they face.
“Such a token adjustment falls far short of what is urgently required to revive Pakistan’s fragile economy and restore business confidence,” Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Muhammad Rehan Hanif said.
Mr Hanif said the marginal cut neither reflects prevailing economic realities nor offers meaningful relief to businesses struggling under an exceptionally high cost of doing business. Despite a visible decline in inflation, borrowing costs in Pakistan remain among the highest in the region, he said.
“Regional economies such as China, India, Bangladesh, Viet­nam, Indonesia and Sri Lanka maintain single-digit interest rates, enabling their industries to access affordable financing, expand capacity, and remain competitive in global markets, while the situation in Pakistan is opposite,” Mr Hanif said.
Mr Hanif noted when the cost of financing remains prohibitively high, businesses defer expansion plans, shut down marginal units, and reduce employment, ultimately leading to lower economic output and reduced government revenues.
Echoing that sentiment, leaders from other major trade bodies said the small reduction would fail to encourage new investment or create jobs.
“The 50 basis point cut would not resolve the industries’ problems and fail to boost exports under the challenging business environment,” Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry’s (FPCCI) Senior Vice President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon said.
“The interest rate should be brought down to a single digit to at least come at par with regional peers.”
Industries are currently burdened with exorbitant energy tariffs, high fuel prices, excessive taxation and a volatile exchange rate. Business leaders argue that maintaining a high interest rate regime suffocates productive economic activity.
Ahmed Azeem Alvi, president of the SITE Association of Industry, termed the move insufficient. “People are losing jobs every day.
The government must bring the policy rate down to single digits so that the economy can breathe and employment opportunities can grow,” he said.
Alvi added that bureaucratic hurdles and IMF conditions were preventing effective decision making.
Businessman Diwan Fakhr­uddin outrightly rejected the reduction, noting that high interest rates have made bank financing difficult to obtain, forcing manufacturing units to operate below capacity and leading to rising unemployment.
He stressed that small and medium enterprises have been particularly hard hit.
“As a result, not only has the establishment of new industries come to a halt, but existing manufacturing units are also being forced to operate below capacity,” Mr Fakhruddin said.
He urged the SBP to take into account the ground realities and announce an immediate, substantial, and effective reduction in interest rates.
Pakistan Chemicals and Dyes Merchants Association Chai­rman Saleem Valimuha­mmad said if the interest rate remains at this level, it will be impossible for businesses to grow, and the overall economic growth will continue to slow down. Unless the interest rate is brought down to single digits, there will be little hope for the improvement of the economy.

Trump accused Britain’s publicly owned broadcaster of defaming him by splicing together parts of a January 6, 2021 speech, including one section where he told supporters to march on the Capitol and another where he said “fight like hell”.

 

It omitted a section in which he called for peaceful protest.
Trump’s lawsuit alleges the BBC defamed him and violated a Florida law that bars deceptive and unfair trade practices. He is seeking $5 billion in damages for each of the lawsuit’s two counts.
The BBC has apologised to Trump, admitted an error of judgment and acknowledged that the edit gave the mistaken impression that he had made a direct call for violent action. But it has said there is no legal basis to sue.
Trump, in his lawsuit filed on Monday in Miami federal court, said the BBC despite its apology “has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses”.
The BBC is funded through a mandatory license fee on all TV viewers, which UK lawyers say could make any payout to Trump politically fraught.
A spokesman for Trump’s legal team said in a statement the BBC “has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda”.
A BBC spokesperson told Reuters earlier on Monday that it had “no further contact from President Trump’s lawyers at this point. Our position remains the same.”
The broadcaster did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the lawsuit was filed.
Crisis led to resignations
Facing one of the biggest crises in its 103-year history, the BBC has said it has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary on any of its platforms.
The dispute over the clip, featured on the BBC’s ‘Panorama’ documentary show shortly before the 2024 presidential election, sparked a public relations crisis for the broadcaster, leading to the resignations of its two most senior officials.
Trump’s lawyers say the BBC caused him overwhelming reputational and financial harm.
The documentary drew scrutiny after the leak of a BBC memo by an external standards adviser that raised concerns about how it was edited, part of a wider investigation of political bias at the publicly funded broadcaster.
The documentary was not broadcast in the United States.
Trump may have sued in the US because defamation claims in Britain must be brought within a year of publication, a window that has closed for the ‘Panorama’ episode.
To overcome the US constitution’s legal protections for free speech and the press, Trump will need to prove not only that the edit was false and defamatory but also that the BBC knowingly misled viewers or acted recklessly.
The broadcaster could argue that the documentary was substantially true and its editing decisions did not create a false impression, legal experts said. It could also claim the program did not damage Trump’s reputation.
Other media have settled with Trump, including CBS and ABC when Trump sued them following his comeback win in the November 2024 election.
Trump has filed lawsuits against the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and a newspaper in Iowa, all three of which have denied wrongdoing.
The attack on the US Capitol in January 2021 was aimed at blocking Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s presidential win over Trump in the 2020 US election.</p><small>2025-12-16 02:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16072434e5b0ede.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961408/orchestrated-campaign-against-state-unearthed' target='_blank'><strong>‘Orchestrated campaign against state unearthed’</strong></a><br><p>• Talal Chaudhry claims terrorists using social media to manipulate public opinion• Alleges PTI-linked accounts creating ‘anti-state trends’• Warns citizens against becoming part of ‘paid trends’
ISLAMABAD: As he targeted the opposition for alleged social media campaigns, State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Monday claimed that Pakistan had uncovered extensive evidence of coordinated and paid online campaigns being run through fake accounts operated largely from abroad.
According to the state-run APP, the minister said the government recently provided foreign media with background information on how terrorists and organised networks were exploiting social media platforms to manipulate public opinion in Pakistan.
The minister explained that investigations revealed how artificial trends were created and sold through WhatsApp groups and other platforms.
He said individuals were paid small amounts ranging from a few rupees to cents per post to repeatedly tweet or forward messages, sometimes hundreds of times a day. Many of these accounts, he said, originate outside Pakistan and are operated by companies using fake identities. He added that account names are frequently changed depending on the campaign being promoted, making it harder to trace their origins.
The state minister claimed the same networks had been found promoting content linked to terrorist organisations, as well as ‘unrelated international causes’, demonstrating that the activity was commercial rather than ideological. These trends are not organic or natural, he added.
Mr Chaudhry clarified that the evidence shared was gathered directly from the same social media platforms being misused, including details of temporary WhatsApp groups formed to run trends and then deleted to avoid detection. He said social media companies’ own community guidelines were being violated, leading to account closures and further action by the platforms.
While emphasising that the government did not want ordinary citizens to face criminal cases, the minister issued a clear warning, saying that if people knowingly became part of paid trends that were against the country, they could face legal consequences.
Freedom of expression is not without responsibility, he said, claiming that no one had the right to hurt religious sentiments, target friendly countries, or malign individuals and institutions under the guise of free speech.
Responding to questions, Mr Chaudhry stated that most accounts involved were fake and that privacy laws limited access to IP addresses and ownership details, although Pakistan was engaging with platforms and foreign governments to address the issue. He reiterated Pakistan’s firm condemnation of terrorism in all forms, anywhere in the world, noting that the country has long been on the front line in the global fight against terrorism.
The press conference, he said, was aimed at dispelling the notion that controversial online narratives reflected genuine public opinion. This is not popularity.
This is a money-driven mechanism operated through fake accounts across the world, Mr Chaudhry said, adding that Pakistan would continue to work with international partners to curb such activities.
PTI blamed
Mr Chaudhry also accused PTI-linked social media accounts of receiving foreign funding to promote the “enemy’s narrative and target institutions by creating anti-state trends”. He said that PTI social media accounts were being operated from abroad, mainly from North America, Europe, and some parts of South Asia, and were used specifically to create trends.
He alleged that a malicious campaign was being run against state institutions on social media, vowing that no compromise would be made on national sovereignty. He regretted that the PTI was using social media to promote a ‘specific narrative’ and said coordinated campaigns were allegedly launched to unleash propaganda against national security.
He alleged that some companies auction and sell trends and hashtags. He said certain elements were actively working against the country’s sovereignty, reiterating that the government would not compromise on national security.

Pakistan Railways Rawalpindi Divisional Superintendent Noorduddin Dawar confirmed to Dawn that the Millat Express struck a police vehicle belonging to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) that suddenly tried to cross the track at an unmanned crossing, leaving two constables dead and one injured. He added that two other constables were “safe”.
“SHO (Station House Officer) RPS (railway police station) Sargodha and SHO Cantt Sargodha Punjab Police are present at the site,” he said in a message to Dawn. “This falls under the jurisdiction of Sargodha Cantt District Police. The train has moved after a brief stop.”
Muhammad Sawar Khan, an area officer for Pakistan Railways, confirmed to Dawn that the train — which left Sargodha and headed towards Charnali railway station —was running through the unmanned crossing when a police van belonging to the SIU attempted to cross.
“The driver of the police van tried to cross the unmanned crossing without looking and was hit by the train. Two police constables died in the collision and three were injured, one of whom is in critical condition,” Khan elaborated.
The two deceased cops were identified as Constables Sibtain and Amanullah, while the other three were identified as Head Constable Muhammad Owais, Constable Abrar and Driver Constable Ziafat, according to Rescue 1122 Sargodha.
Visuals of the vehicle showed that the front end of the vehicle had been completely mangled in the collision.
According to the police, the five personnel were performing a routine patrol of the area when they attempted to cross the railway track.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IG) Dr Usman Anwar took immediate notice of the incident and demanded a report from the deputy inspector general of the SIU.
Meanwhile, a Punjab Police spokesperson said that the incident was being investigated and legal action would be taken.
Pakistan Railways has some 4,072 level crossings – 1,341 manned and 2,731 unmanned – on its 8,000 kilometres or so long operational track. At least Rs4 million are required to convert an unmanned level crossing into manned one.</p><small>2025-12-15 20:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639609-moderate-earthquake-shakes-parts-of-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Magnitude-5.2 earthquake shakes parts of Karachi, Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>
