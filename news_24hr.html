“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after Musk slammed his tax and spending mega-bill as an “abomination”.
The world’s richest man responded by live-tweeting on his X social media platform as Trump spoke on television, saying that the Republican would not have won the 2024 election without him and slamming him for “ingratitude.”
In an extraordinary rant as visiting German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sat mutely beside him, 78-year-old Trump unloaded on SpaceX and Tesla boss Musk in his first comments on the issue.
“I’m very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here … all of a sudden, he had a problem,” Trump said when asked about Musk.

The clash comes less than a week since Trump held a grand Oval Office farewell for Musk as he wrapped up his time leading the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
South African-born Musk, 53, hit back minutes later, saying Trump’s claims he had advance sight of the bill were “false”.
 






“Whatever,” he added above a video of Trump saying Musk was upset about the loss of subsidies for electric vehicles.
Musk then ratcheted up the public spat even further, saying the Republican would have lost the election without his support. He was the biggest donor to Trump’s campaign, to the tune of nearly $300 million.
“Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” Musk said on X. “Such ingratitude.”
Tesla shares fell sharply on Wall Street, down eight percent, after his comments, in a sign of the huge stakes for a falling out between the world’s richest man and its most powerful.
‘A little make-up?’
A wistful-sounding Trump took reporters through the break-up with Musk on live television, in what at times sounded more like a therapy session than a meeting with a foreign leader.
Trump talked about Musk’s farewell appearance in the Oval Office on Friday, when he turned up with a black eye that he said was caused by a punch from his son.
Musk at the time was also facing reports of drug use on the Trump campaign trail.
“You saw a man who was very happy when he stood behind the Oval desk, and even with the black eye. I said, you want a little makeup? We’ll get you a little makeup,” Trump said.
“But he said, ‘No, I don’t think so,’ which is interesting and very nice. He wants to be who he is.”
 


Trump said he could understand why Musk was upset with some steps he had taken, including withdrawing a nominee to lead the NASA space agency whom the tech tycoon had backed.
Through it all, the visiting German chancellor sat silently.
Merz had prepared to avoid a repeat of the ambushes that Trump unleashed on the Ukrainian and South African presidents in the Oval Office — but in the end it was Musk that the US president ambushed.
At the centre of the bitter row is Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” on tax and spending.
The centrepiece of his domestic agenda, it aims to continue tax cuts from his first term — and could define his second term and make or break Republican prospects in the 2026 midterm elections.
Musk, however, called it a “disgusting abomination” on Tuesday, on the grounds that it will increase the US deficit. A day later, the magnate called for Republicans to “kill the bill”, and for an alternative plan that “doesn’t massively grow the deficit”.</p><small>2025-06-05 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/052201240739a3b.jpg?r=231225' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915652/three-drown-in-canal-in-kps-malakand-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>Three drown in canal in KP’s Malakand: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>Three people drowned in a canal in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand district on Thursday, while a body was discovered in a river in Upper Dir in a separate incident, rescue officials told said.
Rescue 1122 official Nasar Khan told Dawn.com that four people, including a minor, were bathing in the canal to cool off amid intense heat.
“All four people were recovered from the canal by divers, but three of them had drowned,” Nasar said. “One person was still alive and we transported him to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Dargai.”
The official added that local residents aided rescuers in recovering the victims’ bodies.
Rescue 1122 Malakand identified the deceased as 32-year-old Alamzeb, 26-year-old Mohammad Bilal and 6-year-old Arman Khan, while the survivor was identified as 17-year-old Salman Khan.
Meanwhile, in a separate incident, Ibrahim Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Upper Dir, told Dawn.com that rescuers recovered the body of a seminary student who drowned in a river in the district’s Gandigar area.
“The student went missing three days ago,” Ibrahim said. “Rescue teams and civil defence personnel participated in a search operation.”
The student was identified as Mohammad Hilal Khan.
In April, two minor sisters drowned in the Indus River in the Shangla district’s Bisham tehsil, according to officials.
Bisham Station House Officer (SHO) Khurshid Ali told Dawn.com that the children had gone to the river to play at the river bank, where the strong current ended up drowning them.
SHO Ali said the girls’ ages, as told by their relatives, were seven and nine.</p><small>2025-06-05 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607952-indian-actions-boost-nuclear-risk-in-future-conflict-with-pakistan-warns-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>Indian actions boost nuclear risk in future conflict with Pakistan, warns Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>

India held the IWT in abeyance after the further deterioration in relations between the two countries following the April 22 Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. In retaliation, Pakistan decided that it would exercise the right to hold all bilateral agreements with India, including but not limited to the Simla Agreement, in abeyance. It also announced the closure of the Wagah border and suspension of all trade with New Delhi, among other measures.
Pakis­tan has launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team will also visit London and Brussels. The delegation comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
Addressing the  Middle East Institute in Washington, Bilawal said: “In the age of climate challenges that are to come, water scarcity and water wars used to be a theory. India shutting off Pakistan’s water supply is laying the foundations for the first nuclear water war. We have said that cutting off our water supply would be an act of war.
“We don’t say it in a jingoistic manner. We don’t say it with any relish. It is an existential crisis for us.
Any country on the planet, no matter their size, their strength or their ability, would fight for their survival and fight for their water.”
Bilawal said India must abide by the IWT and the US and other countries must take a firm stance to not allow it to violate the treaty.
“You cannot allow this precedent to be set in the Pakistan context, because we’ll fight the first war, but it won’t be the last. If India is allowed to cut off our water, that means that every upper riparian with hostilities to a lower riparian now has a carte blanche.
“And if our dialogue and diplomacy in pursuit of peace are to be successful, if we are to talk to India, have a positive dialogue with India, make new arrangements, new deals, perhaps even new treaties with India, then surely they first must abide by the old treaties and take back their decision vis-a-vis the IWT.”
He said Pakistan wanted to pursue peace for the benefit of both countries.
Bilawal criticised the Indian government, saying it had refused cooperation on terrorism, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer for cooperation on investigating the Pahalgam attack, US President Donald Trump’s mediation in the current dispute and more dialogue.
“All that means is there’ll be more terrorism, there’ll be more war, and there’ll be no peace.  The prime minister of India and his government may want to damn his people to this fate. I refuse to damn my people, and I refuse to damn the people of India to this fate, which is why my delegation and I will be traveling from capital to capital with a simple message: We want peace. We need your help.”
Working together, Bilawal said India and Pakistan could achieve a lot more than individually.
“Surely, India and Pakistan working together, we can eradicate terrorism from the subcontinent. India and Pakistan working together can create that conducive environment in Kashmir where the people that live there can live there free from oppression, suffocation, and actually see prosperity. India and Pakistan’s cooperation obviously would require the waters to flow freely, but it should lead to broader cooperation.
“The challenge of climate change and water scarcity is a challenge for Pakistan. It’s also a challenge for India. How are we going to face the coming decade? We’ve already experienced devastating floods, droughts and the manifestation of climate change in various forms.
“I believe Pakistan and India working together can meet that challenge as well. If we don’t rise to this occasion, then let there be no mistake, the blame for the carnage, the devastation, the scourge, the quarrel, will lie at the footsteps of Narendra Modi and his government. You’ve heard today, I don’t want to go into repetition.”
Further lashing out at the current Indian administration, Bilawal said: “Now they’re damning my generation, future generations, not only to fight over Kashmir, not only to go to full-out war whenever there’s a terrorist attack, but now we’re damning future generations of Indians and Pakistanis to fight over water.
“This is why I am so confident, I am so passionate in our cause. I refuse to damn the people of my country and I bear no ill will to the people of India. I refuse to damn the youth of India that my children and their children will fight over water, over Kashmir, over terrorists.”
Earlier, the high-level delegation stressed the need for dialogue with India in a series of meetings with US Congress members in Washington, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Thursday.
During Wednesday’s discussions at Capitol Hill, the delegation underscored the urgency of dialogue on the Kashmir issue, noting it was an “unfinished agenda of the United Nations”.
It stressed the imperative of respect for international law, UN Security Council resolutions and the IWT, Radio Pakistan added.
Bilawal emphasised that sustainable peace in South Asia hinged on dialogue, restraint and a just resolution of the Kashmir dispute, rather than “unilateralism or intimidation”.
He briefed members of Congress on India’s recent acts of unprovoked aggression, including the targeting of civilians, as well as the “deeply concerning” and unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.
Bilawal appreciated the US, particularly “President Donald Trump, for his constructive role in helping de-escalate tensions and supporting efforts towards a ceasefire”, according to the report.
The delegation reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance on regional peace, counterterrorism efforts and recent Indian aggression, reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment “to peace, responsible conduct, and rejection of baseless allegations”.
Meanwhile, members of the Congress welcomed the Pakistani delegation, urging “both countries to demonstrate restraint and prioritise regional peace and stability”, Radio Pakistan stated.
They reiterated the US support for the people of Pakistan and its commitment to aiding the country’s economic progress.
Separately, Bilawal posted on X that his team met with Congressmen Jack Bergman and Tom Suozzi, who co-chair the Congressional Pakistan Caucus, along with Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar and Republican Party’s Ryan Keith Zinke.
During the meeting, the Pakistani delegation underscored that enduring regional peace rested on “principled dialogue, mutual restraint, and a just settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, not unilateralism and coercion”.
 






Bergman and Suozzi were among a group of lawmakers who visited Pakistan in April and met with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir, along with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
Bergman has repeatedly voiced support for former prime minister Imran Khan, calling for his release.
On the delegation’s meeting with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, Bilawal termed the exchange constructive. The PPP chairman said they discussed “Pakistan’s deep concerns over India’s increasingly belligerent posture and its refusal to engage, whether through dialogue, joint investigation, or third-party facilitation”.
 






He also met with Democratic Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove, Ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on South and Central Asia, “for a frank discussion on peace and stability in our region”.
“Shared Pakistan’s concerns over the new abnormal imposed by Mr. Modi, where every incident by nameless actors triggers unprovoked aggression, risking war between two nuclear-armed neighbours,” Bilawal said on X.
Bilawal further met with Republican Senator Jim Banks for a “candid discussion” on regional peace and security […] and appreciated the “critical peacemaker role played by President Trump in facilitating the ceasefire understanding, intended as a pathway to broader, sustained peace and dialogue”.
“Reiterated that there is no military solution to our challenges. Only diplomacy and dialogue can deliver lasting peace in South Asia,” the ex-foreign minister added.
 






A day ago, the delegation concluded its two-day visit to the United Nations Headquarters in New York, where it met with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, along with elected and permanent members of the UN Security Council.
Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, visited Moscow from June 2 to June 4. It met with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and a senior aide to President Vladimir Putin.
On its part, India had also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, as well as meet members of the UNSC, to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.
Pakistan wants Trump to arrange talks with India
Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the recent four-day conflict had revealed the “Pahalgam incident was a false-flag operation”, and credited Trump for playing a decisive role in ensuring a ceasefire.
Addressing an event at the US Embassy in Islamabad marking the 249th anniversary of American independence, the premier said Trump had shown beyond any doubt that “he is a man for peace … and beneficial business deals”.
He added, “President Trump is a man against escalation and a man against cold and hot war.”
 






PM Shehbaz said Pakistan downed six Indian fighter jets in self-defence after Indian aggression on May 6-7 resulted in the deaths of 33 Pakistani civilians.
“We responded with restraint and patience,” he said. “Our offer for an impartial international probe into the Pahalgam incident was met with aggression instead.”
He said that India “should have come out with solid evidence and convinced the world about the occurrence of the incident”.</p><small>2025-06-05 17:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607937-karachi-experiences-29th-mild-earthquake-since-june-1' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi experiences 29th mild earthquake since June 1</strong></a><br><p>

“The level of demand seems to be sky-high,” said Serkan Toto, founder of the Kantan Games consultancy.
In the Ikebukuro shopping district of Tokyo, dozens of successful applicants to a sales lottery by electronics retailer Bic Camera lined up before the store opened to collect their devices.
“I feel like I’m going to cry,” Yumi Ohi, a 30-year-old delivery contractor, told Reuters.
Ohi had missed out in other lotteries and had come from Saitama prefecture, adjacent to Tokyo, to receive her Switch 2.
Nintendo has sold 152 million Switch home-portable devices since launching in 2017. It became a games juggernaut with titles, including two “The Legend of Zelda” titles and Covid-19 pandemic breakout hit “Animal Crossing: New Horizons”.
The Switch 2 bears many similarities with its predecessor but offers a larger screen and improved graphics, and debuts with titles including “Mario Kart World”.
“The much larger audience of Switch users should translate to stronger adoption in the opening part of its lifecycle,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst at Ampere Analysis.
“Nintendo is better prepared this time around” to deal with the high demand, he said.
The launch of the $499.99 Switch 2 is a test of Nintendo’s supply chain management during US President Donald Trump’s trade war.
Nintendo last month forecast sales of 15m Switch 2 units during the current financial year, as well as 4.5m Switch units.
President Shuntaro Furukawa said Nintendo will strengthen production capacity to respond to strong demand and focus on sales promotion in an effort to exceed the forecast.
“Given it’s a special occasion, I wanted to buy [the Switch 2] right away on its release date,” said Shinichi Sekiguchi, a hotel receptionist in his thirties.
Nintendo said it received 2.2m applications for its Switch 2 sales lottery on its My Nintendo Store in Japan. Pre-orders at Target sold out in less than two hours.
“You are looking at weeks or months until you can walk into a store and buy a Switch 2,” said Toto of Kantan Games.
Investor expectations for the new device are similarly lofty. Nintendo’s shares, which closed down two per cent in Tokyo, have gained 28pc this year.
Concerns include whether momentum for the Switch 2 will be sustained after hardcore gamers have upgraded.
“The volume of first-party games on offer at launch isn’t as strong as it could be, so some more casual users may wait and see how the games available build over the next one to two years before making the leap,” said Ampere’s Harding-Rolls.
Ampere forecasts Switch 2 sales to exceed 100m units in 2030.
“Mario Kart World” has a US sticker price of $79.99, generating debate over the price of games. Nintendo is also attracting third-party titles to the system.
“I’ve been around since the era of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and games from [that period] were expensive too so I think it’s somewhat within the acceptable range,” said Akitomo Takahashi, a salesman in his forties.
Takahashi said he was keen to play action role-playing game “Elden Ring” on his Switch 2.</p><small>2025-06-05 16:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/051744440ea25c8.jpg?r=175522' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915636/conditions-of-simla-agreement-no-longer-applicable-after-indian-iwt-violation-khawaja-asif-says' target='_blank'><strong>Conditions of Simla Agreement no longer applicable after Indian IWT violation, Khawaja Asif says</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Thursday said that the Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan was no longer applicable after the former violated the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
India held the IWT in abeyance after the further deterioration in relations between the two countries following the April 22 Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. In retaliation, Pakistan decided that it would exercise the right to hold all bilateral agreements with India, including but not limited to the Simla Agreement, in abeyance. It also announced the closure of the Wagah border and suspension of all trade with New Delhi, among other measures.
 
 

The agreement was signed between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the 1971 war; the signatories being Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi. The agreement, inter alia, stipulated that neither party would take any action unilaterally, that the disputes between the two countries would be resolved bilaterally, and that the ceasefire line would become the Line of Control.
Talking to Geo News earlier today, Asif said that the IWT had no room for any party to withdraw from it unilaterally. He said all decisions about the agreement could be taken with the joint agreement of both parties.
“If this is the case and India has begun this [attitude] then the Simla Agreement is between two parties and has no interference or patronage from the World Bank or anyone else, so the Line of Control (LoC) will revert to a ceasefire line, which was its original status as per the [UN] resolution passed at the time of the 1948 plebiscite.
“The sanctity of the Simla Agreement has been eliminated due to India’s actions,” the defence minister added, further saying that its conditions, such as for India and Pakistan to resolve issues bilaterally, were no longer applicable.
“The agreement as a whole after this episode of war has now no value.”
 


Later, a senior official from the Foreign Office told Dawn.com: “No formal decision on abrogation of any bilateral agreement with India has so far been made.”
In connection with the Kashmir dispute, the Simla Agreement stated that “the basic issues and causes of conflict which have bedevilled the relations between the two countries for the last 25 years shall be resolved by peaceful means”. It also bound both countries to discuss the modalities and arrangements for lasting peace and normalisation.
However, Pakistan argues that India violated the Simla Accord in 2019 when it unilaterally revoked Article 370, altering the status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir. This further enabled outsiders to obtain domicile and purchase property in occupied Kashmir to change the Muslim-majority demography of the valley, again termed as a violation of the agreement.</p><small>2025-06-05 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05190809bfd0083.jpg?r=191011' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915641/trump-hails-very-good-phone-call-with-chinas-xi' target='_blank'><strong>Trump hails ‘very good phone call’ with China’s Xi</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Thursday called his telephone conversation with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping a “very good phone call” and stated that the countries’ respective teams “will be meeting shortly”.
Earlier, China’s state-run news agency Xinhua reported that the call took place at Trump’s request, as bilateral relations have been strained by trade disputes.
In a post on social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote that the one and a half hour call discussed the “intricacies of the trade deal” and that it “resulted in a very positive conclusion for both countries”.
“There should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of rare earth products. Our respective teams will be meeting shortly at a location to be determined,” the president wrote, adding that the US will be represented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.
The post added that Xi “graciously invited” both Trump and First Lady Melania to visit China, with the US president reciprocating the offer.
“As [the] presidents of two great nations, this is something that we both look forward to doing,” Trump wrote. “The conversation was focused almost entirely on trade. Nothing was discussed concerning Russia/Ukraine, or Iran.”
The post concluded by stating that the president would “inform the media” as to where and when the two countries’ delegations will meet.
 


Meanwhile, Xi told Trump that both nations need to “correct the course” of bilateral relations, according to Xinhua.
“Correcting the course of the big ship of Sino-US relations requires us to steer well and set the direction, especially to eliminate all kinds of interference and even destruction, which is particularly important,” he was quoted as saying.
Additionally, Xi warned Trump that the US “should handle the Taiwan question with caution” to avoid “‘Taiwan independence’ separatists dragging China and the United States into the danger of conflict and confrontation”.
The highly anticipated call comes amid accusations between Washington and Beijing in recent weeks over critical minerals in a dispute that threatens to tear up a fragile truce in the trade war between the two biggest economies.
The countries struck a 90-day deal on May 12 to roll back some of the triple-digit, tit-for-tat tariffs they had placed on each other since Trump’s January inauguration.
Though stocks rallied, the temporary deal did not address broader concerns that strain the bilateral relationship, from the illicit fentanyl trade to the status of democratically governed Taiwan and US complaints about China’s state-dominated, export-driven economic model.
Since returning to the White House in January, Trump had repeatedly threatened an array of punitive measures on trading partners, only to revoke some of them at the last minute.
The on-again, off-again approach has baffled world leaders and spooked business executives, who say the uncertainty has made it difficult to forecast market conditions.
China’s decision in April to suspend exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets continues to disrupt supplies needed by automakers, computer chip manufacturers and military contractors around the world.
Beijing sees mineral exports as a source of leverage — halting those exports could put domestic political pressure on the US president if economic growth sags because companies cannot produce mineral-powered products. The 90-day deal to roll back tariffs and trade restrictions is tenuous.
Trump has accused China of violating the agreement and has ordered curbs on chip design software and other shipments to China. Beijing rejected the claim and threatened counter-measures.
Despite Trump’s push for a call or a meeting with Xi, China rejected that as not in keeping with its traditional approach of working out agreement details before the leaders talk.
The US president and his aides see leader-to-leader talks as vital to sort through log-jams that have vexed lower-level officials in difficult negotiations.
It’s not known when the two men last spoke.
The talks are being closely watched by investors worried that a chaotic trade war could cut into corporate earnings and disrupt supply chains in the key months before the Christmas holiday shopping season. Trump’s tariffs are also the subject of ongoing litigation in US courts.</p><small>2025-06-05 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05203124b0b1a13.png?r=203136' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915646/afghan-women-un-staff-forced-to-work-from-home-after-threats' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan women UN staff forced to work from home after threats</strong></a><br><p>Afghan women working for the United Nations in Kabul have been threatened by unidentified men because of their jobs, the organisation and several women told AFP on Thursday.
Multiple women working for various UN agencies told AFP on condition of anonymity they had been threatened on the street and over the phone by men warning them to “stay home”.
UN staffer Huda — not her real name — said that for weeks she has been bombarded with messages abusing her for “working with foreigners”.
“The messages keep coming and they are always harassing us … saying, ‘Don’t let me see you again, or else’,” the young woman told AFP. She said her office had advised her to work from home until further notice.
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) confirmed that UN staff had been threatened.
“Several United Nations female national staff members in the Afghan capital Kabul have been subjected to threats by unidentified individuals related to their work with the UN,” it said in a statement.
Considering the threats “extremely serious”, the UN has taken “interim” measures “to ensure the safety and security of staff members”, it added.
The Taliban government, accused by the UN of imposing a “gender apartheid” against women since returning to power in 2021, has denied any involvement.
Interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani said such threats were a “crime” and that police would take action. UNAMA said the authorities had opened an investigation.
Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban authorities have severely restricted Afghan women from working and it is the only country in the world where women are banned from education beyond primary school.
The government in 2022 banned women from working for domestic and international NGOs, which was extended to include the UN’s offices in the country the following year.
The policy has some exceptions, including for women working in healthcare and education, and has not been consistently enforced.
The UN has previously called the policy “deeply discriminatory”.
Selsela, in her 30s, said that while returning from the office last week, she was approached by unknown men who told her she should be “ashamed” and that she must “stay home”.
“They said, ‘We told you nicely this time, but next time you’ll have another thing coming’,” she told AFP.
“I was very scared,” she said, explaining how she struggles to work efficiently from home in a country where electricity and internet are unreliable.
“The situation for women is getting worse every day.”
Another woman, Rahila, said she and two other women colleagues were stopped by men while travelling home in a UN vehicle and told not to go to the office anymore.

She also said she wanted to see an end to prayer rooms at universities but stopped short of calling for an outright ban.
“God has to step aside. You have the right to your faith and to practice your religion but democracy takes precedence,” she told Danish news agency Ritzau.
In August 2018, Denmark banned the wearing of full-face Islamic veils such as the burqa and niqab in public places, with offenders subject to a fine.
Human rights campaigners and religious groups have criticised the ban as discriminatory and as a violation of both freedom of religion and women’s freedom of choice.
Supporters argue it enables Muslims of immigrant backgrounds to better integrate into Danish society.
Frederiksen alleged that prayer rooms at universities could be used for “social control and oppression”.
She said her government would start talks with universities to have them removed.
“It’s not a discussion about whether we want them or not,” Frederiksen said.
“We are actively taking a position that we don’t want them because they are used as a mechanism of oppression against girls and potentially boys as well.”
Frederiksen said she did not know how widespread the phenomenon was.
“For me, it’s not just the scale that matters. I’m the prime minister of Denmark. I’m also a woman. And I can’t tolerate the oppression of women.”</p><small>2025-06-05 15:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/051953173c3a64c.jpg?r=195733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915585/pilgrims-pray-and-avoid-the-sun-as-haj-reaches-peak' target='_blank'><strong>Pilgrims pray and avoid the sun as Haj reaches peak</strong></a><br><p>Worshippers prayed on Mount Arafat during the high point of Haj on Thursday as authorities urged them to avoid the hottest hours of the day after tragedy struck last year.
Thousands of white-robed pilgrims recited verses from the Holy Quran from dawn on the 70-metre rocky rise near Makkah, where the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) gave his last sermon.
But numbers thinned by midday following official warnings for pilgrims to stay inside between 10am and 4pm, a year after 1,301 people died in temperatures that hit 51.8 degree Celsius.
“I came here early to [avoid] the sun and later I will pray inside my tent,” said 54-year-old Adel Ismail, from Syria.
 


Saudi authorities have taken several steps to reduce the risk from heat at Haj, which has drawn more than 1.6 million pilgrims to one of the world’s hottest regions, according to fresh figures published on Thursday.

Shaded areas have been expanded by 50,000 square metres, thousands more medics are on standby and more than 400 cooling units have been deployed, the Haj minister told AFP last week.
The Saudis have also cracked down on unregistered, non-fee paying pilgrims, who lack access to the full amenities and made up more than 80 per cent of last year’s deaths.
On Thursday, icepacks were handed to people walking towards Mount Arafat, with some placing the small bags on their heads. With temperatures reaching 42°C, officials ushered people away if they spent too long in one place near the bouldered hill, which had fans spraying mist and cool air at its foot.
‘I don’t think about the sun’
Late on Thursday afternoon, pilgrims began making their way to Muzdalifah, halfway between Arafat and the sprawling tent city of Mina, where they will gather pebbles for Friday’s symbolic “stoning of the devil”.
Despite the heat, they were generally delighted to be performing the Haj.
“I don’t think about the sun or the temperature or anything like that,” said Ahmed, a 44-year-old from Egypt. “Because standing in Arafat is a great thing and a beautiful day, and as you can see, all the pilgrims” are doing it.

Ali, 33, from Pakistan, said he felt “blessed” to take part.
“This is something that I used to see every year on the TV screen during Haj and I always thought: ‘I wish I could be here’,” he said.
Through tears of joy, Iman Abdel Khaleq said she had wanted to perform the Haj for 10 years and was overwhelmed with emotion as she arrived at Arafat.
“It’s a big dream for me that I had almost given up hope of realising,” the Egyptian woman in her 50s told AFP from the foot of the mountain.
High-tech Haj
Saudi officials said the heat-mitigation measures implemented this Haj had largely been successful in preventing a repeat of last year.
“We are encountering a limited number of heat-related illnesses cases this year and this is evidence of the effectiveness of all the organisation measures as well as preventive measures,” said Mohammed Al-Abd Al-Aali, Saudi Arabia’s assistant minister of health.
Along with the anti-heat measures and thousands of extra personnel, Saudi Arabia is also using an arsenal of high-tech tools to help better manage crowds.
More than 15,000 cameras run through artificial intelligence software are monitoring the holy sites and walkways during an event that has a history of deadly stampedes.
 
 

This year, officials have also clamped down hard on unregistered pilgrims looking to sneak into Makkah, using raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.
Late on Thursday, a Haj ministry source said the moves had helped stave off overcrowding at the holy sites so far.
Haj permits are allocated to countries on a quota basis and distributed to individuals by a lottery. But even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs prompt many to attempt Haj without a permit, even though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.

A day ago, Pakistan was appointed chair of the committee established under Resolution 1988 (2011), which oversees the implementation of sanctions against the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan was also named vice chair of the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), which monitors implementation of Resolution 1373 (2001), a core component of the UN’s global counterterrorism architecture.
Additionally, Pakistan will serve as co-chair of two important subsidiary bodies: the Informal Working Group on Documentation and the newly formed Working Group on Sanctions.
In a post on X, the prime minister said the appointments were a “matter of great pride”.
He added: “These key appointments validate the international community’s confidence and trust in Pakistan’s counterterrorism credentials as well as an acknowledgement of our strong and unwavering commitment to eradicate this global menace.
“As one of the biggest victims of terrorism, with over 90,000 casualties and more than $150 billion economic losses, Pakistan’s sacrifices in combatting this scourge have been second to none.”
 






The Pakistan Mission to the UN had called the appointments a “significant diplomatic development”.
“These appointments represent an acknowledgement of Pakistan’s active engagement with the United Nations system, including its constructive role as an elected member of the Security Council,” a press release had said, adding, “They are also an international recognition of Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts”.
Pakistan, it said, remained committed to working with the UN and fellow member states in advancing the principles and purposes of the UN Charter as well as playing its part in the global fight against terrorism in collaboration with its international partners.
Pakistan began a two-year term as a non-permanent UNSC member on the first day of the new year. This marks Pakistan’s eighth term on the council, providing an opportunity to shape discussions on pivotal international issues, but also posing significant challenges.
Elected in June to replace Japan, Pakistan occupies one of the two Asia-Pacific seats on the UNSC. It will preside over the council in July, a key opportunity to set the agenda and foster dialogue.
While only permanent members hold veto power in the council, non-permanent members wield significant influence in terrorism-related sanctions committees, as decisions are made by consensus under established norms.
Pakistan’s term coincides with heightened tensions in conflict zones such as Gaza, held Kashmir and Syria.
The committee announcements came days after a high-level Pakistani parliamentary delegation concluded a visit to the UN headquarters in New York. The delegation wrapped up its engagements on Tuesday after a series of meetings with senior UN officials and diplomats from various member states.
During the visit, the delegation briefed UN officials on what they described as India’s escalating rhetoric and actions aimed at pushing the region towards conflict. Pakistani representatives urged the international community to take note of New Delhi’s alleged attempts to provoke a confrontation and stressed Islamabad’s commitment to regional peace and stability.
The delegation also reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to engage in comprehensive dialogue with India, including cooperation on counterterrorism, to defuse tensions and foster long-term peace in South Asia.</p><small>2025-06-05 14:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/051841416bc9da5.png?r=184149' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915623/nepra-announces-rs298-per-unit-refund-for-ke-consumers-in-june-bills' target='_blank'><strong>Nepra announces Rs2.98 per unit refund for KE consumers in June bills</strong></a><br><p>The National Elec­t­ric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday notified a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs2.98 per unit for K-Electric (KE) consumers in June’s bills for power consumed in March.
According to a notification issued by Nepra today,  the authority “decided to allow a negative FCA of Rs2.9898/kWh (negative Rs4.045 billion) for March 2025, to be passed on to the consumers in the billing month of June 2025”.
Nepra said the negative FCA would apply to “all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, domestic protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and prepaid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff”.
The adjustment would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in the respective month to which the adjustment pertains, it said.
“In case any bills of June 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” the notification said.
It also said that KE shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of March in the billing month of June.
The notification said that the negative FCA of Rs2.98/kWh was being allowed on a “provisional basis subject to adjustment” once Nepra determined KE’s Multi-Year Tariff for FY2024-30. “The difference in cost, if any, based on the MYT FY 2024-30 would be allowed in future adjustments once the same is notified,” it added.
Separately, Nepra also notified a 0.93 per unit additional FCA following an adjustment on account of variation in fuel charges for April in the approved tariff of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos).
According to a separate notification issued today, the authority “has reviewed and assessed a National Average Uniform increase of Rs0.9306/kWh in the applicable tariff for Discos on account of variations in the fuel charges for April”.
The notification said that the FCA should apply to all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, EVCS and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for prepaid tariffs.
“Discos shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of April 2025 in the billing month of June 2025,” the notification said, adding that it would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills based on units utilised in April.
“In case any bills of June 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” it added.</p><small>2025-06-05 13:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05174421e81d1ee.jpg?r=175450' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915634/japanese-startup-to-attempt-moon-landing' target='_blank'><strong>Japanese startup to attempt moon landing</strong></a><br><p>A Japanese startup will attempt a tricky lunar touchdown on Friday with an unmanned lander named Resilience, two years after its first try which crashed onto the moon’s surface.
If successful, it will be only the third private mission to the Earth’s rocky natural satellite ever completed, and the first by a company based outside of the United States.
The startup, ispace, says touchdown is expected at 4:17am Japan time on Friday (1917 GMT on Thursday) with the potentially nail-biting attempt streamed on its website.
Resilience is “ready to attempt a historic landing on the moon” and “we are confident in our preparations for success”, ispace CEO Takeshi Hakamada said last week.
“We have leveraged the operational experience gained in Mission 1 and during this current voyage to the moon,” he said in a statement.
Only five nations have soft-landed spacecraft on the moon: the Soviet Union, the US, China, India and Japan.
Companies are vying to offer cheaper and more frequent space exploration opportunities than governments.
Last year, the Houston-based Intuitive Machines became the first private enterprise to touch down on the moon. Although its uncrewed craft landed at the wrong angle, it was still able to complete tests and send photos.
Then in March this year, Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost — launched on the same SpaceX rocket as ispace’s Resilience — aced its lunar landing attempt.
Despite their rocket ride-share, Resilience took longer to reach the moon than Blue Ghost, and ispace is now hoping for its own moment of glory, after its first mission resulted in an unsalvageable “hard landing” in 2023.
Landing on the moon is highly challenging as spacecraft must rely on precisely controlled thruster burning to slow their descent.
Intuitive Machines’ second attempt at a moon landing ended in disappointment in late March.
Its spacecraft Athena, designed to touch down on a spot called the Mons Mouton plateau — closer to the lunar south pole than any previous mission — tipped over and was unable to recharge its solar-powered batteries.
Meanwhile another Japanese startup, Space One, has been trying to become the country’s first private firm to put a satellite into orbit.
Its latest rocket launch attempt in December blasted off but was later seen spiralling downwards in the distance as the company said the launch had to be terminated.</p><small>2025-06-05 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0517394274f0ce4.jpg?r=174338' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915631/trump-orders-inquiry-into-conspiracy-to-hide-bidens-health-decline' target='_blank'><strong>Trump orders inquiry into ‘conspiracy’ to hide Biden’s health decline</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered an investigation into what Republicans claim was a “conspiracy” to cover up Joe Biden’s declining cognitive health during his time in the White House.
The move, which was slammed by Biden, is the latest in a long-running campaign by Trump — with the backing of Republican Party politicians and their cheerleaders in the conservative media — to discredit his predecessor.
But it also comes as a growing chorus of Democrats begin to acknowledge the former president appeared to have been slipping in recent years.
Those concerns were thrown into stark relief by a disastrous debate performance against Trump during last year’s presidential campaign, in which the then-81-year-old stumbled over his words and repeatedly lost his train of thought.
“In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former president Biden’s aides abused the power of presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden’s cognitive decline,” a presidential memorandum issued on Wednesday reads.
“This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden’s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.”
‘Ridiculous and false’
Biden vehemently denied the allegations.
“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,” he said in a statement shared with AFP.
“Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false,” he said, slamming the ordered probe as “nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation”.
Republicans have long claimed that Biden was suffering from intellectual decline even as the White House pressed ahead with major legislation and presidential decrees during his term.
They cite his infrequent public appearances, as well as his apparent unwillingness to sit for interviews as evidence of what they say was a man incapable of doing the demanding job of Commander-in-Chief of the United States.
They insist that those around him covered up his physical and cognitive decline, taking decisions on his behalf and using a device that could reproduce his signature to allow them to continue to run the country in his name.
‘Autopen’
“The Counsel to the President, in consultation with the Attorney General and the head of any other relevant executive department or agency … shall investigate … whether certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden’s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President,” the memorandum says.
The probe will also look at “the circumstances surrounding Biden’s supposed execution of numerous executive actions during his final years in office [including] the policy documents for which the autopen was used [and] who directed that the President’s signature be affixed.”
Biden’s calamitous debate performance ultimately sank his bid for reelection, with key Democratic Party figures soon calling for him to drop out of the race.
But it was only several weeks later, after unsuccessful attempts to quieten his critics, that he withdrew, anointing his vice-president Kamala Harris, who eventually lost to Trump.
The Democratic Party is increasingly riven by squabbles about whether Biden could have been forced to step down earlier to give the party chance to find a more popular presidential candidate.
Biden’s former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday criticised the in-fighting by the Democrats, calling it a “betrayal” of Biden and announcing her departure from the party as a result.
The fight has been given oxygen with the publication of a book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that claims the former president’s inner circle connived to keep him from public view because of his decline, which included forgetting familiar faces like Hollywood star and party stalwart George Clooney.
Trump’s claims of a cover-up were also boosted by news that Biden is suffering from an “aggressive” prostate cancer, with some voices on the right insisting — without evidence — the diagnosis must have been known some time ago to those close to the former president.</p><small>2025-06-05 12:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607912-pakistan-terminates-simla-agreement-with-india-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Simla Agreement lost its 'sanctity' due to India's unilateral actions: Asif</strong></a><br><p>

The security situation in Balochistan has deteriorated, with militants escalating attacks as part of a long-running insurgency. Last month, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” post-Pahalgam to intensify terrorism in Pakistan, citing “irrefutable evidence” of state-sponsored attacks directed by Indian military personnel. He said “credible intelligence” showed India tasked groups such as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban and other militant cells to ramp up activity.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Bugti referred to the attacks in his province and said: “This is a completely Raw-funded intelligence-driven war against the state of Pakistan.”
He said India changed its narrative after suffering a crushing blow by Pakistan’s security forces during their recent military escalation.
“Pakistan army gave a befitting reply to Indian aggression. The failure of Operation Sindoor ignited the Indian proxy Fitna ul Hindustan,” he said, adding that the Indian media shared fake news about an attack on Karachi port.
 


Last month, India and Pakistan engaged in a military confrontation over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
New Delhi launched air strikes killing civilians, prompting Pakistan to down five Indian jets in retaliation. After reciprocal strikes on airbases, American intervention on May 10 secured a ceasefire.
During his press conference, CM Bugti showed a video of what he said was an “Indian proxy” agent talking to an unknown person — that the chief minister claimed was a RAW handler — sharing intelligence about Karachi port as evidence of Indian involvement.
“The government has sufficient evidence against Fitna ul Hindustan which will be shared at appropriate time,” he said. “The enemy wants to destroy Pakistan’s emerging economy.”
The chief minister said these “Indian proxies” had no connection with the Baloch identity, but were terrorists attacking Pakistani citizens and security forces.
“They should not be connected with Baloch identity. The Baloch have their own culture but they [terrorists] have [done away with] all norms. They are terrorists killing innocent Pakistanis and attacking security forces,” the chief minister said.
In reply to a question, he said the government could launch an operation in Balochistan against the terrorists, but security forces were focusing on small kinetic operations.
“There can be an operation in Balochistan like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but it is not in law enforcement agencies’ capacity,” he said. “The solution is small, kinetic operations which security forces are conducting.”
“If required, we will not hesitate to use the military to conduct an operation.”
Bugti said terrorist capacity had risen due to US gadgets available on the black market and weapons supplied by RAW.
“The solution is small kinetic IBOs (intelligence-based operations).”
Regarding the issue of missing persons, the chief minister said that “a narrative had been built” against the state on a controversial subject.  “There is a missing count. There are people missing in KP. No one speaks about them,” he said.
He said the Balochistan government passed legislation to set up centres where radicalised youth would be trained to reintegrate them into society.
“They will be kept there, their parents will be there, a magistrate will be present. A high-powered board chaired by BHC (Balochistan High Court) chief justice will be giving them extension,” he said.
Bugti also said there was a difference between “self-disappearance” and enforced disappearances.
“Many have self-disappeared. That’s why we passed a law and political dialogue will continue,” he added.</p><small>2025-06-05 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0517143775999d5.jpg?r=171835' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915624/putin-ready-to-help-resolve-iran-nuclear-stand-off-kremlin' target='_blank'><strong>Putin ready to ‘help resolve’ Iran nuclear stand-off: Kremlin</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to “help resolve” the standoff between Iran and the United States over Tehran’s nuclear programme, the Kremlin said on Thursday.
“We have a close partnership with Tehran. And President Putin said that he was ready to use this partnership to help resolve the Iranian nuclear issue,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
After a call between the leaders on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said Putin had offered to “participate” in talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, as Trump accused Iran of “slow-walking” its response to Washington’s offer of a deal.
Washington and Tehran have held five rounds of talks since April to thrash out a new accord to replace the nuclear deal that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.
Trump said on Monday that his administration would not allow “any” enrichment of uranium, despite Tehran’s insistence that it has the right under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said earlier on Wednesday that Washington’s proposal was against Tehran’s national interest.
Russia and Iran have deepened their military ties amid Moscow’s military offensive on Ukraine. The Kremlin said earlier this week that Tehran had the “right” to a run a peaceful nuclear energy programme.</p><small>2025-06-05 12:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/051645196ec8982.png?r=164701' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915610/ptis-omar-ayub-requests-committee-formation-to-appoint-new-chief-election-commissioner' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Omar Ayub requests committee formation to appoint new chief election commissioner</strong></a><br><p>Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan on Thursday submitted a request to National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq to constitute a committee to appoint a new chief election commissioner (CEC) and two new members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
The constitutional deadline for the appointment of a new chief election commis­sioner and two members of the ECP exp­ired on March 12, with no action from the government.
On Wednesday, it emerged that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrote a letter to Ayub inviting him to join consultations to appoint a new CEC. No exact date for a meeting was given, nor were any names released about prospective CECs in the letter, dated May 16.
In today’s letter to the NA speaker — seen by Dawn.com — Ayub recalled a previous letter written on January 15 in which he requested that the parliamentary process to appoint a new CEC be initiated.
“I am writing once again to remind you that a considerable period has passed since the expiry of the Chief Election Commissioner’s tenure,” Ayub wrote.
In accordance with parliamentary procedure, the opposition leader nominated six members of the opposition; two from the National Assembly and two from the Senate.
The nominees from the lower house were PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser, Sunni Ittehad Council Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza and MNA Latif Khosa.
Senators Shibli Faraz and Allama Raja Nasir were Ayub’s nominees from the upper house.
Ayub requested that “the process for the formation of the Parliamentary Committee under Article 213(2B) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (The parliamentary committee to be constituted by the speaker shall comprise fifty per cent members from the treasury benches and fifty per cent from the opposition parties) be initiated at the earliest, to facilitate the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and two members of the Election Commission of Pakistan from Sindh and Balochistan”.
The 26th Constitutional Amendment allowed the CEC and its members to continue until their successors take the position. As per Article 215(4) of the Constitution (vacancy in the office of the Commissioner or a member
shall be filled within 45 days), the appointment of the CEC and members must be completed within 45 days.</p><small>2025-06-05 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607906-met-office-issues-severe-heatwave-alert-for-eid-holidays' target='_blank'><strong>Met Office issues severe heatwave alert for Eid holidays</strong></a><br><p>

State prosecutors say Mohamed Soliman, 45, faces nearly 400 years in prison on attempted murder charges in state court. He also faces other state charges.
Prosecutors on Wednesday said the number of people injured in the attack rose to 15 ranging in age from 25 to 88. A dog also was injured. Soliman also faces federal hate crimes charges that carry a life sentence. A federal court appearance is scheduled for Friday.
 
 

The Boulder public defenders office, listed in court documents as representing Soliman, did not respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors say that Soliman, an Egyptian national, on Sunday tossed Molotov cocktails and yelled “Free Palestine” at people taking part in an event organised by Run for Their Lives, an organisation devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized during Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, sparking the devastating onslaught in Gaza.
The incident comes as pressure on Israel rises to cease what has been called a “genocide” in Gaza by the United Nations and Amnesty International among other international human rights organisations.
Soliman entered the US on a tourist visa in 2022 and recently lived in Colorado Springs. Federal officials say he had overstayed that tourist visa and his work permit had expired, and he was in the country illegally.
His family, including his wife, two teenagers and three younger children, were taken into custody on Tuesday and may be deported, though a federal judge on Wednesday blocked their immediate removal.
The attack was the latest act of violence aimed at Jewish Americans amid Israel’s escalating military offensive in Gaza, which has so far killed over 54,000 Palestinians, prompting growing criticism from the international community.
It followed the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy aides that took place outside Washington’s Capital Jewish Museum last month.

Shira Weiss, the global coordinator for the Run for Their Lives grassroots movement, said the Boulder attack had stunned her organisation, which has 230 chapters around the globe.
 
 

Weiss said it was bewildering why the organisation — which she said is apolitical, aims to stay out of policy arguments and that had never threatened before — was targeted by Soliman.
“This is so sad that we were trying to do something positive and something good, and this horrible thing happened,” she said.
Following the attack, Weiss asked local chapters to pause their short weekly walks, but overwhelmingly heard back that people wanted to carry on.
About 80 per cent of chapters will hold their weekly walks as scheduled this weekend. That includes a Sunday walk in Boulder, which will coincide with the city’s 30th annual Jewish festival, which organisers said would go on with heightened security measures and a focus on the efforts of Run for Their Lives.
Weiss has received 20 enquiries about starting new chapters since the attack in Boulder, and has also seen an increase in the number of people wanting to walk with existing groups.
Maya Bajayo, organiser for the Denver chapter of Run for Their Lives, said the group will join the Boulder chapter on its Sunday walk. Despite anxieties about security, she expects that all 50 regular members of her group would participate.</p><small>2025-06-05 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607900-pti-names-lawmakers-for-parliamentary-committee-to-appoint-cec-ecp-members' target='_blank'><strong>PTI names lawmakers for parliamentary committee to appoint CEC, ECP members</strong></a><br><p>

Day temperatures are likely to remain 5 to 7°C above normal from June 7-12 in Peshawar, Swabi, Mardan, Charsadda, Nowshera, Kohat, Hangu, Bannu, Karak, Lakki Marwat, Khyber, Kurram, Orakzai, Waziristan, Tank, Dera Ismail Khan, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur and Mohmand, according to a PDMA advisory dated June 5, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
“Additionally, dust storm/rain-thunderstorm associated with gusty winds are expected over the province,” PDMA said.
It noted that rising temperatures in upper areas may enhance the snowmelt rate during the forecasted period, and advised precautionary measures be taken to avoid any loss of life, damages to crops/ infrastructure and livestock.
The general public, especially senior citizens and children, should avoid direct exposure to sunlight during peak hours between 10am-5pm.
The PDMA said it was necessary to ensure that the general public was “made aware to make judicious use of water for drinking and cooling-off.”
Individuals with underlying health conditions were encouraged to remain especially vigilant and ensure they have necessary medical supplies readily available.
The PDMA advised to promote the use of appropriate protective measures, such as lightweight, loose-fitting and light-coloured clothing, along with SPF and hats.
“Educate the public about the signs and symptoms of heat-related illnesses (ie
dehydration, heat exhaustion, heatstroke) and necessary steps to take when
experiencing these symptoms,” the advisory said.
The KP Health Department, in coordination with local administration, was directed to mobilise resources to establish heatstroke centers, cooling points, and mobile cooling stations at high-traffic areas.
“Ensure the facilities are equipped with adequate cooling equipment (air
conditioners, fans, misting systems) and drinking water [and] have trained personnel available to provide immediate medical assistance if needed.”
Additionally, farmers were advised to manage their wheat harvesting keeping in view the weather conditions, and to take care of their livestock as well.
The advisory requested that emergency services, such as Rescue 1122 and the fire brigade remain alert against possible fires.</p><small>2025-06-05 11:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607835-pm-shehbaz-embarks-on-two-day-official-visit-to-saudi-arabia-today' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz reaches Saudi Arabia on two-day official visit</strong></a><br><p>

On Monday, Karachi police arrested a main suspect along with two of his employees over charges of beating a citizen named Dheeraj. The suspect, identified as Salman Farooqi, was arrested from DHA and his vehicle was impounded.
Farooqi, who was travelling in a luxury car, allegedly assaulted a motorcyclist accompanied by a woman on the Khayaban-i-Ittehad Road following a minor accident.
A judicial magistrate on Tuesday remanded Farooqi and his guard, Owais Hashmi in police custody in the case. They were produced in court today by the police following the completion of their two-day remand.
Today, Dheeraj appeared in court and identified the suspect.
“I was not aware that the court had summoned me,” he said. “The lawyer told me today, so I appeared.”
The judicial magistrate asked Dheeraj whether he was facing any sort of pressure.
“It was my fault, my bike hit his car,” Dheeraj told the court.
“I do not want to file a case. I forgive the suspect,” he said, adding  “Whatever the court decides, I will have no objection.”
Public Prosecutor Irfana Qadri told the court that a case had been registered against the suspect for threatening and humiliating a woman, identified as Dheeraj’s sister Kalpana.
“These are non-bailable charges,” Qadri said. The court reserved its verdict after the lawyers’ arguments.
In a separate hearing, however, Additional District and Sessions Judge Abdul Zahoor Chandio rejected the bail application filed by Farooqi and Hashmi.
A case had been registered against the suspects at the Gizri police station on the complaint of an eyewitness citizen.
Dheeraj filed a no objection certificate (NOC). However, the sessions court noted that the affidavit appeared to have been submitted under undue influence or coercion and did not accept the NOC.</p><small>2025-06-05 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607876-with-us-lawmakers-pakistan-delegation-raises-indias-provocations-stresses-dialogue' target='_blank'><strong>With US lawmakers, Pakistan delegation raises India's provocations, stresses dialogue</strong></a><br><p>

They added that Faisal Sagheer, 45, allegedly killed his wife Sana, 35, and 10-year-old son Mohammed Ali. Later on, he attempted suicide by cutting his throat and got injured.
Surjani Town police SHO Mohammed Ali Shah told Dawn that Faisal owned a hardware shop in the area but on the day of the incident, he did not open it.
His children study the Quran at the home of his sister in the vicinity of the same area, but on that day they did not attend the class as well.
It triggered suspicion among his relatives. Faisal’s sister made calls on the cell phone of her sister-in-law, which was on, but no one responded. Ultimately, she visited the residence of her brother in Yusuf Goth near Karimi Chowrangi, knocked at the door but did not get any response.
Then she saw from a window that both her brother and sister-in-law were struggling for their lives. She raised alarm, alerting neighbours who entered the home with the help of a ladder. They took them to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital where the woman and her son were pronounced dead on arrival while Faisal was admitted in critical condition.
The officer said that Sana sustained cuts while her son’s cause of death is yet to be ascertained. The couple’s two daughters remained safe.
 
 

He said it appeared that Faisal did not want to kill his son. He hinted at the possibility that he might have given tranquiliser to his family, which might have led to the death of the minor son due to the overdose. He said the couple’s daughters did not wake up till afternoon, which indicated the possibility that they might have been given a tranquiliser, but they remained safe.
The officer said the husband killed his wife by putting a piece of cloth on her face and suffocated her.
He said it seemed that the man stabbed his wife to death for some reason and later on tried to kill himself as he did not want to stab and kill his children, but one of his children died due to an overdose of drugs.
However, he said the exact cause of death of the son would be ascertained after a post-mortem examination as there were no injury marks on the body.
In a statement, the officer said when the police arrived at the spot, the house was locked from the inside.
The couple’s two daughters Bareeda and Aimal were present in the house. They told the police that they usually wake up at 10 or 11am but on that day, they woke up at 4pm, indicating a strong possibility that they were given sleeping pills or something.
The police have recovered the knife used in the incident.
“Different aspects of the incident are being probed and after completion of the investigation, an FIR will be registered,” according to the police statement.
“The case has been almost solved as a strong possibility has emerged during investigation so far that the injured man Faisal killed his wife and son and then attempted suicide,” said SSP Mastoi.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said the husband is alive but in critical condition with cut injuries while the wife had sustained fatal cuts.
Dr Summaiya added that the minor boy has no visible marks of violence. All samples have been collected and cause of death reserved.

The accused was presented before Judicial Magistrate Ahmed Shehzad Gondal by the federal police. Tensions rose in the courtroom when the magistrate noticed the absence of both the prosecutor and the district public prosecutor.
Expressing his displeasure, Magistrate Gondal said: “Where are the prosecutors of my court? Usually, no one shows up, but today the courtroom is full.”
Upon being informed by the duty prosecutor that the regular prosecutor was on leave, the magistrate ordered the presence of the district prosecutor before the proceedings could continue. The hearing was briefly adjourned, and the accused was taken back into police custody while awaiting the district prosecutor’s arrival.

Identification parade to be conducted once victim’s mother, aunt return from Chitral

Senator Falak Naz was also present in the courtroom during the hearing.
 
 

Later, upon reviewing the investigation officer’s request, the magistrate approved the remand and ordered Omar Hayat to be sent to jail for 14 days for the purpose of conducting an identification parade.
The suspect had allegedly murdered 17-year-old Sana Yousaf at her house in G-13 on Monday. He was arrested from Faisalabad within 20 hours of the incident. Additionally, the victim’s mobile phone and the murder weapon were also recovered from his possession.
“The ruthless killer took the phone with him after the murder to destroy evidence. In order to apprehend the accused, raids were conducted at over 11 locations in three cities. The accused is a 22-year-old unemployed man who repeatedly attempted to contact the victim. Upon her refusal to respond, he committed the murder,” said the police.
Moreover, the mother and aunt of Sana Yousaf are likely to identify the suspect arrested by the police in connection with the teenage girl’s murder, Dawn has learnt.
Police officers said that on Wednesday, the suspect was sent to Adiala jail on a 14-day judicial remand for the identification parade.
 
 

They said that a case had been registered over the murder in response to a complaint lodged by the victim’s mother, Farzana Yousaf. According to the FIR, the victim’s aunt was present in the house, while her father was outside.
However, the FIR does not clearly state whether the victim’s mother was present in the house at the time of the murder, the officers added. They said the family of Sana Yousaf had left for their hometown in Chitral along with the body for burial.
The police will request the mother and aunt to return as soon as possible for the identification parade.
The victim’s aunt, who also resides in Chitral, had come to Islamabad a few days ago to visit her brother (Sana Yousaf’s father) and was present in the house at the time of the murder.
The officers said that, so far, the investigators only have evidence in the form of geo-fencing data, recovery of an iPhone from the suspect, and CCTV footage. The suspect has yet to be interrogated, as no witness has so far recorded a statement regarding the murder.
However, there are two potential witnesses. The aunt who was present at the scene and the mother, on whose complaint the case was registered.
So far, the police have made successful efforts to trace and arrest the suspect and obtained his judicial remand for further legal action, the officers said. The investigation into the murder will gain momentum after the identification parade and recording of witness statements.
The police are also tracing other individuals considered as suspects who may have either assisted the suspect or been used by him intentionally. After committing the murder, the suspect reportedly left the victim’s house in a car driven by another person and reached Chungi No 26, from where he boarded a passenger vehicle.
The police will also investigate the ownership of the weapon used in the murder — whether it was licensed or illegal — and determine who owned or lent it to the suspect.
Bringing the weapon to the victim’s house suggests that he came there with the intent to harm her, the officers added.

• 105 rearrested out of 216 escapees so far
• Meetings between families, inmates resume
KARACHI: Police and allied agencies are taking all-out efforts to recapture over a hundred prisoners who escaped from District Prison Malir on Monday night and are still at large, officials said on Wednesday.
The jailbreak began on Monday night and continued into the early hours of Tuesday after hundreds of prisoners — spooked by low-intensity quakes — were allowed into the prison courtyard. Later, the prisoners snatched guns from prison staff and forced open the main gate after a shootout and fled.
Officials said that 216 inmates had managed to break out of the prison and by Tuesday night 83 of them had been rounded up and police teams were carrying out raids to bring in those still at large.
On Wednesday, jail officials accompanying Sindh Prisons Minister Ali Hasan Zardari during his visit to the Malir jail told the media that out of 216 escapees, a total of 105 prisoners had been recaptured and 111 prisoners were still at large.
They said meetings of prisoners with their families have been resumed amid strict security arrangements.
The minister was briefed about the jailbreak and escape of over 200 prisoners following a small-intensity earthquake in the area.
However, he did not speak much about the high-profile incident, saying the Sindh government had formed an inquiry committee and it would not be advisable for him to talk prior to their findings.
Accompanied by newly appointed DIG-Prisons Aslam Malik, Malir jail superintendent Shahabuddin Siddiqi and Malir SSP Kashif Abbasi, the minister said escaped prisoners were returning back to the jail voluntarily. He promised that no action would be taken against such prisoners.
He said the jail would be upgraded to accommodate more prisoners while new barracks would be constructed. He said the prisoners are getting all facilities as per jail manual.
Following the jailbreak, the Sindh government had formed a two-member inquiry committee comprising Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi and city police chief Javed Alam Odho to conduct a thorough investigation.
The Sindh chief minister had ordered the removal of Inspector General of Prisons Qazi Nazir and suspended DIG-Prisons Hassan Sehto and Jail Superintendent Arshad Hussain.
The now-suspended prison superintendent had claimed in his report that prisoners became agitated due to tremors and started raising a commotion and shouting from the barracks. When security staff rushed to control the situation, many of the inmates broke down the doors of the barracks at Circle No IV, overpowered the jailer and other security staff and rushed towards the main gate.
Ordinance promulgated
Also on Wednesday, acting Sindh Governor Awais Qadir Shah promulgated an ordinance — the Sindh Prisons & Corrections Service (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 — empowering the Sindh chief minister to appoint an officer of the Police Service of Pakistan, Pakistan Administrative Service or Provincial Management Service as the prisons IG and DIG in place of officers belonging to the regular prisons service.
Governor Kamran Tessori is out of country and in his absence Sindh Assembly Speaker Shah became the acting governor.
Officials said that after the new law, the provincial government can post police officers as SSP and SP of prisons across the province.
They said that the decision was taken against the backdrop of the Malir jailbreak.

• Fear has gripped media industry, judge told
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday issued a final deadline to the federal government to respond to the identical petitions filed against “co­­ntroversial amendments” in the cybercrimes law, and hinted at deciding the matter ex parte if re­­plies to the challenges were not received.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas issued final notices to the Ministry of Law and Justice, Mi­­nistry of Information Techno­logy, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA, and the Pakistan Telecom­munication Authority (PTA) to submit their replies to the petitions filed against controversial amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
The judge made it clear that the hearing will proceed even if responses were not filed.
The petitions filed by the Pak­istan Federal Union of Journa­li­s­­ts, anchorpersons, and various journalist organisations have chal­­lenged the expanded scope of Peca, which, they argue, crimina­lises journalistic activity and curtails press freedom. During the hearing, several senior media rep­­­resentatives appeared in court.
Imran Shafiq, counsel for the pe­­­­­titioners, informed the court that only the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Information had filed partial responses, while the Ministry of Law, PTA, and other agencies concerned had ei­­ther sub­­mitted incomplete replies or igno­red the court’s orders altogether.
He accused the government of using delaying tactics, highlighting that it had raised jurisdictional objections. He asserted that only a constitutional bench could hear the case under the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
He argued that this objection was unfounded.
“This is merely an attempt to prolong the proceedings,” Mr Shafiq told the court, also pointing out that one of the government’s objections mentioned a verse from the Holy Quran that suggests caution before sharing information publicly. He alleged that the government had done so to justify the registration of FIRs against journalists.
Senior journalist Mazhar Abbas emphasised that an atmosphere of fear had gripped the media industry, adding that journalists were routinely harassed, summoned by the FIA, and threatened with arrest for performing their professional duties.
“We are not demanding any special treatment,” Mr Abbas said, adding, “We only ask for the protection of our constitutional rights and the right to report freely.”
Advocate Riasat Ali Azad urg­ed the court to issue an interim stay order to prevent the registration of FIRs and arrests of journalists.
Besides, he suggested the court should impose a fine of Rs500,000 on the agencies for failing to comply with court orders.
Justice Minhas wondered whether journalists were being truly prevented from reporting.
In response, Adnan Haider said, “We are fighting a war on social media just like the army defends the country in a war.”
The court granted a final opp­ortunity to the government depa­rtments to file their responses and adjourned the hearing to the second week of July.

Trump said the measure was spurred by a makeshift flamethrower attack on a Jewish protest in Colorado that US authorities blamed on a man they said was in the country illegally.
The move bans all travel to the United States by nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
 
 

Trump also imposed a partial ban on travellers from seven countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Some temporary work visas from these countries will be allowed.
The bans go into effect on Monday, the White House said.
“The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted,” Trump said in a video message from the Oval Office posted on X.
“We don’t want them.”
 






World Cup, Olympics excluded
The ban will, however, not apply to athletes competing in the 2026 World Cup, which the US is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico, as well as the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Trump’s order said.
Trump separately on Wednesday announced a ban on visas for foreign students who are set to begin attending Harvard University, ramping up his crackdown on what he regards as a bastion of liberalism.
The US leader compared the new measures to the “powerful” ban he imposed on a number of mainly Muslim countries in his first term, which caused travel disruption across the world.
 
 

Trump said that the 2017 ban had stopped the US from suffering terror attacks that happened in Europe.
“We will not let what happened in Europe happen in America,” Trump said.
“We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen.”
Venezuela hit back by warning that the United States itself was a dangerous destination.
“Being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans,” Venezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said after the announcement, warning citizens against travel there.
Trump’s new travel ban could, however, face legal challenges, as have many of the drastic measures he has taken in his whirlwind return to office.
‘Terrorists’
The White House unveiled the new ban with virtually no warning, minutes after Trump had addressed some 3,000 political appointees from his balcony at a celebratory “summer soiree”.
Trump also made the announcement with no reporters present, an unusual move after sharing many of his most headline-grabbing policy announcements at signing ceremonies in the Oval Office.
But rumours of a new Trump travel ban had circulated following the attack in Colorado, with his administration vowing to pursue “terrorists” living in the US on visas.
 
 

Suspect Mohammed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national according to court documents, is alleged to have thrown fire bombs and sprayed burning gasoline at a group of people who had gathered on Sunday in support of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.
US Homeland Security officials said Soliman was in the country illegally, having overstayed a tourist visa, but that he had applied for asylum in September 2022.
“President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson said on X.
 






Trump’s proclamation gave specific reasons for each country in his proclamation, which says it is aimed at protecting the United States from “foreign terrorists and other national security” threats.
Notably, Egypt was not on the list of countries facing travel restrictions.
For Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and war-torn Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen, it said they lacked “competent” central authorities for processing passports and vetting.
Iran, with which the United States is in negotiations on a possible nuclear deal, was included as it is a “state sponsor of terrorism”, the order said.
“The impact of the ban will once again be felt by Americans who were denied the ability to see their loved ones at weddings, funerals, or the birth of a child,” said National Iranian American Council president Jamal Abdi.
For most of the other countries, Trump’s order cited an above-average likelihood that people would overstay their visas.
Trump administration ramps up attack on Harvard, Columbia
Meanwhile, Trump ramped up his campaign against top US universities on Wednesday, banning visas for all foreign students coming to attend Harvard and threatening to strip Columbia of its academic accreditation.
Trump is seeking to bring the universities to heel with claims that their international students pose a national security threat, that they ignored anti-Semitism on campus, and perpetuate liberal bias.
A proclamation issued by the White House late on Wednesday declared that the entrance of international students to begin a course at Harvard would be “suspended and limited” for six months, and that existing overseas enrollees could have their visas terminated.
“Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” said the order.
“I’m trembling. This is outrageous,” Karl Molden, a Harvard government and classics student from Austria, told AFP.
“He is abusing his executive power to harm Harvard as much as he can.”
 
 

“My god!” said another international student at Harvard, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, on learning of the executive order.
“This is such a disgrace.”
The announcement came after the Trump administration’s earlier efforts to terminate Harvard’s right to enrol and host foreign students were stalled by a judge.
The government has already cut around $3.2 billion of federal grants and contracts benefiting Harvard and pledged to exclude the Cambridge, Massachusetts institution from any future federal funding.
Trump has also singled out international students at Harvard, who in the 2024-2025 academic year accounted for 27 per cent of total enrollment, and a major source of income.
“This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights,” a university spokesman said.
“Harvard will continue to protect its international students.”
 
 

The latest sweeping action against Harvard came as Trump’s education secretary threatened on Wednesday to strip Columbia University of its accreditation.
The Republican has targeted the New York Ivy League institution for allegedly ignoring harassment of Jewish students, throwing all of its federal funding into doubt.
Unlike Harvard, several top institutions — including Columbia — have already bowed to far-reaching demands from the Trump administration, which claims that the educational elite is too left-wing.
But Wednesday’s official action suggested it was not enough for Trump.
“Columbia University looked the other way as Jewish students faced harassment,” US Education Secretary Linda McMahon said on X.
 






She accused the school of breaking rules prohibiting recipients of federal funding from discriminating on the basis of race, colour, or national origin.
In the statement, the US Education Department said its civil rights office had contacted Columbia’s accreditation body about the alleged violation.
Withdrawing Columbia’s accreditation would see it lose access to all federal funding — a very significant proportion of the university’s income. Students attending the university would also not be able to receive federal grants and loans towards tuition.
Critics accuse the Trump administration of using allegations of anti-Semitism to target educational elites and bring universities to their knees.
 
 

The administration has already put $400 million of Columbia’s funding under review, prompting the university in March to announce a package of concessions to the government around defining anti-Semitism, policing protests and conducting oversight for specific academic departments.
Following Wednesday’s announcement, a Columbia spokesperson said the university is “aware of the concerns” raised by the government with its accreditation body.
“We have addressed those concerns directly with Middle States,” the spokesperson said, adding that “Columbia is deeply committed to combating anti-Semitism on our campus”. “We take this issue seriously and are continuing to work with the federal government to address it. “</p><small>2025-06-05 04:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0509321349d114c.jpg?r=093225' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915540/pm-approves-plan-to-cut-import-duties-on-raw-materials' target='_blank'><strong>PM approves plan to cut import duties on raw materials</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif has approved a reduction in duties on over 7,066 tariff lines, which include raw materials, intermediate and capital goods aimed at stimulating industrial growth in the country.
The premier green-lit the proposals for a formal announcement in the budget speech, which had received earlier approval from the Tariff Policy Board and Steering Committee. However, the premier asked that the implementation committee identify any irritants before the budget announcement.
Official sources told Dawn on Wed­­nesday that the government will announce the abolishing of 2 per cent additional customs duty (ACD) on 4,294 tariff lines in the upcoming budget. These are mostly raw materials, which will reduce the industries’ input cost.
It was also decided that the ACD will be reduced from 4pc to 2pc on 545 tariff lines, from 6pc to 4pc on 2,227 tariff lines, and from 7pc to 6pc for all products currently subject to a customs duty above 20pc.

Orders committee to consult sectors enjoying 100-150pc tariff protection

According to officials, the major impact will be seen in products classified in chapters 28 to 38, which mostly cover products related to chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, etc. The 2pc to 4pc duty cut will lower the cost of all these products.
The reduction will also cover information technology products, which fall under chapters 84 and 85 of the Pakistan Customs Tariff. Polyester Filament Yarn and HRC of steel sectors will also see a cut in import duties.
Simplified structure
In the budget, the government will also introduce a simplified customs duty structure with slabs of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20pc. The existing 16pc slab will be reduced to 15pc, while the 11pc rate will drop to 10pc. The 3pc slab will be abolished, with products either moved to a zero-duty category or the new 5pc slab.
Regulatory duties, which range from 5pc to 90pc on various products, will also see a drastic reduction in the upcoming budget. However, it will be fully eliminated over five years, easing import costs and improving market accessibility.
The regulatory duties, which currently reach as high as 90pc on various products, would be reduced to a maximum of 30pc.
Moreover, the 5th Schedule of Customs, which provides industry-specific tariff concessions, will be dissolved, with all products covered under it transitioning to the 1st Schedule in a phased manner. There are no changes in the tariff structure in the upcoming budget which will hurt the interest of any specific industry, the official added.
Engaging stakeholders
PM Shehbaz Sharif has directed the steering committee to initiate formal engagement with leading sectors such as auto, iron and steel, textiles, chemicals and plastics — currently shielded by effective tariff rates ranging between 100pc and 150pc after the budget announcement.
The committee will propose an agreed-upon reduction in tariffs for all these sectors in consultation with all stakeholders, the officials said, adding that the premier stated his government’s priority is to shift away from import substitution to an export-led growth strategy.
The premier agreed on the overall plan of a phased reduction in overall tariff protections for select industries.
Under the approved plan, the government has set a target to slash the simple average tariff from the current 19pc to 9.5pc within five years. A key adjustment in the plan includes restructuring duty slabs, replacing the existing slabs of 0pc, 3pc, 11pc, 16pc and 20pc with a streamlined system of 0pc, 5pc, 10pc and 15pc.
By the end of the five-year implementation period, the tariff overhaul will establish a uniform maximum duty slab of 15pc, eliminating sector-specific peaks that previously exceeded 20pc — primarily affecting the auto industry.
The additional customs duties curren­tly set at 2pc, 4pc, 6pc and 7pc across var­ious slabs will be gradually phased out to zero within the next three to four years.

ISLAMABAD: Amid final consultations on the budget, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) wants strict compliance with programme requirements, including the coverage of agriculture income tax in provincial budgets to ensure effective collection starting no later than September 2025.
The Fund also does not agree with a plan for incentivising enhanced power consumption desired by the federal government to absorb surplus capacity. Informed sources said the IMF wanted a strong commitment from the provinces for expenditure control, notwithstanding expansionary development plans presented by the provinces and approved by the National Economic Council (NEC). The four provinces have already exceeded their development allocations for next year by almost Rs850 billion than the IMF’s estimates.
The provinces, on the other hand, might not be able to provide a committed budget surplus this year, given the Centre’s revenue shortfall, and were maximising their next year allocations to ensure they did not lose their financial rights guaranteed by the National Finance Commission (NFC) before its next meeting.
The IMF also wants full implementation of the agriculture income tax and related services that the federal government and the provinces have not been able to settle, as the Centre believed corporate agriculture fell within its domain.
The sources said the authorities had tried their best getting a waiver for the sale of 7000mw of surplus power capacity at marginal cost — meaning no subsidy involved — but the Fund believed similar distortions in the economy, including taxation, incentives and allowances, had landed the country in a difficult state of affairs.
The government believed that surplus power could help boost economic activity if provided to new consumer sectors and industrial sectors even at breakeven rates, but the IMF believed it to be unfair to existing consumers paying a heavy price.
It was also considered unjustified to force old industries running at higher input costs to compete with new setups running on cheaper energy. The government was advised to continue cost-cutting efforts to stabilise the power sector and provide a level playing field to all. In this context, it was yet unclear if a section of the government trying to allocate 2000MW electricity to crypto farming would succeed in providing 3-4 cents per unit (Rs8-9 per unit) against Rs24-25 per unit base rate.
The IMF has also opposed provincial subsidies on electricity and gas as provided during the current year by Punjab, which intends to repeat it next year. In addition, it wants joint strategies to fight electricity and gas theft and smuggling to minimise financial leakage and tax loss. In this regard, the provinces would also have to right-size their departments in the next year to support a similar federal exercise during the current year.
The FBR tax target for next year would remain around Rs14.2tr or so as agreed during the first review of the extended fund programme a couple of months ago. Most of the other estimates shared at the time would also remain unchanged. There would be minor relaxation in tax rates for the salaried class but greater focus on recoveries from the retail sector. The cross-cutting theme of the next year’s budget would be digitisation and differential tax and transaction rates for cash and digital means.

• Bilawal says New Delhi can’t be ‘net security provider’ in the region if it can’t even defend its own skies
• Dar blames political rhetoric from Indian leaders for keeping South Asia tensions high
WASHINGTON / ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari have praised US President Donald Trump for his role in helping de-escalate the latest India-Pakistan military confrontation, and urged Washington to facilitate a comprehensive dialogue between the two nuclear neighbours.
Speaking at an event at the US Embassy in Islamabad marking the 249th anniversary of American independence, PM Shehbaz said the recent four-day conflict had revealed the “Pahalgam incident was a false-flag operation”, and credited President Trump for playing a decisive role in ensuring a ceasefire.
The premier said that the US president had shown beyond any doubt that “he is a man for peace … and beneficial business deals”.
He added, “President Trump is a man against escalation and a man against cold and hot war.”
PM Shehbaz said Pakistan downed six Indian fighter jets in self-defence after Indian aggression on May 6-7 resulted in the deaths of 33 Pakistani civilians.
“We responded with restraint and patience,” he said. “Our offer for an impartial international probe into the Pahalgam incident was met with aggression instead.”
He said that India “should have come out with solid evidence and convinced the world about the occurrence of the incident”.
PM Shehbaz also extended heartfelt felicitations to the US president and people of the United States, on his behalf and on behalf of the Pakistani nation, on celebrating their Independence Day.
He said the bilateral ties between the US and Pakistan were entering into renewed friendship, and the close contacts were being revived.
Facilitate dialogue
Meanwhile, speaking to US-based Pakistani journalists in Washington, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said President Trump “deserves credit” for helping facilitate the ceasefire between Pakistan and India last month.
“We should also pay attention to what the US president is saying. On 10 different occasions, he has taken credit for facilitating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan — and rightly so. He deserves that credit, because it was his efforts that helped make the ceasefire possible,” said Mr Bhutto-Zardari, the leader of the Pakistani delegation that began a three-day visit to Washington on Wednesday.
“So, if the US is willing to help Pakistan in maintaining this ceasefire, it is reasonable to expect that an American role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would also be beneficial for us,” he added.
While India publicly denies that President Trump played any role in the ceasefire agreement and consistently rejects third-party mediation on bilateral issues, Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s remarks appear aimed at drawing the US into a more proactive diplomatic role in South Asia.
“Yes, America has an establishment, a thought pattern,” he acknowledged, “but knowing the ground realities, we are not delusional. We know what the realities of this city (Washington) are, what its geopolitics are, but we are here because we believe that our message is the message of truth. It aligns with international laws and relevant UN Security Council resolutions.”
His comments also targeted what he described as a failed US strategy of building up India as a regional security anchor. Referring to New Delhi’s recent troubles, he said: “What security will that net security provider provide to others when it cannot do that for itself? They were supposed to protect others, but couldn’t protect their own planes.”
“The concept of India as a counterweight to China now seems hollow. It’s not even a paperweight anymore. This approach, I believe, must now be re-evaluated,” he said.
India has long pitched itself as a “net security provider” in the Indo-Pacific region — a concept US policymakers have also endorsed. But Mr Bhutto-Zardari said this strategy had outlived its utility.
“I believe that this strategy of building up India as the net security provider has failed,” he said. “I believe what can really provide security to this region, and to the rest of the world, is peace bet­ween India and Pakistan.”
Rhetoric sustaining tensions
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday expressed readiness for a comprehensive dialogue with India, but warned that rising political rhetoric from Indian leaders is sustaining high tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals following last month’s military confrontation.
“Whenever they (Indians) want a dialogue, at any level, they will find us ready, but we are not desperate,” Mr Dar said during a press briefing in Islamabad.
Mr Dar said that although the ceasefire has held, political tensions remain inflamed by statements from Indian leaders, particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently described the military exchange as “just a trailer” ahead of upcoming elections in Bihar.
“Political rhetoric is still on, possibly for internal reasons,” Mr Dar said. “I wish sense prevails. We are peace lovers, focused on economic revival, but dignity, sovereignty and territorial integrity come first.”
Mr Dar insisted that any future dialogue between Pakistan and India must be comprehensive, addressing terrorism, water rights under the Indus Waters Treaty, and broader bilateral issues. “When India is ready for talks, it will find us ready for talks on all issues.”
He also rejected Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishan­kar’s assertion that the talks should only cover the issue of terrorism, saying it wouldn’t work.
