A competitive and credible currency regime should form the core of the nation’s economic strategy, particularly given the country’s dependence on foreign exchange for growth.
Unfortunately, Pakistan has repeatedly used the exchange rate as a short-term stabilisation tool, often holding it at levels that favour political convenience rather than economic fundamentals. Once reserves are depleted, this approach has led to abrupt and disruptive corrections consistently undermining rather than enhancing export potential.

 

That said, it is incredibly important to have a competitive exchange rate as it improves export margins, encourages investment in tradable goods, and signals the viability of producing for global markets.

History shows that prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax on exports and a subsidy to imports

However, rate alone is insufficient; credibility is equally essential. Exporters are willing to invest and scale up operations only if they trust that relative prices will remain broadly aligned with fundamentals over time. In Pakistan’s case, this trust has been repeatedly eroded.
The Musharraf era
During the Musharraf administration, the rupee was kept stable at around Rs60 to the dollar throughout much of the 2000s. While this stability created an illusion of macroeconomic soundness, it concealed growing external imbalances.
When the pressures finally surfaced, the adjustment was late and severe: from 2007 to 2009, the rupee dropped from roughly Rs60 to over Rs80 per dollar as reserves collapsed and an International Monetary Fund intervention became necessary. Exporters, who had operated under an overvalued currency, did not suddenly become competitive. Instead, they faced higher input costs, disrupted financing, and weakened financial positions.
Stability over fundamentals
The above pattern recurred between 2013 and 2017, with the rupee held between Rs100–105 per dollar despite widening current-account deficits and falling reserves. Exporters consistently warned about the currency’s overvaluation, but policy makers focused on maintaining price stability and political optics. When the inevitable adjustment occurred, it was abrupt and disorderly: the rupee’s value dropped sharply in mid-2017, followed by a larger correction after 2018, reaching around Rs160 per dollar by mid-2019. This sudden realignment destabilised firms and inflation expectations instead of supporting a smooth transition.
Market distortions and eroding confidence
The last three years have proven even more damaging. Administrative controls, delayed adjustments, and the emergence of multiple exchange rates pushed pressure into informal markets.
In early 2023, the rupee experienced one of its steepest single-day falls, losing nearly 10 per cent within hours. Over the year, it depreciated by close to 30pc percent, at one point briefly approaching Rs300 per dollar before settling near Rs285 when administrative controls were introduced.
These shifts coincided with harsh stabilisation measures such as import compression, punitive interest rates, higher energy prices, and increased taxes. Any potential export gains from depreciation were negated by rising costs and collapsing confidence.
Repeatedly underminig exports
These episodes highlight a clear lesson: prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax on exports and a subsidy to imports. This encourages consumption and rent-seeking while discouraging investment in tradable sectors. When adjustment is finally forced, it comes as a crisis — too sudden and volatile to generate the intended export response. Exporters cannot recover lost markets overnight, nor can they invest amidst uncertainty and tightening financial conditions.
Gradual adjustment and integrated policy
Successful export economies do not rely on dramatic devaluations. Instead, they allow gradual, market-aligned adjustments, avoid prolonged misalignments, and resist using the exchange rate as a political tool. Effective currency policy is complemented by competitive energy pricing, predictable taxation, efficient logistics, and skills development, enabling exporters to respond to price signals.
For example, Vietnam has pursued gradual adjustments that avoid prolonged overvaluation and limit volatility, giving exporters the confidence to invest and integrate into global value chains. Bangladesh has similarly adopted a steady crawl rather than crisis-driven devaluations, preserving export competitiveness and market share — a model Pakistan has repeatedly failed to emulate.
Conclusion: toward a credible exchange rate policy
Pakistan’s core issue is not deciding between a ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ rupee. Rather, it is the persistent belief that administrative controls can substitute for competitiveness. Until the exchange-rate policy reflects fundamentals on a sustained basis and is part of a broader, credible export strategy, depreciation will remain disruptive, and exports will continue to be vulnerable to future crises.

PROTESTERS scuffle with an ICE supporter who was in downtown for ‘Americans Against Islamification’ rally.—AFP

WASHINGTON: The Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers in Alaska to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota, the site of large protests against the government’s deportation drive, two US officials told Reuters on Sunday.
The army placed the units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence in the midwestern state escalates, the officials said, though it is not clear whether any of them will be sent.
President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to use the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces if officials in the state do not stop protesters from targeting immigration officials after a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.
But if the troops are deployed, it is unclear whether the Trump administration would invoke the Insurrection Act.

Army places units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence escalates

Even without invoking the act, a president can deploy active-duty forces for certain domestic purposes such as protecting federal property, which Trump cited as a justification for sending Marines to Los Angeles last year.
In addition to the active-duty forces, the Pentagon could also attempt to deploy newly created National Guard rapid-response forces for civil disturbances.
The Pentagon and the White House did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on the order, which was first reported by ABC News.
Trump’s threat
“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of ICE, who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
The soldiers subject to deployment specialise in cold-weather operations and are assigned to two US Army infantry battalions under the 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska, the officials said.

Yet the reality is more prosaic and interesting. The dollar remains the world’s dominant currency, even as it faces genuine pressures from a more fragmented global economy, shifting geopolitics, and deliberate efforts by some states to reduce reliance on it. What we are witnessing is not de-dollarisation in the dramatic sense, but gradual diversification within a system that still overwhelmingly favours the greenback.
The numbers tell a nuanced story. The Dollar Index fell 10.7 per cent in the first half of 2025, its steepest decline in over five decades, before stabilising around 99 in early 2026. That drop reflected a combination of US monetary easing, political uncertainty, and investor repositioning rather than a wholesale loss of confidence. Even after the slide, the dollar continues to underpin roughly 80pc of global trade finance and close to 57pc of official foreign exchange reserves.
Monetary policy played a central role in last year’s volatility. In 2025, the Federal Reserve (Fed) cut interest rates three times, bringing the policy rate to a 3.5–3.75pc range as the labour market cooled. By January 2026, job creation had slowed to 50,000 new positions, below expectations, though unemployment edged down to 4.4pc. Markets are now pricing in further rate cuts this year, reducing the dollar’s yield advantage. At the same time, core inflation has remained stubbornly high, complicating the Fed’s task and injecting uncertainty into global capital flows.
Bond markets added to the puzzle. In mid-2025, the dollar weakened even as 10-year treasury yields rose by around 30 basis points — an unusual divergence that unsettled investors. While yields later stabilised near 4.2pc and helped the dollar recover, rising US fiscal deficits fuelled record speculative bets against the currency. By June 2025, net short positions reached roughly $47 billion. Multinational firms felt the strain too, with earlier dollar strength shaving an estimated 6–8pc off overseas earnings before the currency’s subsequent decline eased import costs but hurt exporters.

Recent US legislation has further legitimised instruments like cryptocurrencies, strengthening the greenback’s presence in digital finance

Gold’s surge offered another signal of anxiety. Prices climbed to around $4,500 per ounce in 2025 and then rose further to fresh record highs in January 2026, accompanied by a sharp rally in silver, which also reached multi-year peaks. The twin surge underscored deepening inflation fears, geopolitical risk, and the dollar’s long-term erosion in purchasing power.
Since 2000, the dollar has lost roughly 40pc of its real value. Central banks responded by accelerating gold purchases — around 2,500 tonnes annually — pushing gold’s share of global reserves to levels last seen in the 1990s. This shift reflects hedging rather than abandonment: precious metals are being used to diversify risk, not to replace the dollar as the anchor of the global system.
Geopolitics has added further strain. The Trump administration’s tariffs on BRICS countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, among others — contributed to the dollar’s over 9pc fall in 2025, its worst annual performance in a decade. Supply chain disruptions and legal challenges to the tariffs increased uncertainty and encouraged some countries to settle trade in non-dollar currencies.
Similarly, the extensive use of financial sanctions — most notably the freezing of Russian assets after the Ukraine invasion — has prompted targeted states to seek alternatives. By mid-2024, as much as 38pc of Russia’s trade was reportedly conducted in Chinese yuan.
These actions have had measurable, if gradual, effects. The dollar’s share of global reserves slipped to about 57.8pc by the end of 2024, down from roughly 70pc at the turn of the century. Some projections suggest it could fall further over the decade. Yet there is no evidence of a sudden flight from US Treasuries or a viable replacement currency ready to assume the dollar’s role.
The BRICS bloc looms large in this debate. Now representing over 40pc of the world’s population 40pc of the global economy as of 2024, the group has promoted local-currency trade, expanded use of the yuan, and explored alternative payment systems. The New Development Bank aspires to challenge Western-led institutions, and discussions of gold-linked units or shared platforms have gained attention. Still, internal differences, limited financial depth, and governance issues constrain BRICS’ ability to offer a true substitute for the dollar-centric system.
Payment infrastructure tells a similar story. The dollar remains involved in roughly half of all SWIFT transactions. China’s CIPS network and multilateral experiments such as mBridge are growing, but they still account for a small fraction of global flows. Even in commodities, where diversification is most visible, around 80pc of global oil trade remains dollar-denominated, despite some bilateral deals in yuan or local currencies.
Ironically, cryptocurrencies are reinforcing the dollar’s reach rather than undermining it. Dollar-backed stablecoins now account for hundreds of billions of dollars in value and trillions in transaction volumes, effectively digitising the greenback and extending its use into new markets. Recent US legislation has further legitimised these instruments, strengthening the dollar’s presence in digital finance.
The conclusion is clear. The dollar is under pressure, but it is far from dethroned. Diversification is real and accelerating, yet it reflects risk management in a multipolar world rather than a collapse of confidence. For the United States, the challenge is strategic, not existential: maintain institutional credibility, manage fiscal risks, use financial power judiciously, and embrace innovation rather than resist it. If Washington adapts wisely, the dollar’s central role will endure — even in a more contested global landscape.

Traders and area residents said that timely action from the Saddar Fire Station, other civic bodies, and local officials could have saved lives and livelihoods, yet the firefighting operation only picked up in full force early Sunday.

 

Shopkeepers at the site told Dawn that if the firefighting team had arrived last night with full force and resources, the scene here would probably look very different.
One shopkeeper pointed out that the Saddar Fire Station is only a few minutes away, yet no timely action was taken.

Traders say fire could have been contained sooner, but limited resources and delayed action by authorities allowed it to spread unchecked

A local resident said they were repeatedly told on Saturday night that there was a shortage of water, which hampered the operation.
People criticised the Sindh government and the Karachi mayor, questioning where the mayor and provincial ministers were during the crisis. They also highlighted that the condition of M.A. Jinnah Road makes it extremely difficult to position even two water bowsers side by side.
“Had the operation started properly the moment the fire broke out, perhaps so much damage could have been avoided. By morning, everything had been consumed by the flames,” one shopkeeper said, looking over the rubble.

 

“If a proper rescue operation had been in place, people could have been saved, and businesses might have survived. The government doesn’t seem to realise that these weren’t just shops – thousands of households’ livelihoods were at stake,” a clothing dealer lam­ented.
“At first, the smoke kept spreading, and then the fire reached the upper floors. If the teams had arrived on time, perhaps people could have been brought out safely,” a young man on the scene recounted.
Atmosphere of fear and mourning
The fire that could still not be fully extinguished by Sunday night has cloaked the bustling M.A. Jinnah Road and Saddar area in an atmosphere of fear, anxiety and mourning.
The rising sun, usually seen as a symbol of life and hope, appeared sorrowful this Sunday morning in Karachi. The light that every day awakened new hopes in shops and businesses was silent, as if it too had lowered its gaze after witnessing the blaze and destruction.
Along with traders and the relatives of those who died, even the air around Gul Plaza seemed to be grieving.
Some are searching for their loved ones, while others are consumed by the agony of losing their businesses. Every eye looked wet and every face appeared drained and hopeless.
The same market where shopkeepers raised shutters every morning and the voices of bargaining echoed, today stands as a burning skeleton. Where once crowds of buyers gathered, now victims, relatives, rescue workers and onlookers stand clustered together.
The intensity of the fire has already caused part of the building to collapse.
One glance at the rubble is enough to realise the scale of the devastation. Hundreds of shops have been destroyed.
It is clear that when a building burns, it is not only brick and metal that burn. Livelihoods, trust and the hard labour of years also burn to the ground.
The piles of debris and ash have shattered the economic lives of traders within moments.
‘Everything was here’
A middle-aged trader who had been running his business in the building for nearly two decades stood on the road looking at the charred structure on Sunday morning.
After a long silence, he uttered just one sentence: “Everything was here.”
In that single sentence lay the struggle, livelihood and hope of an entire life.
Another affected trader broke down while speaking to Dawn and pointed toward the burning building. People around him tried to console him, but every heart around seemed to be grieving.
Majid, who owned a children’s clothing shop, said he and other shopkeepers had stocked merchandise for the Eid season, but “now everything has turned to ashes.”
A dangerous design, an ageing structure
Among the public, there is also a belief that the scale of the fire is tied to the risks that had accumulated over time.
Gul Plaza is among the commercial centres of Karachi built decades ago. Over the years, thousands of shops, warehouses and stockrooms became packed into narrow corridors.
Fabrics, plastics, cardboard cartons, other goods, cramped pathways and substandard wiring created an environment that made today’s disaster unbearable.
Traders say that such calamities not only destroy wealth, but also push an entire class to stand once again before time and debt to rebuild what was lost.

ISLAMABAD: The government on Sun­day conceded power cuts in most parts of the country for the last 8–10 days despite surplus capacity due to transmission constraints and fuel mismanagement, the continuation of the debt servicing surcharge on consumers for the next six years, and the cost of inefficiencies being charged to taxpayers.

 

Speaking at a press conference in the capital, Power Minister Awais Leghari said the grid faced problems due to fog, north-south transmission constraints, a few days of extension in the scheduled outage of a major nuclear power plant, and ‘mistakes’ in the right fuel arrangements by the Sahiwal Coal Power Project. He said the issue was, however, mainly due to the repeated tripping of the transmission system because of the weather.
This resulted in lower production of a few hundred megawatts, on top of lower hydropower generation due to annual canal closure. The minister apologised to the consumers for the inconvenience but said that nothing was possible due to the weather.
The minister contested the recent State of the Industry Report (SOIR) 2025, released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), saying it came out with a 5-6 month delay and thus interpretations were based on outdated data.
He said that Nepra wrongly observed that Rs3.23 per unit was an additional burden on consumers, saying it had been in place for years and would have gone on for decades, but the current government announced its continuation for only six years.
Mr Leghari said the regulator also wrongly claimed that higher system losses than regulatory targets were an unnecessary burden on consumers, and said these gaps — both low recoveries and high losses — were being financed by the Ministry of Finance out of taxpayers’ money and hence posed no additional burden on electricity consumers.
The minister said the SOIR was a comprehensive document and its draft should have been shared with the power division for fact-checking before its publication.
He said the government had no intention of strangulating the regulator, but capacity improvement was required both at the power division and the regulator. He said the power division would officially write to the regulator to highlight its concerns.
He agreed with the Nepra’s projections, indicating a surplus margin of up to 8,700MW, that increased generation costs and higher tariffs, as most of the plants operate under ‘take or pay’ or ‘must run’ agreements, but said the installed capacity had passed through due to the regulatory process. The government had introduced a surplus power package for industrial and agricultural consumers at discounted rates for three years to stimulate demand and improve asset utilisation, and positive results emerged in December.
‘Without due diligence’
Responding to weaknesses in integrated system planning pointed out by Nepra and its cost to consumers, the minister said that Nepra had been approving the indicative generation expansion plans (IGCEP) without due diligence.
“We have now submitted IGCEP 2025-35, which represents a fundamental shift in Pakistan’s approach to power sector planning purely on merit and least cost of energy, thus excluding 7,967MW high-cost and non-essential generation projects and prioritisation of low-cost, indigenous, and renewable energy sources, with a projected saving of $17bn,” he said.
The minister confirmed that delays in project execution remained a persistent challenge across several major initiatives in the transmission sector, saying the government has separated the project development function into an independent company, EIDMC, for the timely execution of transmission projects.
He also denied that the power division controlled power companies, saying they were given full autonomy under the board of directors. “In the current year, the fiscal space burden has already been reduced by Rs400bn (from Rs1.287 trillion to Rs893bn) through this process,” he said.
He also conceded the past practice of Discos issuing electricity bills with incorrect readings, which was ‘a major driver of non-payment, leading to lower recoveries for the Discos’. He claimed that over Rs40bn had been returned to the consumers last year through the introduction of a proportionate billing mechanism (bills no longer than 30 days). He hoped the regulator would soon approve investment plans to enable Discos to introduce automated meter reading (AMR) devices.
He said the Discos’ recovery of bills improved from 92.4pc to 96.6pc in FY2025, resulting in Rs183bn reduction in unrecovered bills, falling from Rs315bn in FY24 to Rs132bn in FY25. In FY2026 (Jul-Dec), recovery improved by another Rs43bn compared to last year, he said. On the other hand, the at-source deduction of 25pc from bills of provincial governments and government departments also improved financials.
Circular debt
Contesting the regulator for reporting that circular debt reduction of Rs780bn last year primarily stemmed from external financial injections rather than structural improvements, the minister said the regulator’s “understanding with regard to power sector numbers is surprising”.

 

He said the debt reduction was due to lower losses (Rs193bn), waiver of late payment surcharges with power producers (Rs260bn), and Rs300bn due to macroeconomic improvements like exchange and interest rates.
Most importantly, the minister challenged Nepra for claiming that only the private sector distribution company, KE, had not contributed to the circular debt, but its consumers paid the debt servicing surcharge. “K-Electric had contributed to the accumulation of circular debt in the past by not paying electricity dues to CPPA-G. Up to June 2023, the resulting addition to circular debt due to K-Electric’s non-payment amounted to Rs640bn.
The receivables from KE stand at more than Rs300bn as on November 30, 2025,” the minister said. He added that lenient regulatory targets to improve KE efficiency resulted in more than Rs500bn subsidies to its consumers over the last five years.
Responding to Nepra’s assessment that the non-affordability factor due to rising electricity tariffs pushed consumers toward conservation and solar alternatives, and that economic stagnation further reduced demand, the minister claimed the average tariff had dropped from Rs53.04 in March 2024 to Rs42.27 per unit in December 2025.

However, this variation primarily reflects the timing of their assessments in relation to the 2025 monsoon floods.
The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) forecast of 3.6pc was formulated in October 2025 and does not incorporate the impact of the subsequent floods. In contrast, the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) revised estimate of around 3.25pc and the World Bank’s projection of 3pc are later evaluations that explicitly account for the flood’s dampening effect on the economy, particularly the agricultural sector.
Macroeconomic indicators for the first half of the year (July-December 2025) indicate that full-year growth would be somewhere between 3pc and 3.5pc in the best-case scenario.
Though this exceeds Pakistan’s population growth of roughly 2.6pc, it still risks constraining recent gains in per-capita income and employment creation. Poverty reduction and improved social mobility, and meaningful job creation may remain elusive even as macroeconomic indicators show short-term stabilisation.

Swift, broad-based employment creation is imperative for national stability and resilience in the increasingly competitive regional and global arena

Much will also depend on the regional and domestic security environment, which remains fluid and difficult to forecast. Heightened tensions in the Middle East — particularly the risk of a limited or escalatory military confrontation involving the United States and Iran — could have indirect but significant repercussions for Pakistan.
Such a scenario may disrupt global energy markets, raise oil prices, strain Pakistan’s import bill, and complicate external financing conditions at a time of fragile macroeconomic recovery.
Diplomatic pressures could also intensify, placing Pakistan in a delicate position as it seeks to balance strategic neutrality with economic and security interests, including the safety and operational continuity of its diplomatic missions in the region. Even without a full-scale conflict, prolonged uncertainty alone could dampen investor confidence, delay capital inflows, and further weaken prospects for job creation and sustained growth.
Rising domestic political polarisation is fraying social cohesion, and failure to create employment could intensify unrest. Pakistan simultaneously faces militancy, terrorism, and a volatile regional security environment, particularly as tensions escalate in the Middle East following the US-Iran imbroglio. In such circumstances, a stagnant labour market is not just an economic problem; it is a strategic vulnerability.
The picture for 2026 is clear. Moderate GDP growth alone will not generate jobs. Automation, structural inefficiencies, informalisation, skill gaps, and demand suppression converge to constrain employment.
Without bold policy interventions — including labour-intensive investment, workforce skill development, small and medium enterprise (SME) support, and education reform — Pakistan risks growth that is largely jobless, leaving both its workforce and national stability exposed.
Labour-intensive sectors — historically engines of employment like construction, textiles, and agriculture — are no longer absorbing workers as they once did. Automation, mechanisation, and artificial intelligence adoption threaten jobs across industries, particularly in routine roles.
Research from the Lahore University of Management Sciences Mahbub-ul-Haq Research Centre estimates that around 17 per cent of Pakistan’s workforce is at high risk of displacement due to technological adoption, with manufacturing, customer service, and portions of agriculture most exposed.
Bangladesh’s ready-made garment sector demonstrates the consequences of this “jobless growth” dynamic: automation has reportedly reduced workforce numbers by 30pc or more in some factories, even as output and exports surged, leaving lower-skilled workers displaced and incomes stagnant.
SMEs, long recognised as the backbone of Pakistan’s economy and employment, are under intense pressure. According to a joint Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority and International Labour Organisation study, Pakistan’s roughly 5.24 million SMEs account for a substantial portion of economic activity, yet many struggle to survive amid high compliance costs, limited access to formal finance, and regulatory burdens.

 

Estimates place the informal economy at 35–40pc of GDP, or approximately $457 billion, underscoring its critical role in sustaining livelihoods. Yet as documentation and regulatory demands rise, many small enterprises either shut down or operate outside the formal system, contributing to a “gigified” labour market of precarious, short-term, and underpaid work.
The public sector, a fallback for labour absorption in the good old days, too, cannot act as an employer of last resort. The FY25 federal budget froze hiring for BPS 1–16 positions, projected to save Rs45 billion annually, while rightsizing initiatives have eliminated thousands of redundant posts across ministries and attached departments and the ongoing privatisation of overstaffed and financially unviable state-owned enterprises, like the Utility Stores Corporation, also produces a new wave of joblessness.
Fiscal pressures and international reform conditionalities limit the government’s capacity to offset private-sector job shortfalls. This structural shift leaves the private sector, SMEs, and informal enterprises to shoulder the responsibility of employment creation, a burden made heavier by technological disruption and weak consumer demand.
Even export growth, traditionally a key engine of employment in labour-intensive economies, is becoming less job-intensive. Pakistan’s textile and clothing sector (which accounts for 55–63pc of merchandise exports and roughly $16–18 billion in value) has shown modest growth in recent years. Yet employment in the sector has stagnated.

• Macron wants ‘never-before-used anti-coercion instrument’ against US• Meloni calls tariff threat a ‘mistake’• Dutch FM dubs it ‘blackmail’• UK, Norway mull over response
LONDON: Global markets face a fresh bout of volatility after President Donald Trump vowed to slap tariffs on eight European nations until the US is allowed to buy Greenland.
Trump said he would impose an additional 10pc import tariffs from Feb 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain, which will rise to 25pc on June 1 if no deal is reached.

 

“Hopes that the tariff situation has calmed down for this year have been dashed for now — and we find ourselves in the same situation as last spring,” Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmied-ing said, expecting the euro could come under pressure when Asian trade begins.
“The US-EU trade war is back,” said Tina Fordham, strategist and Fordham Global Foresight founder.
On Sunday, European leaders slammed the tariff threat over their opposition to his designs on Greenland, warning transatlantic ties were at risk. “Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,” Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden warned in a joint statement.

 

An extraordinary meeting of its ambassadors was called in Brussels on Sunday by the EU, which clinched a deal with Washington in July for most EU exports to face a 15pc US levy.
France’s President Emmanuel Macron will ask the EU to activate a never-before-used “anti-coercion instrument” against the US if Trump makes good on his tariff threat, Macron’s aides said.
Even Trump’s European allies baulked at the threat.
Italy’s far-right Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, called the threatened tariffs a ‘mistake’. “I believe that imposing new sanctions today would be a mistake,” she said during her Seoul trip.
Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel called Trump’s threat an “inexplicable” form of “blackmail”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was planning to discuss the situation with Trump “at the earliest opportunity”, UK culture minister Lisa Nandy told the BBC, calling the president’s tariff threat “wrong”.
“We believe it’s deeply unhelpful, and we believe it’s counterproductive, and the prime minister has not shied away from making that clear,” she said.
Trade war fear
France’s Agricultural Minister Annie Genevard warned that tariffs would hurt Washington, too.
“In this escalation of tariffs, (Trump) has a lot to lose as well, as do his own farmers and industrialists,” she told broadcasters Europe 1 and CNews.
Norway, targeted by the tariff threat but, like Britain, not an EU member, said it was not currently looking at retaliation against US goods.
“I think one needs to stop and think so that a trade war can be averted that would lead to a downward spiral. Nobody would win,” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store told NRK television.

Tajikistan, in Central Asia, shares a mountainous border with Afghanistan and has had tense relations with Kabul’s Taliban authorities.
According to Tajik security services cited by the state-owned Khovar news agency, “four terrorists were neutralised” after they refused to put down arms in the southern Khatlon region.
Tajik authorities have reported at least five deadly incidents on the mountainous border, which is some 1,350 kilometres (840 miles) long, since November.
An AFP count using official data found that 16 people have been killed in total. These include Tajik border guards, Chinese workers and what Dushanbe calls “smugglers” and “terrorists”.
After attacks on Chinese nationals in November, Tajik authorities urged the Taliban government to take measures to prevent destabilisation of the volatile border region, where drug traffickers and militants are active.
In December, five people were killed in an armed clash on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, according to Tajik state media. It added that the people killed in the clash included “three terrorists” and two Tajik border officers.
Dushanbe is also concerned about the presence in Afghanistan of members of the terrorist organisation Islamic State in Khorasan.

DAMASCUS: The Syrian president and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced an immediate ceasefire after fierce fighting, which saw the government forces take control of territories held by the Kurdish SDF.
The Syrian army, in its lightning advance towards the key city of Raqqa in the north, captured Tabqa before reaching a ceasefire with the Kurdish forces on Sunday on all fronts. Al Jazeera, quoting the Syrian state media, said that the SDF forces agreed to withdraw to the east of the Euphrates under the agreement.

 

According to Al Jazeera, the agreement provides for the immediate and complete administrative and military handover of Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates to Damascus. The agreement also allowed the government to assume control of all civilian institutions in the two governorates, and current employees would be reinstated through decrees.
The government promised it would not target the SDP supporters or fighters. The ceasefire granted the Syrian government control over all border crossings as well as oil and gas fields in the region. In addition, all civil institutions in al-Hasakah Governorate are to be integrated into official Syrian state institutions and administrative structures, while a presidential decree will be issued naming a candidate as governor.

 

The agreement also stipulated that a list of proposed leaders submitted by the SDP command will be used to fill senior military, security, and civilian posts in the central government, while heavy military forces from the city of Ain al-Arab/Kobani will withdraw. Furthermore, it also envisaged a local police force affiliated with the Syrian interior ministry besides the creation of a security force drawn from local residents.
The agreement also allowed the integration of the administration in charge of the Islamic State camps into the Syrian state structure.
Syrian army advances
Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that the Syrian government troops were entering the outskirts of Raqqa and were advancing deeper into the northeast of the country, the last stronghold of the US-backed autonomous Kurdish-led administration. Two Syrian military sources said that tanks had begun entering Raqqa, once controlled by the Islamic State, which the SDF captured in October 2017.
Thousands of residents took to the streets of Raqqa to celebrate the Syrian army’s advances as SDF forces pulled out their equipment, two residents said.
The army, with its Arab tribal allies, had earlier taken control of Deir al-Zor’s main oil and gas fields east of the Euphrates River — a key source of revenue for the Kurdish-led forces — dealing a major blow to the group.

Interventions such as improved seeds, optimal fertiliser use, effective pest and disease management, and provision of extension services were all aimed at raising per-acre productivity.
Conceptually, this focus was quite sound. Even today, it is relevant because Pakistan’s yields for most crops remain well below global averages, and the yield gap between progressive farmers and the average smallholder is still substantial.
Unfortunately, despite efforts, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of wheat yields over the past 25 years (1998–99 to 2023–24) has been only 1.66 per cent, as yields increased from 878kg per acre to 1322.5kg per acre. By contrast, during the same period, the population grew by a CAGR of 2.5pc.

 

Consequently, the country met rising wheat demand partially through the expansion of wheat area. Similarly, the CAGR of yields for rice, sugarcane, rapeseed and mustard, and potato has been 1.38pc, 1.78pc, 0.65pc, and 1.64pc, respectively.
It is important to recognise that any meaningful increase in future crop yields will depend primarily on the availability of high-yielding, climate-resilient seed varieties. However, decades of underinvestment in agricultural research and development (R&D) have left Pakistan largely incapable of developing such varieties locally.
Nevertheless, another potential way to raise net yields and overall agricultural output is to reduce harvest and post-harvest losses, which reach up to 10pc for grains, oilseeds, and pulses, and as high as 30pc for fruits and vegetables.

The country must move from its focus on improving yields to growing a wide range of high-value crops with comparative advantages

Regrettably, Pakistan has not invested much in promoting modern harvesting and threshing equipment, improving crop handling and transportation practices, or developing crop storage systems that are safe from rodents, pests such as weevils, and mycotoxins (aflatoxin). As a result, millions of tonnes of wheat (government stocks) are stored in open fields, and a large number of export shipments of various crops are rejected every year due to aflatoxin contamination.
In past decades, Pakistan has also enhanced overall agricultural output through extensification — expanding the area under cultivation. However, much of this expansion has been offset by land taken over for housing colonies. Even so, from 2010 to 2024, the total cultivated area increased from around 42.6 million acres to 52.8m acres.
Notably, Pakistan still has millions of acres of barren land, but the government’s long-standing preference for investing in motorways and highways over water storage infrastructure, such as dams, has made water availability a binding constraint on further expansion. This challenge is further compounded by the failure to improve water-use efficiency in the agriculture sector.
Rising cropping intensity (the number of crops grown on a piece of land in a calendar year) has been another key factor boosting Pakistan’s agricultural production. The widespread installation of new tubewells, particularly solar-powered ones, has enabled farmers in many districts to move from single to double cropping.
Similarly, the advent of short-duration seed varieties for several crops has made it possible to cultivate three crops annually. In several districts, three-crop patterns have emerged, such as potato–maize–Basmati rice (90-day 1509 variety) or wheat–sesame–Basmati rice (1509).

 

All these factors that have contributed to higher agricultural production in Pakistan have been only partially supported by the government and, in many cases, have emerged without any policy backing at all. Most of these developments occurred organically. The underlying driver has been the economic pressures faced by farmers — particularly due to shrinking farm sizes — which have forced them to extract maximum output from increasingly smaller landholdings. At the same time, the private sector has played its role by marketing inputs and technologies that enable farmers to boost productivity.
Despite these farmer- and market-led adjustments, the real GDP of the agriculture sector has failed to grow at a pace sufficient to reduce rural poverty or generate meaningful self- or wage-employment. This underscores the need for a paradigm shift in agricultural policy — one that moves beyond incremental fixes and is capable of delivering broad-based, sustained growth to the sector.
To achieve this within the prevailing agricultural landscape, the government must prioritise two strategies in its agricultural policy framework.
First, Pakistan is stuck with the low-value crops — wheat, rice, sugarcane, cotton, gram, and maize — which have been cultivated on over 90pc of the cropped area for decades. Yet the country has a clear comparative advantage in growing a wide range of high-value crops, such as garlic, olives, turmeric, peas, groundnuts (in irrigated areas), and many others, which can be cultivated on vast areas thanks to fertile soil, favourable agro-climatic conditions, quality water, and abundant cheap labour.
Therefore, the focus should move to crop diversification. However, these crops require higher input costs and a well-functioning value chain from farm to export markets, which necessitates government support.
Second, the government should encourage export-oriented small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in agricultural processing and value addition by providing targeted incentives and supporting them in accessing and expanding into international markets.
Nevertheless, one point must be clear: unless Pakistan’s agricultural commodities and value-added products gain reliable access to export markets, efforts toward crop diversification and value addition will remain largely futile. This necessitates enhancing the effectiveness of the Department of Plant Protection, the Ministry of Commerce, and Pakistan’s trade missions abroad.

Already, Pakistan’s Finance Ministry has signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with the global crypto giant Binance for consultations on the tokenisation of sovereign bonds, treasury bills, and commodity reserves valued up to $2 billion.
Separately, Pakistan’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority has also granted No Objection Certificates to Binance and HTX to begin local licensing processes. With an estimated 30–40 million Pakistanis actively using digital assets, the government has been increasingly positioning blockchain as a key element in its quest for financial transformation.
In simple words, asset tokenisation is the process of turning a physical or financial asset into its digital copies, or tokens, that can then be traded or owned in a blockchain network. One of the main benefits of tokenisation is that it allows the fractionalisation or breakup of non-fungible or indivisible assets into smaller, affordable parts. This, in turn, effectively allows more than one person to own a single expensive asset.
Consequently, tokenisation has the potential to democratise access to markets such as real estate, art, private equity, or bonds that have long been closed off to common individuals. This could prove to be helpful in developing countries like Pakistan, where much of the population is poor and has limited access to conventional financial services.

Despite their potential to democratise access to markets such as real estate, art, private equity, or bonds, the programmability of NFTs makes them harder to monitor and mitigate potential risks

Another key trait of tokenisation is that the underlying blockchain-based technology has the capability to automate many financial processes, greatly cutting down the need for intermediaries and middlemen like brokers and banks. This allows for near-instant settlement of transactions, greatly increasing efficiency and accuracy, streamlining operations and cutting down costs, and allowing 24/7 trading.
Other than that, blockchain’s feature of a shared system of record that cannot be altered allows for greater data security and transparency. It establishes trust in the market and allows for easier oversight and compliance for regulatory authorities. Specifically, such a level of transparency greatly reduces information asymmetry commonly seen in Pakistani markets, allowing participants to operate in an environment where there is a clearer understanding of the risks and returns involved, thereby promoting greater financial inclusion.
Above all, asset tokenisation will give rise to a new set of financial products. By turning illiquid assets such as an airplane or machinery, for example, into digital tokens, businesses and governments can generate new sources of funding.

 

However, these assets bring their own set of challenges; chief among them being the lack of understanding of what tokenisation exactly is. The mechanism of tokenising assets is complex, and the products created from it could prove to be even more so. This was particularly true for nonprogrammable assets during the 2008–09 financial crisis, which had been spurred by products that no regulator or inventor understood.
The case here is similar, where a layer of programmability complicates the landscape and makes it harder for authorities and investors alike to monitor and mitigate potential risks. Integrating it into the current landscape could also prove to be tricky since there is limited interoperability between blockchain networks and legacy systems. All this requires is a legal and financial framework and expertise that needs to be standardised and implemented across markets and countries.
Then there is the issue of the cold start problem. While tokenised assets and products are easy to produce, limited liquidity deters investors from participating in such markets. Overcoming the cold start problem would require constructing a use case in which the digital representation of collateral delivers material benefits — including much greater mobility, faster settlement, and more liquidity. Delivering true, sustained long-term value requires coordination across a multifaceted value chain and widespread engagement of participants with the new digital asset class.
The speed of settlements could also prove to be a double-edged sword. Like crypto, tokenised assets, especially those exchanged in secondary markets, could experience significant price volatility. Last of all, a common problem that Pakistan will especially encounter is the security risks that such tokens pose. While blockchain technology is generally considered to be secure, there have been instances of successful cyberattacks on crypto exchanges and other blockchain-based systems.
Yet, despite these challenges, tokenisation has the potential to transform the future of finance. The main aim now is to ensure successful adoption while reducing the number of unbanked citizens in the process. By leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology, tokenisation promises the possibility of greater efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity in the financial markets and beyond.

Addressing a jirga comprising parliamentarians and elders from Bajaur tribal district in Chief Minister’s House here, he said that peace had been restored in 2018, however, deliberate attempts were being made to worsen the situation.
He stated that decisions, taken behind closed doors, had always worsened the situation.

 

Sources privy to the meeting said that participants discussed law and order and development schemes in Bajaur district. They said that situation could not be brought under control until all the stakeholders were on the same page.
“Governments are run with wisdom. There should be a mechanism where all the stakeholders agree on a point and be on the same page. That is how I believe things will normalise,” former governor Shaukatullah told Dawn.

Elders from Bajaur, Khyber and Kurram apprise chief minister of their issues

Others said that there were issues but they were performing duty, protecting their areas and never allowed outsiders to stay on their land. “As far as military operations are concerned, you know well that the chief minister himself is helpless and cannot stop it in his own hometown, how do you expect him to stop such action in Bajaur,” a participant told this scribe on condition of anonymity.

 

He said that development in the merged district was also discussed in detail in the meeting.
He said that the chief minister promised that if the funds, promised by federal government for merged districts, were not released, he would cut funds from other developmental projects and divert them to Bajaur.
A statement issued by Chief Minister’s House said that the participants of jirga presented suggestions for establishing permanent peace and expressed full confidence in the chief minister, assuring him all out support.
The jirga discussed law and order situation in the province, improvement in Pak-Afghan relations and development strategy.
It said that the chief minister announced increasing compensation for partially damaged houses in Bajaur from Rs0.16 million to Rs0.5 million following recent operations. He said that federal government had promised Rs1 billion annually at the time when the previously tribal areas were being merged with KP, however, over the past seven years, only Rs168 billion was released.
He said that federal government was not providing funds for Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP). He issued direction for increasing the upper age limit for recruitment in police department in merged districts.
Also, in another jirga with members from Kurram and Khyber districts, the chief minister said that he understood the agony of military operations. He added that he would not leave his people alone.
He told the jirga members that sectarian issues caused damage and enemies took advantage of the situation. He said that he would soon visit Kurram to resolve issues of displaced persons. He ordered registration of those people, who had left their homes due to the law and order situation, within one week.
Our correspondent from Mansehra adds: Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi said that the street movement launched from Karachi on the directive of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founding chairman Imran Khan would bring revolutionary changes in political system of the country.
“This mammoth crowd, which gathered at midnight to welcome the convoy of the street movement from Haripur to different parts of Hazara, is an eye-opener for the government. The people want immediate release of PTI jailed founding chairman, Imran Khan,” he said while addressing cheering crowds at Khatm-i-Nubowat Chowk and College Doraha in small hours of Sunday.
PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the speaker of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, Babar Saleem Swati, PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar and deputy president Kamal Saleem Swati were also present on the occasion.
The chief minister said that the street movement had successfully mobilised people from Sindh to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and would soon reach every nook and corner of the country.
“We want to make it clear to the government that this time it cannot suppress the people’s street movement. We have turned every city and every square into D-Chowk,” he said.
Mr Afridi said the country needed Imran Khan’s leadership to steer it out of the prevailing socio-political and economic crises, accusing federal government of failing to address those challenges.
The convoy of the street movement entered Mansehra through Karakoram Highway at Datta, proceeded through Ghazikot and concluded at College Doraha in the early hours of Sunday.

The development comes after Prime Mi­­nister Shehbaz Sharif, in a meeting with a Chinese delegation, had reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to the One China Policy and lauded China’s generous support to Pakis­tan, especially through China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
“The visit will be undertaken on the special invitation of the Chairman of the National People’s Congress (NPC) of China, Zhao Leji”, the statement said.
“The visit marks the first state-level and maiden official visit of the Pakistani Parliament in the year 2026 to the friendly People’s Republic of China.”
It further added that the visit of the Parliament delegation would coincide with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, serving as a “milestone reflecting the enduring and time-tested friendship between the two countries”.
“In recognition of this historic occasion, Pakistan and China have agreed to commemorate the anniversary in a befitting and meaningful manner through the organisation of a series of joint events throughout the year,” the Secretariat said.
It said that the parliamentary delegation led by Speaker Sadiq will hold meetings with the parliamentary and political leadership of China, focusing on “strengthening parliamentary cooperation and further deepening bilateral ties”.
It was also announced that a high-level Senate delegation, led by Deputy Chairman Senator Syedaal Khan, would undertake an official visit to the United States from January 20 to 25, 2026.</p><small>2026-01-18 19:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/182313485417dd2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967688/at-least-6-including-women-and-children-killed-as-gunmen-open-indiscriminate-fire-in-kps-karak-officials' target='_blank'><strong>At least 6, including women and children, killed as gunmen open ‘indiscriminate fire’ in KP’s Karak: officials</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: At least six members of a family, including two women and children, were killed on Sunday when gunmen opened indiscriminate fire following a “domestic dispute” in the Sabirabad area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district.

According to Rescue 1122 officials, their teams had finally managed to enter the charred building to launch a search for survivors and bodies as the cooling process was still underway.
The fire, which erupted on Saturday night at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road, had been brought under control by about 70 per cent by late Sunday afternoon, officials said.
Speaking to the media at around 7pm, CM Murad said, “I say with utmost grief that so far, it is confirmed that six people have lost their lives, including KMC firefighter Furqan Shaukat.”
He added that 22 others were hurt and had now been discharged from hospitals as they had faced minor injuries.
“But what is very concerning […] is that around 58 people — some people even say more than 60 — are missing. May God give them more life.”
According to a list shared with Dawn around the same time, the South district office had received reports of 53 missing people from their families so far.
The Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.
A separate statement by the South Zone police also listed the following helpline contact numbers: 021-99205670, 021-99201196 and 021-99205691.



Hundreds of people had gathered around the building today, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.
During his media talk, CM Murad noted that the mall was a three-storey building with a basement and housed more than 1,000 shops.
While the chief minister noted that the cause of the fire could not be ascertained for sure at this stage, he said a short circuit was being blamed for igniting the blaze in a shop with flammable material.
Terming it a “very upsetting” incident, he stressed that authorities were making efforts to find missing people.
The Sindh CM detailed that around 26 fire tenders, 10 bowsers and multiple snorkels took part in the fire extinguishing operations.
CM Murad, citing what he had been informed, said an alert about the fire was received at 10:16pm, and the first fire tender had reached the site at 10:27pm.
“All municipal authorities acted immediately, according to what I have been informed, and all these things will be verified.”



President announces civil award for deceased firefighter
President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday spoke CM Murad over the telephone to inquire about the latest situation of the fire, stressing the need to use all available resources to ensure the success of rescue and firefighting operations, a statement from the President’s House said.
“The president also paid tribute to firefighter Farqan Shaukat, who lost his life in the blaze, and asked the Sindh government to nominate him for a civil award.”
He directed authorities to ensure proper medical care for the injured and take immediate steps for the rehabilitation of affected families, while emphasising strict enforcement of fire safety laws and the modernisation of safety inspection mechanisms in commercial and residential buildings to prevent similar incidents in the future.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said PM Shehbaz Sharif also inquired about the incident over the phone, offering all kinds of assistance to the provincial government from the Centre.
‘Need properly marked fire exits’
Pointing out that the mall was constructed in the 1980s, he said, “I admit that we could not control the deterioration that, without any study, multi-level buildings were allowed. And now if we stop them, the builders make a fuss that they are being bothered.”
He highlighted that many buildings do not have materials to extinguish fire available inside the buildings, and stressed the need for fire exits to be properly marked.







‘Flammable material biggest challenge’
At around 4pm, South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso told Dawn that the fire had been brought under control by up to 70pc.
Speaking to Geo News, DC Khoso said authorities were gathering information about the number of people trapped inside the building.
“We have cordoned off the area and are trying to extinguish the blazes phase-wise,” he said.
Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Abid Jalal told Geo News in the afternoon that “firefighting is underway from all three sides”.
He also said that the fire had been brought under control by about 70-75pc. However, he stressed that the building was very dilapidated.
“The backside has collapsed, and the front area is also about to collapse.”
Terming flammable material inside the mall as the “biggest challenge” in fully dousing the blaze, COO Jalal pointed out that accessing the building was very difficult.
“Sending firefighters inside right now is not without danger,” the rescue officer said. Therefore, he added, the team’s strategy was to control the fire first and then begin the search once they were able to enter the mall.
COO Jalal detailed that over 125 people, including firefighters, were engaged in the ongoing operations and about 20-22 vehicles of the fire brigade were involved.



A DawnNewsTV correspondent present at the site reported that all sides of the mall had been impacted, with one having “completely collapsed”.
He added that several people had come to look for their relatives, including shopkeepers working at the mall.
Delhi Colony residents Mansoor and Jameel told DawnNewsTV that they were unable to contact six of their family members who had come to Gul Plaza last night for shopping.
They said their last contact was at around 10:10pm last night, after which their mobile numbers were not reachable. The missing members comprised three women, two men and a 14-year-old girl.



Speaking to the media at the site in the afternoon, Karachi Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad said the search for missing people will begin after the fire has been put out and the cooling process has been completed.
‘Very old’ building
“There were goods such as crockery, clothes, electrical appliances, cosmetics and perfumes in various shops, due to which the fire intensified,” Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan explained.

The spokesperson added that on Sunday morning, 20 fire tenders from different departments and institutions were being employed to extinguish the blaze.
“But the building appears very old, and there is a danger that its structure may fall at any time because of the impact of the fire. Thus, the rescue operation is being carried out with extreme caution,” he said.
“When we arrived, the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames,” Khan told Reuters.
A Rescue 1122 spokesperson told BBC Urdu early on Sunday that the fire “spread over 8,000 square yards is very intense and the process to extinguish it [fully] could take one to two days”.







Earlier in the day, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed also confirmed that six bodies and 11 injured had been brought to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) so far. State-run APP reported that an emergency has been declared at the hospital.
In a statement run by APP, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said “more than 17 people” had been taken to hospitals due to suffocation, several of whom were discharged after receiving medical treatment.
Noting that Gul Plaza was an old building, he said the final cause of the fire will only be known after the completion of investigations. He added that 40 snorkels were taking part in the operation.
A firefighter identified as Furqan Shoukat also lost his life during the fire-extinguishing efforts, according to a statement by Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab.
“In this time of grief, we stand with the family of martyred Furqan and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation will provide full support to its martyred employees,” the mayor was quoted as saying by APP.
He said teams and machinery are fully engaged in extinguishing the fire.
In a separate statement, Wahab said all municipal departments have been directed to provide full support to the victims.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a separate statement reported by state-run Radio Pakistan, also expressed sorrow over the firefighter’s death.
He highlighted that Furqan sacrificed his life while saving the public, and prayed for his elevated ranks.
‘Seemingly caused by short circuit’
“It appears to have been caused by a circuit breaker,” Sindh Inspector General (IG) Javed Alam Odho told reporters at the site, noting that Gul Plaza housed around 1,200 shops and also had a basement.
“The layout and construction of this market was such, and secondly, the nature of the items in it — such as carpets, blankets and other objects made of resins — so the fire is still simmering because of these.”



Garden Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Mohsin Raza also said in a statement on Saturday night that the fire appeared to have been caused by a short circuit at one of the shops, before spreading to the entire mall.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed officials to divert traffic in the area to alternative routes for the safe passage of citizens.
In a statement, he said that the cause of the fire should be ascertained through a thorough investigation. He said that the building should be secured so that the fire does not spread.
The minister said the routes should be cleared so that fire brigade vehicles could access the scene.

A Sindh Rangers spokesperson said in a statement that personnel had been deployed to the scene of the incident.
“Rangers personnel are actively participating in rescue activities and rescue operations along with the fire brigade staff,” the statement, which was issued shortly after the fire erupted, said. “Officers and personnel will remain at the scene until the rescue operation is completed.”
The statement further read that in addition to aiding in rescue operations, a contingent of Rangers had been deployed to cordon off the building for the safety of civilians and to ensure traffic flow.
“Alongside fire tenders, Rangers personnel are evacuating trapped people and ensuring the safety of valuables,” the statement read, adding that protecting lives and preventing the fire from further spreading was a top priority.
President, PM vow assistance as traders fear huge losses
Traders feared huge losses as their goods were reduced to ashes by the blaze.
While the estimates vary, the All City Traders Ittehad Association (ACTIA) estimated losses worth around Rs2-2.5 billion, including “repair and reconstruction costs”.
In a statement, ACTIA patron-in-chief Sharjeel Goplani said chairman Zahid Amin and other members of the association had conducted an assessment of the affected mall.
Addressing the Sindh government and the prime minister, Goplani said, “Currently, 1,200 traders have suffered losses. This should be compensated immediately.”
President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz expressed their deep grief over the fire at Gul Plaza and the resulting loss of lives.
In a statement reported by APP, the premier instructed that all possible assistance should be provided to the affected traders and other individuals, and that all necessary facilities should be provided to the injured.
He stressed that all relevant departments should work together in the rescue operation.







In his statement, President Zardari directed that the Sindh government — which is of his PPP — and the relevant authorities “provide immediate and every possible assistance to the affected people and the traders”.
“No stone should be left unturned in providing the best medical facilities to the injured,” the statement quoted him as saying.







Memon, in a statement reported by APP, said the Sindh government will decide the future course of action after a complete assessment of the losses.
The minister said that whether it is the trader community or other affected individuals, the government will make every effort to provide maximum possible assistance within the framework of law and regulations.
CM Murad orders inquiry
Taking notice of the incident, CM Murad issued orders to Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi for an immediate inquiry into the matter and to prepare a report on the cause of the fire.
CM Murad was briefed about the incident earlier in the day at the CM House by Commissioner Naqvi and DC Khoso, who informed him that the fire broke out between 9:45pm and 10:15pm.
“The fire safety arrangements in the building should be inspected,” CM Murad was quoted as saying in a statement.
He ordered the strict implementation of fire safety rules and action against those whose negligence or carelessness would be proven.
“A fire safety audit should immediately be conducted of Karachi’s commercial buildings,” CM Murad said.
According to the briefing, more than 1,200 shops were gutted in the incident. A massive emergency response was launched, involving 22 fire brigade vehicles, 10 water bowzers, four snorkel vehicles, and 33 Rescue 1122 ambulances.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had directed CM Murad and Wahab to deploy all resources to control the fire.
Expressing grief over the loss of lives and property, he demanded an immediate probe into the blaze and ordered that steps be taken to prevent such future tragedies.







Chief secretary, governor visit site
Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah visited the site of the incident earlier in the day to assess the rescue operations.
The South deputy commissioner and Rescue 1122 officials briefed him on the steps taken to control the fire.
The chief secretary issued orders for the deployment of all available fire tenders and additional rescue workers.
Soon after the fire began, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori had also visited Gul Plaza, where he was briefed on the rescue and relief operations.
Standing alongside the traders whose shops were ablaze, the governor issued directives for the rehabilitation of the affected.
Prior to his visit, in a statement from his office, Tessori expressed concern over the incident and ordered the relevant authorities to immediately expedite rescue and relief operations.
He also ordered an immediate report on the incident and firefighting operations, while assuring traders and others affected by the blaze of full cooperation.



Frequent fires in city
Gul Plaza has witnessed fire incidents in the past as well.
In August 2016, more than 25 shops were burnt in a huge fire that broke out in the multi-storey market. It was believed that a short circuit caused the fire.
A fire at a warehouse in Gul Plaza in August 2008, also caused by an electric short-circuit, destroyed some goods. However, no casualty was reported.
Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.

 

At a conference in October 2025 following multiple fire incidents, city planners, fire experts and disaster management authorities raised serious concerns over the deteriorating state of fire preparedness in Karachi.
They urged authorities to take immediate action to align the metropolis’s fire safety systems with international standards, warning that the current state leaves the city dangerously exposed to large-scale emergencies.
In December, the Sindh Assembly voted unanimously in favour of an opposition-sponsored resolution that called for the comprehensive modernisation of Karachi’s inadequate and substandard firefighting system.

The TTAP delegation, led by the chairperson and the newly-appointed opposition leader in the National Assembly, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, has arrived in Sindh for four days. The visit is part of the mobilisation efforts for a nationwide ‘street movement’ called by the PTI, scheduled for February 8.
TTAP members also announced observing “Black Day” and nationwide strike on Feb 8, to commemorate the second anniversary of the last general elections in Pakistan, which they claimed were rigged.







According to the TTAP’s manifesto, “Democracy rests on the foundation of transparent elections; therefore, restoring public trust in the transfer of power is possible only through fair elections.”
The manifesto demanded “the immediate appointment of an impartial chief election commissioner and the holding of transparent elections under a new election commission.”
It further called for an independent investigation into the alleged rigging in the Feb 8, 2024, general elections, the identification of those responsible, and their punishment under Article 6 of the Constitution, which corresponds to high treason.
“Through the 26th and 27th constitutional amendments, the independence of the judiciary has been undermined by keeping the sword of judges’ transfers hanging over their heads,” it said.
“Conscientious judges, including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Athar Minallah, and Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza, have been sidelined.”
“The TTAP manifesto said it “strongly condemned” the recent actions against Justice Tariq Jahangiri, terming his disqualification the “latest example of an attack on the judiciary”.
It further condemned the “false cases and convictions” against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife.
“TTAP demands the immediate release of all political prisoners, including former prime minister Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Umar Sarfaraz Cheema, Mian Mahmood ur Rashid, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Hassan Niazi, Ali Wazir, Haji Abdul Samad, Wali Mohmand, Dr Mahrang Baloch, and the detainees of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee,” the manifesto said.
Moreover, it called for an end to restrictions on meetings of party leaders and family with Imran.
Referring to the PECA law, the manifesto termed it a move to “silence critical voices and curtail media freedom”. It labelled the legislation as “black law” and demanded its “immediate revocation”.
During the APC, members slammed the “economic exploitation” of media networks, including Dawn TV, by imposing an advertisement ban.
The manifesto also demanded that the ongoing military operation in the Tirah Valley be “stopped immediately”, urging that the “federal government should take the provincial government into confidence on all matters”.
“All issues with Afghanistan should be resolved diplomatically,” the manifesto read, further asking the “unanimous demands” of the Jirga held in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly be immediately accepted.
‘Everyone will chant Pakistan Zindabad if provinces get their rights’
Speaking to the APC, TTAP chief Achakzai said, “Everyone will chant Pakistan Zindabad if the provinces get their rights.
“We have to understand the problems of every province.”
“Come, let’s save our country,” Achakzai said, adding, “If you call the people of Waziristan and tell them that it is [Pakistan] your country, the terrorism will end.”
He alleged that the mandate of 25 million people was stolen in the Feb 8 elections.
“We have to come out on Feb 8 to protest peacefully,” he added, saying, “people will have to be united.”
‘90 per cent of people are in favour of Imran Khan’
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) head and nominated leader of opposition in the Senate, Allama Raja Nasir, said, “90 per cent of people in Pakistan are in favour of Imran Khan.”
“Despite keeping Imran in jail, they couldn’t keep people away from him. Only the public can pull Pakistan out of this turmoil,” he said.
Abbas also urged people to take to the streets and join the peaceful protest on Feb 8.
“If people come out on Feb 8, we will see a big difference on Feb 9.”
‘Over 200 FIRs and over two years in jail’
Former NA speaker Asad Qaiser said that Imran had been in jail for two years, and over 200 first information reports (FIRs) had been registered against him.
“His wife and nephew are also in jail,” Qaiser said, adding that the PTI founder had always opted for a life of struggle over lavishness.
“Despite problems, he [Imran Khan] stood firm and resolute.”
The ex-speaker said that Imran’s perspective was centred around human rights; therefore, he “will never compromise.”
He further stated that Imran had denied vengeance once he got in power.
“Our Constitution gives the freedom to express and assemble, but we are not allowed to hold public gatherings.“</p><small>2026-01-18 16:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1816032599c5cf7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967681/trump-invites-pm-shehbaz-to-join-gaza-board-of-peace-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Trump invites PM Shehbaz to join Gaza ‘Board of Peace’: FO</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been invited to be a part of the Gaza “Board of Peace” that is being formed by United States President Donald Trump, the Foreign Office has said.
“The prime minister of Pakistan has received the invitation from the president of the United States to join the Board of Peace on Gaza,” said FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi in response to media queries.
“Pakistan will remain engaged with international efforts for peace and security in Gaza, leading to a lasting solution to the Palestine issue in accordance with United Nations resolutions,” he added.







The so-called “Board of Peace” has begun to take shape as the US moves on to the second phase of Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza, which stands decimated after two years of Israel’s bombardment.
Trump had already declared himself the chair of the body, as he promotes a controversial vision of economic development in the Palestinian territory.
The United States has invited the heads of around 60 states to join the Board of Peace, including those of Turkiye, Egypt, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Morocco, Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia.
However, the charter of the board, which does not mention Gaza by name, suggests that Trump has begun to position it as a rival to the United Nations.
On Friday, the US president named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and his senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to the panel.
According to Reuters, the board also includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Israel has repeatedly opposed any Turkish role in Gaza.
Other members of the executive board include UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Sigrid Kaag; Israeli-Cypriot billionaire Yakir Gabay; and a minister from the United Arab Emirates, which established relations with Israel in 2020.
A Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern Gaza held its first meeting in Cairo on Friday, which was attended by Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who has partnered with Witkoff for months on the issue.

 

Former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath, who is leading the committee, has an ambitious plan that includes pushing war debris into the Mediterranean Sea and rebuilding destroyed infrastructure within three years.
Analysts say the coming weeks will test whether Washington can translate the ambitious blueprint into tangible progress on governance, security and reconstruction in Gaza, as negotiations over demilitarisation and political transition intensify.</p><small>2026-01-18 16:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/18193841fc22843.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967685/policeman-martyred-by-unknown-assailants-riding-a-motorcycle-in-kps-bannu-district' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman martyred by unknown assailants riding a motorcycle in KP’s Bannu district</strong></a><br><p>BANNU: A target killing incident occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Sunday, where unknown assailants riding a motorcycle opened fire on a policeman, killing him on the spot.
According to a police statement, the incident occurred in the district’s Mamma Khel area, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Haved Police Station. It added that the martyred policeman was deployed at the Mazanga police checkpoint when he was attacked.
District Police Officer (DPO) Yasir Afridi said, “The martyred policeman, identified as Iqbal, was in his native village of Akhund Mamma Khel, when he was shot.”
“After offering evening prayers, he was on his way back home when motorcycle riders opened fire on him in front of his house, killing him on the spot,” the DPO added.
Following the incident, a heavy contingent of police reached the scene, cordoned off the area, and launched a search operation, while further investigation into the incident is underway.
The security situation in KP has worsened over the last three years with an increase in terrorist attacks, especially after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire deal with the government in 2022 and vowed to target security forces, police personnel, and law enforcement agencies personnel.
Last month, Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan revealed that 27 cops were martyred in 134 terrorist attacks targeting personnel in the district in 2025. He added that during the attacks, 79 sustained injuries, while in retaliatory action by the police, 53 terrorists were killed and 163 were injured.
The DIG said that Bannu police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations across the district, resulting in the arrest of 105 terrorists. Overall, successful action was taken against 170 terrorists, he said.
Meanwhile, an important jirga was held in Bannu under the chairmanship of Brigadier Umair Niazi of 116 Brigade and Deputy Commissioner Faheem Khan, with the elders of Jani Khel, during which the security and administrative situation of the district was reviewed.
During the jirga, demands were raised regarding law and order, road repair and construction, action against absentee teachers, and the restoration of 4G internet services.
Brigadier Niazi assured the jirga elders that peace and stability would be ensured, directed government employees to resume their duties, stressed avoiding all contact with terrorists under a zero-tolerance policy, and announced that all roads in Bannu would be opened after the completion of security arrangements.
The elders appreciated the steps taken by the institutions and assured their full cooperation.</p><small>2026-01-18 15:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/181113049e1fcde.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967516/experts-warn-elite-capture-unchecked-development-eroding-islamabads-green-spaces' target='_blank'><strong>Experts warn elite capture, unchecked development eroding Islamabad’s green spaces</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Concerned citizens and experts speaking at a webinar raised apprehensions over the growing environmental crisis in Islamabad, caused by rapid, unplanned and largely irreversible urban development by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and various housing societies, often in violation of zoning rules and regulations.
Speakers stressed that the city’s green spaces were steadily being replaced by concrete due to weak governance, elite capture and a persistent conflict between populist decision-making and professional, science-based planning.
A key outcome of the discussion was a strong call for a new, collaborative approach to sustainable urban development through the establishment of a dedicated Islamabad-focused think tank. Participants emphasised the need to bring together independent professionals, policymakers, civil society and creative communities, including architects, designers and artists, to develop long-term, people-centred solutions.
The webinar underscored that environmental degradation was not only an ecological issue but also a major public health concern, making citizen engagement and collective responsibility essential.
The webinar was organised by the Development Communications Network (Devcom-Pakistan) on the theme “Islamabad’s Green Future – Coping with Irrational Development”. It brought together environmental experts, policymakers, civil society members and concerned citizens to deliberate on the growing environmental challenges facing the federal capital.
Environmental expert Dr Tariq Banuri highlighted that environmental protection efforts were being undermined by institutional weaknesses and the marginalisation, and at times harassment, of environmental professionals and activists working to safeguard protected hills, forests and wildlife habitats.
Participants agreed that without transparent, democratic and inclusive governance, Islamabad’s ecological balance would continue to deteriorate.
Dr Banuri focused on the environmental consequences of rapid and often unplanned urban development and underscored the urgent need for sustainable governance models that balance economic growth with environmental conservation.
He said Islamabad’s environmental degradation was a symptom of deeper governance challenges, pointing to elite capture, weak institutional frameworks and the ongoing tension between populism and professionalism as key factors driving the replacement of green spaces with unchecked concrete development.
Dr Zafar Mirza strongly condemned the ongoing tree-cutting in Islamabad, terming it a brutal act against nature and a direct assault on public health and environmental sustainability. Emphasising the power of citizen-led action, he suggested forming active citizens’ forums modelled on initiatives such as “Lahore Bachaao”, which have played a critical watchdog and advocacy role in urban conservation.
He said similar collective platforms in Islamabad could significantly contribute to protecting green spaces and the Margalla Hills National Park by raising public awareness, monitoring violations and holding authorities accountable for safeguarding the city’s natural heritage.
Former senator Mian Attiq stressed the urgent need to establish an independent, multidisciplinary think tank to guide the CDA on sustainable planning and environmental governance in Islamabad.
He said evidence-based advice from professionals and experts was essential to correct the city’s current development trajectory.
Former Pak-EPA director general Ziaul Islam criticised the ineffective bureaucratic approaches dominating environmental governance in Islamabad, noting that such top-down systems often ignored ground realities and community knowledge.
Devcom Director Munir Ahmed said Islamabad was witnessing an alarming wave of tree-cutting that threatened the very identity of the capital as a green and liveable city. “The unchecked felling of trees in the name of development reflects a serious failure of planning and governance,” he said.
He emphasised that the Islamabad High Court and relevant parliamentary committees should play a proactive, pro-citizens role, calling for accountable governance, restoration of institutional mandates and meaningful participation of independent environmental professionals and citizens in decision-making.
Internationally known ecosystems expert Ashiq Ahmed Khan said sustainable development was fundamentally a governance challenge as much as an environmental one.
He said true sustainability could not be achieved without inclusive and democratic decision-making processes that gave space to collective voices, particularly those of independent experts, local communities and civil society.
Others who spoke on the occasion included Rabia Raheel, Ivan Carmody, Abdul Shakoor Sindhu, Almas Shakoor and Silvia Shamoon.

Demonstrations sparked in late December by anger over economic hardship exploded into protests widely seen as the biggest challenge to the Iranian leadership in years.
Iranian officials have said the demonstrations were peaceful before turning into “riots” and blamed foreign influence, namely from Iran’s foes, the United States and Israel.
The rallies subsided after the crackdown carried out by security forces amid a communications blackout that started on January 8 as the protests grew in size and intensity.
Government officials have said calm has been restored, with schools reopening on Sunday — Iran’s weekend falling on Thursday and Friday — after a week of closure.
Late Saturday, the Tasnim news agency reported “the relevant authorities announced that internet access would also be gradually restored”, but gave no further details.
Citing an unnamed “informed source”, the agency said local messaging applications “will soon be activated” on Iran’s domestic intranet.
On Sunday morning, AFP was able to connect to the internet from its Tehran office, though the vast majority of internet providers and mobile internet remain cut.
Outgoing international calls have been possible since Tuesday, and text messaging was restored on Saturday morning.
For days, text messages and international phone calls — and at times even local calls — were cut off.
Iran has since been relying on its intranet, which has supported local media websites, ride-hailing apps, delivery service and banking platforms.
Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR) alleges it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters killed by security forces. However, the media cannot independently confirm the figure, and Iranian officials have not given an exact death toll for the protests.
On Saturday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said “a few thousand” people had been killed by what he called “agents” of the United States and Israel, and Iranian local media has reported multiple deaths among security forces.
Khamenei said authorities “must break the back of the seditionists”, as local media has reported thousands of arrests and rights groups have estimated up to 20,000 people have been detained.</p><small>2026-01-18 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645828-sindh-cm-orders-commercial-buildings-fire-safety-audits-after-karachi-mall-blaze' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh CM orders commercial buildings' fire safety audits after Karachi mall blaze</strong></a><br><p>

“It’s blackmail what he’s doing … and it’s not necessary. It doesn’t help the alliance (Nato) and it also doesn’t help Greenland,” David van Weel said in an interview on Dutch television.
In a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said additional 10 per cent import tariffs would take effect on February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain countries that have agreed to contribute personnel to a Nato exercise on Greenland.
Van Weel said the Greenland mission was intended to show the US Europe’s willingness to help defend Greenland, and he was opposed to Trump making a connection with diplomacy over the island and trade.
Trump has insisted he will settle for nothing less than full ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, which he has said is vital to US security because of its strategic location and mineral deposits.
Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have said the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States.
Ambassadors from the European Union’s 27 countries will convene on Sunday for an emergency meeting to discuss their response to Trump’s tariff threat.</p><small>2026-01-18 10:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645795-no-information-about-my-child-woman-breaks-down-during-search-for-missing-son' target='_blank'><strong>‘There is no information': Families search for loved ones after Gul Plaza fire</strong></a><br><p>

The White House announced this week the setting up of a “Gaza Executive Board,” which would operate under a broader so-called “Board of Peace” to be chaired by US President Donald Trump as part of his 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza.

 

The executive board, described as having an advisory role, includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi, alongside other regional and international officials.
Late on Saturday, Netanyahu’s office objected to the composition of the executive board.
“The announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy,” the office of Netanyahu said.
“The prime minister has instructed the foreign affairs minister to contact the US secretary of state on this matter.”
It did not explain the reason for its objection, but Israel has previously objected strongly to any Turkish role in post-war Gaza, with relations between the two countries deteriorating sharply since Israel’s assault on Gaza began in October 2023.
In addition to naming Turkey’s foreign minister to the executive board, Trump has also invited Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to join the overarching Board of Peace.
Media reports said that leaders of the country’s ruling coalition were scheduled to meet on Sunday to examine the composition of the executive board.
“There is a meeting scheduled of the coalition at 10am (0800 GMT),” the spokesman of Netanyahu’s Likud Party told AFP, declining to provide further details.
Alongside Likud, the coalition includes the Religious Zionist Party led by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) led by far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir.
The White House said Trump’s plan would include three bodies: the Board of Peace, chaired by Trump; a Palestinian committee of technocrats tasked with governing Gaza; and the Gaza Executive Board, which would play an advisory role.
The Palestinian technocratic committee held its first meeting in Cairo on Saturday.
The diplomatic developments came as the United States said this week that the Gaza truce plan had entered a second phase, shifting from implementing a ceasefire to the disarmament of Hamas.</p><small>2026-01-18 09:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645788-karachi-gul-plaza-fire-what-we-know-so-far-or' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Gul Plaza fire: What we know so far</strong></a><br><p>

District South Deputy Commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso said that the restaurants and other food shops had been sealed because they had placed their furniture on the walkways.  
He said that the sealed outlets would be unsealed after payment of fines and undertaking by the restaurant owners to fully comply with the standard operating procedures (SOPs).  
Mr Nabi said that the commissioner had directed all deputy commissioners to take strict action against the “soft encroachments” that hindered the vehicular and pedestrian movement in any part of the city.  
He said that most of the shops and eateries were sealed in Arambagh sub-division where Burns Road Food Street was also located.  
The DC said that all shopkeepers would have to pay fines and submit written assurances of compliance with the SOPs. 
He said that some of the restaurants and shops sealed two days ago would be allowed to re-open their outlets as they had already paid fines and submitted required affidavits.  
Meanwhile, the anti-encroachment operation also continued in other parts of the city.  
Korangi DC Masood Bhutto said that two restaurants were sealed in in Model Colony and five others in Korangi and other parts of the district.  
It may be noted that the city authorities have launched a massive operation against encroachments on footpaths and walkways across the city, sealing several markets, including the largest motorcycles market at Akbar Road, Saddar.

The controversy over the hunting permits for markhor and grey gorals emerged when the wildlife department received minutes of a recent meeting with the climate change and environmental coordination ministry where minister Musadik Masood Malik was in the chair.
“The chair directed that a legal opinion be obtained to clarify the matter and that a subsequent meeting be convened to finalise the non-exportable quota in line with relevant international conventions. Till that time, no quotas for non-exportable trophies will be allocated by any province,” reads minutes of the meeting available with Dawn.
Sources in KP wildlife department told Dawn that the federal ministry of climate change and environmental coordination had bound intermediaries, formally called outfitters, to take no objection certificates before moving permit holders to the region for hunting, a move that was an encroachment on the province’s jurisdiction.

Wildlife dept insists permit restriction encroachment on its domain will discourage hunters

In a formal response to the federal government’s NOC move, the KP wildlife department has feared that the restriction would discourage hunters, mostly foreigners.
It said that Section-11 of the KP Wildlife and Biodiversity (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Act, 2015, declared that “All wild animals, free ranging or captive, tamed or untamed, found within the territorial jurisdiction of the province shall be deemed to be the property of the government.”
The official documents reveal that the management of wildlife within the province vests with the KP wildlife department as per provision of the said act. In this context, matters relating to non-exportable hunting quota, which do not involve international trade appropriately, remain within the provincial regulatory framework and are not in contravention to the act ibid. The wildlife department has informed the federal government in its reply that “Pakistan Trade Control of Wild Fauna and Flora Rules, 20218 has no provisions to determine local Quotas.”
Also, under the Pakistan Trade Control of Wild Fauna and Flora Act, 20212, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Management Authority is mandated to regulate matters relating to export, import and re-export of wild fauna and flora.
Rules 3 of the Pakistan Trade Control of Wild Fauna and Flora Rules, 2019 provides that the functions of the Management Authority include coordination, facilitation and consideration of advice from the scientific authority and relevant stakeholders.
The rules say that decisions concerning wildlife conservation and management benefits for provincial units shall be made in light of close consultation with the provincial government with a view to develop informed and consensus-based outcomes consistent with constitutional devolution and field realities.
An official of the wildlife department told Dawn that six permits for hunting gray goral had been sold for $398,500 and one of them had already been used.
He added that action on other permits had got blocked as the federal wildlife authority had linked it with its permission.
The official insisted that hunters were reluctant to approach that authority.
He also said the wildlife department had sold 11 permits of non-exportable trophies for $553,300 and only five of them had been used.
The official said that 80 per cent of the revenue generated from the sale of permits was spent on the welfare of communities in the respective areas, while the rest went to the exchequer.
He said the community’s share was spent on public welfare initiatives.

In a review published in the British journal The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Womens Health on Saturday, the team said they had focused on amassing the best-quality evidence to address the claims.
Paracetamol is safe to use in pregnancy, said lead author Asma Khalil, professor of obstetrics and maternal foetal medicine at City St Georges, University of London.
The key message is reassurance: When used as recommended, the best available evidence does not support a causal link with autism, ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) or intellectual disability.

President Trump claimed last year the painkiller could be linked to autism in children if taken during pregnancy

Khalil said she had been asked about the popular pain medication also known as acetaminophen by her patients after Trump in September told pregnant women not to take the drug. At the time, national and international medical groups decried the presidents comments, saying they were not evidence-based.
Paracetamol/Tylenol is the only pain reliever considered safe for pregnant women, and doctors already advise them to use the smallest amount for the shortest time to control pain and fever during pregnancy. Untreated, these conditions can be risky for both pregnant women and their babies. The researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing data, finding 43 studies that were then assessed for quality and bias using a standard tool.
The team particularly focused on studies that looked at children born to the same mother who took paracetamol/Tylenol during one pregnancy but not the other. These take into account shared genetic factors and family environments that could be linked to autism or the other conditions studied, Khalil said.
There were only three studies of this type, but they were large, covering more than 260,000 children assessed for autism, and around 335,000 and 405,000 for ADHD and intellectual disabilities respectively.
They showed no significant link between use of the drug and any of the conditions studied. This remained the case when results from all of the high-quality studies that were assessed were pooled, the authors said.
Khalil said much of the work showing a potential link, including a review of 46 studies cited by Trump officials, was prone to bias or confounding factors that her team’s review had tried to account for. Grainne McAlonan, professor of Translational Neuroscience at King’s College London, who was not involved in the research, praised the study, adding: I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close.
