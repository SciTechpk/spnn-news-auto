<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1920392386d9a66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943248/fm-dar-hints-other-states-may-follow-suit-after-pak-saudi-defence-deal' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar hints other states may follow suit after Pak-Saudi defence deal</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday hinted that some countries were showing interest in building strategic defence agreements with Pakistan, following the country’s landmark pact with Saudi Arabia.
Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday.
The agreement came amid diplomatic upheaval in the Middle East and just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May.
“It’s premature to say anything, but some other countries want to enter into an agreement of this nature,” Dar told reporters in London, replying to a question about whether other states will join the pact or ink similar deals. “This was not signed overnight; it has taken several months.”
Calling the agreement a “historic pact”, FM Dar said Pakistan has always maintained an informal defence arrangement with Saudi Arabia, which is the same as the agreement signed on Wednesday.
“I believe that both sides are very happy. Let’s be frank: Saudi Arabia has stood with us during difficult times, such as the sanctions. Their support was very relevant and important,” he added. “Similarly, during the current crisis since 2022-2023, when we needed IMF (International Monetary Fund) support, Saudi Arabia stood with us.”
 


Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif told Reuters that nuclear weapons were “not on the radar” of the pact. He said the agreement could be extended to cover other Gulf nations.
“We have no intention of using this pact for any aggression,” said Asif. “But if the parties are threatened, then obviously this arrangement will become operative.”
In contrast, asked a day ago about whether Pakistan’s nuclear assets were also up for use under the agreement, Asif said: “What we have, our capabilities, will absolutely be available under this pact.
 


PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also welcomed the development.
He said the way the deal was signed in the context of the recent conflict with India was a “very positive” development for both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and congratulated the prime minister for pulling it off.
 


Separately, India said it hoped Saudi Arabia would keep in mind mutual interests and sensitivities between it and archival Pakistan.
“India and Saudi Arabia have a wide-ranging strategic partnership which has deepened considerably in the last few years,” Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters during a weekly news briefing.
“We expect that this strategic partnership will keep in mind mutual interests and sensitivities,” he said.
 






Saudi Arabia is one of the top exporters of petroleum to India and the two countries agreed this year to boost cooperation in supplies of crude and liquefied petroleum gas.
The two nations were also exploring joint projects in refineries and petrochemicals, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said this year.
A day ago, India’s foreign ministry said it was aware that the pact had been under consideration and that it would study the implications for New Delhi.
The neighbours have fought three major wars, along with numerous clashes, including the four-day conflict in May that was their heaviest fighting in decades.</p><small>2025-09-19 19:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/19235708ba39807.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943249/afghan-national-among-3-terrorists-killed-by-ctd-in-kps-khyber' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan national among 3 ‘terrorists’ killed by CTD in KP’s Khyber</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) gunned down three “terrorists”, including an Afghan national, during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) carried out in Khyber district late on Friday night.
Two among the three militants killed during the IBO, were involved in a suicide bombing in Peshawar which led to the deaths of a sub-inspector and a constable.
A statement issued by the CTD said that the department conducted an IBO based on the reported presence of Fazal Noor, a commander of the banned militant Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) and his group members in Ali Masjid area of the district.
It added that as soon as the SWAT reached the spot, the militants opened fire which was retaliated and the exchange of fire continued for around 30 minutes.
The CTD said a search operation was launched after the firing stopped  and the SWAT team found three dead bodies who were later identified as Muhammad Naeem, Muhammad Karim, residents of Karak, and Noor Nabi, a resident of Nangarhar in Afghanistan, affiliated with the ISKP.
It added that Fazal Noor along with other group members escaped during the exchange of fire.
“The militant group had been under continuous technical surveillance, with investigators tracing their movements and confirming their identity through technical footprints,” the statement read, adding that the CTD traced their movement for the execution of a militant activity in the Lala Chena Dosarky Ali Masjid in Khyber district.
The statement said the SWAT team recovered three SMGs, 135 rounds, 12 magazines and three bundle wear, adding that the technical investigation linked the group to at least three militant attacks.
“Preliminary intelligence confirms that two militants who fled away from the scene were identified as a local commander of ISKP namely Fazal Noor and Hakim Nisar operating under foreign-based, foreign-funded handlers with active plans to conduct major terrorist activities in Peshawar and Khyber,” the statement read.</p><small>2025-09-19 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/192334396c90cba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943183/pakistan-get-close-but-fail-to-finish-313-run-south-africa-chase-in-pre-world-cup-odi-encounter' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan get close but fail to finish 313 run South Africa chase in pre-World Cup ODI encounter</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan were all set to chase South Africa’s daunting 313-run total, but fell 25 runs short in their second one-day international (ODI) pre- Women’s World Cup ODI encounter in Lahore.
A spectacular knock by Sidra Amin, who brought up her second consecutive century of the series, brought them close, but in the end, the Duckworth-Lewis method adjusted 313-run target was a step too far.
Set a mammoth score to chase after the Proteas batters ruled the roost in the first innings, Sidra stepped up again under the Gaddafi Stadium lights to score a sublime hundred — but failed to close the chase.
 






What could have been a night to remember for the fans in the rain-affected ODI clash saw the Women in Green falter in the final stages of the chase — which, if they had come through, would have been their second-highest chase ever.
The match saw the Proteas reach 292-3 in 46 overs before the total was adjusted to 313 according to the D/L method after a disruption in play as the Pakistani bowlers had a forgettable day with the ball.
Player of the match and opening batter Tazmin Brits continued her dominant run with the bat — notching up a mammoth unbeaten 171 in just deliveries.
Proteas skipper Laura Wolvaardt ably supported Brits with a hundred of her own as the two batters set up the third-highest Women-ODI opening partnership of all time of 260.
Pacer Diana Baig was the only Pakistan bowler to get wickets, ending up with figures of 2-45 off her five overs as the spinners went wicketless.
Speaking to Dawn.com in the build-up to the World Cup, Pakistan bowling coach Junaid Khan had termed the fast-bowling line-up of the team as a much-improved unit.
“No doubt our spinners were number one in the world, but now the fast bowlers have also stepped up — I applied my learnings from my recent experience in international cricket — I helped them apply their skills and we saw the results in the World Cup Qualifiers as well,” Junaid said in an interview at the National Stadium in Karachi last month.
Pakistan’s chase
The Pakistan reply saw the early fall of the in-form left-hand bat Muneeba Ali to the medium pace of Marizanne Kapp.
Omaima Sohail — returning to the side, hit a quick-fire 43 of 38 deliveries before falling to Masabata Klaas.
Sidra stepped up yet again to get 122 of just 110 deliveries — but after her fall, the lower order failed to complete the job.
 






The Women in Green slipped from 247-4 to 287 all out, falling 25 runs short.
Earlier in the day, Pakistan skipper Fatima Sana won the toss and elected to bowl first in their second ODI of the series.
South Africa had sailed to an easy victory over Pakistan after chasing down a target of 256 to win by eight wickets in the first ODI of their series in Lahore on Tuesday.
The ODIs are being staged at the Gaddafi Stadium on September 16, 19 and 22, with the first ball of all matches to be bowled at 3:30pm.
Pakistan’s 15-member squad is captained by Fatima, while Laura Wolvaardt leads the visiting side. In the build-up to the series, Pakistan held a two-week pre-series camp in Lahore, which included practice sessions and scenario-based matches.
The squad features one uncapped player, Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland in Dublin in August.
The series provides both sides with an opportunity to finalise preparations for the eight-team World Cup, set to take place from September 30 to November 2 in India and Sri Lanka. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka.
In head-to-head, in 28 ODI matches, South Africa had an upper hand against Pakistan, but the last time both sides met, Pakistan defeated South Africa by eight wickets in the ICC Women’s Championship 2022-25 series fixture at the National Stadium in Karachi on September 14, 2023.</p><small>2025-09-19 18:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/192235439a737b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943225/icc-claims-pcb-breached-protocol-objects-to-pycroft-apology-video-report' target='_blank'><strong>ICC claims PCB breached protocol, objects to Pycroft apology video: report</strong></a><br><p>The International Cricket Council (ICC) has taken strong exception to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) recording a meeting between match referee Andy Pycroft and Pakistan team officials ahead of their Asia Cup fixture against the UAE in Dubai on September 17, with the controversy stemming from the so-called “handshake-gate” incident involving India captain Suryakumar Yadav, the Press Trust of India news agency reported on Friday.
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency, ICC chief executive Sanjog Gupta wrote a ‘strongly-worded email’ to the PCB on Thursday, terming the use of a mobile phone to film the conversation inside the Players and Match Officials Area (PMOA) a breach of protocol.
The meeting was attended by Pycroft, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha, head coach Mike Hesson, team manager Naveed Akram Cheema, media manager Naeem Gillani, and ICC general manager cricket Wasim Khan.
 






Gillani was initially told by ICC officials that mobile phones were not permitted inside the PMOA under anti-corruption regulations.
However, the PCB insisted that the meeting be recorded, even threatening that Pakistan would not take the field against the UAE unless their demand was met. A compromise was reached under which the session was filmed without audio.
In his email, Gupta described the episode as “misconduct” and said the PCB had committed “multiple violations” of the PMOA code. He also objected to a PCB press release which had claimed Pycroft had “apologised” to the Pakistan captain and manager.
Gupta clarified that the referee had only expressed “regret over the miscommunication” that led to Suryakumar not shaking hands with Salman before the India-Pakistan clash.
The controversy delayed the start of Pakistan’s game against the UAE by nearly an hour, with the PCB initially instructing its players to remain at the hotel after learning Pycroft would officiate.
The standoff was broken after the ICC agreed to the pre-match meeting between the referee anthe d Pakistan team management.
 
 

The PCB had earlier demanded Pycroft’s removal from the tournament, accusing him of violating the code of conduct and the MCC’s spirit of cricket by instructing Salman not to shake hands with Suryakumar.
The ICC, however, said Pycroft was only relaying a message from the Asian Cricket Council’s venue manager and that an internal inquiry had cleared him of any wrongdoing.
Later on Friday, however, the PCB defended its decision to record the Dubai meeting, maintaining that its media manager had authorised access to the PMOA and acted within ICC protocols.
“The team’s media manager is part of the squad and has authorised access to the PMOA. His presence there is not a violation,” the PTI quoted “a tournament source” as saying. The board further argued that protocols allow media managers to use cameras inside the PMOA.
However, PTI claimed the matter was flagged by the ICC referee to Pakistan’s anti-corruption officer, who acknowledged the breach. Gupta, in his email, was categorical: “The ICC, in order to preserve the interest of the sport, the tournament and the stakeholders involved accepted PCB’s request although this demonstrated a complete disregard for the sanctity of the PMOA.”</p><small>2025-09-19 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/19222111baa37d4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943244/creating-confrontation-runs-counter-to-peoples-aspirations-china-says-on-trumps-plan-to-retake-bagram-air-base' target='_blank'><strong>‘Creating confrontation’ runs counter to people’s aspirations, China says on Trump’s plan to retake Bagram air base</strong></a><br><p>China on Friday strongly reacted to United States President Donald Trump’s plan to retake control of Afghanistan’s Bagram air base and said “hyping up tensions and creating confrontation” in the region runs counter to people’s aspirations.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said the country’s future should be decided by the Afghan people, according to state-run Global Times.
“China respects Afghanistan’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and that the country’s future should be decided by the Afghan people,” he said.
“Hyping up tensions and creating confrontation in the region runs counter to people’s aspirations,” Lin said, adding that China hopes all parties will play a constructive role in promoting regional peace and stability.
On Thursday, Trump said that his administration is trying to secure the return of the Bagram air base from the Taliban, though specifics on the hitherto secretive negotiations remained scarce.
 
 

Trump said part of his motivation for attempting to reacquire the facility is due to its proximity to a nearby site where China produces nuclear weapons, lamenting that US control over Bagram was not maintained during the American withdrawal under former president Joe Biden.
Although the interim administration had yet to officially respond to claims by Trump, Zakir Jalaly, a Taliban official, said that Afghans have not accepted a military presence in history and the return of Bagram air base was rejected during the Doha talks.
“Military presence has not been accepted by Afghans historically, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement,” he wrote on X.
 






Jalaly added that Washington needs to interact with Afghanistan and both countries have economic and political relations based on mutual respect and shared interests, regardless of whether the US has a military presence in any part of Afghanistan.</p><small>2025-09-19 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/19184108e1c00bf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943192/independent-judges-fight-back-legal-fraternity-expresses-support-for-ihc-judges-petition' target='_blank'><strong>‘Independent judges fight back’: Legal fraternity expresses support for IHC judges’ petition</strong></a><br><p>Members of the legal fraternity on Friday expressed solidarity with the five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Tariq Mah­mood Jahangiri, Saman Raffat Imtiaz and Ejaz Ishaq — who submitted separate petitions at the Supreme Court (SC) on Friday against several issues concerning their court; from the composition of benches to rosters to case transfers.
The petitions, available with Dawn.com, named the IHC, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and the Federation of Pakistan as respondents and have been filed under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
Article 184(3) sets out the SC’s original jurisdiction and enables it to assume jurisdiction in matters involving a question of “public importance” with reference to the “enforcement of any of the fundamental rights” of Pakistan’s citizens.
In their petitions, the judges moved the SC to declare that administrative powers could not be “deployed to undermine or trump the judicial powers” of the high court judges.
They further asked the apex court to declare that a chief justice of the high court was “not authorised to constitute benches or transfer cases” once a high court bench had been assigned a case.
Today’s development has once again highlighted deep fissures within the IHC, which gained prominence when Justice Dogar was appointed as the high court’s chief justice.
The fissures in the high court can be traced back to March last year, when in a startling letter written to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) members, the five IHC judges, along with Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir had accused the country’s intelligence apparatus of interference in judicial affairs, including attempts to pressure judges through abduction and torture of their relatives and secret surveillance inside their homes.
Barrister Rida Hosain said on X that the petition was an act of “Independent judges fighting back”.
“Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi gave his consent for the transfer of judges, including (IHC Chief Justice) Dogar, to the IHC and ‘welcomed’ the transfer,” Hosain said.
“Meanwhile, Chief Justice Dogar’s milestones include suspending and obstructing judges from their judicial duties,” she added.
Advocate Abdul Moiz Jafferii, speaking to Dawn.com on the development, said: “The toying with the constitutional order with the 26th amendment and the later transfer appointment of a judge from Lahore into the Islamabad High Court, which we were asked to rejoice, is bearing fruit.”

“Gone is any small semblance of judicial order”

“Gone is any small semblance of judicial order. This could all have been prevented from happening if the Supreme Court and our senior lords had united when the amendment was being passed in the dead of night,” Jafferii said.
“It could have been corrected if the Supreme Court had intervened in a timely manner once the amendment was challenged,” he added.
“The desire is to denude the will of the people — and unless our Supreme Court and its constitutional benches see their own powerless futures in the faces of these five brave judges — we will get more of the same going forward,” the advocate added.
 
 

Barrister Asad Rahim Khan told Dawn.com: “At a time of such widespread regression for the legal system, the Islamabad High Court has again burnished its reputation for judicial independence.”
“The petitions of the five judges require immediate resolution by the Supreme Court, given just how much its recent verdicts have whittled down the judiciary’s autonomy,” he added.
Taking to X, Advocate Rabbiya Bajwa, former vice president of the Lahore High Court Bar Association, said, “The brave and principled judges of the Islamabad High Court are standing firm against all odds.

“We are not disappointed, as they represent the true face of the judiciary we are striving for in Pakistan. Long live the resistance.”

The leaders of the world’s two largest economies spoke by telephone for the second time since the return to the White House of Trump, who has tried to keep a lid on tensions despite his once virulent criticism of China.
Trump told reporters ahead of the call that he hoped it would finalise a deal to take out of Chinese hands TikTok, the social media platform hugely popular with young Americans that the Republican mogul has turned to himself to garner support.
Neither side reported a final agreement but Trump said the call was “very productive”.
“We made progress on many very important issues, including trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the war between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
He said he would meet Xi on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in South Korea starting at the end of next month and that he would travel to China next year.
Trump said Xi would also visit the US at an unspecified time and that the two leaders would speak again by telephone.
Chinese warning on ‘market rules’
China offered a sterner take on the talks.
“On the TikTok issue, Xi noted that China’s position is clear: the Chinese government respects the will of enterprises and welcomes them to conduct business negotiations based on market rules, to reach solutions that balance interests and comply with Chinese laws and regulations,” state broadcaster CCTV said.
“China hopes the US side will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies investing in the US.”
It described the call as “frank and in-depth”.
The US Congress last year, during Joe Biden’s presidency, passed a law to force TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to sell its US operations for national security reasons or face the ban of the app.
US policymakers, including in Trump’s first term, have warned that China could use TikTok to mine data from Americans or exert influence on what they see on social media.
But Trump, an avid social media user, on Tuesday once again put off a ban of the app, which he has credited as a factor helping him win the 2024 election.
Trump told reporters on Thursday that under an upcoming deal, TikTok’s US business would be “owned by all American investors, and very rich people and companies”.
The Wall Street Journal raised the possibility of a consortium to control TikTok that would include tech giant Oracle and two California investment funds — Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz.
Oracle owner Larry Ellison, one of the world’s richest people, is a supporter of Trump, meaning TikTok would be the latest media or social media app to come under the control or influence of the president.
Tariff truce
Trump while on the campaign trail, bashed China relentlessly as an enemy, but since returning to office, has spoken of his strong relationship with Xi.
Both sides dramatically hiked tariffs against each other during a months-long dispute earlier this year, disrupting global supply chains.
Washington and Beijing then reached a deal to reduce levies, which expires in November, with the US imposing 30 per cent duties on imports of Chinese goods and China hitting US products with a 10pc tariff.
The phone meeting comes after Xi organised a major summit this month with the leaders of Russia, Pakistan and India — and invited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to observe a major military parade in Beijing to mark the end of World War II.
Trump accused China and Russia of conspiring against the US.
Xi, in the Chinese social media readout, voiced appreciation for the US role in World War II.</p><small>2025-09-19 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/192045093fa6a0a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943232/pakistan-extends-indian-aircraft-airspace-ban-for-another-month-paa' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan extends Indian aircraft airspace ban for another month: PAA</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Friday extended the airspace ban for Indian aircraft till October 24, according to a statement by the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA).
Last month, the government extended the closure of its airspace to Indian aircr­aft for another month, until September 25, according to a NOTAM (notice to airmen) issued on August 22.
New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating April’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
On April 24, Pakistan’s top brass had announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country.
PAA spokesperson Saifullah Khan confirmed to Dawn.com that the airspace closure for Indian aircraft had been extended till October 24.
A copy of the NOTAM, available with Dawn.com, also confirmed the closure.
“Pakistan’s airspace will remain closed to Indian registered aircraft. This ban applies to all aircraft owned, operated or leased by Indian airlines or operators. This includes military flights,” the statement by the PAA spokesperson said.
“The ban will come into effect from 1:00 PM (PKT) on 19 September 2025 and will end at 4:59 AM (PKT) on October 24 2025 (end time is approximate). The ban will be effective from ground level to unlimited altitude,” the PAA said.
The two neighbouring nations closed their airspaces multiple times during the hostilities last month. Pakis­tan reopened its airspace for all types of flig­hts on May 10 after the ceasefire was announced.</p><small>2025-09-19 16:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/19171845f69e8bc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943199/fo-clarifies-that-pak-saudi-defence-agreement-not-directed-against-any-third-country' target='_blank'><strong>FO clarifies that Pak-Saudi defence agreement ‘not directed against any third country’</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) said on Friday that the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement signed between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia earlier this week would not be used to threaten any other country.
Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday. On Thursday, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif stated in an interview that the pact was defensive in nature.
During a weekly press briefing today, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan called the agreement “an important milestone for promoting peace and security in the region and the world” and noted that since the 1960s, a key pillar of the ties between Islamabad and Riyadh has been defence cooperation.
“The Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement formalises this decades-old and robust defence partnership,” the spokesperson said. “It is defensive in nature and not directed against any third country. It will contribute to regional peace, security and stability.”
 


Khan added that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received a telephone call from the Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty on Thursday night, congratulating him on the landmark agreement.
“The strategic defence agreement is a milestone in promoting partnership and trust,” the spokesperson said, quoting the Egyptian FM. “Both foreign ministers discussed regional and global issues and emphasised the importance of peace, stability and economic development.”
According to the spokesperson, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia enjoy a “long and distinguished history of brotherhood and cooperation”.
“[The] Pakistan-Saudi Arabia bilateral relationship is unique, enduring and multifaceted,” Khan outlined. “The leadership of the two countries share the common vision to take it to new heights.
“The relationship lives in the hearts of the people of [the] two countries. [The] people of Pakistan have special sentiments for Saudi Arabia, the land of Mecca and Madinah, and they hold the Royal family in high esteem for being the custodian of the holy sites.</p><small>2025-09-19 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624570-pakistan-extends-airspace-ban-on-indian-airlines-till-oct-23' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan extends airspace ban on Indian airlines till Oct 23</strong></a><br><p>

These are the words of five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges who have moved the Supreme Court (SC) against the IHC itself, and its top judge.
Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Tariq Mah­mood Jahangiri, Saman Rafat and Ejaz Ishaq Khan have filed similar petitions in the country’s apex court. Their applications also outline the events that led to them making the move.
Here’s how these events unfolded, as detailed in their pleas.

It began in Justice Aamer Farooq’s tenure
During the tenure of the previous IHC chief justice, now Supreme Court Justice Aamer Farooq, the petitioners had raised the “issue of executive interference in judicial work and attempts to pressurise the judges to influence judicial outcomes in certain cases”.
“These serious concerns” were first brought to the knowledge of the then-chief justice of the IHC, informally, in a meeting of all the judges of the high court. The same concerns were brought to the attention of the then-chief justice of Pakistan, Umar Ata Bandial, during a meeting at his residence in May 2023, and the petitioners continued to raise the issue, along with other administrative matters, in several meetings with the then-IHC CJ.
According to the petitioners, these issues had a “serious impact on the administration of justice and independence of the judiciary”.
“However, no response that would adequately address the serious concerns was forthcoming.”
Subsequently, six IHC judges “felt constrained to formally notify the then chief justice, through a letter dated May 10, 2023, regarding the “attempts to assert pressure to influence judicial outcomes”. These judges also included the ones who petitioned the SC on Friday.
The six judges had recommended to the then-IHC CJ to initiate appropriate proceedings under Article 204 of the Constitution — which deals with contempt of court — to address the matter.
“No proceedings were, however, initiated.”
In this connection, the six IHC judges also met the senior-most judges of the SC — then-CJP Bandial, then-senior puisne judge of the apex court, Qazi Faez Isa, and Justice Ijazul Ahsan — the same month “in another attempt to seek appropriate response from within the institution”.
“However, the attempts to pressurise and intimidate the judges continued and were reported to the relevant offices within the institution.”
Then, in March last year, an SC ruling set aside the dismissal of former IHC senior puisne judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui. He had been dismissed as a judge of the high court in October 2018 by the Supreme Judicial Council  (SJC) — which decides on cases of misconduct of the judges of the superior judiciary — over a fiery speech he had delivered that year at the Rawalpindi Bar Association targeting a security institution.
In his speech, Justice Siddiqui had accused Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of influencing court proceedings and ‘forming benches of its choice’.
In view of the SC’s 2024 ruling and “continued interference by the executive branch in the affairs of the Islamabad High Court,” the six judges had also approached the SJC members and SC judges to “seek guidance on the duty of a judge to report and respond to executive interference through their letter dated March 25, 2024”.
In April, the SC took suo motu notice of the matter, and in the first hearing, the SC directed all stakeholders, including the high courts, to furnish their proposals “as to what should be the institutional response and mechanism to address the issues like the ones raised in the letter.”
But, instead of convening a full court meeting to deliberate and discuss the proposals, then-IHC CJ Farooq “deemed it appropriate to only circulate the order and seek proposals,” the judges regret.
Subsequently, Justices Arbab Tahir, Babar Sattar and Saman Rafat were “constrained” to write letters to the then-CJ, urging him to convene a full court
meeting for consultation between members of a collegiate body, as opposed to merely circulating the order, and seeking proposals.
“A full court meeting of the IHC was thereafter convened on April 23, 2024, wherein it was unanimously decided that a formal reporting mechanism and appropriate remedial action shall be taken in cases of any executive interference.”
The proposals were also submitted to the SC, but the matter remains “pending and no substantial proceedings have been conducted since last year”.
‘Takeover of the IHC’
In the days following this development, “the takeover of Islamabad High Court” by way of transfer of judges from the provincial high courts to IHC was initiated, and already serving judges of the IHC were “deprived” of their “due seniority”. The transferred judges included incumbent IHC CJ Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar.
This move impacted the IHC’s seniority list, leading to Dogar’s appointment to the top post.
Keeping in mind their code of conduct and comity of judges, the petitioner judges once again reached out to the then-IHC CJ to express reservations
and concerns regarding any transfer with the clear intent to “penalise the already serving judges” of the IHC.
Some of the petitioner judges also spoke to the then-chief Justice of Pakistan, and voiced their concerns regarding such transfers and the “deleterious effect” they may have on the IHC and its independence. These transfers were carried out with “indecent haste”, which “forced” the petitioner judges to formally write to all relevant chief justices and ask them to hold “meaningful consultation” in line with Article 200 of the Constitution. This provision of the Constitution deals with the transfer of high court judges.
The chief justices were also asked to advise the president against any such transfer that would “erode the independence” of the IHC.
“Nevertheless, three judges from different provincial high courts …
were transferred to the IHC right before the elevation of the then-chief justice of the IHC.
“Immediately after the transfer process was purportedly completed, the then-chief justice of the IHC issued a revised roster and seniority list on February 3, 2025,” the petition notes.
Then, during a meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan on February 10, convened to consider elevations of judges of high courts to the SC, then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq was nominated as a judge of the country’s apex court.
Two days later, President Asif Zardari notified his appointment and CJ Dogar was appointed as the acting IHC CJ, “after having spent not even two weeks” at the Islamabad High Court.
“Left with no other remedy, the petitioner judges were constrained to challenge the transfer of three judges and the revised seniority before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.”
The SC issued a short order on their plea on June 19, remanding the issue of seniority to the president. This order, however, was challenged through an intra-court appeal in the apex court. But “detailed reasons” for the SC ruling on June 19 are still awaited, and the subsequent appeals are yet to be fixed.
These events also led to the “ouster of senior-most judges of the Islamabad High Court from the administration of the Court and unlawful adoption of the Islamabad High Court Practice and Procedure Rules, 2025,” the judges say.
“The intent behind the transfer became apparent immediately when, in complete violation of the applicable rules and the practice of the court,” a crucial administration committee of the IHC was reconstituted to comprise Justice Aamer Farooq, Dogar and Khadim Hussain Soomro. Notably, among them, Justices Dogar and Soomro were newly transferred to the IHC then.
“Justice Dogar, at number 15 in the Lahore High Court, was a long way off from serving on the administration committee under the Rules and Orders of the Lahore High Court. Similarly, Justice Soomro, appointed as an additional judge as recently as April 14, 2023, was at seniority number 26, in the Sindh High Court, Karachi, but was made a member of the administration committee in the IHC.
“In short, immediately after their transfers, Justices Dogar and Soomro were handed control of the administration of the IHC.”
Earlier in February, Justice Babar Sattar had also written to the IHC registrar. Citing news reports, he had noted that the rules determining the composition of administration committee had been amended. The same month, Justice Saman Rafat also sought information about the reported amendments.
It was emphasised that the power to amend or promulgate rules applicable to the high court vests with the high court, as defined in Article 202 of the Constitution.
“Any amendment to the rules without the approval of the full court is unconstitutional and illegal.”
Days later, the IHC registrar “asserted” that the IHC Practice and Procedure rules had been approved by the administration committee and were at the publication stage.
This led to more letters by Justice Rafat, to the IHC registrar and all IHC judges. In her letters, she emphasised that under the Constitution, only a full court was empowered to adopt new rules or changes to the applicable rules.
“Since no full court meeting has been convened for this purpose, any purported amendment adoption is illegal.”
Upon receiving no response, she sought an update on the matter on April 24, but in “complete disregard of the law, the Constitution and settled practice”, the IHC registrar circulated a letter stating that IHC Practice and Procedure
Rules, 2025 had been published and through a gazette notification dated February 18, and that the file had been placed before the CJ for approval.
“The Practice and Procedure Rules were purportedly adopted, approved and published without any approval of the full court and even after publication in the gazette, the judges of the Islamabad High Court had to wait for chief justice’s approval to receive a copy.
“For months, the petitioner judges’ efforts to seek information regarding the rules being adopted or amended was met with deafening silence,” the petitions read.
The Practice and Procedure Rules and the Islamabad High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2025 were placed before a full court months after their adoption, “when the chief justice of the Islamabad High Court felt assured that he had the majority for, after-the-fact, endorsement in [the] full court. Both sets of rules were then endorsed by a majority of six to five votes without any deliberation”.
At the time the copy of the Practice and Procedure Rules was circulated, it became apparent that the rules were purportedly notified on February 7 after approval by and under the instruction of the “illegally constituted” administration committee, comprising the then-chief Justice, who was scheduled to be considered for elevation to the SC within 72 hours, and two transferred judges who had assumed charge of the IHC merely 72 hours before approving the rules.
“The petitioner judges, nevertheless, welcomed the long overdue convening of the full court meeting by the chief justice and hoped that it may be an opportunity to raise and discuss the striking issues relating to dispensation of justice by the Islamabad High Court.
“These attempts were stymied during the meeting.”
“The conduct of the chief justice and his approach to institutional consultation left the petitioner judges horrified, who also declared that even the minutes of the full court meeting would not be shared with the judges. Consequently, some of the petitioner judges were constrained to write dissenting notes to document their opinion regarding the approval of the Practice and Procedure
Rules in particular, and the manner in which the meeting was conducted in general.”
CJ Dogar’s ‘misuse of administrative powers’
It was in these circumstances that Justice Dogar assumed the role of the IHC CJ. In this position, he would later use his administrative powers to “render the petitioner judges dysfunctional, undermine the independence of judiciary and credibility of the Islamabad High Court,” the judges say.
Justice Dogar, since assuming charge as the IHC CJ, “has consistently used administrative powers in violation of settled principles of comity of judges and judicial independence to render the petitioner judges, who challenged his
transter and seniority, dysfunctional”.
“The chief justice, in complete disregard of the settled law by the Supreme Court, has repeatedly used administrative powers to restrict some of the petitioner judges from exercising their judicial functions and powers, and to interfere with the discharge of their judicial functions.”
“Under Chief Justice Dogar’s watch, the office has refused to issue cause lists in breach of judicial orders and has transferred part-heard matters from the docket of one court to another without such powers vesting in the chief justice.
“Chief Justice Dogar has used his administrative power to reconstitute benches and transfer cases being adjudicated from the bench seized of them to another.”
“Chief Justice Dogar continues to use his power to issue the roster of sitting judges to render senior judges dysfunctional. Chief Justice Dogar has constituted divisional benches headed by junior judges and has relieved senior judges of such responsibility, including the senior puisne judge, who is no longer part of any divisional bench.”
“Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz can no longer preside over single benches, and the cases pending in their dockets, including part-heard cases, have been arrogated to other judges. The purported excuse used to achieve this purpose is a policy decision taken in a meeting of the National Judicial Policy Making Committee to create a Commercial Litigation Corridor within high courts.”
“Chief Justice Dogar has used administrative powers in a manner that lacks transparency in fixation of cases and bench constitution. There are no objective criteria guiding the composition of benches. IHC cause lists manifest arbitrary marking of cases. As against the high court rules that vest the function of marking cases in the office of the deputy registrar, all cases are fixed under the instructions of the chief justice.”
The petitioner judges say they have repeatedly raised the issue of bench formation and fixation of cases “for years now”. However, despite repeated efforts, the issue has remained unaddressed and the CJ continues to exercise powers regarding bench formation and fixation of cases “unilaterally without any specified objective framework and criteria”.
“While exercising administrative authority in an opaque manner that impacts which judges hear what cases, Chief Justice Dogar refuses to engage in a conversation regarding the need for an objective framework to evaluate the performance of judges. [The] Islamabad High Court instead engages in issuing skewed statistics regarding the discharge of judicial work.
“These statistics are designed to cultivate an impression that some judges work efficiently, while others do not work at all. These statistics are issued
without any regard to the nature (and number) of cases marked to the performing judges versus others, and the nature, quality and length of orders that make up the disposal figures.”
“Chief Justice Dogar, has opted to assume powers to transform the chief justice’s office into a monocracy. He has appropriated the power backed by no law to issue a circular requiring judges to seek an NOC (no-obejction certificate) from the chief justice to travel out of the country. Neither the Constitution nor the law vests such rule-making power in the office of the chief justice to lord over his peers,” the petitions state.
“While the right to seek earned leave remains an entitlement under the presidential order regulating the terms and conditions of service of judges, to hold that the leave cannot be sought except during summer or winter holidays is tantamount to suspending a statutory entitlement. And to require judges to seek an NOC for travel abroad even during holidays or while a judge is on leave is plain absurd apart from being unconstitutional.”
“A circular has also been issued barring individual court’s from uploading final judgements on the website of the IHC as a “means of controlling public access to judgements”.
“Chief Justice Dogar has transformed the office of chief justice into an autocracy, in an effort to reduce the judiciary to a regiment. Such actions undermine judicial independence,” which is essential for the discharge of adjudicatory duties.
Regarding the subordinate judiciary, the petitioner judges have raised the issue of failure to exercise effective supervision and control over lower courts.
“The Islamabad district judiciary, staffed largely by deputationists, resembles
the game of musical chairs, with judges on deputation enjoying no security of tenure. Chief Justice Dogar has taken affirmative steps to ensure that the Islamabad district judiciary remains a rag-tag ensemble, the members of which can be shunted back to their parent departments if they fall out of line.”
Then, the exercise of administrative powers by Chief Justice Dogar is also marred by conflict of interest, the judges believe.
As the competent authority under the Protection against Harassment at Workplace Act, 2010, Justice Saman Rafat recently constituted an inquiry committee after receiving complaint by a female lawyer against Justice Dogar.
“Acting in his own cause, the very same day, Chief Justice Dogar recalled the notification appointing Justice Rafat as the competent authority to administer the Protection against Harassment at Workplace Act, 2010, and appointed an additional judge replacing her as the competent authority.”
Moreover, CJ Dogar has “initiated an unfortunate practice of using judicial powers that undermine the independence of the judiciary. In several cases, judicial powers have been exercised not only to transfer pending cases from one judge to another, but also an unprecedented practice of issuing writ of certiorari (i.e. suspending proceedings before the judges of the same court) has also started.”
This is happening when it is settled law that judges cannot issue writs in pending matters to the same court, the judges say.
But, “in Chief Justice Dogar’s time, we are witnessing this practice as a tool, to restrain the petitioner judges from proceeding to hear matters that are fixed for hearing before the court.”
For instance, recently, a division bench comprising CJ Dogar and Justice Azam Khan restrained Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work.
In this case, the exercise of judicial powers in “breach of principles of fair trial and due process” is a “potent example of self-cannibalisation by an institution!”
It is the “latest manifestation of the retribution that some of the petitioner judges have been threatened with, for exercise of judicial authority in a manner in select cases that powerful members of the executive found disagreeable.”</p><small>2025-09-19 15:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/192003005ba8b1a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943228/fact-check-viral-video-does-not-show-houthi-official-threatening-pakistan-after-saudi-defence-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video does not show Houthi official threatening Pakistan after Saudi defence deal</strong></a><br><p>Post from multiple Indian users on social media platform X on Friday shared a video clip of a Houthi official, claiming that it showed him threatening Pakistan for allegedly sending troops to the Saudi–Yemen border amid the signing of a mutual defence deal with the kingdom. However, the video is old and does not show the Houthi official talking about Pakistan.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh on Sept 16, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
A statement from the PM’s office announcing the signing of the pact read: “This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression.”
A known Indian propaganda account shared the picture of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman on X today, along with a video clip of a Houthi official.
The caption of the post said: “Breaking: Tensions escalate after Pakistan sends 25,000 troops to the Saudi–Yemen border under a new defence pact. Houthi fighters issued a stark threat, saying they will ‘turn the Yemen–Saudi border into a graveyard for Pakistani soldiers’, raising fears of wider confrontation.”
The video attached to the post did not have any subtitles or a translation of what the person was saying. It also did not mention the identity of the person in the video clip.
The post gained over 359,000 views.
The video with the same claim was shared by multiple other users on X as can be seen here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the defence agreement signed between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
A keyword search to corroborate the alleged developments yielded no news reports from credible mainstream international, Saudi, Yemeni or domestic media outlets about either Pakistan sending 25,000 troops to the Saudi-Yemen border or the Houthis threatening Pakistan for any such move.
To corroborate what was actually being said in the video, its content was translated into English through AI transcription tool Turboscribe, which showed that the Houthi official did not say anything about threatening Pakistan.
Translating the video through ChatGPT and Google Translate also yielded the following transcription:
“For us, Gaza is a red line — a red line. Our causes, our sanctities, and our Islam are a red line, and we do not compromise on them. In his last speech, Sayyid [the leader] said: There are no red lines in front of the Yemeni people. No red lines. If you have red lines, we have none in front of us. We will target things the enemy has never thought of, never imagined, and not even the Yemeni people or the peoples of the [Muslim] nation have imagined. And we will reach, by God’s permission and with His power, the fifth and sixth stages. If the enemy’s aggression continues against Gaza, there will be positions and actions that not even the Yemeni spirit could have imagined.”
A reverse image search yielded a video report by Lebanon-based news outlet Al Mayadeen News on its YouTube channel on May 14, 2024.
Comparing the viral clip with the original video showed that they were the same, as can be seen by the writing in the background, the speaker’s hand gestures and his facial features.
 


The translation of the news clip is provided below:
Anchor: “From the Yemeni support front, Yemeni Armed Forces spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree confirmed that Gaza is a red line and that operations are open with no red lines. He also stressed that if the aggression against Gaza continues, the armed forces will strike targets that the enemies cannot imagine.”
Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree: “If Gaza is a red line, then our causes, our sanctities, and our Islam are red lines, and we will not compromise on them. I heard Mr Al-Shammari say in the last test that there are no red lines for the Yemeni people, no red lines. If you have red lines for us, they are not red lines. We will target things that the enemy has not thought of, that the enemy cannot imagine, that even the Yemeni people and the peoples of the nation cannot imagine. And we will reach the fifth and sixth stages, God willing and with God’s power, if the enemy continues its aggression against Gaza. This means that there will be situations that even the Yemeni people cannot imagine, and that even the Americans cannot imagine.”
The Al Mayadeen News report mentions the person speaking as Yemeni Armed Forces’ spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree. The translated transcription shows that he did not mention Pakistan in his statements.
A keyword search for further information on the video yielded a news article published by Iranian news outlet Press TV on May 14, 2024, titled “Yemen warns it may strike targets enemy ‘can’t even imagine’”.
According to the report, Saree warned that Yemen’s armed forces might escalate their pro-Palestinian strikes if Israel kept up its “ongoing genocidal war” against the Gaza Strip.
The articles quoted Saree as saying: “Gaza is a red line for us, a red line. Our causes, holy sites and our Islam are red lines, and we will not compromise on them. We target things that the enemy hasn’t thought of and can’t imagine, things that neither the Yemeni people nor the people of the [Arab and Islamic] nation can imagine.”
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video clip shows a Houthi official threatening Pakistan after the signing of a mutual defence deal with Saudi Arabia is false. The video is old from May 2024 and shows Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree talking about Israel and the Gaza conflict.

The petitions, available with Dawn.com, named the IHC, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and the Federation of Pakistan as respondents and were filed under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
Article 184(3) sets out the SC’s original jurisdiction and enables it to assume jurisdiction in matters involving a question of “public importance” with reference to the “enforcement of any of the fundamental rights” of Pakistan’s citizens.
In their petitions, the judges moved the SC to declare that administrative powers could not be “deployed to undermine or trump the judicial powers” of the high court judges.
They further asked the apex court to declare that a chief justice of the high court was “not authorised to constitute benches or transfer cases” once a high court bench had been assigned a case.
Moreover, the petitions sought the declaration that the chief justice of a high court “cannot exclude available judges from the roster, at will, and use the power to issue a roster to oust judges from performing judicial functions”.
The SC was also urged to declare “that the constitution of benches, transfer of cases and issuance of roster can only be done in accordance with the rules adopted by the entirety of the High Court under Article 202 (rules of procedure), read with Article 192(1) (constitution of high court) of the Constitution”.
The petitioners also asked the apex court to declare that the “decision-making” with respect to the constitution of benches, issuance of roster and transfer of cases could not “solely rest in the hands of the chief justice”.
“Declare that the ‘Doctrine of the Master of the Roster’ has definitely been set aside in Supreme Court decisions,” the petitions read.
The petitions further sought the declaration that formation of IHC’s administration committees through notifications dated February 3  and July 15 and all the actions taken by them “suffer from mala fide in law and are illegal”. They asked the court to set aside these notifications and all actions taken by the administration committees constituted under them for “being illegal and coram non judice”.
Moreover, they stated: “Declare that the adoption and approval of Islamabad High Court Practice and Procedure Rules, 2025, by the illegally constituted administration committee, and its notification without prior approval of the high court is in breach of Article 192(1) and Article 202 of the Constitution, and its subsequent endorsement in September, are illegal and of no legal effect.”
The judges further stated in their prayers that the SC “direct the IHC to provide effective supervision and oversight” over the functioning of the district judiciary, as mandated by the Constitution under Article 203, which states that each high court shall supervise and control all courts subordinate to it.
The petitioner asked the SC to “declare that a high court cannot issue a writ under Article 199 of the Constitution to itself.” Article 199 pertains to the jurisdiction of a high court.
They continued: “A Division Bench of high court is neither vested with jurisdiction to sit in appeal over interlocutory orders of a single bench nor can assume control over the proceedings of a single bench as if it is an inferior court or tribunal.”
An interlocutory order refers to a temporary judgment passed in an ongoing case.
The petitioners requested the SC to declare that a high court judge can only be “restrained from working from performing judicial duties under Article 209 and a writ of quo warranto seeking the removal of a judge from office is not maintainable.”
Article 209 of the Constitution empowers the Supreme Judicial Council to carry out inquiries into the capacity and conduct of Supreme Court and high court judges.
The petitioners concluded their statement by asking the SC to “grant any other relief deemed appropriate in the circumstances of this case.”
Rift within IHC
Today’s development has once again highlighted deep fissures within the IHC, which gained prominence when Justice Dogar was appointed as the high court’s chief justice.
The fissures in the high court can be traced back to March last year, when in a startling letter written to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) members, the five IHC judges, along with Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir had accused the country’s intelligence apparatus of interference in judicial affairs, including attempts to pressure judges through abduction and torture of their relatives and secret surveillance inside their homes.
Widespread calls subsequently emerged from various quarters for a probe into the investigation, amid which former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa summoned a full court meeting of the Supreme Court’s judges. After a meeting between CJP Isa and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on March 28, the duo decided to form a commission to investigate the concerns of interference in judicial affairs following the cabinet’s approval. However, former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, who was appointed to head the commission, subsequently recused himself from the matter, leading to the apex court taking a suo motu notice of the issue.
In November 2024, the Supreme Judicial Council, chaired by incumbent CJP Yahya Afridi, who also heads the council, had considered different options concerning the letter and agreed to expand consultations, noting that the code of conduct of judges applies to heads of different institutions as well as judges.
Meanwhile, the 26th Constitutional Amendment was passed in October 2024, bringing many changes, most of which pertain to the judiciary.
Rumours began circulating in December 2024 that the judicial bureaucracy was reportedly planning to bring a judge from the Lahore High Court (LHC) to lead the IHC after the elevation of the then-IHC chief justice.
Traditionally, the senior puisne judge of a high court was appointed as the chief justice, but the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) had introduced new rules to bypass the seniority criterion in light of the 26th Amendment. The JCP had proposed that the chief justice of a high court could be appointed from among the panel of five senior-most judges.
In February 2025, the five IHC judges had formally opposed the then-potential transfer of then-LHC Justice Dogar, warning that his elevation as the IHC chief justice would violate constitutional procedures and judicial norms.
The letter was addressed to CJP Afridi, then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq, LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Sindh High Court Chief Justice Mohammad Shafi Siddiqui and raised serious concerns over the possible transfer.
However, Justice Dogar, who was sworn in as a LHC judge in June 2015, was formally transferred to the IHC on February 1. His transfer, along with those of two other judges, to the IHC had also impacted its seniority list and led to many changes as  Justice Kayani, who was senior puisne jud­ge before Justice Dogar’s transfer, has been removed from the top decision-making committee. Justice Kayani was also stripped of the position of inspection judge of the special courts.
The IHC administration had formally notified Jus­t­ice Dogar as the senior puisne IHC judge of the Islam­abad High Court and also revi­sed its seniority list.
The seniority list is as follows: Justice Dogar, Justice Kayani, Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, Justice Jahangiri, Jus­tice Sattar, Justice Ishaq Khan, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, Justice Saman Imtiaz, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro, Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, Justice Mohammad Asif and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas.
The five IHC judges had then sent a representation to the IHC chief justice and CJP Afridi against placing them down on the seniority list but this was rejected.
Justice Dogar was appointed as the acting IHC chief justice on Feb 13. The next day, he took the oath in a ceremony. All IHC judges were invited, but five of them — the same ones who filed petitions in the SC today — did not attend the ceremony and boycotted it.
Following the development, the IHC went through a major administrative restructuring, which notably reduced the authority of senior puisne judge Justice Kayani — who previously held key decision-making roles — following amendments to the high court rules.
The IHC Administration Com­mittee, previously comprising the chief justice, the senior puisne judge and a senior judge, was restructured to include CJ Dogar and two of his nominees. This reconstitution significantly altered the court’s decision-making authority.
On Feb 20, the five judges had petitioned the SC to restrain Justice Dogar from carrying out his duties as the acting IHC chief justice.
In March, Justice Sattar and Justice Imtiaz had expressed concerns over the demanding of gratuity by the court staff and changes to the rules that stripped the senior puisne judge of his powers.
A subsequent consolidation of all petitions related to ex-PM Imran Khan’s jail conditions apparently widened the gulf among the IHC judges as Justice Ishaq had raised critical questions about the transfer of a case pending before his court.
The tensions simmering among the IHC judges seemingly boiled over on March 21, when three members of the IHC Tribunal — who were replaced earlier this month when the tribunal was reconstituted — declared that neither the acting chief justice nor the president had the authority to dissolve or reconstitute the tribunal without legal justification.
Around the end of March, Justice Sattar had questioned the chief justice’s authority to administratively reassign cases, emphasising that such decisions fell within the jurisdiction of judges and the deputy registrar.
A fresh controversy emerged within the IHC in April over the acting chief justice’s authority to unilaterally transfer cases from single benches to division benches. The move reportedly spar­ked concerns about judicial procedure and administrative transparency.
A division bench comprising Justice Kayani and Justice Ishaq, while upholding an order previously issued by Justice Sattar, had expressed surprise at the recent transfer of several cases without clear legal justification.
The two judges subsequently ruled that the acting chief justice had exceeded his authority by transferring cases from one bench to another, calling for the ambiguity in judicial rules to be addressed through a full court meeting.
Meanwhile, amid the growing concerns among senior IHC judges over the shifting of cases between benches, Justice Minhas had issued a judicial verdict reinforcing the authority of the chief justice to assign and reassign cases, backing the top judge’s ex­­clusive role as the “Master of the Ros­ter”.
Ten­sions within the IHC escalated sharply on April 28, as two separate but interlinked proceedings exposed a deepening ‘institutional rift’ over judicial authority, procedural conduct and internal accountability.
Justice Sattar had issued a strongly worded order criticising the registrar’s office for not listing a case related to the removal of the former director general of Malir Development Authority from the no-fly list. The judge had issued the contempt notices to the heads of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Immi­gration and Passport.
However, a division bench comprising Justice Dogar had already suspended the contempt notices after the penalised government officials filed an intra-court appeal. The bench also merged the case with another identical matter. Subsequently, the case was not fixed before Justice Sattar on April 28 as was scheduled.
Justice Sattar had lambasted the deputy registrar (judicial) for what he described as “prima facie defiance” of court orders. He had summoned court officials to explain why the case was not listed before him and also the removal of his prior orders from the high court’s public database.
The case listing controversy escalated in May as two judges accused Justice Sattar of conducting unauthorised proceedings in a stay matter. However, in a dramatic courtroom episode, Justice Sattar had openly challenged the authority of a division bench, rejecting its order suspending his previous directive to remove a citizen’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL).
During the proceedings, the assistant attorney general had presented a copy of the division bench’s interim order, stating that Justice Sattar’s directive had been suspended. However, Justice Sattar had responded that he would continue hearing the case and issue a comprehensive judgement, arguing that the division bench could not lawfully suspend a single bench’s order in such a manner.
The simmering tensions among the high court judges had touched new heights around the end of May after a three-member tribunal declared another three-member tribunal comprising Justices Sattar, Ishaq and Jahangiri as “defunct” and scrapped the order regarding the repatriation of the judges.
On June 19, the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench (CB), by a majority of 3-2, had ruled that the transfer of three judges from provincial high courts to the IHC was in line with the Constitution. However, the bench had left it up to the president of Pakistan to determine the seniority amongst judges, based on their service records. The decision was later appealed by the five IHC judges.
However, Justice Dogar later took his oath as the IHC CJ on July 8. The five IHC senior judges were sidelined in the subsequent reshuffling of key committees.
On July 16, Justice Ishaq had given the federal government 30 days to constitute a commission to investigate misuse of the blasphemy law. However, a division bench comprising Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan later suspended the order’s imp­le­mentation.
Another controversy subsequently emerged in the Aafia Siddiqui case. On July 21, Justice Ishaq had put on notice the prime minister and the entire federal government. However, there was a question mark on the proceedings, since Justice Ishaq was not scheduled to hear the case or any other case that week.
The roster, approved by CJ Dogar, had not listed any case before the judge in question, since he was on a five-week leave from July 20. As a result, the IHC registrar’s office didn’t issue a cause list — schedule of cases — for Justice Ishaq’s court.
A senior official from the IHC chief justice’s office had told Dawn the cause list of Justice Ishaq’s court was cancelled and there was no case before him. Sources had said that Justice Ishaq’s staff had asked the registrar to issue a revised cause list, since the judge intended to hear some cases on July 21, despite being on leave. How­ever, the request was declined.
Subsequently, insiders claim­­ed, the judge’s staff had “issued a cause list bypassing the chief justice”. In his order, Justice Ishaq had accused the chief justice’s office of “deliberately sabotaging his judicial authority” by refusing to amend the weekly roster.
The registrar’s office subsequently put on hold the processing of the contempt of court notices. Later in August, the court reassig­ned the case from Justice Ishaq to Justice Minhas as part of a new “Roster of Sitting” that took effect from September 1, according to a court cause list.
Instead, earlier in August, Justice Ishaq was placed on a special division bench with Justice Sattar to hear tax references and related commercial matters, a posting that prevents members from sitting as single-judge courts.
Sources had said the two judges would not hold single benches until a backlog of around 2,000 Commercial Litigation Corridor cases was cleared. In the meantime, petitions on their individual dockets would be taken up by other available benches. The decision was taken by CJ Dogar.
Legal experts had said that with the development, the IHC’s senior judges, including those who had challenged the transfer and subsequent seniority of the incumbent chief justice, would now be occupied with clearing the years-long backlog of financial cases.
Earlier this month, a full court IHC meeting had adopted the High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2025 despite strong resistance from senior judges. The rules were passed by a slim majority, while a proposal from two judges, seeking changes to the meeting’s agenda, was rejected.
 
 

A day before the full court meeting, Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Ishaq wrote a letter to their colleagues, expressing grave concerns that administrative powers were allegedly being misused to “sideline dissenting judges”. Later, they also objected to the way the rules were presented at the meeting, complaining that “insufficient time” had been provided for a proper review.
Justice Sattar and Justice Ishaq reportedly objected to the way case assignments were being structured, alleging that the process was “manipulated to favour” judges transferred to the IHC along with the chief justice, while sidelining permanent judges who had opposed his transfer.
Last week, the IHC fixed for hearing a petition challenging the appointment of Justice Jahangiri over allegations of possessing an invalid law degree. In an extraordinary development on Tuesday, CJ Dogar and Justice Azam restrained the senior judge from exercising his judicial powers.
The decision sparked immediate outrage among the bar associations. His degree issue surfaced last year, while he was hearing the election petitions of runners-up of all three constituencies of Islamabad.
The lawmakers of the ruling party were visibly not comfortable with the proceedings of the election tribunal and the government, in the meantime, issued an ordinance that enabled the appointment of a retired judge to head the election tribunal.
Matters came to a head when the IHC administration stripped Justice Imtiaz of her powers to entertain harassment complaints after she took cognisance of a complaint lodged by lawyer Imaan Mazari against CJ Dogar.
A circular from her office had said that, being the competent authority under the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010, the inquiry committee comprising Justice Ishaq, Justice Tahir and Justice Imtiaz was formed to conduct an inquiry into the complaints of harassment.
However, the court administration had sw­iftly de-notified her as the competent au­­thority and replaced her with Justice Minhas.</p><small>2025-09-19 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/191954034ebcd31.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943229/pakistan-and-india-meet-again-at-asia-cup-after-handshake-row' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and India meet again at Asia Cup after handshake row</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and India will clash again in the Asia Cup on Sunday, renewing one of cricket’s fiercest rivalries a week after their last match was overshadowed by a handshake row.
India won the September 14 group match by seven wickets in Dubai and afterwards refused to shake hands with their opponents in a controversial move. It was the first meeting between the neighbours since a four-day cross-border conflict in May left more than 70 people dead.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged a protest with the International Cricket Council (ICC), alleging that match referee Andy Pycroft had told skipper Salman Ali Agha not to approach Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav for a handshake at the toss.
 
 

The PCB demanded that Pycroft be removed from their matches and threatened to withdraw from the eight-team Twenty20 competition.
Their last group game was held up for an hour before the PCB said Pycroft had apologised and the match, with the Zimbabwean in charge, eventually went ahead.
Pakistan beat hosts, the United Arab Emirates, to qualify for the next stage, the Super Fours, and set up another meeting with India in Dubai.
Indian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for Sunday’s clash.
India spinner Kuldeep Yadav sought to defuse the controversy.
“When you step onto the field, it’s just a batter in front of you. I have always approached it this way against Pakistan,” he said ahead of India’s last group game, against Oman today.
Salman also stuck to sports.
“If we play good cricket like we have played in the last few months, I think we’ll be good against any side,” the Pakistan captain told reporters.
Simmering tensions
Because of fraught political ties, nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan only meet at neutral venues during multi-team tournaments.
Tensions soared ahead of the Asia Cup after the two countries engaged in their worst conflict since 1999. The hostilities in May left more than 70 people dead in missile, drone and artillery exchanges, before a ceasefire.
The conflict was triggered by an April attack on civilians in Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir that New Delhi accused Pakistan of backing, a charge Islamabad denies.
India resisted calls to boycott the first Pakistan match.
A potential third India-Pakistan showdown looms if both sides qualify for the final on September 28 in Dubai.
India lifted the Asia Cup in its last, 50-over edition and are the favourites to retain the crown.
India and Pakistan advanced to the next stage from Group A, while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh qualified from Group B.
Sri Lanka face Bangladesh on Saturday in the first Super Fours fixture. The Lankan Lions, unbeaten so far, look dangerous while Bangladesh carry the underdog tag under skipper Litton Das.
Along with regional bragging rights, the Asia Cup serves as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka.</p><small>2025-09-19 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1917551238f78ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943214/taliban-release-detained-elderly-british-couple-from-afghanistan-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Taliban release detained elderly British couple from Afghanistan jail</strong></a><br><p>An elderly British couple detained in Afghanistan for almost eight months were released on Friday, the Taliban authorities said, after pressure built to free the pair due to fears over their health.
Taliban officials have refused to detail why Peter Reynolds, 80, and his wife Barbara, 76, were arrested in February as they were returning to their home.
“We’ve been treated very well. We’re looking forward to seeing our children,” said Barbara, in a red headscarf, standing next to her bearded husband, near a plane on the tarmac of Kabul airport.
“We are looking forward to returning to Afghanistan if we can. We are Afghan citizens,” she added, after Qatar-facilitated negotiations for their release.
The couple were married in Kabul in 1970, and have spent almost two decades living in Afghanistan, running educational programmes for women and children. They also became official Afghan citizens.
When the Taliban returned to power in 2021, the couple remained in Afghanistan against the advice of the British embassy.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi, in a statement posted on social media, said the couple were handed over to the UK’s special representative to the countr,y Richard Lindsay.
“Two British nationals named Peter and Barbara Reynolds, who had violated the laws of Afghanistan, were released from custody today following the judicial process,” Balkhi added.
Images of the couple standing together with Lindsay at Kabul airport before their departure to the Qatari capital Doha were broadcast on Sky News.
“They are very relieved to be going home,” Lindsay told the broadcaster.
The couple were first held in a maximum security facility, “then in underground cells, without daylight, before being transferred” to the intelligence services in Kabul, according to UN experts.
The release of the British couple is a “moment of immense joy”, their family said today.
“We are overwhelmed with gratitude and relief to share that our parents, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after seven months and 21 days in detention by the Taliban,” the family said.
Thanking Qatari officials for facilitating the negotiations, the family said their “dedication and humanity have made an unforgettable impact on our lives”, and also thanked the UK government for ensuring the couple had access to medication.
“This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy, and international cooperation. While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief,” the family said in a statement.
In a latest update, an AFP journalist reported that the couple has arrived in Qatar.
In late July, the independent UN human rights experts called for the Taliban government to free the pair, warning of the “rapid deterioration” of their physical and mental health, stating that they “risk irreparable harm or even death”.
Their family had made repeated pleas about their ailing health after their arrest.
Hamish Falconer, the UK’s minister for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan, said in a statement that he was “relieved… their ordeal has come to an end”.
He added that it was against travel advice for British citizens to visit Afghanistan, warning that the government’s ability to offer consular assistance “is extremely limited”.
Russia is the only country to have officially recognised the Taliban government, which has imposed a strict version of Islamic law and been accused of sweeping human rights violations.
Only a handful of embassies have reopened in the capital after most were evacuated at the end of the NATO-led war against Taliban militants.
Foreign ministry spokesman Balkhi in his statement said that the government “does not view the matters of citizens from a political or transactional angle”, adding that “Afghans, wherever they may be, should also receive consular services”.
 
 

It comes after Washington’s special envoy on hostages, Adam Boehler, made a rare visit on Saturday to Kabul to discuss the possibility of a prisoner exchange.
At least one US citizen, Mahmood Habibi, is held in Afghanistan.
Dozens of foreign nationals have been arrested since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021 following the withdrawal of the US military.
A Qatari official, on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, told AFP that the couple were “safely released from detention in Afghanistan following mediation led by Qatar”.
“The Qataris had been engaged with the Afghan authorities for many months, working in close coordination with the British government,” he added.</p><small>2025-09-19 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1918231990c3b2e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943221/hong-kong-to-evacuate-6000-after-wwii-era-bomb-found' target='_blank'><strong>Hong Kong to evacuate 6,000 after WWII-era bomb found</strong></a><br><p>Hong Kong planned to evacuate thousands of residents on Friday as a bomb left over from World War II was discovered at a construction site.
Police said that the bomb measured approximately 1.5 metres in length and weighed about 450 kilogrammes (1,000 pounds), adding that they believed it remained “fully functional”.
“Due to the extremely high risks involved in dismantling and disposing of the bomb, we must activate the emergency evacuation plan,” said Hong Kong Police District Commander Andy Chan.
About 6,000 people from 18 residential buildings in the Quarry Bay area will be evacuated on Friday night, with demolition work set to begin early on Saturday morning, police added.
Hong Kong was an early target in what would become a full-blown Asian campaign for imperial Japan during the Second World War. The city saw fierce fighting between Japanese and Allied forces during wartime, and hikers and construction workers still occasionally discover unexploded bombs in the territory nearly 100 years later.
In May 2018, a bomb was discovered in Hong Kong’s Wan Chai district, which led authorities to evacuate 1,200 residents.
Police said the unexploded ordnance unearthed on Friday was of the same type as the one found in 2018. At that time, the bomb disposal process took about 20 hours to complete.</p><small>2025-09-19 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624548-dpm-dar-hints-at-more-defence-pacts-after-landmark-saudi-deal' target='_blank'><strong>DPM Dar hints at more defence pacts after landmark Saudi deal</strong></a><br><p>

The DG ISPR expressed these views during an interview, which was aired by Pakistani television channels on Friday. According to television channels, the interview was purportedly given to a German media house.
During the interview, the military spokesperson was asked about Army Chief Asim Munir’s visits to the US and whether they had helped with “warming up” relations between Islamabad and Washington.
In his response, Lt-Gen Chaudhry appreciated the US and President Trump’s role in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in May after a four-day escalation. He said, “Over a period of time, we have been able to enhance and amplify on our convergences (with the US) and deftly managed the divergences.”

“There are areas where a lot can be done, there are areas where a lot of engagement can be done,” he said, adding that “Pakistan views its relationship with the US as very important.”
“We don’t think that these relationships have anything to do — or there is either-or with other countries.” At this point, the interviewer interjected him to mention China, with the DG ISPR continuing — following a cut in the video — that “we, at the same time, have very constructive and strategic relationships with China and other countries.”
 
 

He said that there is a lot of “scope” for collaboration between the US and Pakistan on the matter of counterterrorism.
On that note, he expressed satisfaction over the United States’ recent declaration of the Majeed brigade as a terrorist outfit.
Pakistan has proscribed the Majeed Brigade — the terrorist outfit Balochistan Liberation Army’s suicide squad — as a terrorist entity since July 18, 2024.
On the question of Pakistan’s concerns over weapons systems left behind by the US in the wake of its withdrawal from Afghanistan, DG ISPR cited the retrieval of US-made weapons from terrorists involved in the Mianwali airbase attack on 4 November 2023 as evidence.
He said that “we share all this data with the Americans,” adding that “the amount of weapons left behind by the US is huge.”
Quoting a report prepared by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), Lt-Gen Chaudhry said that, “after withdrawal of the United States and NATO forces, more than $7.2 billion worth of US equipment has been left.”
On the issue of strained relations with India, DG ISPR referred to the May escalation, noting that “On May 10, actually the fire ceased — it’s the cease of fire that happened, [but] the conflict endures.”
“Whether it is the Kashmir issue, whether it is state-sponsored terrorism of India, whether it is the rising extremism of Hindutva mentality, rationality that has gripped India —” Lt-Gen Chaudhry said.
Stating Pakistan’s position on the matter, he said, “Pakistan believes that the issues need [a] resolution,” calling for international actors to intervene.
“Especially players like the USA, they must intervene,” he said.
He went on to say: “We have no doubt in our minds in Pakistan that each and every incident of terrorism that happens in Pakistan — behind that is Indian support and its abetment.”
Noting Pakistan’s efforts in curbing terrorism and the frequency of terrorist attacks in the country, DG ISPR highlighted that, “just by the threat that is coming to Pakistan, any sane mind can understand this can not go on without external support.”
 
 

DG ISPR alleged that, “the base of operation that the Indians use is Afghanistan, the whole of terrorism that is being done is executed by the Indians over there.”
“Indians have a playbook of using terror as a tool of state,” he said, claiming that their “main tools” at the moment are terrorist outfits Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and BLA.
On the question of insurgency in the country, DG ISPR denied that such a thing existed, stating, “There is no insurgency in Pakistan; the correct term is terrorist,” he said.
Asked if the grievances of the people in Balochistan are properly addressed, he claimed that out of Balochistan’s total population, only a fraction actually lived in Balochistan, saying that “before talking about the issue, it is important to see how many Baloch are we talking about.”
 
 

Over the issue of missing persons in Balochistan, he claimed that “half of these missing persons are part of BLA.”
He said that several terrorists killed in Balochistan were included in the list of missing persons as well, claiming that there were more missing persons in Sindh and Punjab than in Balochistan.</p><small>2025-09-19 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/191246416ebb06b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943160/ghq-attack-case-rawalpindi-atc-dismisses-plea-against-imrans-appearance-via-video-link' target='_blank'><strong>GHQ attack case: Rawalpindi ATC dismisses plea against Imran’s appearance via video link</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi dismissed on Friday the PTI’s plea that contested the decision to make incarcerated party founder Imran Khan appear in trial proceedings of the General Headquarters (GHQ) attack case via video link.
Imran’s arrest on May 9, 2023 sparked violent protests across the country, during which state buildings and military installations, including the GHQ, were torched and vandalised.
He was expected to attend today’s hearing at the ATC via video link, but his counsel argued before Judge Amjad Ali Shah against this arrangement on the PTI’s application.
For his part, prosecutor Zaheer Shah contended that trial proceedings were transferred to the ATC from Adiala Jail — where Imran is imprisoned — on the Punjab government’s executive order. “The authority to review the executive order lies with the constitutional court,” he added.
He further argued that in 2016, the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended to allow suspects to appear in courts via video link.
Shah also cited Sections 15 and 21 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, saying that they authorised the courts to make “decisions regarding trials”. He added that the government was “not obliged” to give a reason for transferring the trial.
The prosecutor said submitting an application against Imran’s appearance via video link “is tantamount to creating hurdles in the trial and wasting time”. He said it was the defence lawyer’s right to approach the superior court against the notification for transferring trial proceedings from jail to the ATC, but the trial could not be stopped.
During his arguments, Imran’s lawyer, Faisal Malik, said, “We demand fair trial from the court.” He added that a fair trial was conditional upon the accused being physically present in the court.
He informed the ATC that they had received a copy of the provincial government’s notification yesterday, and they would approach the higher court against it.
The judge then asked Malik whether he wanted to present any more arguments on the matter.
At that, the defence counsel sought some time for consultation with his legal team.
The court then adjourned the hearing for half an hour.
When the hearing resumed, the testimony of two prosecution witnesses — Sub-Inspector Saleem Qureshi and Sub-Inspector Manzoor Shahzad — was recorded.
The witnesses presented 13 USB drives containing video clips to the court.
Forty videos of the PTI founder related to May 9 were downloaded, the witnesses said in their statements.
They also presented video clips of others, namely Khadim Khokhar, Shehryar Afridi, Umar Tanveer, Sadaqat Abbasi and Sikandar Mirza, along with clippings from various national newspapers, all of which were saved on the USB drives.
The witnesses said the “digital evidence” was obtained from CCTV cameras installed on Benazir Bhutto Road, Mall Road, Liaquat Bagh and ajoining areas.
Concluding the hearing, the court dismissed the PTI’s plea seeking Imran’s appearance during the proceedings in person and maintained that he would appear via video link, in line with the Punjab government’s notification.
The court summoned 10 more witnesses from the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, the Federal Investigation Agency, the PTI, the Press Information Department, Internal Security and the interior ministry to record their statements at the next hearing, slated for September 23.
Yesterday, a police spokesperson told Dawn that security will be beefed up around the Rawalpindi ATC on Friday during the hearing of the GHQ attack case.
Imran was indicted in the case on December 5 last year. The PTI founder, who has been incarcerated in Adiala Jail since August 2023, was arrested by the Rawalpindi police in the May 9 protest case in January 2024.</p><small>2025-09-19 08:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/19131409b1d5a2d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943171/iran-says-made-fair-proposal-to-avert-sanctions-snapback' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says made ‘fair’ proposal to avert sanctions snapback</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday that he put forward a “fair and balanced” nuclear proposal to European powers to prevent the return of United Nations sanctions on the Islamic republic.
Iran is “introducing a creative, fair, and balanced proposal which addresses genuine concerns and is mutually beneficial,” Araghchi said on X.
He added that the proposal was made on Thursday to Britain, France and Germany — known collectively as the E3 — as well as the European Union.
“Turning this idea into action can be prompt and resolve the respective bottom lines to avert a crisis,” Araghchi said, arguing that “Iran cannot be the sole responsible actor”.
 






The comments were made as the United Nations Security Council was set to vote on Friday on reimposing biting economic sanctions on Tehran over its contested nuclear programme.
Diplomatic sources expect that Iran does not have the nine votes needed to maintain the status quo and prevent the punitive measures from being reimposed by the end of the month.
The E3, signatories to a landmark 2015 nuclear agreement that lifted international sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, claim Tehran has reneged on its commitments under the deal.
The accord was intended to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, a goal that Western powers and Iran’s arch-enemy Israel have long accused it of harbouring, but which it has consistently denied.
Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the deal has been hanging by a thread ever since the United States withdrew from it in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term and reimposed sanctions on Tehran.
The withdrawal prompted Iran in 2019 to begin rolling back on its own commitments, including limiting access to its facilities by inspectors from the UN’s nuclear watchdog.
In June, Israel launched an unprecedented attack on Iran targeting nuclear and military sites, as well as residential areas, and killing more than 1,000 people, including senior commanders and nuclear scientists. Iran retaliated with missile and drone attacks that killed dozens in Israel.
The US briefly joined Israel’s campaign for a series of strikes on key nuclear facilities before a ceasefire was reached after 12 days of war.
Last week, Iran agreed on a new framework for working with the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) after it suspended cooperation following the Israeli and US strikes.
The IAEA has warned that Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed country that enriches uranium to 60 per cent — far beyond the 3.67pc cap set by the 2015 deal, and a short step from the 90pc required for a weapon.</p><small>2025-09-19 08:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624492-atc-rejects-pti-plea-against-imran-khans-video-link-appearance-in-ghq-attack-case' target='_blank'><strong>ATC throws out PTI plea for Imran Khan's in-person appearance in GHQ attack case</strong></a><br><p>

A Senate standing committee recently summoned YouTuber Rizwan Razi, also known as Razi Dada, and grilled him for making derogatory remarks about the people of Sindh. The panel subsequently directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to block his YouTube channel over what it termed “hate speech” against the people of Sindh.
Committee members also questioned how a presenter who appeared on the state-run PTV News could make such remarks on his personal YouTube channel.
In one of his recent vlogs, Razi considered close to the CM made unsavoury, racist remarks.

CM Maryam backs Razi’s apology after PPP terms his remarks a slight to Sindh

However, the Punjab government and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz openly came out in support of Razi, with a social media campaign launched to express solidarity with him.
The PPP strongly objected to the Maryam administration’s stance, questioning how it could support a man who had openly demonstrated hatred toward Sindh and fuelled provincialism.
“It is very unfortunate that the PML-N and the Punjab government have launched a campaign in support of a sick man,” Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon said in a post on Thursday.
He added that this sent a negative message to Sindh, accusing the Punjab government of trying to divert public attention from its poor performance during the floods.
 






PPP Punjab executive member Ahsan Rizvi also condemned the campaign by PML-N-backed X accounts, calling it “absolutely unacceptable.”
“It is regrettable that the PML-N’s social media is supporting a biased YouTuber. Describing someone who engages in blackmail and ethnic prejudice as a journalist is an insult to journalism,” Mr. Rizvi said.
 






The controversy has become a hot topic on social media, with many users urging the Punjab government not to support an “anti-Sindh man” merely because he targets the PML-N’s opponents.
In a statement, CM Maryam Nawaz said that even if Razi had used an inappropriate phrase, he showed “good character” by apologizing with an open heart.
“Those who fuel provincial prejudice and spread hate-filled narratives are never questioned. Rejecting the politics of hatred and the narrative of provincial division is the only way to make Pakistan stronger,” she said.
Punjab Information and Culture Minister Azma Bokhari also stressed that her party had never engaged in the politics of provincialism, nor had it played the river-or-dam card.

• Focus on Middle East may affect scheduled Trump-Shehbaz meeting
• PM heads to London, will attend UN moot on two-state solution
WASHINGTON: With world leaders expected to converge on New York for the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the escalating crises in Gaza and Qatar are reshaping global diplomatic priorities, with significant implications for Pakistan’s engagement with the United States.
In addition to his address at the General Assembly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is also expected to take part in the high-level international conference for the ‘Peaceful Sett­lement of the Question of Pales­tine and the Imple­men­tation of the Two-State Solution’.
The conference, which will take place on Monday, would require the Pakistani delegation to hold close consultations with Arab and Muslim leaders during the UNGA.
At a news briefing this week, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres noted that the 80th UNGA was meeting “in turbulent — even uncharted — waters”.
 
 

The UN chief pointed out that nearly 150 heads of state and government, alongside thousands of officials and diplomats, will participate in this “World Cup of diplomacy” that begins in New York on Monday.
“Palestine is going to be the huge elephant [in the room] in this session of the General Assembly,” said Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour, while explaining how this issue will keep the world leaders busy.
US veto and resolution
On Thursday, Washington reverted to its usual ways as it vetoed a draft Security Council resolution, which would have demanded an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, as well as calling on Israel to lift all restrictions on aid deliveries into the besieged Palestinian enclave.
The text, drafted by the elected 10 members of the 15-member council, would also have demanded the immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all prisoners held in Gaza.
It received 14 votes in favour, but the US used its veto power for a sixth time to come to Israel’s aid.
In a rare move last week, the US had backed a Security Council statement condemning recent strikes on Qatar, though the text did not mention Israel was responsible.
 
 

In another surprising development, Senate Democrats introduced a resolution calling for the US to extend recognition to the Palestinian state.
Although the measure is unlikely to pass the chamber where President Donald Trump’s Repu­blicans have a 53-47 majority, the resolution urges US recognition of a demilitarised Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel.
Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who is leading the effort, said in a statement: “America has a responsibility to lead, and the time to act is now.”
Rescheduled
Islamabad’s proactive stance in condemning the Israeli airstrike on Qatar and its subsequent diplomatic engagements have elevated its profile within the Muslim world, with the recent signing of a mutual defence accord with Saudi Arabia further enhancing its significance in regional security discussions.
In addition, the shifting focus of the UNGA in the wake of Israel’s belligerent actions is also expected to impact meetings scheduled to be held on the sidelines of the summit, as those are now expected to be dominated by hectic diplomacy by Middle Eastern actors. Amidst all this, diplomatic sources in Washington suggested that a proposed meeting between US President Donald Trump and PM Shehbaz Sharif may have to be rescheduled.
While the White House is still interested in the meeting, the intensifying crises in Gaza and Qatar may necessitate a shift in focus, sources said.
President Trump is expected to engage with Israeli and Arab leaders during the UNGA. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already announced that he is meeting President Trump at the White House on Sept. 29, soon after Trump’s consultations with world leaders at the UNGA.
This may mean that the Shehbaz-Trump interaction is confined to the sidelines of the assembly session in New York. Embassy sources, however, say that Islamabad would prefer a full-fledged meeting at the White House, to address bilateral and regional issues.
Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, who has previously met President Trump at the White House, is also expected to accompany PM Shehbaz.
PM in London
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz Sharif arrived in London on Thursday for meetings with senior British officials, ahead of his US trip.
According to sources, the prime minister will remain in London until Sept 21. During his stay, he is scheduled to hold meetings with senior officials and address a gathering of Pakistanis organised by the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation.
Before landing in London, the premier made a stopover in Geneva to meet his elder brother, Nawaz Sharif.
The elder Sharif had arrived in Geneva four days ago for medical treatment, accompanied by his son, Hassan Nawaz, and his physician, Dr Adnan.
Mr Sharif is expected to travel to London on Monday to join the prime minister and his delegation, which includes Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and the prime minister’s special assistant, Tariq Fatemi.

This initiative is part of a broader move towards a cashless economy.
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad briefed the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, outlining the country’s progress in developing a digital payments ecosystem. He discussed the current infrastructure, achievements, and emerging trends, noting that 88 per cent of retail transactions are now conducted digitally.
He added that Pakistan’s digital infrastructure supports 226 million accounts and 46m RAAST IDs across the country. Efforts are ongoing to increase the value of these transactions and improve security, including the introduction of a bank liability framework and a two-hour transaction cooling-off period to reduce fraud.
 
 

Mr Ahmad highlighted the successful launch of Mashreq Bank’s digital operations in Pakistan, which took just 12 months — a rapid timeline compared to the typical five-year rollout elsewhere. He also mentioned that five new digital banks had been granted in-principle approval to operate in the country.

SBP chief says push for cashless economy gains momentum with new initiatives

Despite the progress, the SBP governor acknowledged challenges such as low levels of financial literacy and regulatory gaps. However, he reassured the committee that the SBP was committed to addressing these issues and building a secure, inclusive, and innovative digital payments ecosystem.
MNA Naveed Qamar, chairing the meeting, emphasised the need to expand digital payments and social protection systems, particularly through digital wallets. This would replace branchless banking, providing beneficiaries with direct access to funds and multiple withdrawal options.
Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar briefed the committee on the prime minister’s cashless initiative, which is supported by three subcommittees focused on digital payments innovation and adoption. The committee discussed the roadmap for the initiative, underlining the role of digital financial services in enhancing financial inclusion, transparency, and economic growth.
Separately, Mr Ahmad inaugurated the JazzCash Experience Lounge, designed to showcase various digital payment innovations, including facial recognition payments, palm verification, wearables, and QR code-based transactions.

• Justice Saman Imtiaz defends assuming jurisdiction, says courtroom is a workplace
ISLAMABAD: Two judges of the Isla­m­abad High Court (IHC) have written letters expressing conflicting views over the proceeding on the harassment complaint filed against the chief justice by Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, who was part of the now-defunct committee constituted to examine harassment allegations against IHC CJ Justice Sarfraz Dogar, aligned himself with the top judge, asserting that such allegations did not fall within the ambit of the workplace harassment law.
In a letter, Justice Tahir clarified that the appropriate forum to address such grievances was the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). He maintained that the competent authority had erroneously assumed jurisdiction over the matter, according to sources familiar with the development.
The letter was circulated among judges as well as the chief justice shortly after the IHC administration de-notified Justice Sa­­­­man Rafat Imtiaz as the competent authority.
In a separate letter, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz defended assuming jurisdiction and termed the courtroom a workplace.
She stated that, as the competent auth­o­r­ity under the Protection Against Haras­sment of Women at Workplace Act, she was duty-bound to entertain the complaint.
Although there was no provision for including herself in the inquiry committee constituted to probe the allegations against the chief justice—since Subsection 4 of Section 4 of the Act states: “The inquiry committee shall submit its findings and recommendations to the competent authority within thirty days of the initiation of inquiry”.
Justice Imtiaz pointed out that Subsection 2 of Section 3 states: “The committee shall consist of three members, of whom at least one member shall be a woman. One member shall be from senior management and one shall be a senior representative of the employees or a senior employee where there is no CBA.” She said that in order to meet this requirement she included herself under compelling circumstances.
The episode took a dramatic turn when the IHC administration de-notified Just­ice Imtiaz and replaced her with Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas as the competent authority.
Justice Imtiaz suggested that her successor would complete the unfinished task, reiterating her view that judges could be tried under the Act and that Article 209 did not grant them immunity from such proceedings.
Besides seeking proceedings against the top judge under the Protection Against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, Ms Mazari-Hazir had earlier also moved the Supreme Judicial Council for misconduct proceedings against Justice Dogar. She again approached the judicial council after the IHC administration removed Justice Imtiaz as the competent authority.
The complaints against CJ Dogar stem­med from a heated exchange between the lawyer and the top judge last week.
Dur­ing the hearing, Justice Dogar had warned Ms Mazari-Hazir of a contempt of court case and was reported to have made remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”.

Speaking at the Sindh Amn March organised by his party in Karachi, the Maulana said there could be no state within a state, but if a solution through dialogue was proposed, then it should be entertained by the authorities.
He, however, said no one had the right to take the law into their own hands. “It’s unacceptable for someone to carry guns, climb mountains and kill whoever they want calling it ‘Jihad’,” he said.
Besides the JUI-F leader, the PTI has also opposed military operations, particularly in KP, where terrorism has seen a spike after the Taliban government came to power in Afghanistan. Recently, PTI chief Imran Khan had also told his party’s chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur in KP to oppose the move.
Maulana Fazl appreciated the defence pact between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. He termed it a positive development for regional stability and a step towards greater unity in the Muslim world.
“We urge both nations to utilise this agreement not just for bilateral gains but for the collective benefit of the Islamic world. This accord should be made effective for the whole Muslim Ummah,” he said.

• Two FC men injured in Kalat grenade attack
• Suicide bomber strikes convoy near Kech
QUETTA: At least six people lost their lives in a powerful bomb explosion in the border town of Chaman, a suicide bomber targeted a convoy in Kech district, while security forces killed four militants in Khuzdar during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) on Thursday.
Separately, four people, including two Frontier Corps officials, were injured in a grenade attack and firing by unknown armed men in the Mangochar area of Kalat division late in the evening.
Officials said the Chaman blast ripped through a crowded taxi stand near the Pak-Afghan border in the evening, killing four people instantly and injuring two others. The wounded later succumbed to their injuries, raising the death toll to six.
“The explosion took place near makeshift shops,” Assistant Commissioner Chaman Imtiaz Baloch told Dawn. Police and Levies forces rushed to the scene and shifted the dead and injured to the district hospital.
“The blast left bodies mangled and body parts scattered,” eyewitness Asghar Achakzai, a local reporter, told Dawn by phone.
Police said initial investigations suggested explosives had been planted outside the shops at the taxi stand.
 
 

The Balochistan Home Depart­ment confirmed the casualties and ordered an inquiry into the incident.
It asked citizens to cooperate with investigation officials, stressing that the culprits would be brought to justice.
Kech suicide attack
Meanwhile, a convoy travelling from Gwadar to Turbat came under attack in the Dasht-i-Kuddan area of Kech district, around 60 kilometres from Turbat.
Officials said gunmen opened fire on the convoy before a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden pickup into one of the buses.
There was no official word from the local administration or Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) about the incident. It was not immediately clear whether anyone had been killed or injured.
The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack.
Khuzdar operation
Separately, the military’s media wing said on Thursday that security forces killed four militants linked to the “Indian proxy” group Fitna al-Hindustan during an intelligence-based operation in Khuzdar.
“During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in a statement. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the site, it added.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the ISPR said.
Thursday’s attacks come amid a surge in militant activity across Balochistan.
Earlier this week, five militants were killed in Khuzdar. Last week, four militants were also killed during an IBO in Mastung, according to ISPR.
A day earlier, two police stations and a Levies post were targeted in Sherani district, leaving one poli­ce­­man martyred and two Levies personnel injured.

Right from the second throw, he had the lead in the men’s javelin final. The highly-anticipated clash of the South Asian titans — Arshad Nadeem and Neeraj Chopra — failed to gain momentum in the sold-out Japan National Stadium that turned its attention to Walcott on his way to winning his maiden world title. 
Walcott’s win, thanks to a season’s best 88.16m throw, was pleasantly surprising but not entirely unexpected given he was ranked fourth in the world coming into the World Athletics Championships. Anderson Peters of Grenada was the favorite for gold after an “unexpected’ 89.53m throw in the qualifiers. Curtis Thompson was another surprise of the night as he took bronze in an event the US hasn’t medalled in since 2007. 
But the burden of expectations was largely on Arshad and Chopra; one an Olympic champion, one the reigning champion, both poster boys for sporting excellence and Pakistan-India rivalry outside of cricket. A brotherly relationship kindled over years of competitions together — Chopra outshining Arshad on every front until Arshad climbed to supremacy with an Olympic gold last year — was snuffed out with the full force of a fire extinguisher that is geopolitical tensions between the neighbouring countries.  
The burden, or at least the need to give back to the country, was evident in the way Arshad, who finished a disappointing 10th with a best throw of 82.75m — two sports behind Chopra, took to social media a few hours after the event. 
“Although I couldn’t achieve the result I had hoped for in the final, I am proud to have represented our nation on the biggest stage,” his statement read. “Your prayers, messages, and encouragement mean the world to me. I know I let you all down, but I promise to come back stronger and work even harder to make you proud.” 
Whether scripted by his PR manager or written sincerely from the bottom of his heart, Arshad’s relationship with the nation has been one of putting Pakistan on the sporting map and only asking for “sab ki duaein [prayers from everyone]” in return. 
That he made it to the final was itself a big deal considering he underwent surgery barely two months ago. Plans to train in the UK this summer were replaced by surgery owing to a persistent calf injury, followed by rehabilitation in London. Having to pull out of two Diamond League meets in August meant he was competing in Tokyo with just one competition this season, the Asian Athletics Championships in May where he took gold. 
Speaking to World Athletics after Wednesday’s heats, Arshad explained that surgery had impacted him practicing his run-up, which is paramount in an event like javelin that can be anyone’s win if you’re not at your A-game. Mentally, Arshad has the tenacity and mindset to “fight till the last throw, that’s what I do best”. But when peak mental and physical performance don’t align, winning gold and shattering records is near impossible. 
“To be honest, I’ve been dealing with an injury since July 4, which affected my preparation and fitness level. Despite this challenge, I gave it my all, and I appreciate the experience,” he continued in his social media post.  
“Thank you for believing in me and supporting me on this journey. I will keep pushing myself to achieve greatness, not just for myself, but for our nation,” he said as he signed off with “love and gratitude”. 
Defending champion Chopra, who was returning to the site of his Olympic triumph, has been suffering from similar injury struggles. 
“I don’t know what happened,” Chopra said. “I had a back issue two weeks ago and I didn’t tell anybody. I was thinking I could still throw far — but no.” 
The men’s javelin final was one of several upsets and triumphs of the night. Four new world champions were crowned in events that have belonged so resolutely to a fiercely elite group of athletes. Reigning champions were dethroned and new ones crowned in an evening made dramatic by rain competing with sweat to drench the athletes. 
Will this be the changing of the guards? A final farewell to veteran athletes like Jakub Vadlejch and Julius Yego, who admitted they’re on the older side of sport now? 
That’s a question that the rest of the field can answer at the next major competition, but Walcott answered it tonight. 
He became Olympic champion at 19, an unexpected intruder at the top of the podium at the London 2012 Olympics. It was the first major disruption of the European-dominated event that Yego — who retired from the final with an injury — continued with his world championship win in 2015 
Walcott’s gold and Peters’ silver, secured with an 87.38m effort, on Thursday night snatched javelin supremacy from the South Asians. What happens next season will finally be a global affair spanning four continents.  
Arshad’s season, however, still isn’t over, as he’s set to compete at the Islamic Solidarity Games in November. And the nation will watch and wait with bated breath again to see if Arshad is back to his best by then.

• IHC moved for conjugal rights of Imran Khan and his wife at Adiala Jail; security around ATC beefed up ahead of today’s hearing           
RAWALPINDI: Despite repea­ted attempts by National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to interrogate PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail, officials have been unable to extract any information as he has consistently refused to meet them.
Meanwhile, a petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission for the former prime minister and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to exercise their conjugal rights while confined in the same jail.
According to sources, a three-member NCCIA team, headed by Additional Director Ayaz Khan, visited the Central Jail Adiala on Thursday for the second time during this week to question the PTI founder about his “X” handle.
However, the sources said Mr Khan told the team to bring his lawyers if they wanted to question him on any matter and refused to participate in the investigation.
The team arrived at Adiala Jail at around 3.30pm and left two hours later empty-handed amid ti­­ght security. The NCCIA launched the investigation after tweets were posted from Mr Khan’s account criticising government officials and the establishment.Earlier, on Tuesday, the same team had visited the Adiala Jail to investigate the PTI founder regarding the ope­ration of his social media account. 
Plea for conjugal rights
Separately, A petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court seeking permission for the former premier Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi to exercise their conjugal rights, while confined in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi.
The petition, submitted under Article 199 of the Constitution, was filed by Shahid Yaqoob, a resident of Islamabad and a supporter of Mr Khan.
The respondents named in the petition include the Chief Commis­sioner Islamabad, the Punjab government, the Inspector General of Prisons Punjab, and the Superin­tendent of Central Jail Adiala.
The petitioner argued that denying conjugal rights violates constitutional protections, international conventions, and previous court rulings. The plea referred to the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the European Conv­e­n­­tion on Human Rights, all of which safeguard the right to family life.
It also cited a 2010 notification issued by the Sindh home department following Sup­reme Court directions, which allo­w­­ed convicted inmates conjugal visits every three months. 
It furt­h­­er relied on the Federal Shariat Co­­urt’s landmark judgement that recognised conjugal rights for prisoners as a fundamental entitlement.
It requested the IHC to order the implementation of SC and Federal Shariat Court directives. 
A police spokesperson said that security will be beefed up around the ATC Rawalpindi on Friday during hearing of GHQ attack case, in which the PTI founder is set to attend the proceeding via video link.
