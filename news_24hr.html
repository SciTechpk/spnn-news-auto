The Saudi outlet reported on Monday that employers were banned from “charging any fees from their domestic workers”, including those “related to recruitment, change of professions, transfer of services, residency permit (iqama) and work permits”.
 






Saudi Gazette said the provisions were included in the “Guide to the Rights and Obligations of Domestic Workers”, issued by the Saudi human resources ministry. It added that the new regulations “include a package of rights that guarantee the domestic worker a decent life and a stable work environment”.
According to the guide, professions permitted by law in the domestic worker sector include “domestic worker, private driver, and specialised professions such as home nurse, cook, tailor, butler, supervisor, and house manager, as well as home guard, personal assistant, farmer, physical therapist, and home coffee maker”.
The guidelines also allow the addition of any other profession that may fall under the duties of domestic workers, the report added.
 
 

“It is also stipulated that domestic workers shall be disbursed with their wages according to the unified contract signed with the employer,” Saudi Gazette said, adding that the new guidelines stress workers’ right to a weekly rest day agreed upon in the contract.
The provisions also include “daily rest hours of no less than eight continuous hours, in addition to a full month’s leave after completing two years of continuous work if the worker wishes to renew the work contract”.
In 2008, the Human Rights Watch called on Saudi Arabia to improve labour law protections and end its “sponsorship” system to prevent domestic workers from being treated like slaves.
Under the “sponsorship” system, also known as the “Kafala” system, foreigners in Saudi Arabia obtain a visa through their employer, who usually retains their passports.

This health and climate crisis has been brewing for some years, while the state — nudged on by civil society and experts — has begun to take steps to combat the smog hazard.
South Asian cities have some of the worst air on the planet, and many Pakistani urban centres are included in this unenviable list. For example, on Tuesday, both Lahore and Karachi were amongst the top five most polluted cities globally, as per IQAir monitoring data, with air quality described as “very unhealthy”. And as winter sets in, things will get worse.
 
 

In Lahore’s case, experts say a combination of local factors and pollutants blowing in from across the border with India are responsible for the dirty air. In particular, pollution caused by firecrackers set off during the Diwali celebrations in India has aggravated matters, as that country’s supreme court relaxed a ban on fireworks, allowing ‘green firecrackers’ for the occasion.
The Punjab administration has taken steps to help reduce air pollution. This includes deploying anti-smog guns as well as rounding up people responsible for emissions from factories and vehicles, and those burning crop stubble. The provincial government has also urged people to wear masks outdoors, and keep doors and windows closed. These steps were direly needed as last winter, Lahore witnessed some of the worst air quality levels on record.
It remains to be seen whether the state’s efforts result in a noticeable change in air quality. Along with such precautionary steps, it is essential to reduce emissions and encourage a switch to electric vehicles, while providing more public transport options to reduce the carbon footprint. Experts also recommend a shift to mechanical composters to address the burning of crop stubble.
While many steps are required locally and nationally, air pollution is also a transboundary issue, and a coordinated response is needed for better air across South Asia. As a senior UN official told the recently held Air We Breathe conference, organised by DawnMedia in Lahore, Pakistan cannot face the threats of air pollution and climate change alone; these are issues that require an international response.
 
 

The latest example of firecrackers set off in northern India affecting air quality in Punjab is one small example of this. While relations with our eastern neighbour may be at rock bottom, both states need to cooperate on issues such as transboundary pollution and climate change.
Clichéd as it may sound, dirty air knows no borders, and it is only through sharing data and best practices that South Asia can tackle the problem of poisonous air. In the meantime, we must do all possible locally to shield people from the acrid smog.

“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar spoke on the phone late last night with the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia, H.H. Prince Faisal bin Farhan,” the FO posted on X today.
According to the FO, the two leaders “reviewed recent developments in the region, including [in] Gaza and Palestine”, building on previous discussions.
The FO further stated that both sides “reaffirmed their shared commitment to peace and stability in the region and agreed to stay closely engaged on matters of mutual interest”.
 






Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were among the eight Muslim countries that had
worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza.
Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan both had hailed the signing of a ceasefire deal between the Israeli government and the Palestinian group Hamas, with Saudi Arabia expressing the hope that it would lead to peace after two years of Israeli bombardment in Gaza.
Moreover, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
In September, the two countries signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.

Muthusamy made a career-best 89 not out and Rabada struck his highest score of 71 as the visitors added 169 for the last two wickets.
Veteran Pakistan spinner Asif Afridi ended the innings on 404 at the stroke of tea.
The 38-year-old Asif finished with figures of 6-79 and is the oldest man to take five wickets on a Test debut.
 






The afternoon session though belonged to South Africa as the World Test champions bid to square the two-match series, after losing the first Test by 93 runs in Lahore.
Muthusamy defied the Pakistan spinners, hitting eight fours to improve on his previous highest of 68 not out against Bangladesh at Chattogram last year.
Muthusamy added an invaluable 71 runs for the ninth wicket with Keshav Maharaj (30) and then increased the lead with a last-wicket stand worth 98.
Rabada smashed four sixes and as many fours, improving on the 47 he made against New Zealand at Christchurch in 2022.
The morning belonged to Asif, who at 38 years and 301 days overtook England’s Charles Marriott as oldest debutant to take five wickets.
Marriott did so against the West Indies at The Oval in 1933 aged 37 years and 332 days.
Like fellow left-armer Maharaj — who took seven wickets for the visitors in Pakistan’s 333 all out — Asif used the dry conditions to maximum effect.
South Africa resumed on 185-4 and added 100 runs in the morning session.
With the turn on the Rawalpindi stadium pitch increasing considerably, Asif dismissed Kyle Verreynne caught behind by wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan for 10 with the fourth ball of the day.
Tristan Stubbs defied Pakistan’s spinners for 256 minutes before a fastish delivery from Asif trapped him leg-before for 76. His knock was studded with six fours and a six.
Asif completed his five-wicket haul by trapping Simon Harmer leg-before for two while Noman Ali dismissed Marco Jansen in the same manner for 12.</p><small>2025-10-22 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/220815415ff8871.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950541/imperial-college-london-refutes-punjab-govts-claims-of-campus-in-lahore-says-has-no-such-plans' target='_blank'><strong>Imperial College London refutes Punjab govt’s claims of campus in Lahore, says has no such plans</strong></a><br><p>Imperial College London has refuted the Punjab government’s claims that it is opening a campus at the Nawaz Sharif IT City in Lahore, saying that all of its campuses are based in the United Kingdom (UK).
On October 18, the PML-N had posted on its official X account about a meeting chaired by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. The post said that a campus of Imperial College London would open at the Nawaz Sharif IT City, adding that the foundation stone would be laid in November.
“A modern 300-bed hospital will also be built within the college campus,” it said.
 






In a separate post on X, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb had also made a similar statement about the meeting chaired by the chief minister.
“A campus of Imperial College London will be established in the Nawaz Sharif IT City which will also include a state-of-the-art 300-bed hospital and its foundation stone will be laid in November,” she had said. The post has since been deleted.

The official X account for the Punjab government had also reiterated the same.
 






However, the educational institute refuted these claims, terming them “incorrect”.
“Reports that Imperial College London plans to open a campus overseas are incorrect,” the college said in a post on its official website on Monday.
“There have been erroneous reports in the media and online that Imperial is opening a campus at Nawaz Sharif IT City in Lahore, Pakistan. Imperial has no such plans, with all the university’s campuses based in the UK,” it said.
It further directed those interested in the college’s global activity to its International Relations Office webpage.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Central Business District (CBD), a department under the provincial government set up to establish urban regeneration projects, also issued a statement, saying the planned college will be a collaboration between a trust of the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) and NovaCare.
“The upcoming healthcare university and affiliated medical college at CBD NSIT (Nawaz Sharif IT) is a collaborative initiative between NovaCare and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (UK) — an independent NHS institution,” it said.
The CBD added that the project “remains firmly on track under the NovaCare–ICHT partnership, advancing our mission to establish a world-class hub for healthcare education, research, and innovation at CBD NSIT, Lahore, under the direct supervision” of the Imperial College Healthcare trust.
 






Earlier, former chairman of the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), Javed Hassan, said that as an alumnus of Imperial College London, he was “briefly bemused by the bold claim of a campus in Nawaz Sharif IT City”.
“Turns out Imperial College is less adventurous — its campus plans remain firmly UK-bound. Verification, it seems, is still a novel concept,” he said.
 






Punjab CM Maryam had officially inaugurated the Nawaz Sharif IT City project commercially in May last year. During the ceremony, the chief minister had stated that several international tech giants were showing interest, with 10 companies already planning to establish their offices there. The IT city spans 853 acres and is designated as tax-free for 10 years.</p><small>2025-10-22 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/221253124a390c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950557/aurangzeb-quite-hopeful-pakistan-can-achieve-close-to-35pc-gdp-growth-during-ongoing-fiscal-year' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb ‘quite hopeful’ Pakistan can achieve close to 3.5pc GDP growth during ongoing fiscal year</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said he is “quite hopeful” that Pakistan could manage to achieve GDP growth of close to 3.5 per cent during the ongoing fiscal year despite the impact of recent floods.
The finance czar shared this projection during an interview on CGTN America programme ‘One on One’, which was published on Tuesday. During the interview, the finance minister was asked how big a challenge the recent floods posed to economic recovery.
To that, Aurangzeb began his reply by underlining that climate change was an “existential issue for Pakistan”.
“We are living it day in and day out,” he said.
He then went on to recall previous floods and their impact, and stated:
“We grew at 3pc GDP last year. We had estimated that we would grow a little over 4pc this year, but now, given the flood situation, this will shave off a certain percentage around that. But, I am still quite hopeful that we can manage anything close to 3.5pc during this fiscal year.”
 


At the outset of the interview, the finance minister was asked about the efforts to restore Pakistan’s economy and the main challenges being faced on that front.
To that, Aurangzeb said Pakistan had “consolidated gains on the macroeconomic stability front. […] Inflation continues to be a good story, which is now in single digits. [The] policy rate has been halved. And as a result of that, what we have seen during the course of this year is [that] all global rating agencies have upgraded us during the course of this year. [It] started with Fitch, then S&P, and then two months back Moody’s upgraded us. So it is after a hiatus of two and a half or three years, we have alignment between the rating agencies.”
In reply to a question about the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Aurangzeb recalled that the global money lender and Pakistan had agreed upon a staff-level agreement on its loan programmes earlier this month, which would allow the country to access $1.2 billion after approval from the fund’s board.
“We are very grateful that the management of the Fund continues to repose trust and confidence in the authorities in Pakistan in terms of staying the course, especially with respect to structural reforms,” the minister said, highlighting that Pakistan had made progress in the areas of taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises, privatisation and public finance.
“Privatisation was one area where we didn’t do well,” he acknowledged. But, he added, “today, we had the first asset — it’s a small bank, but it’s been on the privatisation list for a long time. It’s been nominated out to the UAE, which came in with a very successful bid. So it’s going to be handed over, and they are going to invest further in terms of increasing its footprint, taking it digital, etc.”
About the Pakistan International Airlines, he said “we are very sanguine” that it is going to be privatised before the year’s end.
“As a result of all of these developments, we have been able to return to the commercial markets,” he added. “We tapped the Middle Eastern bank borrowing again after a gap of two and a half years […] We are also now looking forward to actually printing the inaugural Panda Bond before the year is out.”
At that, Aurangzeb was asked whether Pakistan now being able to access commercial banks was a direct consequence of upgrades from rating agencies.
“Indeed,” he replied. “I keep on saying that macroeconomic stability is not an end in itself, it’s a means to an end. We repaid $500 million of Eurobond payment which was due on September 30 […] We are now clearly poised well to repay the next tranche, which is $1.3 billion, in April of next year.
“But we are refreshing our GMTN (global medium-term note) with a view to go for now a major print after the Panda bond. We haven’t decided whether it’s going to be Euro, USD or Islamic sukuk, but we will be looking for a large print during the next calendar year,” he said.
On Pakistan-China ties and what had this partnership done for Pakistan economically, Aurangzeb said, “It is a longstanding, ironclad partnership.“
The finance minister further stated that “everything that happened in the CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor), which was a flagship for BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) — The phase one was all about infrastructure. Now, phase two is all about monetisation of that infrastructure, using the special economic zones, etc. This is very much private sector to private sector”.
Aurangzeb then mentioned he had accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to  Shenzhen last year, where a number of MoUs were signed.
“The difference this time around in Beijing was that we had 24 joint venture agreements signed. So we have travelled from MoUs to JV agreements, which means there is traction now. It is going to be very much private-owned enterprises from China working with the private sector. And our role is going to be making sure that we provide the necessary ecosystem.”
Asked what was the focus of CPEC Phase II, the finance minister said, “The focus is investment — first of all, making sure that the $19 billion dollar plus trade that we have, we take it to the next level. We have an Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place, and this can now be upgraded. That’s one part of it.
“The second part of it is investments. And investments in all areas of mutual interest. It’s minerals and mining, it’s agriculture, it’s AI (artificial intelligence) and IT (information technology).”
He also underlined the potential for cooperation in the pharmaceutical sector.
“When I say pharma, I think we have a huge opportunity to get the vaccination production going in Pakistan. We saw it firsthand when the unfortunate Covid situation came in and we had to go helter-skelter finding the vaccinations. This is one of the key areas where we can work with Chinese enterprises to get that production going in Pakistan.“</p><small>2025-10-22 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/221436583fc3fdc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950565/can-international-law-stop-wars' target='_blank'><strong>Can international law stop wars?</strong></a><br><p>Roman philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero believed that laws were silent amidst the clash of arms. However, the notion that rules were necessary even in times of armed conflict have ancient roots. From the ancient Vedic traditions, Sun Tzu’s ‘The Art of War’, Roman law, the Bible, and the Qur’an, all of these texts include stipulations of what is or is not allowed in war.
These norms have evolved into the contemporary law of armed conflict, which aims to spare those not directly involved in hostilities and limit the effects of violence to the amount necessary for the purpose of war.
They aim to balance the need to uphold humanitarian rules even in times of armed conflict and that of military necessity, which would allow for a party to the conflict to engage in lawful conduct in order for it to win the war. Ultimately, they seek to inject some element of humanity into the awful business that is warfare.
Cardinal Principles
Distinction
The laws of armed conflict are applied when there is a “resort to armed force between States or protracted violence between governmental authorities and organised armed groups or between such groups within a State.“ Therefore they apply to inter-state as well as civil wars.
One of the cardinal principles of the laws of war is that of distinction. This rule states that parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives. Only combatants and military objectives are to be targeted. However, there are certain caveats to the simple statement of this rule. Civilians can be targeted if they directly participate in hostilities for so long as they do so. Moreover, combatants who are injured, surrender, or become prisoners of war cannot be targeted.
 


The definition of military objective has been subject to debate. The law defines military objectives as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage”.
This generally includes armaments factories, missile depots and command centres, however, it can also include bridges if they are used to supply troops to the front line and hills if they offer a vantage point of high ground. Even hospitals can become a legitimate target if they are used to commit acts harmful to the enemy, though the opposing party must give a warning before attacking a hospital.
The US’ position has been that military objectives include ‘war sustaining’ objectives as the military advantage comes from the revenues which allow them to support their military operations. This renders the US’ targeting of oil tankers and cash stockpiles in its war against Isis lawful. This interpretation has been contended and criticised. Legal scholar Marty Lederman, for instance, asks whether this approach would allow a state at war with the US to “target Apple headquarters, or various other tax-generating operations in Silicon Valley.”
Similarly, in its most recent operation in the Gaza Strip, Israel “adopts a highly unusual view” that entire apartment buildings inside which an enemy military facility is found constitute a single military objective that may be targeted. Most other militaries adopt the view that the unit itself is a military objective but the entire building is not. Therefore, there are a number of approaches that states adopt regarding the definition of military objectives which allow for a broader view of what may or may not be targeted during times of armed conflict.
Proportionality
The principle of proportionality provides that the amount of ‘collateral damage’ must be weighed against the military advantage anticipated from an attack. The law itself defines an indiscriminate attack as an “attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”. A key issue with this principle is the inherent difficulty of weighing civilian life in exchange for military advantage and whether they can in fact be balanced at all.
While many human rights reports in particular simply determine an attack to be disproportionate due to the civilian lives lost, that is not an adequate way to gauge the legality or otherwise of an attack. As military lawyers have stated, “I have approved targets that could have caused 3,000 civilian casualties and I’ve raised questions about targets predicted to risk fewer than 200 civilian lives. The issue is about the importance of the target.” However, the importance of the target itself may be subjectively determined with the importance of the military advantage to be gained being overblown, thereby undermining the calculation made.
In analysing Israel’s attack on the Jabalia refugee camp on October 31, 2023, in which 126 civilians died in the targeting of a Hamas commander, operatives and the tunnel network underneath the camp, Mark Lattimer notes that “the IDF appears to have accepted a level of expected civilian casualties that was not just larger but several times larger than that used by the U.S. and the U.K. in any of the operations during the war against ISIS and other counterterrorism campaigns”. He further questions Israel’s commitment to civilian protection which the principle of proportionality aims to guarantee.
Precaution
The principle of precaution requires that feasible measures be taken to ensure that civilians or civilian objects are not being attacked. If a range of options are available, for instance, in destroying a railway line, it would be preferable to destroy the line in the countryside as opposed to in the city, if this is feasible.
Additionally, the attacking state must take precautions in choosing weapons and tactics to minimise incidental injury and collateral damage and the selecting of military objectives among those giving similar military advantage expected to cause least danger to civilian lives or objects. This principle also obliges parties to endeavour to give warning if feasible to civilians who may be affected by an attack.
However, compliance with the principle of precaution does not mean that any of the other obligations (of distinction and proportionality) are lessened in any way. Israel has in the past issued warnings before air strikes through phone calls, text messages or ‘knocks on the roof. In doing so, Israel argues that it is abiding by international law. It is contended, however, that giving warnings to civilians who in practice have no means to leave may not in fact comply with this cardinal principle.
Conclusion
After the devastation wrought by recent conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan, where the laws of war have been violated and war crimes have been committed, it is a worthwhile endeavour to return to the laws themselves and ask whether they are in fact fit for purpose.
While the norms underlying these rules have ancient roots, it may be that the current indeterminacy with which they are drafted, and the varying approaches to their implementation, undermine the fundamental principles they seek to protect. In order to reduce human suffering amid the clash of arms, it may be that more precise and objective rules are required.

She made the remarks as an eight-member resumed hearing over three dozen petitions against the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year.
At the time, the PTI claimed seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate, with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The hearing
Advocate Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, counsel for veteran politician Afrasiab Khattak, presented his arguments today.
The live stream of the hearing initially faced technical issues, with the audio being cut off. However, the issues were later resolved with proceedings being streamed as per usual. The hearing was later adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow (Thursday).
 


Justice Aminuddin Khan is heading the bench hearing the case. It also includes Justices Ayesha, Mohammad Ali Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
At the outset of the hearing, Hosain emphasised that the judiciary’s reputation “does not depend on the 26th Constitutional Amendment”. “This case should be heard by a different independent bench,” the lawyer asserted.

Justice Mandokhail then asked, “Do you not trust this bench?”, at which the lawyer said that a decision on Article 191A — through which the CB in the apex court was introduced — should be taken by the “original full court”.
Justice Rizvi noted that Hosain’s petition did mention the term “original full court”. The counsel clarified that he did not say “this bench is not independent”.
Justice Mandokhail remarked, “You yourself said that the case should be kept before another independent bench. Will we judges be included in that ‘independent bench’?”
Justice Aminuddin also wondered whether CJP Yahya Afridi would be a part of that “independent bench”, to which Hosain replied that he “absolutely would be”.
Here, Justice Mandokhail questioned Hosain that if the current CB “could not hear this case, how could it issue any order?”.
The lawyer replied, “Why is the court seeking a path to issue an order? So far, the Centre has not raised any objection to a full court or [the CB] issuing any order.”
Justice Aminuddin responded that each lawyer had their own stance, and that the bench was raising questions after considering the Constitution. “Some lawyers are even saying to keep aside the Amendment,” Justice Mandokhail observed.
At one point, Justice Mazhar noted, “If 26 judges are included, then it will become a regular bench.” Hosain also agreed that it would not be a constitutional bench.
Justice Mandokhail recalled Dr Adnan Khan’s arguments from yesterday, in which he contended that the SC and the CB were separate entities. The judge then directed the lawyer to detail when the concept of benches came into existence.
When Justice Mazhar mentioned that some lawyers argued that other SC judges can also be included in the current bench, Hosain asserted that the CB was also a bench of the apex court.
Justice Ayesha then directed the counsel to read Article 191A in conjunction with its Clause 3, which says “no bench of the Supreme Court other than a Constitutional Bench shall exercise the following jurisdictions vested in the Supreme Court”, with the latter including the SC’s original jurisdiction under Article 184.
 
 

Justice Ayesha observed that the provision said the specified jurisdictions were to be exercised by the SC’s CB. “For some reason, we keep reading this as an ouster to say that no one else will [hear the case]. It simply says no other bench will do it.”
She further said that even if Article 191A was interpreted to mean that “no other bench” will hear such cases, it meant that the CB would hear “a case on the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court” and interpret the Constitution.
“Where is the bar? […] It (the CB) is reading the provisions of the Constitution and interpreting it, and in doing that interpretation, it is saying that […] because this is a matter of a Constitutional Amendment, we interpret this to mean that a full court can hear the matter. Would that make sense?”
Justice Ayesha remarked, “I am speaking for myself; I, in the first case, said I don’t see a bar.” She added that as per Article 191A, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) is to nominate judges for the CB.
The judge termed Article 191A a “procedural” provision. She noted that while it imposes restrictions on benches, it does not on the SC, adding that the CB was interpreting the provisions as if they impose a “complete restriction”.
Justice Mazhar then expressed his “complete agreement” with Hosain’s argument that contention that a 16-member bench will be a regular bench, and not a CB.
Hosain contended, “If you say that your hands are tied, then that is not the case. Nowhere is it written that a Constitutional Bench cannot refer the matter to the full court.”
Justice Mandokhail then wondered whether the lawyer meant that the CB could not refer the case to a regular bench but could do so to a full court. “But then that will also be a regular bench. He (Hosain) said that a 16-member bench will be a regular one,” the judge added.
Hosain replied that the judges’ powers had not been taken away from them. “If, let’s suppose, the parliament tomorrow decides under a 27th amendment that an executive officer will preside over the Supreme Court, will you judges not be able to review that decision? You definitely can,” he said.
Khattak’s counsel argued that the appropriate procedure for passing the 26th Amendment had not been followed, at which Justice Mazhar said this question could be raised before the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP) when arguing on the merits of the case.
At one point, Justice Hassan remarked that the lawyer was “seeking the main relief” through his current petition before the CB.
Hosain replied, “My CMA (civil miscellaneous application) does not say strike down the 26th Amendment. My CMA is very focused, which is what is before your lordships now. It is ‘please send these cases to the original full court […] and there is nothing stopping you from doing that’.”
During the hearing, Justice Mandokhail wondered who would hear such a challenge if the “jurisdiction of the entire Supreme Court was taken away through any Constitutional amendment”.
“Even if the powers are taken away, the same Supreme Court will hear it,” he observed, recalling previous arguments that the current CB was not eligible to hear the case against the same 26th Amendment that led to it.
Hosain reiterated that there was no bar on the CB referring the matter to the full court, adding that he was not seeking a final decision from the current bench, but a directive to forward the case to the full court.
“Your lordships have the power. Please do not underestimate your power,” the counsel said. Hosain then concluded his arguments, following which the hearing was adjourned till tomorrow.
Requests for full court
Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s (BHCBA) counsel Munir A. Malik, and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed.
Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request. The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself.
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-22 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/21165157a597e24.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950361/how-pakistans-crypto-craze-has-made-it-a-scammers-paradise' target='_blank'><strong>How Pakistan’s crypto craze has made it a scammer’s paradise</strong></a><br><p>“Never save your wallet key online,” warned Talha, a data scientist with an MS in computer science who works on web development. “I learned that the hard way.”
Despite two-factor authentication (2FA) and strict security on his Facebook account, he lost access to his crypto wallet — not because he clicked a link or downloaded malware, but because months earlier, he had messaged himself his 12-word seed phrase on Facebook Messenger. “There was no login attempt, no alert. The funds just vanished,” he said.
The experience taught him that no system is ever fully secure once your key is exposed. “We think we’re safe behind strong passwords or 2FA, but in reality, anything online is public,” he said.
But that wasn’t his only lesson. He was active in several Telegram groups where people discussed new coins. “Someone with a Chinese profile reached out, talking about workouts, lifestyle, and crypto,” he recalled. “It felt like any normal networking chat.” The man introduced him to a supposed “insider” tip: a new coin launch where early buyers could profit within hours.
The token’s value kept rising on paper — his $30 ballooned to $300 — until the moment he tried to sell. “It wouldn’t sell,” he said. “That’s when I knew it was fake. People were still buying, but no one could withdraw. It was just an illusion of growth.”
 

Common crypto scams reported by Pakistani users. (This list is not exhaustive but highlights the most frequent types of fraud shared by victims in the story)

When Talha confronted the scammer, the man doubled down, urging him to invest $1,000 next time. “That’s how these cons work,” he said. “The first time, they let you win small. Then they trap you when you scale up.”
Talha’s experience was only one of many echoing across Pakistan’s growing crypto community.
The dark side of Pakistan’s crypto boom
An early crypto adopter who now runs a Facebook page called Pakistan iFrauds to report online scams, Muneeb* (name has been changed on the victim’s request) has been on the receiving end of multiple frauds — some elaborate, others deceptively simple. “The first time I got scammed was through phishing,” he said. “I got an email saying funds had been transferred to my account, but I didn’t check. Later, when I reviewed the email headers, I realised it was fake.”
His second experience was through a chargeback scam — a common tactic where the sender reverses a payment after receiving goods or crypto. In another instance, he received a payment from a hacked account. “The bank called to say the transfer came from one of their old and big customers, so they simply reversed the transaction and took the money back from me,” he recalled.
The financial loss was only part of the ordeal. “I even got a case filed against me by authorities,” he said. “I was the one who was scammed, but I had to pay a bribe of Rs700,000 just to close the case.”
Despite everything, Muneeb* remained optimistic about crypto. “Most scams could have been avoided if I had followed standard operating procedures and been less trusting,” he admitted. “I still made a profit overall, so I believe crypto has been beneficial; it’s the future.”
To him, the problem isn’t crypto itself but a lack of awareness. “You can get scammed anywhere — Facebook, online shopping, even a phone call,” he said. “If you’re educated about it, the advantages still outweigh the risks.”
A doctor from Sindh echoed that sense of misplaced trust. Since 2021, he had lost nearly Rs1 million to various crypto schemes. “Podcast hosts don’t disclose sponsorships,” he said. “They misguide viewers by promoting projects that later turn out to be scams.”
 

Common red flags in crypto scams

A popular celebrity and entertainment journalist once had her Instagram account hacked. After months of follow-up, she finally received a response from the authorities: her account could be restored — but there was a catch.
Her 3,000-plus followers, many of whom she had painstakingly built through boosted posts, had already received private messages promoting “investment opportunities” in crypto coins and wallets. The messages appeared to come from her account, making it seem like she was personally vouching for them.
“Some of my celebrity followers had even received direct messages from my hacked account,” she said. When authorities told her she could reclaim her account, she refused. “What’s the point,” she continued, “of getting it back if my followers think I scammed them?”
The digital ecosystem feeding online fraud
Crypto influencer Waqar Zaka said that scammers are using his name to defraud “over a million people every month.” While the number seems outlandishly high, he said, “People are so gullible and greedy, they don’t want to do research. They see a Telegram or Facebook comment saying, “‘I’m from Waqar Zaka’s team. Send money and I’ll trade for you,’ and they just send it.”
According to him, the issue isn’t just regulatory failure — it’s platform negligence as well. “Instagram, Facebook and Telegram tick marks are fake. Most crypto scams today are happening in comment sections under Facebook and Instagram posts,” he noted.
He added that scammers have shifted their targets. “They don’t even use crypto hashtags. They place ads in front of women watching cooking or drama content. And when those women lose money, they don’t tell their families — they just message me asking for help.”
Zaka argued that the burden lies with global platforms, not just regulators. “Meta profits off viewership from emerging markets; it’s their duty to protect users,” he stated. “The solution isn’t another task force; it’s accountability and awareness.”
He also advises beginners to ignore “get-rich-quick” content entirely. “Instead of random podcasts, learn from credible sources — MIT, Stanford, or official exchange academies,” he said. “If you want to invest, start by educating yourself.”
 
 

On the global platforms where crypto conversations thrive — Discord, Telegram, and Reddit — entire networks of scammers operate in plain sight. One insider working at an AI and crypto startup (who requested anonymity due to a non-disclosure agreement) described the scale of it as “an automated business.”
“Scammers routinely post in Discord servers, posing as fake support bots,” he explained. “My newbie friend got his wallet drained that way on his first day. They send friend requests, set up fake ‘support’ servers, and even mimic official channels with thousands of members.”
He described how the con is engineered: “They train illegal bots to automatically message anyone who posts a query. That message redirects users to a fake channel full of scammers and fake users. It’s like a Venus flytrap — once you land there, trained humans take over, using real technical jargon to sound legitimate.”
According to him, major crypto companies have had to hire teams dedicated to tracking such scams. “They target when regular moderators are asleep,” he claimed. “It’s all automated until a real human scammer steps in to close the deal.”
We’re missing a market watchdog
Pakistan ranks third globally in overall crypto adoption, behind only India and the United States, as per the 2025 Global Adoption Index by Chainanalysis. However, nearly all of its activity is retail-driven by small investors. Most transactions take place through centralised exchanges like Binance or local peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, where scams often take place in Pakistan’s unregulated crypto environment.
Within local crypto circles, frustration is spilling into public view. Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the recently launched Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), recently posted on X, “Should we launch a grievance cell to start investigating these cases?”, replying to a user who lamented, “Bilal bhai, thak gaye hain P2P scams se.”
The exchange highlights how widespread the problem has become and how regulatory and industry responses are still struggling to keep pace. The PCC was contacted for comment, but had not responded by the time this report was published.
There have, however, been concerted efforts in recent months to bring virtual assets trading such as crypto currencies under a regulatory framework — a far cry from State Bank of Pakistan’s position in 2018 when it warned the public that digital assets “are neither recognised as legal tender nor authorised by SBP for issuance, sale, purchase, exchange, or investment”. Fast forward to March 2025, the government established the Pakistan Crypto Council, chaired by the finance minister, signalling a significant shift in attitude.
Soon after, the SBP too clarified its position, saying that its earlier “advice” was “due to the absence of any legal and regulatory framework for the VAs; not because it was declared illegal in the country.”
In July 2025, the Virtual Assets Ordinance (VAO), 2025, established an independent regulator for virtual assets and cryptocurrencies. Under it, the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA) has been created as an autonomous federal body empowered to license, regulate and supervise entities dealing in virtual assets.
While its website currently invites expressions of interest from companies seeking licences and registration, most sections still read “launching soon”, which is understandable given that it only came into effect a few months ago.
Given the already high level of crypto adoption in Pakistan, though, regulation and awareness cannot come soon enough.
 

Appfigures indicates that Binance has had 14.1m downloads on Google Play Store and 1.5m on App Store

Around 250 apps appear on Google Play in Pakistan when you look up the keyword “crypto”, according to analytics from Appfigures. Global players like Binance, Crypto.com, and Trust Wallet naturally dominate the search results.
Binance, however, ranks seventh under the finance category, indicating its popularity, which can be further attested by the fact that it has remained the third-most downloaded in finance by Pakistanis for two years straight, according to the Pakistan State of Apps 2024 report by Data Darbar. Binance has had 14.1m downloads on Google Play Store and 1.5m on App Store since 2021, as per Appfigures.
Meanwhile, Appfigures analytics indicates that crypto’s competitiveness score is an astonishing 95, suggesting that demand is fragmented across dozens of platforms. Most of these apps have been around for roughly a decade, but receive frequent updates showing continued local engagement. For Pakistan to protect its crypto investors, the PCC will have to step in to regulate, sooner rather than later.
 

Appfigures analytics shows crypto’s competitiveness score — 95

The price of trust
Fintech expert Zeeshan Ahmed argued that these patterns — social engineering, phishing, and P2P fraud — are all part of a broader financial truth. “For as long as there has been value, be it gold, diamonds, fiat, or now crypto, scams have existed,” he remarked. “The basic rule hasn’t changed: an unsuspecting person is deceived into transferring value. Only the medium has evolved.”
According to him, Pakistan’s crypto ecosystem lacks one key element: trust infrastructure. “Don’t transact in unverified environments,” he recommended. “If you want to trade or store crypto, use a licensed exchange — those operating under regulators in Bahrain or the UAE have oversight so tight that fraud chances are less than one per cent.”
Ahmed stressed that people should verify regulatory claims before trusting a platform. “Go to the Abu Dhabi Global Market’s website — it lists every exchange licensed in the UAE, and even those suspended or under compliance checks,” he advised. “Regulators make that information public. People just don’t look.”
He believes Pakistan doesn’t need to invent new crypto regulations — it just needs to adapt the tested ones. “The beauty of what the Pakistan Crypto Council is trying to do is that they’re adopting globally tested models,” he stated. “The UAE and US frameworks have been stress-tested for years. If those gold-standard systems are replicated here, we won’t have to start from scratch.”
Ultimately, all these stories, from Talha’s vanished funds to hacked accounts and fake bots, point to one truth: the weakest link is still human trust.
As Talha said, “We think we’re safe behind passwords and two-factor authentication. But if the key is online, it’s never really yours.”</p><small>2025-10-22 09:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2213555835c1257.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950564/after-kp-cms-complaints-naqvi-says-bulletproof-vehicles-to-be-sent-to-balochistan-instead' target='_blank'><strong>After KP CM’s complaints, Naqvi says bulletproof vehicles to be sent to Balochistan instead</strong></a><br><p>After complaints by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi regarding  bulletproof vehicles provided by the federal government, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Wednesday that the vehicles in question would be sent to Balochistan instead.
On Monday, Afridi had blamed the “flawed policy” of the federal government for the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province. He further claimed that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other constitutional rights”. He had also alleged that the bulletproof cars provided by Naqvi were “defective and old”, adding that they should be recalled.
Late on Tuesday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had commented on the claims and said that like KP, his province was also affected by terrorism.
“It is an appeal to the interior minister that if the KP government is refusing to take the bulletproof vehicles, they should be transferred to the Balochistan government so that terrorism can be countered effectively,” he said in a post on social media platform X.
 






Today, Naqvi responded to Bugti’s post and said: “CM sahib, done. These bulletproof vehicles will be sent to Balochistan immediately to enhance counter-terrorism efforts. Thank you for raising this.”
 






On Tuesday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had criticised the new KP chief minister, expressing disappointment that the “fight against terrorism and sacrifices made by soldiers were being overshadowed by politics”. He alleged that the PTI-led provincial government was choosing not to fight the war against terrorism “so they could use it to blackmail the government”.
Responding to Afridi’s comment on the vehicles, the minister said that it was “unfortunate that CM Afridi was returning necessary equipment to make the Centre look weak for political point scoring”.
“If you did not like the bulletproof cars, then maybe give your own instead,” he said, adding that the KP government was “not fighting a war but only wasting time and creating unnecessary drama”.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.</p><small>2025-10-22 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22122327b2289b8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950551/pakistan-navy-ship-seizes-drugs-worth-nearly-1bn-in-arabian-sea' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Navy ship seizes drugs worth nearly $1bn in Arabian Sea</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Navy ship Yarmook seized narcotics worth more than $972 million from sailboats in the Arabian Sea, according to a statement issued on Wednesday from the naval network overseeing the operation.
The Combined Maritime Force (CMF), a naval partnership that includes the United States, said the Pakistani naval vessel intercepted two different dhow sailing boats within 48 hours last week. It was working in “direct support of Saudi-led Combined Task Force (CTF) 150” of the CMF during focused operation Al Masmak, which began on October 16.
“The crew boarded the first dhow and seized over two tons of crystal methamphetamine with an estimated street value of $822,400,000 [on] October 18. Less than 48 hours later, the crew boarded a second dhow and seized 350 kilogrammes of [crystal meth] worth $140,000,000 and 50kg of cocaine worth $10,000,000,” the CMF statement said.
The narcotics were transported back to the ship for testing to confirm the contents and subsequently disposed of, the statement added.
The intercepted vessels were “identified as having no nationality”, it said without indicating where they had originated.
It was “one of the most successful narcotics seizures for CMF,” Royal Saudi Naval Forces Commodore Fahad Aljoiad, commander of the CMF taskforce carrying out the operation, was quoted as saying.
“The success of this focused operation highlights the importance of the multi-national collaboration,” he further stated.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Navy said in a statement that the achievement highlighted its “unwavering commitment to regional maritime security, global peace, and the collective fight against illicit trafficking at sea”.
It further said that the successful operation reaffirmed Pakistan’s “active role as a responsible maritime partner contributing to peace and security in the wider Indian Ocean region”.
The statement further said that Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf commended the crew for their professionalism and dedication.
“He emphasised that Pakistan Navy remains steadfast in its mission to safeguard national maritime interests while contributing to the global commons through cooperation and coordinated maritime security efforts,” it quoted him as syaing.
“The naval chief underscored that PNS Yarmook’s operation under Saudi-led task force will further enhance the interoperability between the two navies and strengthen defence collaboration between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it added.
President Asif Ali Zardari said that the achievement reflected “national pride, professional excellence, and Pakistan Navy’s unwavering commitment to regional peace and maritime security”.
 






The US Central Command in a post on X congratulated the CMF, which includes 47 countries’ navies and patrols more than three million square miles of sea, including some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, to disrupt the smuggling of drugs and weapons.
 






The commissioning ceremony for Pakistan Navy Ship (PNS) Yarmook was held in Romania in February 2020 and it was inducted into the Pakistan Navy fleet in December 2020.
PNS Yarmook is an electronic warfare, anti-ship and anti-air platform with cutting edge self-protection and terminal defence systems. The ship is capable of performing a variety of maritime operations and unmanned aerial vehicle operations simultaneously.
In March last year, the vessel was employed in a rescue operation after a distress call from a boat, carrying eight Iranian fishermen, that had caught fire.
In July 2024, it was also deployed in the Indian Ocean with an embarked helicopter for the safety and security of merchant ships bound to and coming from the country’s ports.</p><small>2025-10-22 09:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629906-pakistani-student-delegation-visits-key-institutions-in-ankara' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani student delegation visits key institutions in Ankara</strong></a><br><p>

This is the fourth time that the court has issued an arrest warrant for Aleema in the case.
November 26 protests, as they famously came to be known as, saw more than 10,000 PTI protesters surge into Islamabad, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. A day of clashes between security forces and protesters in the city’s Red Zone had ended in the PTI leadership’s hasty retreat, with the party announcing that it was calling off its planned protest sit-in “for the time being”.
Subsequently, cases were registered against several PTI leaders under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Two of these cases were registered at the Taxila police station and one each at the Sadiqabad and Naseerabad police stations.
Proceedings for the case registered at the Sadiqabad police station were held at the ATC in Rawalpindi today, where 10 of the 11 suspects appeared before the court. Subsequently, the ATC again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema over her failure to appear before the court.
The court also issued a show-cause notice to Superintendent of Police (Rawal Division) Saad Arshad and Deputy Superintendent of Police Naeem for filing a “bogus report”. Moreover, the court summoned them in their personal capacities over “contempt of court”.
The court remarked that the officials had said in the report that Aleema had gone into hiding. But, she was seen at the Adiala jail and also on social media channels, the court observed.
During the last hearing, the court had directed SP Saad to arrest and produce Aleema before the court on Oct 22 (today). It had also ordered the confiscation of her surety bond and the verification of property documents submitted by her guarantor.
At today’s hearing, her guarantor’s surety bonds were confiscated and Aleema was directed to submit new surety bonds worth Rs1 million.
Moreover, the surety bonds of the guarantors of four vehicles linked to the case, which had been acquired from the ATC, were also confiscated. The case has been adjourned till November 24.
Previous proceedings
Today was not the first time when the court issued arrest warrants for Aleema in the case over her non-appearance.
ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her over her continued absence from the proceedings during the last hearing on Oct 20 as well.
Prior to that, the court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her during the hearing on Oct 14, noting that she had failed to appear twice before the court. It had also directed Sadiqabad police to arrest and produce her before the court by Oct 15.
The court had also rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that she was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the Nov 26 protest.
The ATC had also issued a bailable arrest warrant for Aleem on Oct 8. Aleema was to be indicted during that hearing but didn’t appear before the court.</p><small>2025-10-22 07:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629886-atc-again-issues-non-bailable-warrant-for-aleema-khan-in-ptis-nov-26-prote' target='_blank'><strong>ATC again issues non-bailable warrant for Aleema Khan in PTI's Nov 26 protest case</strong></a><br><p>

The US president has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May. India has denied the claim that the US president was responsible for brokering the ceasefire via trade threats. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has praised Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping the two neighbours achieve peace in the region.
Participating in a Diwali celebration at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said he had a “great conversation” with Indian PM Modi over the phone.
“We talked about trade — we talked about a lot of things, but mostly the world of trade, he’s very interested in that. Although we did talk a little while ago about let’s have no wars with Pakistan,” he said.
“I think the fact that trade was involved, I was able to talk about that — and we have no war with Pakistan and India and that was a very, very good thing,” he said. Trump also called Modi a “great person”, saying that he had become a great friend of his over the years.
 


The US president also stated that Modi was keen to see the end of the Russia-Ukraine war.
“We just have a very good relationship,” he said while talking about Modi. “And he’s not gonna buy much oil from Russia; he wants to see that war end as much as I do — he wants to see the war end between Russia and Ukraine … so they’ve cut it way back and they’re continuing to cut it way back.”
Trump also lauded the US’ success in “forging peace all over the world”.
“We’re putting America first; we’re getting everybody to sort of get along,” he said, highlighting the US role in securing “total peace” in the Middle East.
“Nobody thought we’d ever see that happening,” he said. “We have levels of friendship with everybody … countries that hated each other now love each other,” he said.
Meanwhile, Modi thanked the US president for his phone call and Diwali greetings.
“On this festival of lights, may our two great democracies continue to illuminate the world with hope and stand united against terrorism in all its forms,” he said on social media platform X.
 






Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” which targeted sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties.
India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory operation called “Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Month later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.</p><small>2025-10-22 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629877-operation-al-masmak-pakistan-navy-seizes-drugs-worth-nearly-1bn-in-arabian-sea' target='_blank'><strong>'Op Al Masmak': Pakistan Navy seizes drugs worth nearly $1bn in Arabian Sea</strong></a><br><p>

It was the first launch of ballistic missiles since May by Pyongyang, which has defied a United Nations Security Council ban on the weapons.
It was also the first such launch since Lee Jae Myung was elected president in South Korea, with a platform of engagement with North Korea.
Lee and United States President Donald Trump are expected to meet in South Korea next week at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Trump is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping.
South Korea detected several projectiles believed to be short-range ballistic missiles fired from an area near North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, in a northeasterly direction early on Wednesday, its Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
Trump to visit South Korea
Lee and Trump have discussed the idea of trying to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when the American president visits the South, but Pyongyang has not publicly responded to the idea.
US officials considered, but never confirmed, a trip to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
 
 

South Korea has suspended tours of the Joint Security Area (JSA) at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom until early November, but has not confirmed any plans for a meeting with Kim.
Trump and Kim held three summits during Trump’s 2017 to 2021 first term and exchanged a number of letters that Trump called “beautiful“, before the unprecedented diplomatic effort broke down over US demands that Kim give up his nuclear weapons.
In September, Kim expressed “fond memories” of Trump saying there was no reason to avoid talks with the US if Washington stopped insisting his country give up nuclear weapons, but he would never abandon the nuclear arsenal to end sanctions.
 
 

“It is not at all inconceivable that Donald Trump could here in Washington, DC, say ‘Denuclearisation, that’s our goal, that’s our policy’ and then go up to Panmunjom and say, ‘Oh, you know, Kim Jong Un is a nuclear power’,” said Victor Cha, with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.
“Even if it’s a short meeting, in the broader scheme of things, with all that the United States has to deal with these days, it wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing.”
Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said while a Trump-Kim meeting was not impossible, the US president’s known schedule and timing might make it unlikely.
“Trump’s only there for one night, two days, and because of the Xi-Trump meeting, that’s probably taking up all the bandwidth or resources of the US government,” he said.
Multiple missiles launched
Nuclear-armed North Korea has steadily upgraded its missile capabilities over the past decade, defying multiple United Nations sanctions, having test-launched long-range ballistic missiles with potential ranges to strike the US mainland if fired at a trajectory calibrated for that purpose.
South Korea’s military said it had detected movements ahead of the launch, then tracked the projectiles after they were fired and flew about 350 km (217 miles), the military said.
 
 

The missiles appeared to have fallen inland, a military official separately said.
Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said there was no impact on Japan’s security from the North Korean missile launch and Tokyo was sharing real-time information with the US.
North Korea last launched ballistic missiles on May 8 when it fired multiple short-range missiles from its east coast.
North Korea showcased its latest intercontinental ballistic missile this month at a parade attended by the Chinese premier.</p><small>2025-10-22 06:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629866-no-plans-to-open-overseas-campus-imperial-college-london-rejects-punjabs-govts-claim' target='_blank'><strong>'No plans to open overseas campus': Imperial College London rejects Punjab's govt's claim</strong></a><br><p>

Lahore was ranked the second most-polluted city in the world on Tuesday with its Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching 218, after Delhi, India, that topped the list with its AQI at 247, while Kolkata, India, standing third with 209 AQI.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, who also heads the environment department, has stated that comprehensive measures are being taken across the province to combat smog and protect public health.
She says that wearing face masks has been declared mandatory for the traffic police officers and “Suthra Punjab” field teams.

Lahore ranked second most-polluted city in the world

Senior traffic police officers have been directed to strictly enforce the direction among their subordinates, who are constantly exposed to vehicular emissions and air pollution.
Similarly, all “Suthra Punjab” field workers have been instructed to wear masks during their duty hours to safeguard their health against the harmful effects of smog.
The government says that due to the Diwali fireworks and large-scale stubble burning in Indian Punjab, air pollution levels in Lahore and Kasur have risen to dangerous levels.
According to Punjab environment department, polluted winds moving at a speed of five kilometre per hour are blowing from Indian cities, including Amritsar, Ferozepur, Patiala, Gurdaspur, Sangrur, Bathinda, Moga, Barnala, Mansa and Faridkot into Lahore and other parts of Pakistan.
Approximately, rice crop cultivated over three million hectares is harvested in Indian Punjab during September and October, followed by widespread stubble burning.
According to the Punjab Pollution Control Board (India), 663 villages have been identified as major stubble-burning hot spots, significantly contributing to cross-border pollution.
Anti-smog operations are underway in Lahore and other major cities. The Lahore Development Authority (LDA), the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA), the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) and the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) are jointly engaged in water sprinkling on city roads to reduce dust and pollutants in the air.
The recently-introduced ‘anti-smog guns’ are also operating in the highly-polluted city areas, while construction sites are being regularly sprayed with water to check dust.
As per environment department, 24-hour monitoring is being carried out to check emissions from brick kilns, industries and vehicles. At Lahore’s entry points, vehicle inspections and monitoring have also been increased.
Punjab’s first modern ‘Smog Monitoring and Control Centre’ is now fully operational, collecting real-time data from across the province to enable immediate action, the department says.
According to the centre, wind speeds between 3 and 6km/h will gradually help reduce pollution levels.
As per the centre, on Wednesday (today) Lahore’s average AQI is expected to remain between 210 and 240. Winds from Indian cities including Dharamshala, Ludhiana, Haryana, and Sri Ganganagar are likely to affect the air quality of Gujranwala, Lahore, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, Burewala, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Multan, it adds.
The Punjab government has advised people to wear masks during smog conditions, avoid unnecessary travel and limit outdoor exposure for children, elderly individuals and respiratory patients. Residents are also encouraged to increase indoor and outdoor greenery to help absorb pollutants.
Ms Aurangzeb says that Punjab government’s machinery is fully mobilised to mitigate smog and protect public health. “We are taking every possible step to safeguard our people from the harmful effects of smog,” she emphasises.

• Evades question about ban on TLP, says action against those carrying weapons is ‘non-negotiable’
KARACHI: In a strong message, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi made it clear on Tuesday that the federal government would take decisive action against any armed group operating in the country, regardless of its location or affiliation.
He also issued a firm rebuttal to the growing perception on social media, clarifying that the federal government was not targeting any specific religious sect.
The interior minister held a meeting with leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan at the Sindh Governor House.
Governor Kamran Khan  Tessori, MQM-P Chairman Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and senior leaders Dr Farooq Sattar and Aminul Haque lauded Mr Naqvi’s recent role in handling the law and order  situation and in upholding the writ of the state across the four  provinces.
Later, accompanied by the MQM-P leaders the interior minister told reporters at the Governor House that the ongoing actions were solely against armed groups, not peaceful religious communities.
“No one carrying weapons or operating in the form of armed jathas [groups] will be allowed to function under any circumstances,” he said when asked about the possibility of a ban on Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), without directly addressing the question. “Wherever an armed group is found — in any province — there will be action. That is non-negotiable.”
Mr Naqvi expressed “immense respect” for religious leaders, scholars and clerics, emphasising that the government’s actions were not aimed at any particular sect or group but only at those challenging the writ of the state.
“There was a perception being built on social media that the federal government is targeting a particular religious sect,” he said. “Such claims are completely false. We respect all our ulema, and this government has always stood by them. Pakistan was founded in the name of Islam, and our support for religious scholars and clerics remains firm. But anyone who comes armed will, under no circumstances, be allowed to operate.”
Naqvi meets religious scholars, clerics to address reservations
Before arriving at the Governor’s House, Mr Naqvi, accompanied by Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon and Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, met prominent scholars and clerics at the residence of Mufti Muneebur Rehman.
Both sides agreed to convene a comprehensive meeting in Islamabad in the coming days to address key concerns raised by religious leaders. The scholars and clerics were assured that all legitimate and genuine issues presented by them would be addressed on a priority basis. A statement issued after the meeting said that a detailed discussion took place regarding “recent developments”, and the scholars expressed their viewpoints on various issues.
Mr Naqvi reiterated that the government remained committed to non-interference in the affairs of religious seminaries (madaris) and mosques.
 






“The government will not interfere in the affairs of madaris and mosques,” the statement quoted him as saying.
To ensure continued engagement, it was also agreed that a dedicated focal person would be appointed to maintain constant communication and coordination between the government and religious leadership, the statement added.
Other participants of the meeting included Allama Syed Muzaffar Shah, Mufti Abid Mubarak, Allama Liaqat Hussain Azhari, Allama Rehan Azhar Naumani, Mufti Rafiur Rehman Noorani, Allama Ashraf Gormani and Allama Ahmed Rabbani.

The move was announced by former speaker Asad Qaiser, Chief Whip Malik Amir Dogar, Prince Nawaz Khan Allai and Shahram Tarakai at a joint press conference.
Mr Qaiser said the post has been vacant since the disqualification of Omar Ayub Khan and expressed hope the speaker would issue the notification “without delay” upon his return to the country.
“Mehmood Khan Achak­zai is a senior and respected politician. We expect that no undemocratic means will be used in this process. The opposition leader’s seat should not remain vacant,” Mr Qaiser said.

PTI hints at ‘small cabinet’ in KP as CM-Imran meeting remains pending

Mr Dogar said the nomination carried the signatures of 74 MNAs. “Meh­mood Khan Achakzai’s name carries significance for the survival and stability of democracy. The decision reflects our leadership’s consensus, and all members have endorsed it,” he said, adding that Mr Achakzai also remains PTI’s presidential nominee.
Commenting on Pakistan-Afghanistan ties, Mr Qaiser said both countries should exercise patience and reopen trade routes, including onward access to Central Asia.
He also criticised the federal government for providing “non-functional” vehicles to the Khyber Pakhtun­khwa police.
“Even a federal minister acknowledged this issue, but I do not wish to name him,” he added.
He also lamented that the province had yet to rec­eive its three per cent share of the national divisible pool under the NFC Award.
Small cabinet in KP
Separately, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said the party may form a small cabinet in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa if the chief minister is not permitted to meet the PTI founder.
Speaking to reporters outside Adiala Jail, he said a full cabinet would be announced after a meeting between the chief minister and Imran Khan.
Replying to a question, he said that Afghan refugees should be repatriated with dignity.

• Notices issued to Islamabad and Punjab officials, jail administration
ISLAMABAD: To resolve controversies surrounding visitation to incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan at Adiala Jail, a larger bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) will take up all 11 petitions filed by PTI leaders — including one by newly elected Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi — on Thursday (tomorrow).
The IHC registrar’s office has issued notices to the advocates general of Islamabad and Punjab, the Punjab prosecutor general, the Punjab inspector general of police, and the inspector general of prisons. The court has also summoned the Women Medical Officer and Superintendent of Adiala Jail for the same date.
The bench is expected to address not only the issues surrounding visitation rights for the PTI founder but also the question of jurisdiction over Adiala Jail — a longstanding point of contention between the Islamabad and Punjab administrations.
 
 

On Monday, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir of the IHC overruled objections raised by the registrar’s office on Chief Minister Afridi’s petition seeking permission to meet Imran Khan in jail. Advocate Ali Bukhari appeared on behalf of the petitioner, while the plea was filed through Advocate General Shah Faisal.
The petition requested the court’s intervention to allow a meeting between the provincial chief executive and the PTI founder to discuss governance matters and cabinet formation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The registrar’s office had earlier objected, noting that similar petitions had already been decided and that a prescribed procedure existed for such visits. However, Advocate Bukhari argued that “fresh legal grounds” existed, since the cabinet had not yet been constituted and consultation with Mr Khan was essential for administrative functioning.
Justice Tahir, after hearing the arguments, dismissed the objections and issued notices to the interior secretary, inspector general of police, and Superintendent Adiala Jail, directing them to submit their replies by October 23.
Earlier, on March 25, a three-judge larger bench of the IHC — comprising Acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfaraz Dogar, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan — had reinstated the twice-a-week visitation schedule for Imran Khan, while barring visitors from issuing media statements after meetings.
The bench had ruled that only individuals approved by Mr Khan’s coordinator, Salman Akram Raja, could meet him on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and advised the PTI founder to approach the trial court for permission to speak to his children via telephone.
The IHC administration has now fixed the matter before the same bench to consolidate and hear all petitions concerning Mr Khan’s visitation rights and jail conditions.

• Lack of decision on Tomahawks makes Russia less keen on diplomacy, says Zelensky
• European leaders call on Washington to hold firm in demanding immediate ceasefire in Ukraine
WASHINGTON/KYIV: A planned summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin was put on hold on Tuesday, as Moscow’s rejection of an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine cast a cloud over attempts at negotiations.
Trump has no immediate plans to meet Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, a US official said on Tuesday, days after the American president said they would meet within two weeks in Budapest.
Trump had announced last week that he and Putin would meet soon in Hungary to try to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. But Putin has been unwilling to consider concessions. Moscow has long demanded that Ukraine agree to cede more territory before any ceasefire.
Trump, who last week spoke by pho­­ne to Putin and met Ukrainian Presi­dent Volodymyr Zelensky, had hoped for another high-profile session with the Russian leader after their August summit in Alaska failed to advance negotiations.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke by telephone on Monday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, after Trump said that the two top diplomats would be meeting this week to arrange a Budapest summit.
“An additional in-person meeting between the secretary and foreign minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future,” a Trump administration official said on condition of anonymity. The official nonetheless termed the call between Rubio and Lavrov “productive”.
‘No clear date’
The Kremlin said there was no clear date and that “serious preparation” for a summit was needed and that may take time. “Listen, we have an understanding of the presidents, but we cannot postpone what has not been finalised,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
“Neither President Trump nor Pre­sident Putin gave exact dates.” Asked if Moscow had an understanding of a possible date for the summit, Peskov said: “No, there is no understanding.”
Putin spoke by telephone on Thursday with Trump, who met the following day with the Ukrainian president to discuss providing US-made Tomahawk missiles that could penetrate deep into Russia.
Trump hailed the call as progress and quickly posted on social media that he would meet within two weeks with Putin in Budapest.
It marked the latest abrupt shift by Trump, who in August welcomed Put­in to Alaska — his first time on Wes­tern soil since he ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
‘Lack of decision on Tomahawks’
The Ukrainian president, in his ni­­ghtly address, said Russia “almost au­­tomatically became less interested in diplomacy” due to the postponement of a decision by the US administration on Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine.
Zelensky said he and  had agreed that a starting point for talks would be with the two sides at their current positions on the battlefield.
“Instead, Russia is once again doing everything it can to abandon diplomacy,” Zelensky said.
“The greater the Ukrainian long-range capability, the greater the Russian willingness to end the war. These past few weeks have confirmed this once again,” Zelensky said.
The Tomahawks, he said, had become “a strong investment in diplomacy” and Ukraine would hold further discussions on long-range weapons with its European and US allies.
European leaders called on Washington on Tuesday to hold firm in demanding an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, with present battle lines to serve as the basis for any future talks.
In a statement, the leaders of Bri­tain, France, Germany and the EU said they “strongly support Presi­d­e­nt’s position that the fighting should stop immediately, and that the curre­­nt line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations”.

The prime minister said the initiative, to be known as INSPIRE, was “a milestone in Pakistan’s transition to a knowledge-based digital economy” and signalled its entry into the $600 billion global semiconductor ecosystem.
Under the programme, 7,200 professionals would be trained in semiconductor design and research.
Shehbaz Sharif kicked off the “initiative to nurture semiconductor professionals for industry, research & education” (INSPIRE) to mark Pakistan’s transformative step toward technological self-reliance and global competitiveness.

PM unveils ‘INSPIRE’ to train 7,200 professionals, aiming for a share in the $600bn global market

In his address, the prime minister said the launch of INSPIRE was a milestone in the country’s transition toward a knowledge-based digital economy, where innovation, research, and human capital drive sustainable growth. “Our vision is to prepare Pakistan’s youth for the industries of tomorrow… Through this initiative, we are building the foundations of a new economic frontier — one where Pakistan contributes talent, technology, and innovation to the world,” he remarked.
Assuring stakeholders of the government’s full support for this programme, the prime minister directed the execution of work at a fast pace to achieve targets.
“The planning ministry, under its Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), had allocated Rs 4.5 billion for this programme, which is just a drop in the ocean,” he said.  “Funding is no issue for this programme.”
Cashless economy
The prime minister said the government had undertaken a plan for digitisation and established the Pakistan Digital Authority as a first step.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is being completely digitised. “The government is also working to usher in a cashless economy,” Shehbaz Sharif said.
He praised the IT ministry and the PSEB for their efforts to develop a skilled workforce aligned with global industry demands. The prime minister also acknowledged the Special Investment Facilitation Council’s (SIFC) role in enabling strong public-private collaboration and facilitating investments that underpin national technology initiatives.
In her remarks, Minister for IT and Telecommunications Shaza Fatima Khawaja reaffirmed the government’s commitment to developing a digitally empowered Pakistan.
Dr Naveed Sherwani, chairman of the National Semiconductor Task Force, briefed the audience on the strategic roadmap and underlined Pakistan’s opportunity to build a world-class semiconductor ecosystem.
Abu Bakar of PSEB said it was a matter of pride to have executed the semiconductor programme, which will train thousands of professionals and link academia, research, and industry to develop a sustainable national semiconductor ecosystem.
Training and research
INSPIRE aims to train 7,200 professionals over five years in semiconductor design, verification, and research. It will be engaging nine public-sector universities across Pakistan’s northern, central, and southern regions and establishing six integrated circuit (IC) labs.
As the first phase of the country’s broader National Semiconductor Develop­ment Roadmap, INSPIRE will lay the foundation for Outsourced Assembly & Testing (OSAT) and fabrication capabilities, enabling Pakistan to take part in the global semiconductor supply chain.
With the launch of INSPIRE, Pakistan has entered a new chapter of digital transformation — one defined by innovation, opportunity, and resilience.
The initiative embodies a national vision to harness youth potential, strengthen international partnerships, and position Pakistan as a credible contributor to the trillion-dollar global semiconductor industry.
Restructuring Smeda
Earlier, PM Shehbaz presided over a meeting on a restructuring plan for the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority.  He directed the authorities concerned to encourage the registration of small and medium enterprises to enable them to avail of business loans and stimulate industrial growth.
He said the country’s industrial growth was linked with the development of cottage SMEs. He expressed satisfaction over the efforts made by the Ministry of Industries and Production for Smeda’s restructuring.

The increase in deficit is mainly the outcome of a decline in Pakistan’s overall exports to regional countries, except China, where Pakistan’s exports showed signs of recovery in the first three months of the current fiscal year.
A marginal increase was also recorded in exports to Sri Lanka, while shipments to Bangladesh and Afghanis­tan registered negative growth during the period under review, according to the latest data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
In FY25, Pakistan’s trade deficit with nine neighbouring countries expanded by 29.42pc to $12.297bn compared to $9.502bn recorded during the same period last year.

Gap widens to $3.93bn in July-September

Indeed, verbal attacks from both sides had stopped after a couple of meetings held at the PM Office, and the PPP’s subsequent CEC meeting over the weekend, where the party decided to adopt a wait-and-see approach on whether its demands would be catered to.
The PPP, which had earlier raised reservations over Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s unwillingness to providing relief to flood victims through BISP, seems to have been convinced to some extent that the programme she has announced will be adequate enough to help those who are in need.
Although PM Shehbaz Sharif had agreed to try and prevail upon the provincial government to accede to the PPP’s demand in toto, he was assured by CM Maryam in a subsequent meeting that the comprehensive provincial package for flood rehabilitation package would be adequate for the purpose. The premier, thereafter, seemed content that if things work out as planned, there would be no need to activate BISP in Punjab for this purpose.
Talking to Dawn, senior PPP leader Syed Nayyar Hussain Bokhari, who was present in the meeting between the Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari-led delegation and PM Shehbaz, said that if the provincial government was providing a comprehensive rehabilitation package to the people, his party will have “no objections”.
However, he wondered why the Punjab government had refused to provide funds through the BISP, when it had taken a share from the loans that the federal government received from donors and international lenders.
When contacted, Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who had also attended the PM-Bilawal meeting, told Dawn that the premier had made a promise to Mr Bhutto-Zardari regarding assistance to flood victims in Punjab.
However, he added that on the very next day, another important meeting was held at PM House, which was attended by the chief ministers of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan.
“In that meeting, the Punjab CM assured the PM that she was going to launch a major programme for flood victims in the province and after that there will be no need to get additional funds from the BISP,” he elaborated.
“Following this, the premier was convinced that if Punjab is providing adequate funds from its own kitty, then why should the federal government, which has limited funds, spend its money for the same cause.”
Another senior PPP leader, who did not wish to be named, said his party had no objection if the BISP was not being used for flood programmes in Punjab, provided that the rehabilitation package recently launched by CM Maryam would fully compensate the flood-hit people, especially farmers.
The leader said the recent protests by the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Paki­stan was one of the reasons that the party had stopped its confrontation with the PML-N as the country was passing through a critical situation in which all ruling allies needed to stand together to foil any attempt to disrupt peace in the country.

On Oct 8, the ECP ordered LG polls in December and asked Punjab to immediately start the delimitation exercise and complete the same within two months.
“Thereafter, the election programme should be announced, and the election should be held in the last week of December 2025. The office is expected to follow the timelines strictly,” the Oct 8 order said.
This order, however, was reversed in a meeting chaired by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja on Tuesday, in light of the new law, after a request by the Punjab government.

Commission asks province to finalise delimitation rules in four weeks after new law; warns of ‘appropriate decision’ in case of delay

During the meeting, the ECP secretary said that the Punjab Assembly had passed the Punjab Local Government Act 2025, which has also been approved by the governor.
“With the passage of the new act, the Punjab Local Government Act 2022 has been repealed, and the notifications issued under the 2022 Act regarding delimitations should be withdrawn,” the ECP said in a statement, while halting the delimitation exercise and dropping the plan to hold LG polls in the province this year. The ECP said no further extension will be granted, saying if the task was not completed within the given timeframe, the matter would be reviewed at a hearing and an appropriate decision would be made.
Observers believed the fresh decision could lead to an indefinite delay in the polls, given there were no “constitutional compulsions” to establish the local government systems.
Muddassir Rizvi of Fafen believed that the local governments are “clearly not a priority of the Punjab government, nor is there any constitutional compulsion” to ensure their perpetuity.
“Article 140-A only binds the government to establish local governments but it doesn’t have any provision for the perpetuity of these governments, periodicity of elections, tenure of governments, tier of decentralisation, subjects that must be decentralised, etc,” he said.
In 2019, the then PTI-led Punjab government dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the SC and subsequently completed their term on Dec 31, 2021. That means the elections were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022.  Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold polls  within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions.
PTI parliamentary leader in the Senate, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, criticised the ECP for failing in “discharging its constitutional responsibility by postponing the local bodies’ elections on the flimsy pretext that it requires more time to make adjustments following amendments made by the Punjab government”.

• Expects ban on party to be enforced ‘within a few days’
• ‘Due diligence under way’ on Punjab’s summary, says Talal

• Khawaja Asif calls for ‘hard state’ approach to curb extremism
LAHORE: Individuals providing “financial or political support” to Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) will face terrorism charges, the Punjab government warned on Tuesday, as it pressed the federal government to proscribe the group.
“Some 3,800 TLP financiers have been identified. Their funding sources have been blocked and legal action will be initiated against them under anti-terrorism laws,” Punjab Information and Culture Minister Azma Bokhari told a press conference in Lahore on Tuesday.
She said the Punjab cabinet had forwarded a summary to the federal government seeking a ban on the TLP and expected a decision soon. “We expect the ban on TLP to be enforced within a few days,” she added.
The minister expressed regret that riots and unrest were being justified in the name of Islam and Palestine, terming it not only misleading but also a “distortion of religious sanctity”. She said false propaganda about dead bodies was carried out during TLP protests to garner public sympathy and create chaos.
Responding to rumours about the relocation of TLP founder Khadim Hussain Rizvi’s grave, the minister called it “propaganda”, but warned against using religious sites to solicit donations or fuel violence. She also clarified that no mosque was being demolished.
Ms Bokhari further claimed that 1.92 kilograms of gold were recovered from TLP head Saad Rizvi’s house, along with 898 grams of silver, 68 rare watches and other valuables. Besides, Saad Rizvi purchased properties under benami (anonymous) ownership and turned certain areas into no-go zones, the minister alleged.
She said the management of TLP-linked mosques and madressahs had been placed under the Auqaf Department. “This is not an action against any sect or group but against extremist ideology. A total of 130 TLP mosques have been taken into government control and 223 seminaries have been geo-tagged,” she added.
She asked parents to keep their children away from TLP’s activities and warned that terrorism charges could be filed against them as well.
“Any student involved in such activities will not be granted admission or any facilities within the country,” she said, stressing that those who took the law into their hands, responsible for the killing of an SHO and injuring 110 policemen and 148 civilians, would face terrorism cases. Ms Bokhari said Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas were being traced and would be arrested soon, adding that 95 bank accounts linked to Mr Rizvi had been frozen. “We do not want pressure groups to emerge in the country,” she said.
‘Due diligence under way’
Separately, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Tuesday the government was considering a ban on TLP, confirming that the interior ministry is reviewing a reference sent by the Punjab government.
“Due diligence is under way and a final decision is yet to be taken,” he told a press conference.
Questioning the motives behind recent TLP protests, Mr Chaudhry noted the group announced a march in support of Palestine, “but none of their demands related to Palestine”. He said investigators had identified around 100 bank accounts linked to the organisation.
Accusing the TLP of double standards, he said the party publicly denounced usury while earning returns on donations deposited in these accounts. “They advise people not to use the banking system, calling it anti-Sharia, yet they themselves receive interest from the same system,” he remarked. Mr Chaudhry added that the TLP had sought a blanket boycott and ban on Israeli products, but said 69 foreign-brand watches were recovered from the residence of the group’s chief and were of “the same brands they urge others to shun”.
Warning that such “negative politics” would not be tolerated, the minister said the state had decided that extremist politics and ideology would not be allowed to take root in Pakistan. “All state institutions stand behind this decision like an iron wall,” he said.
‘Hard state’ needed
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, speaking to Geo News, said Pakistan must act as a “hard state” to curb extremism, calling groups that resort to violence “unacceptable”.
His remarks followed Punjab’s request to the Centre to ban the TLP after deadly demonstrations. However, he declined to confirm whether a formal ban was imminent, but said the state would now function strictly under the law and the Constitution.
Acknowledging decades of patronage for such groups, he added: “Everyone knows who created them and for what purpose.” Mr Asif claimed that he was unaware of any JUI-F plan to march on Islamabad, describing Maulana Fazlur Rehman as “highly respectable” and declining further comment.
However, Talal Chaudhry earlier said the government would make arrangements for any JUI-F mobilisation, stressing that Maulana Fazlur Rehman was a political and religious figure whose input the government respected.
“The government will continue efforts to bring the Maulana on board and will not allow him to be alienated,” he stressed.
The JUI-F chief, once a close ally of the PML-N and PPP, has since become a vocal critic of the coalition and rejected the post-election set-up because of alleged irregularities.
According to media reports, the JUI-F chief last week directed his party workers to prepare for a march towards Islamabad.
The announcement came during his address at the Mufti Mehmood Conference held in Dera Ismail Khan, where he delivered a strongly-worded speech expressing concern over the prevailing political situation.

Fatima Sana’s side crashed out of the ICC Women’s World Cup on Tuesday after a crushing 150-run defeat (DLS method) to South Africa in their penultimate match of the league stage at the R. Premadasa Stadium.
Pakistan needed a victory to have any chance of staying alive in the last-four race and already-qualified South Africa, but chasing a target that was revised with every downpour, they stood little chance after the Proteas amassed 312-9 in 40 overs.
 






Speaking after the match, skipper Fatima said: “I think today is the day bowlers didn’t perform well. We have to accept it. They played very well, but we needed to be calmer in those situations.
“I think after the second over, and after the rain, it was a different situation because the conditions and the ball were wet.”
The pacer added that the bowlers tried to find rhythm, but it was very difficult to bowl in those conditions.
The first shower, which had brought upon a two-hour delay, had seen a reduction of 10 overs for each side. By the time Pakistan came out for a third time to bat, their target according to the DLS method was 234 in 20 overs.
Pakistan were already up against the wall at that point, struggling at 60-4 after 14 overs. They eventually finished at 83-7.
South Africa had been put into bat and after the early loss of opener Tazmin Brits for a duck, skipper Laura Wolvaardt led from the front for the Proteas — scoring 90 and combining with Sune Luus for a 118-run second wicket partnership.
Continuing after the break from 6-1 after two overs, the Pakistan bowlers were taken to all parts as South Africa reached their highest-ever score in the World Cup.
Fatima’s side had to rush to the dugout as soon as the match began, after having won the toss and elected to field, as the heavens opened up.
Moments before the players took cover, the Pakistan skipper continued her knack of getting early breakthroughs when she got the dangerous Brits to nick an away swinger to Natalia Parvaiz at first slip.
Once play resumed, the run-fest started for the Proteas, with the hundred coming up in just 14.2 overs.
After Wolvaardt and Luus departed for 90 and 61 respectively, Marizanne Kapp and the dangerous Nadine de Klerk stepped up to take the scoring rate even higher.
De Klerk continued her fine hitting form in the World Cup — smashing 41	of just 16 deliveries laced with three sixes to take South Africa past the 300-run mark.
 






Pakistan’s reply meandered along aimlessly as the rains made the situation even more ignominious with each passing shower.
Chasing a DLS adjusted 302 at the start of their chase, Pakistan opener Muneeba Ali fell early in just the second over to a returning Ayabonga Khaka.
Omaima Sohail was the next to follow when she fell lbw to Marizanne Kapp in a similar manner to her previous outing.
Kapp also got the scalps of veteran batters Sidra Amin and Aliya Riaz to end with figures of 3-20.
The wickets continued to tumble as the Green Shirts stumbled to 60-4 after 14 overs before rain interrupted play again.
Wicket-keeper Sidra Nawaz showed some resistance —ending 22 not out as Pakistan continued to lose wickets from the other end in a familiar fashion to end the innings at 83-7.
 
 

Rains in Colombo had seen Pakistan’s last two matches end in washouts against England and New Zealand, respectively, costing the team a chance to pick up more points in their last-four push. The Green Shirts will now face co-hosts Sri Lanka in their final group encounter on Saturday in a dead-rubber.
The washed-out New Zealand fixture on Saturday saw South Africa become the second team to qualify for the semi-finals of the tournament. Tuesday’s victory saw the Proteas go top of the table.</p><small>2025-10-21 18:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629820-53-magnitude-earthquake-shakes-islamabad-kp-ajk' target='_blank'><strong>5.3-magnitude earthquake shakes Islamabad, KP, AJK</strong></a><br><p>

Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, told reporters in Karachi on Tuesday that the ACC has informed the BCCI that a formal ceremony will be held in Dubai on December 10 to present India with the trophy.
Dawn.com understands that Naqvi, as ACC chief, is keen on handing over the trophy himself following the farcical scenes that followed after last month’s final between Pakistan and India.
Defending champions India edged Pakistan by five-wickets in a last-over thriller to win the Asia Cup title at the Dubai International Stadium last month.
However, the closing ceremony descended into farce as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi.
There were no customary handshakes before the match between the teams after India refused. Pakistan captain Sal­m­an Agha said India had “disrespected cricket”, whe­­­r­­eas his counterpart Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup, which has been overshadowed by ill-will on both sides.
A couple days after the incident, Naqvi posted on X saying: “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.
The Press Trust of India reported today that the cricket boards of Afghanistan and Sri Lanka backed BCCI’s correspondence to Naqvi.
“A top ACC source told PTI that Naqvi has insisted that a BCCI representative collect the trophy from him at the body’s headquarters in Dubai but the Indian board has rejected that stance,” PTI said.
“The BCCI will bring this matter up in an ICC meeting next month.”
According to the ACC source: “The BCCI secretary, BCCI’s ACC representative Rajeev Shukla and representatives of other member boards including Sri Lanka Cricket and Afghanistan had written to the ACC president last week over handing the trophy to India.”
The eight-nation Asia Cup remained under spotlight due to political strains between India and Pakistan, the nuclear-armed neighbours, who were competing in an international cricket event four months after a brief but intense military conflict in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgaam attack that killed 26 local tourists in the Indian-occupied Kashmir.
The tension between New Delhi and Islamabad spilled over into the cricketing field during the Sept 9-28 Asia Cup staged in the UAE when Indian cricketers refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts when the arch-rivals met in their group stage match in Dubai.
Suryakumar was widely criticised for politicising the Asia Cup when he mentioned Pahalgaam incident and Indian armed forces during his post-ma­tch talk and subsequent news conference.
The Pakistan camp, on their part, had avoided media interaction on the occasion of the India match. The tense situation remained the same, rather aggravated as on-field verbal skirmishes between some players took place, when the two sides met in the Super Four stage of the event.</p><small>2025-10-21 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629774-lg-polls-ecp-gives-punjab-govt-four-weeks-for-delimitations-under-new-act' target='_blank'><strong>LG polls: ECP gives Punjab govt four weeks for delimitations under new Act</strong></a><br><p>
