Malik and Justice Aqeel Abbasi, was released on Monday, highlighting divisions within the bench over last year’s dismissal of government appeals.
In June 2024, the Supreme Court of Pakistan declared Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) eligible for seats reserved for women and minorities, dealing a major setback to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s ruling coalition. The verdict was announced by a 13-member bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa.
Following the verdict, the PPP, PML-N and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) filed review petitions, which were later rejected. Justice Abbasi and Justice Malik then released a dissent.
The dissenting note stated that all three review petitions were filed against the brief verdict issued on July 9, 2024, and only the ECP submitted additional petitions based on the detailed verdict dated September 23, 2024.
“All arguments raised by the petitioners had already been addressed in the detailed verdict issued on September 23, 2024.“
The note asserted that all arguments were already addressed in the detailed verdict. It further added that lawyers attempted to reopen the case through fresh arguments; however, the scope of review is limited and a new case can not be initiated.
“Through these reviews, lawyers merely attempted to re-argue the case, which is outside the scope of a review jurisdiction.”
It stated that only those judgments are subject to review where a clear legal error exists and minor irregularities or differences of opinion cannot be grounds for review.
The dissenting note further stated that the judgments of the apex court are final and delivered after thorough consideration and also emphasised that a review is not like an appeal and can’t become routine procedure.
“Turning reviews into routine proceedings would disrupt the balance of the justice system.”
It elaborated that the coalition partners, the PML-N and the PPP did not raise any specific objections to the detailed decision, and both parties only challenged the short order. The petitions were filed on July 13, 2024, whereas the detailed verdict came out on September 23, 2024, the note highlighted.
“Despite the long gap between the short and detailed verdicts, no new legal arguments were presented.,“ concluded the dissenting note.
Reserved seats case
Through its March 25, 2024 order, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the party joined by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024, polls — of reserved seats.
In a 4-1 verdict, the electoral watchdog ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats, which is the requirement of law”.
The SIC — joined by PTI-backed independents who won the elections sans their electoral symbol — had filed the petition through its chairman, Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, seeking directives of the court for the ECP to allocate reserved seats to the council based on their strength in the national and provincial assemblies.
The commission had also decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the PML-N and the PPP becoming major beneficiaries. The decision was challenged by the PTI in the top court.
On July 13, the apex court, in a unique majority verdict, declared the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies, giving it a new lease of life in the legislature by declaring it to be a parliamentary party.
However, the ruling was not implemented by the National Assembly, while the ECP had raised some objections. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the PML-N, the PPP and the ECP.
On the date of the first hearing of this case, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had rejected outright the review petitions filed by the PML-N, ECP and PPP.
Subsequently, their names were excluded from the strength of the Constitutional Bench, even though they were considered part of the bench.
Meanwhile, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail had partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his original order of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats.
In his July 12 dissenting order, Justice Mandokhail had declared PTI a parliamentary party consisting of 39 members, and thus entitled to reserved seats. Therefore, the ECP should recalculate and reallocate the reserved seats amongst the political parties, including PTI, he held.
The July 12 majority judgement had asked the rest of the 41 independent candidates to file signed and notarised statements before the commission within 15 days — explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party. Consequently, the ECP had notified them as PTI members, in light of the judgment.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, who were part of the earlier majority judgement, also reviewed their positions and allowed the review petitions.
However, they posited that since the controversy at hand could not be resolved, either by the PHC or the Supreme Court, the ECP should examine and consider afresh the nomination papers/declaration and other relevant documents of all 80 returned candidates, with regard to their affiliation, and take a decision on the allocation of reserved seats within 15 days from receiving a copy of their short order.</p><small>2025-10-06 19:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/062235013093452.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947043/sindh-cabinet-approves-waiver-of-death-certificate-fee' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh cabinet approves waiver of death certificate fee</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh cabinet on Monday approved the waiver of the death certificate registration fee for the general public across the province at the municipal, union council and town committee levels.
The decision was taken in a provincial cabinet presided over by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah at the CM House.
A press release issued today said that under the new arrangement, the Sindh government will bear the cost of the National Database & Registration Authority service charges, ensuring that citizens can obtain death certificates free of cost.
“This step aims to facilitate citizens, promote digital registration of vital events under the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013, and strengthen the province’s CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistics) system,” the press release said.
It added that the decision followed the cabinet’s approval of free birth registration in September 2024 in line with the Sindh government’s commitment to the United Nations and international partners for improving CRVS coverage.
In other important measures, the cabinet also approved important amendments to the Sindh Letters of Administration and Succession Certificates Act and Rules, 2021, to streamline the issuance of inheritance documents, remove procedural gaps, especially for minor and mentally disabled heirs, and make the process more transparent and efficient.
“Major changes include deletion of the clause treating the presence of a minor as a legal controversy. Applications may be filed by heirs or their power of attorney with the required documents. Certificates for minor or mentally disabled heirs will take effect only after a guardianship certificate is issued under the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890. False declarations will be punishable under Section 198 of the Pakistan Penal Code,” the press release said.
CM Shah said the above reforms would make the system more “accessible, transparent, and people-friendly”, protecting the rights of all legal heirs.
Surrender policy for riverine bandits:  The provincial cabinet also approved the Surrender Policy for Dacoits in the Katcha Areas of Sukkur and Larkana Divisions, aimed at consolidating peace, upholding the writ of the state and promoting socio-economic development in the riverine belt.
The cabinet members and meeting participants were informed that many dacoits had expressed willingness to surrender voluntarily following successful security operations and extensive negotiations with local communities.
The press release said the policy established a “transparent and humane mechanism for surrender under the due process of law”.
It explained that the main features of the policy included mandatory disarmament, protection of families, rehabilitation and livelihood support, and access to education, healthcare, and vocational training. It added that the government would also revive schools, health, veterinary and development projects in the riverine areas to sustain peace and stability.
CM Shah directed the Sindh Home Department to ensure transparent implementation of the policy through Monitoring and Implementation Committees, and to carry out public awareness campaigns promoting surrender as a “path to peace and reintegration”.
Wheat Release Policy 2025–26: The cabinet further approved the release of 1.265 million metric tonnes of wheat to flour mills and chakkies at Rs9,500 per 100 kilogramme bags to stabilise wheat flour prices and ensure financial discipline.
The press release added that phased releases would begin this month with an emphasis on transparency and market stability, adding that the policy was designed to achieve two objectives: to stabilise the prices of wheat flour and provide relief to the public, and to ensure financial discipline by using wheat sale proceeds to repay bank loans and reduce liabilities.
“The chief minister emphasised the need for transparent implementation to ensure benefits reach the public and prevent market manipulation,” the press release said.
Ban on operation of tyre burning plants: Among other decisions, the Sindh Cabinet also approved the complete ban on the operation of tyre pyrolysis plants across the province to curb severe air pollution and protect public health with firms involved in the business asked to close their operations within a month.
The decision, taken on the recommendation of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency, followed reports linking pyrolysis activities to the release of toxic pollutants and hazardous emissions contributing to Karachi’s deteriorating air quality, the press release said.
It added that the cabinet also approved the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Prevention of Use of Sub-Standard Fuel/Tyres) Rules, 2025 under the Sindh Environmental Protection Act, 2014, providing a regulatory framework to prohibit the production, sale, and use of substandard fuels, including Tyre Pyrolysis Oil.</p><small>2025-10-06 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627306-pti-finalises-achakzai-as-na-opposition-leader-nasir-abbas-for-senate' target='_blank'><strong>PTI finalises Achakzai as NA opposition leader, Nasir Abbas for Senate</strong></a><br><p>

The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
 
 

Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, before agreeing to a ceasefire.
PM Shehbaz is currently in Malaysia on an official visit. After tallying up press releases from the Foreign Office about the prime minister’s foreign visits, it emerges that he conducted 10 foreign visits from May to October — a period of five months.
Tour of friendly nations — May 25-30
In his first foreign trip after the war, the PM toured the friendly nations of Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan. According to the FO, he held “wide-ranging discussions” with the four nations while acknowledging their support during the conflict.
Beginning his tour in Turkiye, PM Shehbaz met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and thanked him for his support during the war. Both sides held a delegation-level meeting in which Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and Minister of Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar took part.
The next day, PM Shehbaz flew to Tehran and met Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, expressing gratitude for his support of Pakistan. At a joint press conference, the PM said, “We are ready to talk, for the sake of peace on water issues with our neighbour (India).”

For the third leg of his tour, the PM travelled to Azerbaijan to meet President Ilham Aliyev and express gratitude for his “steadfast support”. The pair also discussed the “full spectrum of bilateral relations and expressed satisfaction over the upward trajectory of political, economic, defence, and cultural cooperation”, according to Radio Pakistan. Additionally, the PM took part in a trilateral summit with Turkiye and Azerbaijan.
To cap off the tour, PM Shebaz landed in Tajikistan, where he met President Emomali Rahmon and addressed the International Conference on Glaciers’ Preservation. At the conference on May 30, he warned that Pakistan would not allow India to cross the red line by holding the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance and endangering millions of lives for narrow political gains.
Visit to Saudi Arabia — June 5-6
The PM travelled to Saudi Arabia for a two-day visit, where he expressed gratitude to the kingdom for supporting Pakistan and also performed Umrah, offering prayers for the country’s success. This was the first of two visits to the kingdom that PM Shehbaz would embark upon since the war concluded.

The delegation arrived in Saudi Arabia at the invitation of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman for a visit from June 5 to 6. The visit focused on strengthening bilateral cooperation in key areas between the nations.
The meeting reaffirmed the deep-rooted, strategic, and fraternal ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
Visit to the UAE — June 12
The week after his trip to Saudi Arabia, the prime minister headed to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where he discussed regional peace and stability and explored ways to deepen bilateral ties during an official day-long visit.
Thanking the Emirati leadership for their support during the war, Shehbaz and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan discussed bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest and reaffirmed commitment to further enhance cooperation in key areas.
ECO Summit in Azerbaijan — July 3-4
In a second trip to Azerbaijan, the PM travelled to Khankendi to attend the 17th Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) Summit, where he urged stronger regional cooperation in the face of increasing geopolitical tensions, including the Iran-Israel conflict and Indian hostility towards Pakistan.
The prime minister also voiced concerns over the situation in Gaza and the ongoing Israeli onslaught, which has killed at least 67,000 Palestinians since October 2023.

Visit to China and SCO Summit — Aug 30-Sept 4
Over a month after his last trip, PM Shehbaz headed to China for a state visit, where he was also due to participate in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) Council of Heads of State summit in Tianjin.
Alongside raising the issue of the Indus Waters Treaty, the PM also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to bolster bilateral ties and vowed to strengthen Islamabad’s “iron-clad and all-weather strategic cooperative partnership” with Beijing.
 


Emergency visit to Qatar — September 11
PM Shehbaz reached Qatar on September 11 for a one-day visit, where he met Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to express solidarity and regional unity after Israel launched an airstrike on the Qatari capital Doha.
 
 

During the meeting, which took place two days after the attack, the PM urged unity in the Muslim world to confront Israeli provocations following Tel Aviv’s airstrikes.
Second visit to Saudi Arabia — September 17
PM Shehbaz travelled to Saudi Arabia once again, where he and Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman inked the “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement”, a pact which pledged to treat aggression against one nation as aggression against both.
“This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” a statement from the PM’s office read.
United Nations General Assembly — September 22-28
The prime minister also attended the 80th session of the UN General Assembly in New York, where he was one of eight Muslim nations to work on a Gaza peace proposal with US President Donald Trump.
He highlighted the need for “proactive” rather than “provocative” leadership for South Asia in his address to the UN.
 
 

During his time in the US, PM Shehbaz took a detour to Washington, DC, with Field Marshal Munir, where they met Trump in what was the PM’s first visit to the White House.
PM Shehbaz thanked Trump for “his public endorsement of Pakistan’s role in counterterrorism and stressed the need to further enhance cooperation in security and intelligence,” as the two discussed matters of regional security.
Visit to Malaysia — October 5-7
The PM is currently in Kuala Lumpur on an official visit at the invitation of his Malayian counterpart Ibrahim, where he had a “most productive exchange of views with my dear brother Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya today”, according to a post on his X account.
“We held wide-ranging discussions on ways to further strengthen our historic partnership — focusing on trade and investment, climate, defence, education, and tourism.”

The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine.
The flotilla was intercepted by the Israeli navy, with commandos boarding the boats and arresting participants. Former Pakistani senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was also on board and is currently in Israeli custody.
In her first public comments since her release by Israeli authorities, Greta emphasised that the real story is not the interception of the flotilla, but the genocide being carried out in the Gaza Strip.
“The Global Sumud Flotilla was the biggest-ever attempt to break Israel’s illegal and inhumane siege by sea,” the Swedish activist said. “It is a story of global, international solidarity, of people stepping up when our governments fail to do so and people are saying ‘my leaders … who are supposed to represent me continue to fuel a genocide … they do not represent me’.“
She added that the mission even existing was “a shame”, condemning Israel’s “illegal and inhumane” siege of the enclave, as well as blocking routes for humanitarian aid.

“Under international law, states have a legal obligation to act to prevent … to stop a genocide, including ending complicity, applying real pressure and ending arms transfers,” Thunberg said.
“We are not even seeing the bare minimum from our governments,” she lamented. “Our international systems are betraying Palestinians. They are not even able to stop the worst war crimes from happening.“
Thunberg said she could “talk for a very, very long time” about her imprisonment and abuse at the hands of Israeli jailers, but insisted that it was not the story.
She said the story was “Israel … continuing to worsen and escalate their genocide and mass destruction with genocidal intent; attempting to erase an entire population in front of our very eyes”.
The Israeli onslaught in Gaza began in October 2023 following an attack by Hamas in Israel. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, thousands injured and millions displaced.
Last month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement.</p><small>2025-10-06 17:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/062132395f5fc10.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947039/gb-police-arrest-8-facilitators-of-attack-on-religious-leader-say-culprits-to-be-caught-soon' target='_blank'><strong>GB Police arrest 8 facilitators of attack on religious leader, say culprits to be caught soon</strong></a><br><p>The Gilgit-Baltistan Police on Monday said they had arrested eight facilitators of an attack the previous day on a religious leader from the proscribed Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) near the Central Police Office (CPO).
Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed, who is the emir of the group’s GB and Kohistan chapter, was travelling along with police guards and a driver when the convoy came under fire. Police officials said the guards retaliated immediately, injuring some of the attackers, who managed to escape with the help of accomplices. The same day, a judge of the Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Court had also survived a brazen gun attack.
Following the incidents, protests erupted across the region. Demonstrators blocked main roads, including the Karakoram Highway, Gilgit–Shandur Road, and Baltistan Road, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits. Shops and markets in Gilgit remained closed in protest.
Addressing a press conference to provide further updates, Inspector General of Police (IG) Gilgit-Baltistan Afzal Mahmood Butt said: “Eight actual culprits have been identified. Eight facilitators of theirs … have been arrested and in police custody,” he said. The police chief added that four vehicles used in the attack were also seized.
He was holding a press conference alongside GB Home Secretary Captain (r) Syed Ali Asghar and Gilgit Deputy IG Raja Mirza Hassan.
The GB police chief elaborated that eight suspects of the assassination attempt on the ASWJ leader and two suspects of the attack on the judge were identified, while four vehicles used in the former incident were also seized.
IG Butt said the suspects involved in the attack would be arrested in a day or two and produced in court soon.
He further added that a case was also registered after the two suspects who opened fire on Justice Malik Inayatur Rehman’s vehicle were identified.
The police chief said that fingerprints and blood samples were obtained from the scene of the incident, which helped in identifying the suspects.
The region’s top cop said that the police and investigation agencies are jointly investigating and based on initial evidence, they have identified the accused.
Religious leaders from all sects had condemned the attacks, describing them as a conspiracy to sabotage peace in the region.
Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON, Engineer Amir Muqam had also condemned the assassination attempt and ordered a high-level investigation.
The minister directed authorities to use all available resources to ensure the swift arrest of the attackers. “Those involved in this heinous crime will not escape justice,” he said.
GB Chief Minister Gulbar Khan had reiterated that no conspiracy against the peace of the region would be allowed to succeed. He had ordered the IG and law enforcement agencies to conduct a transparent investigation and immediately arrest the culprits.
Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Speaker Nazir Ahm­ed Advocate, Deputy Spe­a­ker Sadia Danish, Oppo­sition Leader Kazim Mes­um, cabinet ministers, reli­g­ious leaders from var­ious sects, and civil society activists had all condem­ned the incidents and dem­anded a fair and tran­s­parent investigation.</p><small>2025-10-06 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06210343140bcb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947033/pakistan-urges-international-community-to-help-with-afghan-repatriation-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges international community to help with Afghan repatriation efforts</strong></a><br><p>Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam on Monday pressed the international community to help Pakistan in repatriating Afghan refugees to their country.
Muqam was speaking at the 76th Session of the Executive Committee of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva, which is running from October 6-10, according to a press release from the ministry.
“It is now our shared responsibility to facilitate safe and dignified return of displaced Afghans to their country. However, durable returns require investments, in countries of refugee origin for peace, stability, schools, clinics, and livelihoods to make return viable,” he was quoted as having said.
Pakistan announced the phased repatriation of millions of Afghans in 2023 over security concerns and reasoning that the decades-long conflict had ended in Afghanistan.
 
 

Currently, the repatriation of nearly 1.3 million registered Afghans is underway.
Muqam said repeated calls for such support, alongside predictable multi-year funding for host countries such as Pakistan, had yet to be fully realised amid donor fatigue and delayed disbursements.
The federal minister informed the delegates that for over four decades, Pakistan had generously hosted over 4m Afghan nationals, managing one of the world’s largest and most protracted refugee situations.
“Despite our domestic problems, including economic pressures, security challenges and overstretched public services, we have upheld humanitarian principles by providing safety, access to education, healthcare, and livelihoods to the extent possible,” Muqam said.
In the first phase, those who did not have any documents were repatriated, which was followed by the repatriation of those who held Afghan Citizen Cards.
Muqam said Pakistan remained one of the most climate-vulnerable countries, adding that it had endured repeated climate-induced calamities, with this year’s devastating floods displacing millions, destroying infrastructure and causing huge economic losses.
He further said the international community must support the UNHCR in creating conditions that make the return of Afghan refugees both desirable and sustainable.
“When returnees are welcomed back with meaningful support, they can contribute to the recovery and progress of their societies. Provision of adequate, predictable, and flexible resources to UNHCR remains critical.”
The minister pointed out that Pakistan continued to combat terrorism, which had severely impacted its people and economy over the years.
“Over 90,000 Pakistanis have lost their lives, and the nation has endured staggering economic losses exceeding 150 billion dollars in this struggle.
“These events have had far-reaching humanitarian, economic, and social impacts. Pakistan reiterates its call for the urgent start of the UNHCR’s Climate Resilience Fund and other financing mechanisms to support countries most affected by climate change.”
He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to partnering with the international community to find durable solutions to humanitarian situations.
The minister cited three imperatives: first, urgent investment in the countries of refugee origin for stability and reintegration; second, timely and predictable international support to offset the burdens on host communities; and third, fast-track resettlement in third countries.
The minister also said that displacement continues to be a serious global challenge. He said that more than 132m people worldwide were forcibly displaced, including due to conflicts, persecution, violence and climate-induced disasters.
“Clearly, most of these humanitarian crises are man-made. On the other hand, resources needed to respond to the growing needs of forcibly displaced worldwide are shrinking rapidly.”</p><small>2025-10-06 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0616552368b5137.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947004/zardari-calls-naqvi-to-karachi-as-sindh-punjab-row-heats-up-ppp-stages-walkout-from-na-senate' target='_blank'><strong>Zardari calls Naqvi to Karachi as Sindh-Punjab row heats up; PPP stages walkout from NA, Senate</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Monday called Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Karachi for an urgent meeting as tensions continued to rise between the Sindh and Punjab governments, with the PPP staging a walkout from the National Assembly and Senate.
The PPP and PML-N are coalition partners in the Centre.
A post on X from the presidency said today that Zardari and Naqvi held a telephonic conversation related to the ongoing row between the Sindh and Punjab governments.
“President Asif Ali Zardari spoke to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi over the phone to discuss the recent tensions between the Sindh and Punjab governments. The president has called the interior minister to Karachi for an urgent meeting in this regard,” the post said.
 






The PPP and the PML-N’s Punjab leadership have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues ranging from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government.
The war of words between the two sides initially kicked off over flood compensation but expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself.
In response, the PPP lawmakers decided to stay away from parliamentary proceedings last week to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs subsequently met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces.
However, she declared on Friday that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47.
The now-shelved six-canal project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his elder brother and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif on Saturday and discussed with him the ‘growing tensions’ between the PPP and PML-N, requ­esting him to play his part in cooling off the tempers.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon alleged a day ago that the Punjab government was taking his party’s cover to “target” the federal government.
Partners continue to trade barbs as PPP stages walkout from Senate, NA
The coalition partners continued to trade barbs today as Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari vented that the province had always played the role of a “big brother” during any natural calamity.
She said the Punjab cabinet expressed regret that when the province passed through the challenges of the recent floods, the moment was seized and used for the sake of politics and interests.
“The chief minister said she was saddened and, in her own words: ‘It is difficult for me to forget this. I didn’t expect that Punjab would be treated this way.’”
Bokhari also assailed Memon for his remarks and said a “planted campaign” was being run against CM Maryam.
“Ask all these people doing press conferences what they have done for flood affectees,” she said, also taking a dig at Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab.
The Punjab minister further said that she accepted Memon’s challenge to have a debate.
 


Responding to her, PPP Senator Quratulain Marri said Bokhari had a “phobia” of Sindh.
“PML-N’s declaration of war against Sindh is a dangerous precedent, the consequences of which will not be good for the country,” she said.
Marri also reiterated Memon’s allegation that the Punjab government was actually targeting the PPP to weaken the Centre and PM Shehbaz.
 






In a video message, PPP Senator and Senior Vice President Sherry Rehman said the party had said nothing to suggest that it was manipulating the issue of floods and aid for politics.
“If we are demanding relief for the people of Punjab and someone feels bad about it, that’s strange; Punjab is not anyone’s personal estate.”
 






Speaking in the Senate later, she said the PPP had great concerns and the federation was in “sheer need” of stability amid the devastation wrought by the floods.
She said it was “clear” that the “war of words” between Punjab and Sindh was affecting the federal coalition, saying that the PPP strove to maintain unity during tough times but when “lines were crossed”, the “Punjab card” was used and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s run as foreign minister was criticised, then such statements and remarks crossed the bounds of criticism and decency.
Rehman added that the PPP had never managed a coalition before in such a manner and said that apologising did not lead to a decline in self-respect and stature but only increased them.
“If our leadership is not apologised to, then the PPP is the biggest party in the Senate, count the numbers, we are by far the biggest party in this House and don’t take our support for granted in the coalition benches. We don’t want to break anything, but don’t take our support for granted. That is very clear,” she announced before leading a walkout of PPP senators from the proceedings.
 


Responding to her, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said everyone had a right to protest under a democratic system, but ebbs and peaks were also a part of it.
Tarar said he tried his best in the National Assembly that the recent statements from both sides did not affect parliamentary functioning. He highlighted that PML-N Senator and PM aide Rana Sanaullah had assured the PPP in the Senate that water distribution from the Indus River would only be carried out under the Irsa pact.
The law minister also appreciated that Rehman voiced her party’s grievances in a “very sophisticated” manner, adding that President Zardari and Nawaz were both leaders favouring “reconciliation”.
Addressing the opposition, the law minister stressed that the ongoing tensions were an “ordinary change in temperatures”.
At this point, Senate Deputy Chairman Syedaal Khan, who hails from the PML-N, called on his party’s Anusha Rehman and Khalil Tahir Sandhu, as well as on Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Amir Waliuddin Chishti to go and convince the PPP lawmakers to return to the Upper House.
 


Meanwhile, PTI Senator Ali Zafar quipped that they were witnessing a “historic contest” between the coalition allies.
“The contest is very interesting. It is about who served [the people] better during the floods.”
The PTI senator said that “surely the PPP prepared and may have prevented Sindh from being flooded, but only in books, not in reality”.
Noting the Punjab government’s assertions of providing ample rescue and relief services, Zafar claimed, “Surely they must have given the aid, but this is strange and perplexing aid because it did not reach the flood victims, but perhaps went into their pockets.”
The PTI senator assailed both government parties for contesting over “who held more press conferences rather than who built more houses”.
Meanwhile, in the National Assembly, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser welcomed the PPP’s “friendly fire” amid applause from the opposition. “I feel that if they are serious, they should come and present a vote of no confidence, we will side with them.”
His suggestion came after PPP MNA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said that it was hard for his party to continue to participate in proceedings until it was given assurances by Punjab or any other authority.
Ashraf subsequently led a walkout of PPP lawmakers from the Lower House.
 


PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro addressed Qaiser’s suggestion in an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’ and said a mere sentence could not do anything and “reliablility” needed to be considered.
“I don’t know how reliable the PTI are, has he talked to his party founder?” he said.</p><small>2025-10-06 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06213522e301c38.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947036/militant-linked-violence-in-pakistan-soars-in-third-quarter-report' target='_blank'><strong>Militant-linked violence in Pakistan soars in third quarter: report</strong></a><br><p>Violence has surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) said on Monday.
In a quarterly report, CRSS reported a 46 per cent rise in fatalities, including civilians, security personnel and terrorists, compared to the previous quarter. The thick tank recorded 901 fatalities and 599 injuries resulting from 329 incidents of violence, including terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations.
The report noted that this year is on track to be deadlier than 2024 — already the most violent year in a decade.
The surge reflects an “intensification of militant violence and the expanded scale of counter-terrorism operations”, CRSS said.
“With an entire quarter still remaining, … 2025 is on course to surpass last year’s toll,” the report read.
“If the current trend continues, 2025 could mark one of the deadliest years in a decade.”
There were 2,414 deaths in the first three quarters of 2025, nearing the 2,546 fatalities reported in 2024, according to the think tank. The report added that when comparing casualty numbers from January to September 2024 (1,527 fatalities) to this year, 2,414 fatalities were recorded within the same period — an increase of 58pc.
“However, the source of fatalities has shifted; in 2024, security operations caused 505 deaths (33pc of the total), while terror attacks claimed 1,022. In 2025, security operations accounted for 1,265 deaths — over half of the total fatalities. This shift underscores how the state’s response has intensified, with security forces inflicting heavier losses on militants,” the report read.
Attacks have increased since the withdrawal of US-led troops from neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, with the federal government accusing the Taliban authorities of sheltering terrorists — a charge they deny. However, the United Nations has warned of a “permissive environment” for militant groups in Afghanistan.
Government officials told AFP in September on condition of anonymity that the presence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — designated Fitna al Khawarij by the authorities — had increased in recent months.
That same month, opposition lawmakers accused the military of carrying out an air raid on militant hideouts that killed children.
Local village councils have repeatedly warned that sweeping counter-terrorism operations would risk harming civilians.</p><small>2025-10-06 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/062127072d87f83.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947034/scottish-reptile-fossil-showing-mix-of-snake-and-lizard-from-dinosaur-era-baffles-scientists' target='_blank'><strong>Scottish reptile fossil showing mix of snake and lizard from dinosaur era baffles scientists</strong></a><br><p>The fossil of a small reptile that inhabited Scotland during the age of dinosaurs, 167 million years ago, has scientists puzzled.
It mixed snake-like traits and lizard-like traits. So was it an early ancestor of snakes or perhaps just an evolutionary oddball? Whatever the answer, it was a formidable little beast.
Researchers said this creature, named Breugnathair elgolensis, possessed teeth that were sharply curved and hook-like, as in snakes. And the way its teeth were implanted into its jaws and the inward-leaning angle of them relative to the jaws were also snake-like. But its body and head proportions were more lizard-like, including its well-developed limbs.
Breugnathair, which would have been around 12 inches (30 cm) long including its tail, lived in an environment similar to a mangrove swamp with tropical conditions during the Jurassic Period — much warmer than today’s Scotland. Breugnathair may have preyed on insects, small mammals, amphibians and other lizards.
This represents one of the oldest relatively complete fossils from the reptilian group called squamates, which spans lizards and snakes. With its mosaic of features, Breugnathair blurred the line between a lizard and a snake — sort of a “snizard,” or perhaps a “liznake.”
“Breugnathair is either a lizard-like ancestor of snakes, or it belongs to a more primitive group of lizards that independently evolved snake-like features related to a predatory diet. The balance of evidence is so tight that we weren’t able to choose between these two alternatives,” said paleontologist Roger Benson of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.
 
 

“The unexpected combination of features we’re seeing shows that early squamate evolution was very complex, and we’re only just beginning to understand what might have happened,” Benson added.
The earliest-known indisputable snakes in the fossil record date to about 110 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period, according to study co-leader Susan Evans, a palaeontologist and evolutionary morphologist at University College London.
“No one would mistake them for anything else. They are long-bodied, lack any trace of forelimbs and have reduced hindlimbs,” Evans said.
But these fossils do not reveal what snakes looked like before they evolved their characteristic long bodies.
“So we don’t know, for example, whether snakes evolved their distinctive head and jaw traits first, or their long, snake-like bodies first. And we don’t know where snakes first evolved, or their ecology,” Benson said.
While it is possible Breugnathair was an early transitional form between lizards and snakes, its anatomy is perplexing.
 
 

“We know from DNA that snakes are related to iguanas, monitor lizards and some other lizard groups. We therefore expect the ancestor of snakes to be lizard-like, and to share features with those groups,” Benson said.
“But when we look at the details of Breugnathair, we don’t see many features shared with those. Instead, it has a handful of more primitive features shared with some of the earliest lizards and present today in groups like geckos and skinks. This is a big surprise,” Benson added.
Discovered on the Isle of Skye in a coastal locale near the town of Elgol, its scientific name means “false snake of Elgol.”
If it was not part of the snake lineage, Breugnathair may have been an evolutionary dead end, with snake-like predatory habits emerging separately in a group that ultimately went extinct, the researchers said.
The earliest reptiles appeared roughly 320 million years ago, Benson said.
Some of the earliest forms were superficially similar to lizards but lacked the distinctive features of squamates, such as various traits that increase mobility among skull bones in relation to feeding, and features of the shoulders that increase stride length in lizards.
Breugnathair raises as many questions as it answers. “It may help us, ultimately, in understanding what traits to be looking for in future fossils to understand snake ancestry,” Evans said.</p><small>2025-10-06 16:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06210107879ac8e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947032/nationwide-anti-polio-drive-to-vaccinate-45m-children-from-oct-13' target='_blank'><strong>Nationwide anti-polio drive to vaccinate 45m children from Oct 13</strong></a><br><p>The National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) on Monday announced the launch of a nationwide anti-polio campaign from October 13 to 19, aiming to immunise 45 million children under the age of five against the crippling disease.
On September 29, two new poliovirus cases were confirmed in Sindh’s Badin and Thatta districts, taking the nationwide tally to 29 for this year and the total number of cases in the province to nine, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
“During the week-long campaign, more than 45 million children under the age of five will be administered oral polio vaccine (OPV) to protect them from the crippling disease,” the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported, citing the NEOC.
It said an additional dose of Vitamin A will also be given to children during the campaign to help strengthen their immune systems.
“More than 400,000 trained polio workers will take part in the campaign across the country to ensure every eligible child receives the vaccine,” it added.
As per provincial data shared by the NEOC, in Punjab, over 23m children under five will be vaccinated, while in Sindh, more than 10.6m children will be targeted.
In Balochistan, over 2.6m children will receive the drops, while in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, around 7.2m children will be covered.
The NEOC said that in Islamabad, over 460,000 children will be vaccinated, while in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, more than 760,000 children will be administered the vaccine. In Gilgit-Baltistan, over 280,000 children will be reached during the drive.
“The NEOC has appealed to all parents and caregivers to ensure that every child under five years of age receives the polio drops during the nationwide campaign from October 13 to 19,” the report added.
It also urged parents to complete the full course of routine immunisation for their children to protect them from polio and other preventable diseases.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.
Sindh mulls blocking SIMs, CNICs, passports of parents refusing polio vaccination
Last week, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah said the provincial government was likely to take “stern action” against the parents who refuse polio vaccination for their children.
The punitive measures include blocking of cell phone subscriber identification modules (SIMs) and suspending national identity cards and passports to restrict access to communication and travel facilities.
He also added that elected representatives, deputy commissioners, and senior superintendents of police (SSPs) would visit such households to administer polio drops to children “forcibly”.</p><small>2025-10-06 16:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/061948496b5a6f8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947017/pakistan-forms-18-member-committee-for-economic-engagements-negotiations-with-saudi-arabia' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan forms 18-member committee for economic engagements, negotiations with Saudi Arabia</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has constituted an 18-member committee to carry out bilateral economic engagements and negotiations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), a notification issued on Sunday by the Prime Minister’s Office said.
According to the notification, made available to Dawn.com today, the committee will be co-chaired by Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik and the national coordinator for Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), Lieutenant General Sarfraz Ahmad.
The notification, dated October 5, said that the co-chairs “shall constitute core/negotiation teams for negotiations with the Saudi counterparts”.
These teams, per the notification, shall be responsible for implementing and executing the assigned tasks on a fast-track basis.
“The prime minister has directed that the SIFC shall submit proposals for the travel of members of the committee from Pakistan to KSA and back, and the PMO will ensure that these are processed/approved within one hour of the same working day,” the notification further said.
Per the notification, Economic Affairs Division Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, Special Assistant to Prime Minister (Minister of State) for Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, Power Minister Awais Ahmed Leghari, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan, Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, Communication Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, and Information Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja will also be part of the committee, among other members.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in mutual economic interests, strategic military cooperation, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with the kingdom being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
In February, Riyadh signed a $1.2 billion deferred oil facility, releasing $100m monthly until February 2026. Islamabad is also seeking a rollover of $5bn Saudi loans — $2bn maturing in December 2025 and $3bn in June 2026 — at a concessional four per cent interest rate.
Last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Riyadh was “central to Pakistan’s economy” as he met Saudi Crown Prince Moha­m­med Bin Salman on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh.
Saudi delegation due in Pakistan this week
According to a Reuters report, a Saudi business delegation is due in Pakistan this week to kick off what Islamabad hopes is a programme of investment, though major investments may be dependent on reforms, officials and experts said.
The development follows a mutual defence agreement that the two countries signed last month, pledging a joint response to aggression.
Pakistani sources anticipate initial investment plans of about $1bn, possibly through the creation of a new fund, as a path to a deeper economic relationship mirroring military ties, the report said.
Less clear is what Pakistan gets out of it, though analysts widely expect a financial payoff. The Saudi businessmen will be led by Prince Mansour bin Mohammad al-Saud, former governor of Hafar Al-Batin Province. The delegation is modest in ambition, with a much bigger Saudi interest sought by Pakistan in the months ahead.
Pakistan’s commerce ministry and the Saudi government media office did not respond to requests for comment. Prince Mansour could not be reached for comment.
The sectors that the Saudi businessmen will focus on are technology, sports equipment, and food and agriculture, according to a source involved in the process. They are expected to meet PM Shehbaz.
The Pakistani government is seeking large investments in state-owned enterprises and the development of a petrochemicals plant, according to officials.
Saudi Arabia has also shown interest in mining in the past, including in buying part of the Pakistani government stake in the multibillion-dollar Reko Diq copper mine being developed in western Pakistan.</p><small>2025-10-06 15:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/061640017ba854b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947001/nobel-medicine-prize-goes-to-researchers-studying-immune-system-precision' target='_blank'><strong>Nobel medicine prize goes to researchers studying immune system precision</strong></a><br><p>American scientists Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi from Japan won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for work shedding light on how the immune system spares healthy cells, creating openings for possible new autoimmune disease and cancer treatments.
This year’s prize relates to peripheral immune tolerance, or “how we keep our immune system under control so we can fight all imaginable microbes and still avoid autoimmune disease”, said Marie Wahren-Herlenius, a rheumatology professor at the Karolinska Institute.
Sakaguchi told reporters outside his university laboratory that “I feel it is a tremendous honour”, Kyodo news agency reported.
Regulatory T cells: the immune system’s ‘security guards’
The winners for medicine are selected by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden’s Karolinska Institute medical university and receive a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2m), as well as a gold medal presented by Sweden’s king.
Brunkow is senior programme manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, while Ramsdell is scientific adviser at Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi is a professor at Osaka University in Japan.
“Their discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example, for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement.
The laureates identified so-called regulatory T cells, which act as the immune system’s security guards that keep immune cells from attacking our own body, it added.
After announcing the winners, the institute’s Thomas Perlmann said specific therapies had yet to win market clearance, but more than 200 trials on humans involving regulatory T cells were ongoing.
Among companies in the early race, Sonoma Biotherapeutics, which Ramsdell co-founded, is partly funded and supported by US drugmaker Regeneron to work on therapies against diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease.
Also targeting that condition, Quell Therapeutics has partnered with AstraZeneca.  Other biotech firms exploring the approach include Bayer’s BlueRock.
Medicine the first prize of Nobel season
The Nobel Prizes were established through the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite and a wealthy businessman. They have been awarded since 1901 for outstanding contributions in science, literature, and peace, with interruptions mainly during the World Wars.
The economics prize was added later and is funded by Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank.
Winners are selected by expert committees from various institutions. All prizes are awarded in Stockholm, except for the Peace Prize, which is presented in Oslo — a possible legacy of the political union between Sweden and Norway during Nobel’s lifetime.
Past recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine include renowned scientists such as Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 award for discovering penicillin. In recent years, the prize has recognised major breakthroughs, including those that enabled the development of Covid-19 vaccines.
 
 

Last year’s medicine prize was awarded to US scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of microRNA and its key role in how multicellular organisms grow and live, helping explain how cells specialise into different types.
Medicine, in accordance with tradition, kicks off the annual Nobels, arguably the most prestigious prizes in science, literature, peace and economics, with the remainder set to be announced over the coming days.
More than a century after their inception, the Nobel Prizes remain steeped in tradition. The awards culminate in ceremonies attended by the royal families of Sweden and Norway, followed by lavish banquets held on December 10 — the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death.</p><small>2025-10-06 14:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06175709c14f630.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947012/ihc-disposes-of-contempt-case-against-former-gb-chief-judge-rana-shamim' target='_blank'><strong>IHC disposes of contempt case against former GB chief judge Rana Shamim</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday disposed of the contempt case against former Gilgit-Baltistan chief judge Rana Shamim.
The case pertained to an alleged affidavit by Shamim, which stated that he witnessed former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar relaying instructions to a high court judge not to release PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and his daughter, Maryam Nawaz, in the corruption references against them.
IHC Chief Justice Sardar Sarfaraz Dogar heard the contempt case against Shamim and others. Lawyer Aamir Abdullah stated that the former GB judge had submitted an apology letter, after which the case was not scheduled.
Speaking in court, the deputy attorney general said that the case had been fixed after a long time and only Shamim was indicted.
During the last hearing in 2022, the GB judge disowned his controversial affidavit.
In 2021, Shamim partially backtracked from the contents of his affidavit, stating that not a single sitting judge of the IHC was involved in the controversy and submitted an unconditional apology to the high court. He had, however, stood by his allegations against former CJP Nisar.
When Shamim’s affidavit was published in the newspaper, former IHC chief justice Athar Minallah took notice of the matter and initiated contempt of court proceedings.</p><small>2025-10-06 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06095850a272dba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946958/welcome-step-pm-hails-malaysian-announcement-of-import-of-halal-meat-worth-200m-from-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘Welcome step’: PM hails Malaysian announcement of import of Halal meat worth $200m from Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday termed his Malaysian counterpart’s announcement of the import of Halal meat worth $200 million from Pakistan a “welcome step”, which he said would further augment engagement in this sector between the countries.
The PM’s remarks came in a post on X after he addressed a joint press conference alongside Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya following bilateral talks between the two leaders. PM Shehbaz had also mentioned during the press conference that the Malaysian premier had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan.
 






PM Shehbaz, who reached Malaysia yesterday on a state visit, further shared in his post that he had a “most productive exchange of views with my dear brother Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya today”.
“We held wide-ranging discussions on ways to further strengthen our historic partnership — focusing on trade and investment, climate, defence, education, and tourism.”
The prime minister added that the two leaders also had an in-depth discussion on regional and global developments, including the situation in the Middle East and South Asia. Both prime ministers “reaffirmed our shared resolve to continue working together for the peace, progress, and prosperity of our peoples,” PM Shehbaz said.
Mentioning a “gracious and impressive welcome ceremony at Perdana Putra”, he thanked the Malaysian PM for the “warm and generous hospitality extended to me and my delegation”.
Moreover, he said: “We also reflected on Allama Iqbal’s philosophy that the strength of a nation and the destiny of its people lie in the awakening of the self. It is through faith, effort, and perseverance that people shape their destiny.
“Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and I shared our deep admiration for Allama Iqbal, whose message of faith and self-renewal continues to inspire generations across the Muslim world.”
PM Shehbaz concluded his post saying that he was “looking forward to continued Pakistan–Malaysia collaboration across all areas of mutual interest”.
Pakistan presents ‘immense’ business opportunities: PM
Separately, after addressing the Malaysia Business Forum alongside his Malaysian counterpart, PM Shehbaz said he “invited Malaysian companies to seize the immense opportunities Pakistan offers”.
In a post on X, the prime minister termed Pakistan as a “nation with a skilled and youthful workforce, a rapidly expanding market, and an investor-friendly business environment”.
“With our economic trajectory on the rise and reforms unlocking new sectors, Pakistan offers a highly promising investment destination in the region,” the premier asserted.
 






Addressing the Pakistan–Malaysia Business and Investment Conference alongside his Malaysian counterpart, the premier said he had a very “constructive and productive” meeting earlier in the day with PM Ibrahim, “who is very keen” that bilateral business relations between the two countries should improve further.
“This seminar is a testimony of our joint desire that this is an area where we must cooperate with each other.”
“We have a youth bulge, which is a challenge and also a great opportunity, and both Malaysia and Pakistan wish to use this asset,” said the prime minister. He added that the youth can be provided training in information technology, artificial intelligence, vocational training and modern skills to transform the challenge into a “great opportunity”.
Referring to the tourism potential of Pakistan, PM Shehbaz said this is another area in which both Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur can cooperate. He suggested that companies from both countries can hold discussions to promote tourism and this initiative has the potential to be a “game changer”.
‘Pakistan wants to join hands for mutually beneficial projects’
Earlier, PM Shehbaz said during the press conference with Ibrahim alongside him that Pakistan wanted to “join hands” with Malaysia for mutually beneficial projects which allowed for expertise from the two countries to come together.
The prime minister began his media talk by thanking Ibrahim on behalf of the people of Pakistan for extending an exceptionally warm welcome to the visiting delegation, and called Malaysia a “second home”.
“This is my first visit to your great country but believe me, ever since we arrived here last night, I [see] familiar faces — very cordial, very warm — as if we have known each other for ages and that stems from sincerity of purpose and very true friendship. It’s like a family reunion,” he said.
“The way you are focused on building your great country into one of the most strong economies in the region and around the globe speaks volumes about your leadership skills, vision, and dynamism,” the premier said.
 






PM Shehbaz said that he and Ibrahim had “very productive discussions” and they had covered a wide range of matters pertaining to bilateral relations and other international matters during a meeting held prior to the joint presser.
“I am very happy that our views converge on almost all important issues,” he said. He further said that the Malaysian premier’s visit to Pakistan last year was memorable in terms of further cementing bilateral relations.
“Today, I am very happy that you have expressed your vision [on] how to build our economic and trade relations, how to promote joint ventures, how to encourage investment […], how we can benefit from your vast experience in technology, artificial intelligence and other areas of economic growth where Malaysia has done remarkably well,” he said, adding that Pakistan stood to benefit from Malaysian experience in these areas.
“Today, I want to make it publicly known that Pakistan wants to join hands with Malaysia, not only to benefit from your experience, but to have joint ventures, mutually beneficial projects, where Malaysian and Pakistani expertise can come together,” he said.
 






The premier noted that there were 150,000 Pakistanis in Malaysia who were contributing to national building efforts. “I think all this put together gives us great encouragement and hope that we can use this potential and make our economies stronger,” he said.
He noted that Ibrahim, in his remarks, had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan to Malaysia worth $200 million. “I am eternally grateful to you […] but let me also make it abundantly clear for our Malaysian importers and officials that this quota of exporting meat will be regulated by a market price mechanism.
“It will be regulated by all halal certification required by Malaysian custom and food authorities […]. I want to assure you that we will make all possible efforts to meet all your terms and conditions and only on that basis, we will achieve not only this quota of $200m, but in times to come, it will increase and have a quantum jump,” he said.
The premier further said that an Urdu translation had been launched for Ibrahim’s book Script, which detailed the latter’s vision of sustainability, innovation, research and development.
“These are the great virtues and values that brother Ibrahim has inked in this script and I think it will speak across borders for this generation and coming generations,” he said.
 






He further said that nations were not built with a magic wand but rather through “hard work, untiring efforts and unwavering commitment”.
“When I leave this great country tomorrow […] I will be going back far more informed than ever before, far more impressed than ever before, far more comforted than ever before,” he said.
Talking about Pakistan’s youth and their potential, he said, “If we can really dedicate ourselves to injecting modern technology in their souls, they will be great hands, great builders of Pakistan. I have no doubt about it,” he said.
He concluded his remarks by expressing the wish for Malaysia to continue prospering.
Later, the two premiers also witnessed an exchange of memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between Pakistan and Malaysia.
 






PM Ibrahim ‘extremely appreciative’ of Pakistan’s stance on Palestine
In his remarks, the Malaysian premier acknowledged the presence and contribution of Pakistani professionals as well as students in Malaysian universities.
He said that his country had increased the import of rice from Pakistan. He stated there was also an interest regarding importing meat and Malaysia would facilitate this, noting that Shehbaz had mentioned exports worth $200 million.
Ibrahim humourously quipped that when he visited PM Shehbaz at his hotel at night, the latter “politely suggested” this but also “harassed”.
“So I certainly welcome that and will discuss with my team,” he said.
Calling PM Shehbaz a “brother”, Ibrahim also said that the former had also encouraged cooperation in information technology and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
“Pakistan was among the Muslim countries who were clearly far ahead initially in these fields and that potential is still there. Now that we have secured stability in the country, we certainly will welcome further collaboration,” he said.
Regarding regional and international issues, he said that the two discussed establishing peace in the subcontinent and also joint efforts for countering terrorism.
He also stated that he was “extremely appreciative” of Pakistan’s stance on the Palestine and Gaza issue.
 
 

“We jointly look favourably at the 20-point peace initiative by US President Donald Trump. Although Malaysia does express some concerns, but at least on the point of cessation of hostilities, stopping the insane bombings and killings by the Zionist Israeli regime, that at least is a clear position taken by Arab countries, Muslim countries, and most of the countries in the world now,” he said, expressing the hope for peace in the Palestinian enclave.
“Our joint position in supporting this peace initiative would probably further help this desire to achieve durable peace,” he said.
PM given guard of honour
After the presser wrapped up, Ibrahim took to social media platform X and said: “This morning, I welcomed Pakistan’s Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif [who is] starting his three-day visit to Malaysia.”
“He and his delegation received an official welcome, including an honour guard inspection by the Batalion Pertama Rejimen Renjer Diraja. After the ceremony, we held bilateral talks in a warm, constructive atmosphere,” he said.
“The visit enhances Malaysia-Pakistan friendship and opens a new chapter of strategic cooperation for our peoples,” he said.
 






PM Shehbaz was presented with the guard of honour at the Perdana Putra Complex in Putrajaya, which houses the Malaysian prime minister’s office.
 






According to Radio Pakistan, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier.
Prior to his departure on Sunday, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement.
“I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight.
Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added.
 






‘Visit reflects enduring partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia’
The Foreign Office (FO) earlier stated that talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.”
Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.</p><small>2025-10-06 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06192458f5ce325.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947020/sidra-amin-reprimanded-for-code-of-conduct-breach-during-india-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Sidra Amin reprimanded for code of conduct breach during India clash</strong></a><br><p>Top batter Sidra Amin was reprimanded for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct during their ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 match against India in Colombo.
India won Sunday’s match against Pakistan by 88 runs, with Sidra Amin scoring 81 runs during the encounter. She also become the first Pakistani batter to hit a six against India in a women’s ODI match.
The right-handed batter was found guilty of breaching Article 2.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to “abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an international match.”
 






The incident occurred during the 40th over of Pakistan’s chase, when Sidra forcefully hit her bat onto the pitch after being dismissed.
In addition to the reprimand, one demerit point has been added to Sidra’s disciplinary record. This is her first offence in a 24-month period, ICC reports.
“Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a player’s match fee, and one or two demerit points,” ICC reported.
On-field umpires Lauren Agenbag and Nimali Perera, third umpire Kerrin Klaaste and fourth umpire Kim Cotton had levelled the charges.
Sidra admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Shandré Fritz of the Emirates ICC International Panel of Match Referees, negating the need for a formal hearing.

UK police would be given greater powers to restrict protests as Mahmood said repeated large-scale pro-Palestinian demonstrations had caused “considerable fear” for the Jewish community. The government initiative follows last week’s deadly knife and car-ramming attack on a synagogue in the northwestern city of Manchester.
“The strengthening of the legislation that I am going to bring about is based on the ability of the police to place conditions and restrictions on protests,” she said in a video posted on her X account.
“What I will be making explicit is that cumulative disruption … the frequency of particular protests in particular places is in and of itself a reason for police to restrict or place conditions.”
 






In an interview with the BBC, she further maintained that the move was not about a ban but about “restrictions and conditions”, such as relocating a demonstration and changing the time of protests.
“What I will make clear in the law is [that] cumulative disruption is in and of itself a reason to place restrictions,” Mahmood said. “There would be protests related to the conflict in the Middle East that would now come into the purview of these changes, as well as other protests.”
When asked about the “dark step” of restricting the fundamental right to protest, the home secretary said, “I don’t think it’s offensive to ask people to show a little humanity towards a community that has suffered such a terrible tragedy … I think just because you have a freedom, it doesn’t mean you have to use it at every moment of every day.”

This move garnered significant backlash from political figures, human rights groups, and other public figures across Britain.
Lawmaker Zarah Sultana wrote in a post on X that the home secretary aimed to ban pro-Palestinian protests, adding that Mahmood was “not content with locking up pensioners and priests for opposing the ban on Palestine Action”.
“She’s (Mahmood) violating our civil liberties and the right to protest — all while supporting the flow of arms to the apartheid genocidal state of Israel,” Sultana wrote. “I hope the ministerial car was worth throwing Palestinians under the bus.”
 






In an interview with Sky News, UK Green Party leader Zach Polanski called Mahmood “deeply irresponsible” to conflate protests against the Gaza crisis and “weaponising” against the Manchester synagogue attack.
“Democratic nonviolent protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, and I think it’s worrying when governments are increasingly trying to crush down dissent and using what is a brutal attack … to point at a protest and say people don’t have a right to speak out about a genocide,” Polanski said.
British actor and comedian Tez Ilyas posted a photo of Mahmood from 2014, showing her at a protest with a pro-Palestinian picket sign.
“Shabana Mahmood, before she was given access to the corridors of power,” he wrote in the caption.

South Africa play a two-test series in Pakistan, starting on Sunday, and two games in India in November as they bid to retain the trophy they won in June by beating Australia by five wickets at Lord’s.
 






The World Test Championship is decided at the end of a two-year cycle, with the top two teams competing in a one-off five-day match.
“I suppose you create a bit of a target on your back if youve won (the WTC), and if thats the case, its fair. We want to chase a place in the final again and lift that trophy once again but realise each team will be coming for us,” said Markram, who stands in as skipper for Temba Bavuma who has been ruled out of the tour with a calf strain.
“We, as a team, have to keep getting better and improving and playing well in all different types of conditions. It starts for us in Pakistan, and its a challenge the boys will be up for,” he told a press conference on Monday.
South Africa have been practising on specially prepared spinning wickets at Pretorias High Performance Centre.
“There were a couple of nets prepared where the spin is really exaggerated, and youd rather err on that side, and maybe then its a bit easier when we get to Pakistan,” Markram said.
“Were expecting to face a lot of spin over there, and its also, naturally, a lot lower there from a seam point of view. Theres a lot of skiddy, so its hard to try and emulate that here in South Africa, but weve been looking to put a lot of emphasis on finding a way to train for that.”

Police were called on Sunday evening to Croydon Park, in the city’s Inner West, where the alleged gunman was firing from his property, randomly targeting passing cars and police.
A large contingent of police swarmed the area and locked down the street, before entering the property above a business and arresting a 60-year-old man.
A rifle and ammunition were allegedly seized from the scene, New South Wales Police said.
Office worker Joe Azar said he was working across the road when he heard what he thought were fireworks or rocks being thrown at the windows.
 


“Some guy’s windshield blew up, then the bus stop glass shattered,” Azar told The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.
“The surreal feeling kicked in like, ‘Oh, this is what’s happening’,” he said.
“It was frantic. It all happened so quick, so I couldn’t comprehend what was going on,” he added.
Police had initially said up to a hundred bullets were fired and 20 people were wounded.
But on Monday, New South Wales Police Acting Superintendent Stephen Parry revised the number of shots to around 50 and the toll of wounded to 16.
“In my 35 years in the police, there’s been very few incidents of this nature where somebody is randomly targeting people in the street,” he added.
The accused shooter was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries to the area around his eyes sustained during his arrest.
 
 

The suspect was charged with 25 offences, including 18 counts of shooting with intent to murder, firing a weapon in a public place, and possessing an unregistered firearm and ammunition, the police said.
He was refused bail and is due to appear at court on Tuesday. A police investigation is ongoing.
One man self-presented to hospital with a gunshot wound following the incident, but would likely survive, police said.
The remaining people were treated by ambulance staff for minor injuries, including shattered glass as bullets hit their car windows.
‘Something out of a movie’
The gunman’s motive was unclear but there were “no known links to terrorism activity or any gang activity”, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told local radio station 2GB.
One witness who gave his name as Tadgh told the national broadcaster ABC he had been watching rugby when he first heard the gunshots.
“It was very loud and ‘bang, bang, bang’ and flash-bangs and sparks and smoke and the whole works. It was something out of a movie, really,” he said.
Mass shootings are relatively rare in Australia. A ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons has been in place since 1996, when a lone gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania.
In August, alleged gunman Dezi Freeman went on the run in the bush after being accused of killing two police officers. He remains at large.
And in 2022, six people including two police officers were killed in a shooting near the small Queensland town of Wieambilla.</p><small>2025-10-06 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06133451256f4ff.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946986/frances-new-pm-sebastien-lecornu-resigns-hours-after-cabinet-unveiled-deepening-political-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>France’s new PM Sebastien Lecornu resigns hours after cabinet unveiled, deepening political crisis</strong></a><br><p>France’s new Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned on Monday, barely 14 hours after appointing his new cabinet, after allies and foes alike threatened to topple his government, driving French stocks and the euro sharply lower.
His swift resignation was unexpected and unprecedented, and marked another major deepening of France’s political crisis.
The far-right National Rally immediately urged President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap parliamentary election.
After weeks of consultations with political parties across the board, Lecornu, a close ally of Macron, had appointed his ministers on Sunday and they had been set to hold their first meeting on Monday afternoon.
 


But the new cabinet line-up had angered opponents and allies alike, who either found it too right-wing or not sufficiently so, raising questions on how long it could last, at a time when France is already mired deep in political crisis, with no group holding a majority in a fragmented parliament.
Lecornu handed his resignation to Macron on Monday morning.
“Mr Sebastien Lecornu has submitted the resignation of his Government to the President of the Republic, who has accepted it,” the Elysee’s press office said.
 
 

French politics has become increasingly unstable since Macron’s re-election in 2022 for want of any party or grouping holding a parliamentary majority.
The French president’s decision to call a snap parliamentary election last year deepened the crisis by producing an even more fragmented parliament. Macron named Lecornu, a former defence minister, to the post last month and was his fifth prime minister in two years.
“There can be no return to stability without a return to the polls and the dissolution of the National Assembly,” National Rally leader Jordan Bardella said after Lecornu resigned.
 






Daunting task of finding approval for austerity budget
Lecornu had faced the daunting task of finding approval in a deeply divided parliament for an austerity budget for next year.
His two immediate predecessors, Francois Bayrou and Michel Barnier, were ousted by the legislative chamber in a standoff over the spending plan. France’s public debt has reached a record high, official data showed last week.
Paris’s benchmark CAC 40 index dropped 1.5 per cent as Lecornu resigned, making it the worst-performing index in Europe, as banking shares came under heavy fire, leaving BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole down 4pc to 5pc.
The euro slid 0.7pc on the day to $1.1665.
 
 

France’s debt-to-GDP ratio is now the European Union’s third-highest after Greece and Italy, and is close to twice the 60pc permitted under EU rules.
Previous governments had rammed the last three annual budgets through parliament without a vote, a method allowed by the constitution but deeply criticised by the opposition.
But Lecornu promised last week to ensure lawmakers were able to vote on the bill.
France has been mired in deadlock since Macron gambled on snap parliamentary elections in June last year in the hopes of bolstering his authority. The move backfired, leaving the Macron-friendly bloc in the assembly in a minority.</p><small>2025-10-06 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06161740392a0c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946993/at-least-four-dead-28-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-punjab-over-last-24-hours-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>At least four dead, 28 injured in rain related-incidents across Punjab over last 24 hours: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>At least four people have died and another 28 have been injured over the last 24 hours in rain-related incidents across Punjab as the province received heavy rainfall, a spokesperson for the Rescue 1122 Punjab said on Monday.
According to a weather alert issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) last week, a strong westerly weather system was likely to affect the upper catchments of all major rivers, along with Islamabad, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, causing “heavy to very heavy wind-thunderstorms and rains” from October 5 to October 7.
Punjab Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Farooq Ahmed said in a statement: “Over the last 24 hours, four people, including two children, were killed in rain-related incidents, while another 28 were left injured.”
He added that in Faisalabad, a 12-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy lost their lives as the roof of their house caved in due to heavy rains, injuring another seven people.
“A 70-year-old man was killed in Nankana Sahib, while a 65-year-old man died in a similar incident in Kasur,” the statement quoted the spokesperson as saying.
“Meanwhile, at least six people were injured in separate roof collapse incidents in Samundri, Jaranwala, and Kakarwala, four were injured in Chak, three in Manawala, and five people were injured in Faqirwali, Allah Abad, and Sahiwal in separate incidents.”
Per the statement, another two people were injured in roof and wall collapse incidents in Lahore.
Separately, according to a statement issued by the spokesperson of the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), “Most districts of Punjab received heavy rains in the last 24 hours, with Multan recording the highest level of rain water at 113mm.”
It added that Faislabad recorded 78mm of rain, Bahawalpur 44mm, Lahore 40mm, Khaewal 28mm, Toba Tek Singh 25mm, Sialkot 19mm, Attock 10mm.
Gujranwala, Muree and Sahiwal recorded 8mm, Okara recorded 7mm, Narowal 6mm, Mangla 5mm, Gujrat and Hafizabad 3mm, while Layyah and Kasur recorded 1mm each, the spokesperson said.
PDMA warned that rainfall will continue in most parts of Punjab in the next 24 hours, with rain expected in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Lahore, Gujarat, Sialkot, Narowal, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Okara, Sahiwal, Kasur, Jhang, Sargodha, and Mianwali.
The spokesperson also cautioned that the “water level in rivers may increase due to the rain, with water in the Chenab River to rise by October 7.”
“While the levels in the rivers Sutlej and Ravi will depend on the release of water from India,” the statement quoted him as saying. “Water level at Indus and Jhelum is expected to rise as well.”
The PDMA requested citizens to take precautionary measures and placed relevant authorities on high alert, as per the statement.
Rain emergency declared in Multan
A rain emergency was declared in Multan after the district received heavy rainfall on Sunday night, followed by another spell today afternoon, Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) Managing Director Khalid Raza Khan said in a statement.
He requested people to take necessary precautions, including avoiding electricity poles and staying indoors.
On Saturday, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia, while addressing a media briefing in Lahore, had said showers were to begin in Punjab from Sunday and continue till October 7 (Tuesday) in the northern parts.
The PDMA chief said the north and northeastern regions from Rawalpindi to Lahore were likely to receive 30 to 35mm of rainfall on average, while the province’s southern parts could see 5 to 10mm.
He warned that the intensity of the showers would increase on October 6 and 7, with 50 to 70mm of rain anticipated in northern and northeastern Punjab, extending into central districts as well.</p><small>2025-10-06 12:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06150158a189d1e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946992/un-to-decide-on-broad-eu-backed-investigation-into-afghanistan-atrocities' target='_blank'><strong>UN to decide on broad EU-backed investigation into Afghanistan atrocities</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations Human Rights Council will decide on Monday on an EU proposal to set up a UN investigation into abuses in Afghanistan, which could enable criminal investigations into suspected violations by both the Taliban and foreign troops.
The European Union motion calls for investigators to prepare evidence for future court proceedings and is among the strongest forms of UN rights probe, on par with existing investigations into crimes in Syria and Myanmar.
The United States, which had troops in Afghanistan until 2021 within a NATO coalition, has previously opposed scrutiny of its actions, for example, by the International Criminal Court, but backed research into suspected Taliban violations.
US President Donald Trump has disengaged from the council and did not take a stance in these negotiations, diplomats said. However, a State Department spokesperson said: “Under the leadership of President Trump, the United States government will not tolerate international organisations that attempt to exert unlawful jurisdiction over American troops.”
Fereshta Abbasi, Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch, called the launch a “significant step that could break a decades-long cycle of impunity”.
“If it gives just one regional commander pause for thought on committing violations because he knows there is a case file open, then it’s worth it.”
 






Comprehensive probe
For years, both Afghan and international rights groups have sought such a probe. Calls have become louder as the Taliban tightened restrictions on women and freedom of expression.
The Taliban authorities say they respect rights in line with their interpretation of Islamic law.
The new investigation would cooperate with an existing ICC probe. The ICC has previously indicated it would deprioritise suspected crimes by US forces after Trump imposed sanctions in 2020 over its Afghanistan work.
While the EU proposal does not mention abuses by international troops, it is described as comprehensive and has no time limit, meaning it could address these, diplomats said.
Investigations launched by the 47-member council can lead to war crimes prosecutions. Some countries which sent troops to Afghanistan, such as Britain and Australia, have initiated inquiries, but prosecutions have been rare.
It was not immediately clear whether states would vote on the proposal, which Ukraine, Norway, and South Korea also back.
China has raised doubts about the probe’s costs and whether it would help improve local rights, diplomats said.
China’s diplomatic mission did not respond to a request for comment.</p><small>2025-10-06 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/061602172663e48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946991/govt-should-take-parliament-into-confidence-on-new-us-policy-raza-rabbani' target='_blank'><strong>Govt should take parliament into confidence on ‘new US policy’: Raza Rabbani</strong></a><br><p>Former Senate chairperson Raza Rabbani emphasised on Monday that the federal government should “immediately” take parliament into confidence on its “new US policy”, particularly mentioning media reports about the sale of rare minerals and the supposed plan to offer Pasni port to Washington.
“The federal government has not taken the people or parliament into confidence on the dynamics of the new relationship with the United States,” Rabbani stated in a press release. He added, “It is the right of the people to know the details and the direction of the foreign policy. In history, the US has never been a reliable friend to depend upon.”
On the sale of precious and rare minerals to American metals company US Strategic Metals (USSM), he said it was “unfortunate” that information about the deal had come through the media.
He stressed that “real stakeholders” in this matter were the provinces, which should have been taken into confidence through the Council of Common Interests.
“The federal government fails to realise that Article 172 [of the 1973] Constitution […] is in operation, [and] the provinces are 50 per cent owners of the mineral resources,” Rabbani pointed out.
According to Article 172: “Any property which has no rightful owner shall, if located in a province, vest in the government of that province, and in every other case, in the federal government […]  Subject to the existing commitments and obligations, mineral oil and natural gas within the province or the territorial water adjacent thereto shall vest jointly and equally in that province and the federal government.”
In this connection, he also recalled that the provinces had “rejected the federal government-sponsored minerals law”.
The legislation has particularly faced opposition in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and even ignited debate on resource control.
 
 

Rabbani further stated that it was “alarming” to learn from the international media that Pasni port may be offered to Washington. “This will have very serious repercussions on the other regional relationships,” he said.
He asserted that the federal government should “immediately take parliament into confidence on the various aspects of its new US policy”.
The former Senate chairperson’s assertion comes against the backdrop of
Pakistan is entering a new phase in its economic and strategic partnership with the US, as the two allies move closer to implementing a deal for the export of rare earth minerals.
USSM, which signed a memorandum of understanding with Pakistan in September to invest rou­ghly $500 million to establish mineral processing and development facilities in the country, rece­ntly dispatched its first consignment of mineral samples to the US to advance the deal.
The sample shipment, prepared locally in collaboration with the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), includes antimony, copper concentrate, and rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium.
But the opposition party, the PTI, has raised concerns over these “secret deals” with the US, and called on the government to disclose the details of these agreements.
In a statement, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram referred to the USSM shipment, as well as claims published by the Financial Times regarding a supposed plan to offer the Pasni Port to Washington. He warned that such “reckless, lopsided, and secretive agreements would further inflame the already volatile situation in the country”.
He demanded that parliament and the nation be taken on board and that “full details of all such deals be made public.” Akram stressed that PTI “would never accept agreements struck at the expense of the people and the state’s interests“.
Military sources have already disputed the claims made in the Financial Times report, calling the proposal “a commercial idea” rather than “official policy”.</p><small>2025-10-06 11:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/061645416464ba5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947003/death-toll-from-indonesia-school-collapse-rises-to-63' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from Indonesia school collapse rises to 63</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from an Indonesian school collapse rose to 63 on Monday, officials said, as workers pulled more remains from the rubble of the building that collapsed last week.
Part of the multi-storey Islamic boarding school on Indonesia’s Java island collapsed as more than 150 students gathered for afternoon prayers.
Around half a dozen youngsters are still unaccounted for.
“We hope we can conclude the recovery today (Monday), and we will return the bodies [to the families],” National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) operations director Yudhi Bramantyo told a press conference on Monday.
The collapse was Indonesia’s deadliest disaster so far this year, Budi Irawan, the deputy head of the national disaster agency (BNPB), said.
Investigators have been examining the cause of the collapse, but initial indications suggest that substandard construction may have contributed to the incident, according to experts.
The families of the missing agreed last Thursday for heavy equipment to be used, after the 72-hour “golden period” for the best chance of survival came to an end.
Lax construction standards have raised widespread concerns about building safety in Indonesia.

The ministry said the move was part of the Kingdom’s efforts to streamline procedures for Umrah performers and broaden access to services within the Haj and Umrah system, in support of the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030.
“This step reflects the Kingdom’s ongoing commitment to facilitating the arrival of Muslims from around the world to perform their rituals with ease and tranquillity,” the statement said.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
In July, the federal cabinet formally approved the Haj Policy 2026, outlining key procedural, financial, and logistic measures for the pilgrimage season.</p><small>2025-10-06 09:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06125528adfdf8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946978/islamabad-atc-issues-bailable-arrest-warrants-for-omar-ayub-2-others-over-2024-sangjani-rally' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC issues bailable arrest warrants for Omar Ayub, 2 others over 2024 Sangjani rally</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad anti-terrorism court on Monday issued bailable arrest warrants for PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Zartaj Gul and central information secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram in a case pertaining to the Sangjani rally in September last year.
On Sept 8, 2024, clashes took place between PTI leaders and the Islamabad police as party supporters rallied on the outskirts of the city, demanding the “immediate release” of ex-premier Imran Khan and criticising the government for marginalising the party. Following that, at least 10 PTI MNAs were arrested on Sept 9 and 10 last year from different areas of Islamabad, including the Parliament House.
Today, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra presided over the hearing, where lawyers Sardar Masroof Khan, Amna Ali and Murtaza Toori appeared on behalf of the PTI leaders.
The judge rejected Ayub’s application seeking an exemption from the hearing. “None of them have appeared before the court even once,” Judge Sipra observed.
 
 

Subsequently, he ordered that the three PTI leaders be arrested and produced before the court. The hearing was adjourned till October 20.
Akram reacted to the development by writing “warrant factories” in a post on X, sharing screenshots of various media outlets airing the news of the warrants being issued.
 






Ayub was among the key PTI leaders who had addressed the Sangjani public rally. Others who spoke included Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan, Hammad Azhar, and Ali Muhammad Khan.
Late-night parliament arrests over Sangjani rally
In September last year, the PTI had said nearly a dozen of its lawmakers, including Akram, had been arrested. Gul and Ayub were also wanted by the police, but fearing arrest, some of them had taken shelter inside Parliament House.
Late night on Sept 9, 2024, law enforcement agencies arrested at least three key members from different areas of Islamabad, including Sher Afzal Marwat from the Parliament House.
Just after 3am the next day, plainclothesmen stormed the Parliament House — disconne­c­ting the power supply and barging into the building’s Ser­vices Branch — to whisk away more PTI legislators.
 
 

Others taken into custody over their alleged role in violence at the Sangjani rally included Malik Amir Dogar, Ahmed Chattha, Zain Qureshi, Zubair Khan Wazir, Awais Haider Jakhar, Syed Shah Ahad Ali Shah, Nasim Ali Shah and Yousuf Khan Khattak.
The unprecedented raid had led to a war of words in the National Assembly and suspension of five of its security officials.
The Islamabad High Court had struck down the eight-day physical remand of the PTI MNAs on Sept 13, 2024, with them being granted bail in the case days later.</p><small>2025-10-06 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627218-fo-hopeful-of-ex-senator-mushtaq-ahmeds-evacuation-in-next-couple-of-days' target='_blank'><strong>FO hopeful of ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad's evacuation in 'next couple of days'</strong></a><br><p>

Mushtaq led the Pakistani delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF). The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it and detained the activists on board.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, through its embassy in Amman, is working tirelessly to secure the safe evacuation of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan,” the FO said in a statement.
“With the invaluable assistance of the Jordanian government, we are hopeful that the process can be successfully concluded within the next couple of days,” the FO said.
The statement also expressed deep gratitude to the “brotherly” government of Jordan for “their exemplary cooperation and generous support”.
 






Last week, Pakistan and several other countries condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the GSF.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for the release of those detained by Israel. “We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release,“ he said in a post on X on Thursday.
In a later post, he commended the “dignified participation” of Pakistani activists, including Mushtaq, in the humanitarian mission.
“The government of Pakistan … strongly demands the return of its citizens, praying and striving for their safety, dignity, and earliest possible return to the homeland,” he added.
 






On Friday, he assured JI chief Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman during a telephone conversation that the government was actively engaged in efforts to secure the safe return of Pakistani nationals, including Mushtaq.
The PM told Naeem that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had been assigned to lead these efforts and coordinate with friendly countries and international organisations.
Subsequently, the FO assured in a statement yesterday that it was actively engaged with international partners to ensure the “safety and prompt repatriation of its citizens” who were detained following the interception of the GSF by Israeli forces.
Particularly mentioning Mushtaq, the FO said it had been confirmed through the “diplomatic channels of a friendly European country” that Mushtaq was in the custody of Israeli forces, “safe and in good health”.
“We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, [former] senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis,” the FO added.
Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir noted in a post on X today that the activists detained during the Israeli raid were receiving a hero’s welcome upon their return home. “God willing, [former] senator Mushtaq will also return to a hero’s welcome,” he added.
 






Israel had previously blocked attempts to bring aid to Gaza as well. In June, the aid vessel Madleen, carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces.</p><small>2025-10-06 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627202-non-bailable-arrest-warrants-issued-for-ptis-omar-ayub-zartaj-gul-in-sangjani-rally-case' target='_blank'><strong>Arrest warrants issued for PTI leaders including Omar Ayub in Sangjani rally case</strong></a><br><p>
