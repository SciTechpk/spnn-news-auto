“As of now, we can confirm nine people have died after a man drove through a crowd at last night’s Lapu Lapu Festival,” the police said on X.
 






A 30-year-old local man was arrested at the scene, Vancouver police posted on X. The driver was a “lone suspect” known to police, a police spokesperson told journalists at the scene.
“At this time, we are confident that this incident was not an act of terrorism,” Vancouver police said on X early on Sunday morning.
Footage posted online and verified by AFP shows a black SUV with a damaged hood parked on a street littered with debris, meters from first aiders tending to people lying on the ground.
Eyewitness Dale Selipe told the Vancouver Sun that she saw injured children on the street after the vehicle rammed into the crowd.
“There was a lady with her eyes staring up, one of her legs was already broken. One person was holding her hand trying to comfort her,” Selipe told the newspaper.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was “devastated” by the “horrific events.”
“I offer my deepest condolences to the loved ones of those killed and injured, to the Filipino Canadian community, and to everyone in Vancouver,” he wrote on X.
“We are all mourning with you.”
 






The incident happened as members of the Filipino community gathered to celebrate Lapu Lapu Day, Vancouver mayor Ken Sim posted on X.
The festival, which commemorates a Filipino anti-colonial leader from the 16th century, falls this year on the weekend before Canada’s election.
“Our thoughts are with all those affected and with Vancouver’s Filipino community during this incredibly difficult time,” Sim wrote.
 






Police said the incident happened shortly after 8:00 pm on Saturday (8am PKT, Sunday) in the city’s Sunset on Fraser neighborhood.
The Philippine consulate in Vancouver said in a Facebook statement it “expresses its deep concern and sympathies to the victims of the horrific incident.”
Photos published by Canadian broadcaster CBC showed emergency crews at the scene as well as large crowds at the block party earlier on Saturday.
Festival security guard Jen Idaba-Castaneto told local news site Vancouver Is Awesome that she saw “bodies everywhere”.
“You don’t know who to help, here or there. It’s so shocking,” she said.
British Columbia Premier David Eby said he was “shocked & heartbroken” by the news in a post on X.
 






Election season
Saturday’s event featured a parade, a film screening, dancing and a concert, with two members of the Black Eyed Peas featured on the lineup published by the organisers.
“Our thoughts are with the victims and their families — and Vancouver’s Filipino community,” Jagmeet Singh, leader of the left-wing New Democratic Party said on X.
 






Lapu Lapu Day is celebrated in the Philippines in remembrance of indigenous chief Lapulapu, who led his men to defeat Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in battle in 1521.
The deadly incident comes a year after Canadian Nathaniel Veltman was sentenced to life in prison for running down a Muslim family with his truck on the street in London, Ontario in 2021.
The ruling in Veltman’s case was the first in Canada to make a link between white supremacy and terrorism in a murder case.
Canadians go to the polls on Monday after an frenetic election race where candidates have wooed voters on issues including US President Donald Trump’s tariffs and rising living costs.
Prime Minister Mark Carney is favoured to win after assuring voters he can stand up to Washington’s barrage of sweeping tariffs.
His Liberal Party trailed the Conservatives by more than 20 points in most polls on January 6, the day former prime minister Justin Trudeau announced his plans to resign.</p><small>2025-04-27 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602041-as-pakistan-india-tensions-soar-military-ill-preparedness-exposes-modis-challenge' target='_blank'><strong>As Pakistan-India tensions soar, military ill-preparedness exposes Modi's challenge</strong></a><br><p>

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed in what is being described as the deadliest armed attack in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000. Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
India has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan strongly denied any involvement.
According to the report, PM Shehbaz reiterated his official invitation to the Iranian president and welcomed Iran’s readiness to help ease tensions.
The premier also emphasised that Pakistan sought peace in the region and that if Iran wishes to play a role in this regard, Islamabad would welcome it.
“Pakistan condemns all forms of terrorism and has no connection to the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam, located in the India-held Kashmir region,” the statement read.
Moreover, the prime minister also repeated that Pakistan is ready to “participate in a transparent and unbiased investigation into the terrorist attack”, saying that the country has been one of the greatest victims of terrorism over the past two decades, with thousands of its citizens losing their lives and the government spending billions of dollars to combat this menace.
Regarding India’s decision on the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, he said that weaponising water was “unacceptable and that Islamabad will defend itself at any cost”.
The agency also reported the prime minister “expressed solidarity with the Iranian government and people following the powerful explosion at Shahid Rajaee port, saying Islamabad is ready to assist Tehran in addressing this incident”.
Iran’s President Pezeshkian, for his part, thanked the premier “for his solidarity regarding the incident at Shahid Rajaee port” and praised Pakistan’s efforts for “peace in the region”.
“The Iranian president invited the Pakistani prime minister to visit Tehran, and in return, Sharif renewed his invitation to Pezeshkian to visit Islamabad,” the report read.
Dar appreciates China’s support
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Sunday spoke with his Chinese counterpart and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Wang Yi, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.
Briefing the Chinese minister on the current regional situation, Dar “categorically rejected India’s unilateral and illegal actions, as well as its baseless propaganda against Pakistan”.
Expressing deep appreciation for China’s consistent and unwavering support, Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s “strong commitment to the iron-clad  friendship” between the two countries and the “shared vision of an all-weather strategic cooperative partnership”.
“He emphasised Pakistan’s determination to further deepen bilateral cooperation across all spheres,” the statement read.
It added that both sides “reiterated their firm resolve to uphold regional peace and stability, promote mutual respect and understanding, and jointly oppose unilateralism and hegemonic policies”.
“They agreed to maintain close communication and coordination at all levels to advance their shared objectives of peace, security, and sustainable development in the region and beyond.”</p><small>2025-04-27 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602029-pakistans-2019-strike-delivered-chilling-message-to-indian-military-leadership' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's 2019 strike delivered chilling message to Indian military leadership</strong></a><br><p>

Alongside world leaders and reigning monarchs, an estimated 400,000 people turned out on Saturday for the Argentine pontiff’s funeral at the Vatican and burial in Rome.
The crowds were a testament to the popularity of Francis, an energetic reformer who championed the poorest and most vulnerable.
Many of those mourning the late pope, who died on Monday aged 88, expressed anxiety about who would succeed him.
“He ended up transforming the Church into something more normal, more human,” said Romina Cacciatore, 48, an Argentinian translator living in Italy.
 


“I’m worried about what’s coming.”
On Monday morning, at 9:00am (0700 GMT), cardinals will hold their fifth general meeting since the pope’s death, at which they are expected to pick a date for the conclave.
Held behind locked doors in the frescoed Sistine Chapel, the election of a pope has been a subject of public fascination for centuries.
Cardinal-electors will cast four votes per day until one candidate secures a two-thirds majority, a result broadcast to the waiting world by burning papers that emit white smoke.
Luxembourg Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich said last week he expected the conclave to take place on May 5 or 6 — shortly after the nine days of papal mourning, which ends on May 4.
German Cardinal Reinhard Marx told reporters on Saturday the conclave would last just “a few days”.
Left his mark
Francis’s funeral was held in St Peter’s Square in bright spring sunshine, a mix of solemn ceremony and an outpouring of emotion for the Church’s first Latin American pope.
More crowds gathered on Sunday for the opening for public viewing of his simple marble tomb at the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, his favourite church in Rome.
Francis was buried in an alcove of the church, becoming the first pope in more than a century to be interred outside the Vatican.
“It was very emotional” to see his tomb, said 49-year-old Peruvian Tatiana Alva, who wiped away tears after joining hundreds of others filing past the burial place.
“He was very kind, humble. He used language young people could understand. I don’t think the next pope can be the same but I hope he will have an open mind and be realistic about the challenges in the world right now.”
 
 

A couple of hours after opening, the large basilica was packed, the crowds periodically shushed over speakers.
Among the mourners were pilgrims and Catholic youth groups who had planned to attend the Sunday canonisation of Carlo Acutis, which was postponed after Francis died.
Raphael De Mas Latrie, 45, from France, had been bringing his nine-year-old son to the canonisation but they attended the funeral instead, saying they “really appreciated” Francis’s defence of the environment.
“Today in this material world his message made a lot of sense, particularly to young people,” he said.
He added that Francis’s successor did not have to be his likeness, for “every pope has a message for the world today”.
In his homily at the funeral, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re highlighted the Jesuit pope’s defence of migrants, relentless calls for peace and belief that the Church was a “home for all”.
“I hope we get another pope as skilled as Francis at speaking to people’s hearts, at being close to every person, no matter who they are,” 53-year-old Maria Simoni from Rome said.
Many of the mourners expressed hope that the next pope would follow Francis’s example, at a time of widespread global conflict and growing hard-right populism.
Marx said the debate over the next pope was open, adding: “It’s not a question of being conservative or progressive… The new pope must have a universal vision.”
Pray for ourselves
More than 220 of the Church’s 252 cardinals were at Saturday’s funeral. They will gather again on Sunday afternoon at Santa Maria Maggiore to pay their respects at Francis’s tomb.
There will also be a mass at St Peter’s Basilica at 10:30am (0830 GMT) on Sunday, led by Pietro Parolin, who was secretary of state under Francis and is a front-runner to become the next pope.
Only cardinals under the age of 80 are eligible to vote in the conclave. There are 135 currently eligible — most of whom Francis appointed himself.
But experts caution against assuming they will choose someone like him.
Francis, a former archbishop of Buenos Aires who loved being among his flock, was a very different character to his predecessor Benedict XVI, a German theologian better suited to books than kissing babies.
Benedict in turn was a marked change from his Polish predecessor, the charismatic, athletic and hugely popular John Paul II.
Francis’s changes triggered anger among many conservative Catholics and many of them are hoping the next pope will turn the focus back to doctrine.
Some cardinals have admitted the weight of the responsibility that faces them in choosing a new head of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics.
“We feel very small,” Hollerich said last week. “We have to make decisions for the whole Church, so we really need to pray for ourselves.”</p><small>2025-04-27 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/27141517c37aad4.png?r=141532' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906922/london-hoping-to-host-2029-world-athletics-championships' target='_blank'><strong>London hoping to host 2029 World Athletics Championships</strong></a><br><p>London hopes to host the 2029 World Athletics Championships, the Mayor of London and Athletic Ventures announced on Sunday ahead of the 45th running of the London Marathon.
A formal expression of interest will be submitted to World Athletics in September, with the bid contingent on securing 45 million pounds ($59.91 million) in government support.
A feasibility study projects a record-breaking economic and social impact of over 400 million pounds, UK Athletics, Mayor Sadiq Khan and Athletic Ventures said in a statement on Sunday.
Athletic Ventures is a joint venture between UK Athletics (UKA), Great Run Company and London Marathon Events.
London followed up on the 2012 Olympics by hosting a successful world championships in 2017, with sell-out crowds for all the evening sessions at the Olympic Stadium.
“London 2017 showed the world what this city and this country can do,” said UKA President Denise Lewis, who was part of the team that secured the 2017 bid.
“It was an incredible example of how we can unite behind a vision full stadiums, global energy, and a lasting impact. I know we can do it again in 2029.”
Sunday’s London Marathon provided the springboard for the announcement, with 56,000 runners expected to take part.
The bid for 2029 is part of a wider vision to redefine the delivery of major international events in the UK, said Lewis, the Olympic heptathlon gold medallist in 2000 in Sydney.

Pakistan established its first DNA test laboratory in Islamabad in 2006 with the assistance of China to investigate complicated terrorism and criminal cases.
The Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) will collect DNA samples from all over the province including prisoners in jails as well as criminals, especially habitual ones.
The database aims to enhance the efficiency of the criminal justice system and “timely” identification of crime suspects, said the spokesperson.
In this regard, on the instructions of Punjab Home Secretary Noorul Amin, a working group of experts has been formed to suggest a model for setting up the central DNA database.
The group will be headed by PFSA Director General Dr Muhammad Amjad, while its others members include Center of Excellence in Molecular Biology Director Prof Dr Muaz-ur-Rehman, King Edward Medical University Head of Biomedical Sciences Prof Dr Nighat Yasmin, DIG Athar Waheed and PFSA Director (Administration) Mirza Waleed Baig.
The working group has been instructed to submit its suggestions on the preparation and procedure of the central database to the home secretary within seven days.</p><small>2025-04-27 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/271105597dc4ef1.jpg?r=112102' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906915/iran-port-blast-death-toll-rises-to-25-as-fires-continue-blazing' target='_blank'><strong>Iran port blast death toll rises to 25 as fires continue blazing</strong></a><br><p>Fires were still blazing on Sunday after a massive explosion tore through Iran’s largest commercial port the day before, killing at least 25 people and leaving hundreds more injured, according to local media.
The blast occurred on Saturday at Shahid Rajaee Port in southern Iran, near the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of world oil output passes.
The port’s customs office said in a statement carried by state television that the explosion probably resulted from a fire that broke out at the hazardous and chemical materials storage depot. A regional emergency official said several containers had exploded.
The New York Times quoted a person with ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters, as saying that what exploded was sodium perchlorate — a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles.
Iranian news agency Tasnim, citing the provincial judiciary chief, gave an updated toll on Sunday of 25 people killed. State TV said around 800 people were injured.
Live footage on Sunday showed thick black smoke still visible at the scene.
“The fire is under control but still not out,” a state TV correspondent reported from the site around 20 hours after the blast.
The explosion was so powerful that it was felt and heard about 50 kilometres  away, Fars news agency reported.
Speaking Sunday at the scene, Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni said that “the situation has stabilised in the main areas” of the port.
He told state TV that workers had resumed loading containers and customs clearance.
Images from news agency IRNA on Saturday showed rescuers and survivors walking along a wide boulevard carpeted with debris after the blast at Shahid Rajaee, more than 1,000km south of Tehran.
Flames could be seen engulfing a truck trailer and blood stained the side of a crushed car, while a helicopter dropped water on massive black smoke clouds billowing from behind stacked shipping containers.
“The shockwave was so strong that most of the port buildings were severely damaged,” Tasnim news agency reported.
Mourning
Citing local emergency services, state TV reported that hundreds of casualties “have been transferred to nearby medical centres”, while the provincial blood transfusion centre issued a call for donations.
Saturday is the start of the working week in Iran, meaning the port would have been busy with employees.
Three Chinese nationals were “lightly injured”, China’s state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing its Bandar Abbas consulate.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed sympathy for the victims of the deadly blast, adding he had “issued an order to investigate the situation and the causes”.
The United Arab Emirates expressed “solidarity with Iran” over the explosion and Saudi Arabia sent condolences.
With choking smoke and air pollution spreading throughout the area, all schools and offices in Bandar Abbas, the nearby capital of Hormozgan province, have been ordered closed on Sunday to allow authorities to focus on the emergency effort, state TV said.
The health ministry urged residents to avoid going outside “until further notice” and to use protective masks.
Authorities declared three days of public mourning across the province.
The state-owned National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company said in a statement carried by local media that the explosion “has no connection” to its facilities, reporting no interruption to its work in Bandar Abbas.
The explosion came as Iranian and US delegations met in Oman for high-level talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, with both sides reporting progress.
While Iranian authorities so far appear to be treating the blast as an accident, it also comes against the backdrop of years of shadow war with regional foe Israel.
According to the Washington Post, Israel in 2020 launched a cyberattack targeting the Shahid Rajaee Port.</p><small>2025-04-27 07:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602011-pahalgam-attack-no-handshake-at-muted-pakistan-india-border-ceremony' target='_blank'><strong>Pahalgam attack: No handshake at muted Pakistan-India border ceremony</strong></a><br><p>

As players and officials of the participating teams were eligible for free accommodation and meals during their stay for the event in Johor Bahru, then PHF president retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar with his close relatives and friends — five persons — also went to Malaysia to witness the matches. But the organisers had not included them in the list of persons who had been invited.
A letter written on Feb 27, 2025, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was received at the PHF but addressed to the junior team’s manager, sought a deposit of 45,770 Malaysian ringgit ($10,349.35) for the hotel stay and meals.
When contacted, PHF secretary Rana Mujahid confirmed that the letter was received and added that the same had been forwarded to the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) citing all the expenditures of the said tour were borne by them.
Asked if the payment of $10,349.35 was not the bone of contention that denied Pakistan an invitation to participate in this year’s Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, Mujahid dispelled the impression saying that Azlan Shah Cup’s organisers and Johor Hockey Association were different identities.
“The Malaysian Hockey Federation has also not invited Japan this time, which has no case of default. In fact, Malaysians had sought higher-ranked teams this year and unfortunately [currently] Pakistan is not included among world’s top teams,” the PHF secretary said when contacted by Dawn.
According to a letter, then acting PHF secretary general Shahid Parvez Bhandara had requested the PSB to organise a camp for the Azlan Shah Cup and also demanded TA/DA, food and accommodation for the camp.
Meanwhile, it is learnt that Brig Khokhar during the 2023 event went to Malaysia with some family members and PHF officials. The visit was not compulsory, particularly if he was not invited.
“I don’t know if the PHF president was invited by the organisers but yes we received a letter and it was forwarded to the PSB,” the PHF secretary said.
 
 

It may be mentioned here that the PHF due to the country’s unprecedented decline in international hockey and corruption scandals from 2008 to 2022 is already facing severe criticism by several former Olympians and hockey lovers.
The Auditor General of Pakistan had included 113 paras as objections in its audit reports for the 2008-2022 period and the cases in this regard had been handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). However, it seems that the FIA for several years has been working at a snail’s pace in all cases.

OPENING WORD
My March 30 cover story in these pages, How to Counter the Insurgencies, got respectable traction. That makes me happy, as it would any writer. Unsurprisingly though, my reference to dealing with the separatist insurgency in Balochistan as primarily a political problem has elicited some responses that one might describe as negative or, more charitably, as sceptical. This article is an attempt to posit some of those responses and to try and respond to them as best as I can.
LIST OF RESPONSES
A: One sceptic asked me if a politico-democratic approach is the best way to deal with insurgencies. The argument implicit in this view is that insurgent violence cannot be countered through strategies that tie the state’s hand through laws and rules of engagement, especially when the insurgent — or terrorist, if you will — is free to resort to innovative violence that is often, as is the case in Balochistan, also directed towards non-Baloch ethnic groups and flouts the accepted rules of engagement.
According to this argument, the problem is exacerbated by the insurgents’ use of social media and disinformation and through the political activism of “soft separatists” who use the legal-constitutional compact to make the job of security forces and intelligence agencies even more difficult.
Corollary: unfortunate though it is, the state has to suspend the normal operations of law to deal with the insurgency — ie let’s ignore voices calling for a political process until the insurgency (or its terror component) is dealt with.

The issue of how to deal with the insurgency and dissent in Balochistan continues to divide people and often elicits the most entrenched, if not predictable, responses. Ejaz Haider attempts to answer the most common critiques of the contention that they should be dealt with primarily as a political problem…

B: Who should the state talk to? The insurgents are bent on perpetrating violence while the Baloch leaders have no real roadmap to offer to the state. This argument has many moving parts that, unlike a machine’s, are not synchronic.
B-1: Sardars [tribal chieftains] are not relevant anymore so there’s no point talking to them.
B-2: The insurgency now involves educated, middle-class professionals who do not want to talk to the state.
B-3: The political opposition in Balochistan basically comprises “soft separatists” who do not condemn violence and are in cahoots with the insurgents/terrorists.
B-4: The army has tried multiple times, through various initiatives, to incentivise the Baloch to accept the federal structure. They don’t bite.
B-5: Multiple development schemes and monies associated with them have not worked. The Baloch just don’t want to talk.
Corollary: the only way to go about this problem is to improve and sustain counterinsurgency (COIN) operations and to bring the violence down to manageable levels. Once again, as with A, the bottomline is: we have to suspend some rights to deal with the situation.
Let’s try and unpack this, beginning with A.
COUNTER-ARGUMENTS
The argument encapsulated in A above, and all it entails, is not a novel view, nor is it peculiar to Pakistan. Debates over how to tackle insurgencies and/or internal low-intensity conflicts have raged in several states confronted with the problem.
States have employed various strategies in combatting internal threats and those strategies almost invariably have had a coercive component that operates outside the law — exceptions, if you will, to the normal operation of law and functioning of the courts.
In more extreme cases, states have resorted to collective punishment of insurgent populations, extra-judicial killings through death squads (Latin America has been notable in this regard, though it’s not an exception), complete suspension of constitutional rights for the duration of such operations, introduction of draconian laws (India is a case in point) and even forced population displacements and relocations (you will be surprised how often this unethical stratagem has been used by states as a counterinsurgency tool).
The question then is: if states have been doing this, why can’t Pakistan do it?
There are three reasons why Pakistan should avoid using such measures: they are morally reprehensible (we are still living with the scars of East Pakistan); they do not work in the long run, even when there might be some initial successes (this runs through COIN literature like a motif); and using such ignoble means against one’s own ethnically distinct population groups sends a clear internal and external signal that the insurgents’ cause against the state was justified ab initio.
But before I proceed further, a word about “exception”. Exception creates a legal fiction but it’s been around. The Romans called it iustitium [literally, standstill or suspension of law]. But it should be evident that exception denotes exactly that — exception. It cannot be the norm. Also, measures taken in an emergency remain contentious even within that framework. Outside of that framework, they are generally considered illegal, unconstitutional, violative of rights and due process and, in many cases, downright criminal.
The ironic fact is that most modern states have come into being through secession. As American political scientist Bridget Coggins has noted, “Secessionism does not herald the emergence of every state, but it underlies most twentieth-century births.” America fought a war of independence to secede from the British crown. The northern states then fought a civil war to prevent the southern states from seceding. The first was about segregation; the second about integration, even if enforced.
Before World War I, states, especially strategically located ones (Central and Eastern Europe is an example), often died through conquests and were resurrected in some shape and form through armed insurgencies. Other parts of the planet that were colonised were considered terra nullius [literally, no man’s land]. Those lands were for the taking, as French author and politician Victor Hugo famously exhorted his fellow Europeans to go forth and colonise Africa: “God gives land to men. God offers Africa to Europe. Take it!”
Since World War II and the evolution of state sovereignty and state practice against occupation and annexation that dates back to the 19th century, states have generally stopped dying in the sense of being vanquished, occupied and annexed. Many, however, are riven by civil wars, insurgencies, and general lawlessness, what economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson would call “the Absent Leviathan.” Equally, in most such cases, the Leviathan became absent because it was despotic, forcing peoples to rise up, which then invited external predation.
Most analysts that use the state as a unit of analysis either shy away from the moral argument or dismiss it, arguing that moral considerations do not fit in with the realist framework or realpolitik. The argument is bogus: at best it betrays a lack of understanding of the realist framework; at worst it is a pernicious employment of terms in the service of policies that are dangerous.
If Realism had no room for a moral argument, German-American jurist and political scientist Hans Morgenthau would not have emerged as the foremost critic of America’s Vietnam misadventure. Deeply ironically, proponents of American intervention in Vietnam couched the savagery not in realist but “legal” and “moral” terms — opposing aggression, fighting for freedom. This approach was blasted by George Kennan, the doyen of the American strategist community, who “called for a return to policy-making which more clearly defined national interests.”
 

A Pakistani paramilitary ranger frisks a motorcyclist at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Quetta on August 27, 2024: the situation in Balochistan has become a microcosm of what is happening within the broader problem of power relations in Pakistan

As for the use of realpolitik interchangeably with “realism”, “realist” or raison d’ etat [reasons of state], it is best for interested readers to look for Professor John Bew’s brilliant history of the term and how “the true meaning of realpolitik remains occluded by the partisan way the word has been used in Anglo-American political discourse.”
The issue is neither mere semantics nor just academic. Policies have real-life consequences and, in situations requiring tools of violence, the price is human blood. But before we proceed further, let’s look at the direction of causality — ie what is the cause of an effect.
Take the arguments in B, basically A but with some specific questions. The problem is exacerbated when our views — I wouldn’t call them analysis — become incoherent. For instance, during one of the conversations regarding my previous article, a former senior establishment officer — after telling me that Sardar Akhtar Mengal (as also other sardars) are irrelevant to the current situation — went on to somewhat vehemently defend the absurd decision by the Balochistan government to not allow Mr Mengal and his party to express their opposition to the ongoing situation by marching on Quetta.
When I pointed out to him that if the argument that Mr Mengal is merely looking for brownie points is correct — and it might well be — then how does he explain the government’s response to Mr Mengal’s political protest? Surely, the government would do well to earn its own brownie points by letting Mr Mengal let off some steam, given his supposed irrelevance?

States have employed various strategies in combatting internal threats and those strategies almost invariably have had a coercive component that operates outside the law. The question then is: if states have been doing this, why can’t Pakistan do it? There are three reasons why Pakistan should avoid using such measures: they are morally reprehensible (we are still living with the scars of East Pakistan); they do not work in the long run, even when there might be some initial successes; and using such ignoble means against one’s own ethnically distinct population groups sends a clear internal and external signal that the insurgents’ cause against the state was justified ab initio.

Or is it that Mr Mengal might not be as irrelevant as he is made out to be? The only obvious way to square this non sequitur, of declaring Mr Mengal irrelevant and then giving him relevance, is for the government to decide that it has the space to be cussed without the necessity of developing a coherent policy.
Another interlocutor, again a very senior former establishment officer, told me that the top army commander in Balochistan had requested to meet with Mr Mengal repeatedly but the latter had not bothered to respond to those invitations. When I asked my interlocutor if he had entertained the thought that Mr Mengal might just be signalling that the very meeting with the top army commander is the problem rather than a solution, he was somewhat flummoxed.
I had to explain: “Sir, if one of the major problems behind Baloch grievances is the governance and political structure that is dominated by the army, would it be good strategy by a protesting Baloch politician to accept such an invitation and, by doing so, signal his acceptance of something that he is protesting against?
This is where “who should the state talk to” becomes “there’s no one to talk to” and therefore the only solution is (a) to find collaborators from within the population and (b) treat the rest of the population as enemies of the state in and through policies that suspend the normal operation of law and the constitution.
This is not my interpretation. It is the very essence of the argument I am countering. If the sardars are irrelevant, the middle class supportive of the insurgency and the political opposition are “soft separatists”, then it is a war against an entire ethnolinguistic group — a war without end, unless the state can either completely subjugate that ethnic group or exterminate it. Need anyone mount an argument to establish the moral abomination of this approach?
A CHICKEN-AND-EGG PROBLEM?
What causes insurgencies? It’s easier to determine the causes where people rise up against foreign domination or colonial occupation. We are not dealing with those cases. The issue at hand is the question about why a particular group within a state takes to armed resistance.
Analysing this is important, not just in terms of determining the direction of causality in and of itself. The issue of causality must also inform the strategies the state has to employ to address the problem, especially if we can determine that a resistance group formed group identity because it failed to get the state to take cognisance of its grievances within the accepted legal-constitutional compact and through a socio-political process of aggregation of interests.
Let’s try to understand it through the problem of disarmament. How does one convince states to disarm without first creating an atmosphere of trust between them. Put another way, as Spanish diplomat and writer Salvador de Madariaga once did, do states distrust each other because they are armed or are they armed because they distrust each other?
After a while, the causality becomes bidirectional. States distrust each other so they arm themselves and because X is arming itself, Y and Z must too — until it becomes an arms race.
Does a political process lead to lessening of violence or does the state need to put down violence to make space for a political process? This obviously throws up the question of whether one can indeed look at this issue linearly and sequentially — that A would lead to B which is then supposed to lead to C.
Let’s take stock of the situation once again. At some point, a group within the state decides it wants to secede, exit being the only option after voice has failed and loyalty makes no sense. It has to mobilise. Mobilisation requires identity formation, which needs a marker, an ideology or a distinct ethno-linguistic uniformity.
 

Activists from the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) hold posters of Mahrang Baloch during a protest demanding her release in Karachi on March 24, 2025: the new term “soft separatist” is being bandied about to establish that even those who are without guns but protesting nonetheless have to be put down because, in the end, they are as “disloyal” to the state as the insurgent who is armed and bent on violence

It would then launch a struggle against the state. That could be armed, unarmed or a combination of the two. It would also require to win adherents within the state and outside. Sometimes, as happened in the case of East Pakistan, it would reach out to external state actors to recognise the struggle and support the group covertly or overtly.
These phases are not necessarily sequential. They can overlap. Mobilisation is never smooth and, despite identity formation, there can be competing groups within the struggle. If we consider these phases as “choke points”, as American political scientist Peter Krause does, then the state can formulate policies to disrupt the struggle at each of these choke points.
During The Troubles, the period in Northern Ireland from roughly 1969 to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, the British went through many phases in trying to put down the Irish insurgency. They created the Diplock Courts, which did away with jury trials and where a single judge would hand down sentences. Doing away with the juries was owed to cases of perverse acquittals and because members would often be intimidated. Even so, the Diplock Courts garnered much criticism.
At the operational level, the British forces relied, for the most part, if not always, on intelligence-based, discriminatory operations and avoided provoking the population. Also, their main operational thrust was on netting the IRA leaders rather than using scorched earth policies to kill foot soldiers and civilians.
But discriminatory action requires first-class intelligence and highly trained forces with the will to not be trigger-happy. In low-intensity conflicts, this is not an easy feat to achieve. But that is precisely what high-standard training is meant to achieve. It also implies rules of engagement that are supposed to give the state a high moral perch.
It should be obvious that, just like diagnosing a disease early, it is easier for the state to reach out early to the insurgent group during the mobilisation and identity formation phases — even early in the armed struggle phase. This is also the critical juncture in terms of deciding whether politics will take the lead with the kinetic as back-up or the other way round — ie using force to inform the group that they have no choice but to talk.
In the early stages of a brewing conflict, prudent states would try to rely on dealing with the problem politically. This is not to say that the state would allow the hardliners among the secessionists to run amok. But the use of force or the threat of its use would not be the focal point of the policy.
At the stage where things have already gone out of joint, we always run the risk of being tempted into hard responses. Blood spilled on both sides hardens attitudes. Anger and revenge upstage prudence and equanimity. That’s the most dangerous stage of COIN. One can assume that the state has already failed to prevent mobilisation and identity formation. Violence is now centre stage: the insurgent cannot win but, by entrenching identity and succeeding at mobilisation (recruitment), he continues for the long haul. He wins by not losing.
It should be obvious that, even at the advanced stage, the state can use the choke points of mobilisation and identity formation by reaching out to whoever it can reach out to and by addressing basic grievances. It’s not an easy task, because at this stage the insurgent will disrupt political processes and development schemes and kill those among the group he thinks are betraying the cause by working with the state.
The entire thrust of my previous article on the subject was to debunk linearity and easy solutions. I made two points: one, social policy space does not permit tame solutions because the problems are wicked. And the problems are wicked because policy must be formulated within a problem’s ecosystem, where the sub-systems and the impact of the policy on them become visible only after one begins to implement a policy. The problem is aggravated further because humans, psychologically, are prone to tailoring new data to fit the original hypothesis rather than reformulating the problematic on the basis of new data.
This is the perception problem: perceptions are quick to form but resistant to change. Intelligence analysts often try to circumvent this problem by pairing up an old hand with a new one to synergise their strengths: the old hand bringing in the longue duree [long duration] expertise and the fresh mind picking up new information and cancelling the old hand’s cognitive biases.
Without going into the complexity of the work done by Israeli psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky on fast (heuristics) and slow thinking, let it be said that we are all, to the last person, defined by such biases. Even the best have to train themselves to think slow to cancel our cognitive shortcuts and biases.
WHAT THEN?
This brings us to the problem of who governs Balochistan. No serious discussion to formulate policy can avoid this question. While it links up with the broader civil-military relations problem this country has been beset with, Balochistan stands at its extreme end. A number of factors, including historical memory, have gone into creating the problem whose latest iteration has been festering since the mid-noughties. The army’s predominance in the province and its influence on and machinations in the province’s politics stand out. It is this power equation that, inter alia, feeds the insurgency.
The security establishment is a state’s thin end of the wedge. In states with effective civilian oversight, the use of this thin end is dependent on political decision-making. The insurgent can, in theory, talk to the political principals. But how does he talk to the very force he is fighting against and which, in this case, not just represents the state but comes to the room as the state itself?
The other issue is how and when do you talk to the group which, in a manner of speaking, is a combo of Sinn Fein and the Irish Republican Army? In a recent manifestation of this problem, a judge in Quetta asked Baloch Yakjehti Committee’s incarcerated leader Dr Mahrang Baloch to sign an affidavit of loyalty to the state, a demand that had nothing to do with the case before him. By making this demand, instead of asking the prosecution for evidence against Dr Baloch, the judge, wittingly or unwittingly, created the very binary that agitates the Baloch.
This is where we come to the issue of “soft separatist.” This new term is being bandied about to establish that even those who are without guns but protesting nonetheless have to be put down because, in the end, they are as “disloyal” to the state as the insurgent who is armed and bent on violence. This is the basis of the question about who the state should talk to. One doesn’t need a vexing exercise in reflection to figure out what this means: if you don’t accept what exists, warts and all, and declare loyalty to the state, the state will sort you out — like it does the one with the gun.
If this approach denotes a political process then, to quote Dorothy Parker, the Statue of Liberty is located in Lake Ontario.
Those who are agitating (so far) within the legal-constitutional framework of this state are not enemies. They are precisely the people who the state must reach out to if it is indeed serious about a political process. But these are also people who walk not just a tightrope but a razor-edged one.
They have to deal with the insurgent, their unarmed support base and the state at a time when their relevance within the support base is grounded in the unarmed component of the movement. To ask them to file affidavits of loyalty and subjugate themselves to the state before the state would talk to them is egregious folly couched as informed policy.
They are useful because they still represent people who haven’t picked up the gun. To turn them into collaborators means killing their very usefulness in any political process. It is no surprise that these grotesqueries are primarily being mouthed by those politicians in Balochistan who are already state collaborators and represent no one. Far from being useful, they are instrumental in fanning the flames.
FINAL WORDS
Where the situation stands, there are no easy solutions. But there are solutions that can improve the environment and, by so doing, change the ecosystem incrementally. Did I say ecosystem? Yes, I did. And that implies situating what is happening within the broader problem of power relations in this country, of which Balochistan has become the microcosm.
I am not a betting person but roughly constituted as I am and from where I stand, even I am prepared to wager money on the unfortunate fact that the state, configured as it is, would not do the right thing. It’s not that there’s any dearth of good-intentioned people. There is none. But the system has evolved in a way and has enough collaborators to take on its own life and perpetuate itself.
As someone said, a bad system will beat a good person every time.

According to the Met department’s data, Dadu was the hottest place in the country with 48°C — 8°C higher temperature than the city’s average temperature in Aprils.
The maximum temperature in Shaheed Benazirabad was 46°C, followed by Jacobabad, Paddidan, Khairpur and Larkana (45.5°C), Mohenjo Daro and Rohri (45°C), Sakrand, Sukkur, Mirpurkhas and Chhor (44.5°C), Mithi (44°C), Hyderabad (43°C), Tandojam (42.5°C), Badin (42°C) and Thatta (41°C).
 
 

The data also indicated that the cities are also experiencing warm nights — a significant deviation from their respective monthly average temperatures in previous Aprils.
The ongoing heatwave across the province compelled the provincial government to set up hundreds of relief camps equipped with cold drinking water, shaded resting areas, and first aid facilities.
Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah directed the authorities to ensuring immediate relief to citizens with special focus wasis being given to the needs of vulnerable groups, including senior citizens, children, and outdoor workers.
The health department has been directed to operationalise heatwave prevention centres at all hospitals across the province, ensuring the availability of necessary medical staff and supplies to handle heatstroke and heat exhaustion cases, a spokesperson for the CS said, adding: “The Rescue 1122 services, municipal authorities, and district health teams have been placed on high alert.”
In addition, the energy secretary has been tasked with ensuring uninterrupted power supply across Sindh.
“Public awareness campaigns have also been launched to sensitise the population about preventive measures, such as staying hydrated, limiting outdoor activities during peak heat hours, and recognising early signs of heat-related illnesses,” the spokesperson said.
Heatwave to persist till 30th: Met Office
In Karachi, hot and humid conditions prevailed, with the temperature reaching 39°C during the daytime. Parts of the city, such as the areas of Gulistan-i-Jauhar and Jinnah Terminal with 40°C, were relatively hotter than Bin Qasim Town (33.3°C) and Sharea Faisal (37.5°C).
The department has forecast the continuation of heatwave conditions till April 30.
“The daytime maximum temperature is likely to remain 6-8°C above normal in Dadu, Kambar, Shahdadkot, Shaheed Benazirabad, Jacobabad, Kashmore, Ghotki, Shikarpur, Khairpur, Naushahro Feroze, Larkana, Sukkur, Jamshoro, Matiari, Tando Mohammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Hyderabad and Badin districts,” the department’s advisory says.
Similar weather conditions are likely to prevail in Tharparkar, Umerkot and Mirpurkhas districts with daytime temperature soaring to 4-6°C above normal, it adds.
In Karachi, the maximum temperature is expected to range from 36°C to 38°C, whereas relative humidity is likely to be 70-80 per cent and 45-55pc in the morning and evening hours, respectively.
In an attempt to provide relief to citizens, Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah has directed all divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners to take immediate action by establishing heatwave camps and initiating comprehensive precautionary measures to protect people from the effects of extreme heat.
According to a spokesperson for the chief secretary, 73 heatwave camps have been set up in Karachi.
Twenty each have been established in Shaheed Benazirabad and Naushahro Feroze while 24 and 19 camps have been set up in Nawabshah and Sanghar, respectively.
A total of 122 heatstroke wards are set up at healthcare facilities — including 45 in Nawabshah, eight in Naushahro Feroze and 69 in Sanghar.
In Sukkur division, 47 camps have been set up, including 12 in Sukkur, seven in Ghotki and 28 in Khairpur.
In Hyderabad division, 124 camps have been established in Badin, 88 in Dadu, 10 in Hyderabad city, 71 in Jamshoro, 42 in Matiari, four in Sujawal, 11 in Tando Allahyar, three in Tando Muhammad Khan and eight in Thatta.
In Larkana division, 71 camps have been set up in Kamber-Shahdadkot, 16 in Shikarpur, 41 in Jacobabad and seven in Kashmore-Kandhkot.
In Mirpurkhas division, 11 heatwave camps have been established in Umerkot, eight in Tharparkar and 25 in Mirpurkhas.

“Those who dare to attack the integrity of nuclear Pakistan will have to face consequences beyond their imagination,” president of the Pakistan Ex-servicemen Society (PESS) retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum said while talking to reporters at a book launch on Saturday.
He made it clear that Pakistan will not be intimidated by the hollow threats of India.
“In 1965 war, the Indian army, which wanted to occupy the city of Sialkot and have a gala at the Lahore Gymkhana Club, had to face humiliating defeat both at BRB link canal and in Chawinda tank battle,” he recalled.
“Pakistan Ex-servicemen Society like the entire nation stands shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces,” he declared.
Slamming India for attempts to malign Pakistan by unleashing a propaganda against it soon after the incident, he said it was clearly a false-flag operation.
He pointed out that the incident took place as deep as 400 kilometres inside held Kashmir.
Mr Qayyum said the timing of the incident made the entire episode of shooting all the more suspicious as it took place during a visit to India by US Vice President J.D. Vance.
 
 

He criticised India for “unilaterally” suspending the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty which even survived two wars between India and Pakistan.
The former army officer  termed the steps taken by the Modi government following the attack “an attempt to divert world’s attention” from death and destruction in the disputed territory.

These guidelines aim to promote trust, transparency, and accountability in AI-driven financial services while protecting the rights and interests of consumers.
In its Financial Stability Review 2024, the central bank noted that with AI adoption surging across different sectors, the global banking industry is also increasingly embracing these technologies.
 
 

In the case of Pakistan, financial institutions are also embracing AI technology. The most commonly adopted AI technologies by banks include robotics, process automation (for structured operational tasks), virtual assistant (for customer service), and machine learning techniques (for fraud detection and risk management).

SBP survey finds half of regulated entities have adopted AI tools

In 2024, the SBP surveyed 55 regulated entities (REs) to explore the current state, challenges, and future prospects of AI adoption within Pakistan’s financial services sector. The surveyed REs included commercial banks (conventional and Islamic), microfinance banks, digital banks, Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) and Payment Service Operators/Payment Service Providers (PSOs/PSPs).
The results of the SBP’s survey on using AI in banks reveal that about half of the REs have either deployed AI in financial services or are in the development process.
Moreover, the survey indicates that AI is being used for various financial services, including fraud detection, customer services, marketing, credit risk assessment, process automation, etc. In this context, banks need to take care of the associated risks of AIs and incorporate the carbon footprint of AI into their risk management frameworks, introducing it as a specific risk category.
This requires relevant risk identification, assessment, development and implementation of adequate risk mitigation strategies.
“The foremost step is to recognise the potential environmental risks associated with adopting AI systems,” said the report.
The most commonly used AI technologies in the banking sector are among the most energy-intensive owing to real-time processing and high accuracy requirements.
“After risk identification, banks need to measure the emissions associated with AI models throughout their life cycle,” said the report.
“Banks must implement risk mitigation strategies to contain the environmental impact of their AI systems. The energy-efficient AI models and algorithms could help address climate concerns,” said the report.
Notably, International Financing Reporting Standards (IFRS) S1 and S2 also require companies to disclose information about all sustainability-related risks and opportunities, specifically about climate-related exposures.
“In Pakistan, the adoption of these standards have been proposed in a phased manner, initially starting with listed companies based on certain criteria, such as total assets, turnover and number of employees,” said the report.
It deserves emphasis that banks must define risk appetite and tolerance level of AI’s carbon footprint, the report added. By setting thresholds, banks would ably deploy AI system balancing operational efficiency with environmental concerns, it added.
The report said that a highly important aspect of AI is to assess the systemic risks on financial institutions and their customers. For instance, high technological penetration and supplier concentration could expose financial institutions to losses arising from operational failures, cyber-attacks and supply chain disruptions affecting key vendors. Further, increased use of AI models with similar characteristics could augment asset price vulnerabilities due to increased correlations in financial markets.

In a statement on Saturday, the minister said that despite having a population seven times larger than Pakistan, an expansive landmass and centuries of statehood experience, India continues to suffer from an insecurity syndrome.
In contrast, he added, Pakistan, with just 77 years of statehood and a comparatively smaller geography and population, exhibits greater composure and maturity.
 






Referring to the tragic Jaffar Ex­­press terrorist attack in Balo­chis­tan, Ahsan Iqbal noted that Pakis­tan responded in a responsible and mature manner by acknowledging internal security lapses and committing to addressing them, even while credible evidence pointed towards foreign involvement.
Conversely, he observed, India’s reaction to the Pahalgam tragedy in held Kashmir was impulsive and reactive, and rather than acknowledging its own security shortcomings, it hastily shifted blame onto Pakistan without any substantiated evidence.

PFUJ slams Modi govt for fuelling war-like atmosphere

‘War-like atmosphere’
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) has strongly condemned the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for pursuing a policy that fosters a war-like atmosphere in the region and undermines peace and harmony.
In a joint statement, PFUJ Acting President Khalid Khokhar and Secretary General Arshad Ansari called for an immediate halt to India’s uncalled for decision to suspend relations with Pakistan, particularly in areas such as the Indus Waters Treaty, trade and commerce, over an incident that remains under investigation and appears to be a false flag operation staged in Pahalgam, seemingly for political gains and to stir regional tension.
They pointed out that Pahalgam is located nearly 200km from the LoC and is heavily patrolled by Indian Bor­d­­er Security Force and the army, ma­­king the incident highly suspicious.
The PFUJ leadership warned that hostilities between the two nei­ghbouring countries would only wo­­rsen bilateral relations rather than help bridge the already wide gap — created solely by the policies of India’s BJP-led government, which they said prioritises Hindutva ideology over secularism, a value India has upheld since its independence.
“Investigate the cause of the Pahalgam incident first, instead of blaming Pakistan for your own incompetence,” they added.
The PFUJ leadership also criticised the Indian media for promoting a policy of hate-mongering through the dissemination of false and fake content, a hallmark of Indian media during times of heightened tensions.

• Commissioner says flood wave passes Muzaffarabad without causing damage
LAHORE/MUZ­AFFARABAD: An unusual surge in the water level of River Jhelum — attributed by officials to snowmelt but feared by locals as flash floods released by India after suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) — has triggered panic among the residents of Muzaffarabad and surrounding areas.
“A rise in the water level in River Jhelum at Muzaffarabad was recorded, leaving residents panicked. They thought it was a flash flood released by India upstream,” a local resident told Dawn. “People kept watching the river, trying to check if any debris had come, like it does during flood seasons, but they couldn’t find anything,” he added.
A daily water situation report issued by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) also confirmed an increase in water flow levels in River Jhelum. However, an officer from the Met Department’s Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) dismissed the concerns, stating the rise was part of usual seasonal flows.
 
 

“Typically, these days we see up to 50,000 cusecs in River Jhelum. As of now (April 26), we have 47,000 cusecs, which doesn’t even qualify as a low flood in the river,” Akhtar Mahmood, the FFD deputy director, explained to Dawn on Saturday. “A low flood in River Jhelum ranges between 75,000 and 110,000 cusecs,” he added.
He further clarified that water levels in all rivers typically rise during this period due to snowmelt and rainfall in the catchment areas. “The water level in River Jhelum at Manga always rises this time of year (until June 15) due to snowmelt, followed by monsoon rains. Similarly, water rising in the Indus at Tarbela is 80 per cent due to snowmelt,” he said.
“At times, the rise in Jhelum’s water level could also be due to the cleaning of a mini-reservoir at the Kishanganga run-of-the-river hydroelectric project. But I believe this rise is due to increased temperatures melting snow,” he concluded.
Unusual surge
The Muzaffarabad division commissioner said on Saturday that an unusual surge in the flow of River Jhelum was recorded after India released water into the river.
Speaking to Dawn, Chaudhry Guftar Hussain said that while the normal flow of the river in Muzaffarabad remained around 18 cumecs (cubic metres per second), it swelled to 26.4 cumecs at around 12:15pm. However, the flow reduced to 22 cumecs within an hour, he added.
Despite the sudden increase, the flood wave passed through the territorial limits of Muzaffarabad without causing any loss or damage, he said.
Mr Hussain said that so far, no adverse impact had been reported from the low-lying areas adjacent to the river, which are generally vulnerable to such surges. Nevertheless, he advised residents to continue exercising caution, particularly while moving near the riverbanks, as a preventive measure.
Water release
The Indus River System Authority (Irsa) on Saturday released 118,500  cusecs of water from various rim stations with inflow of 129,400 cusecs,  APP reported. According to data, the water level in River Indus at Tarbela Dam was 1431.43 feet, which was 29.43 feet higher than its dead level of 1402.00 feet. Water inflow and outflow in the dam was recorded as 39,100 cusecs and 43,300 cusecs, respectively.
The water level in River Jhelum at Mangla Dam was 1129.60 feet, which  was 79.60 feet higher than its dead level of 1,050 feet. The inflow and  outflow of water was recorded 47,100 cusecs and 32,000 cusecs,  respectively.
The release of water at Kalabagh, Taunsa, Guddu and Sukkur was recorded as 62,700, 44,300, 34,800 and 7,400 cus­ecs, respectively. Similarly, from River Kabul, 22,400 cusecs of water were released at Nowshera and 12,500 cusecs from River Chenab at Marala.

• Shehbaz warns efforts to divert water to be responded to ‘with full force and might’
• FM Dar speaks to counterparts from several countries, discusses tensions with India
• UNSC slams Pahalgam attack; UN chief spokesperson says Guterres paying ‘very close attention’ to conflict
ISLAMABAD: As the fallout of the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians continues to reverberate across the region, Pakistan on Saturday called for an independent investigation into the deadly attack while also criticising India for leveling “baseless allegations” without a credible investigation or evidence.
“Continuing with its role as a responsible country, Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent, and credible investigation,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said during the passing-out parade of cadets at the Pakistan Military Academy.
PM Shehbaz emphasised Pakistan’s stance against terrorism, saying, “Pakis­tan has always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations as the world’s frontline state against terrorism.” He also criticised India for what he described as a “pattern of exploitation” by leveling “baseless allegations and false accusations without credible investigation or verifiable evidence.”
He also drew a hard line on the issue of water resources, stressing continued water flow under the Indus Waters Treaty as a red line. “Water is a vital national interest of Pakistan, our lifeline,” he said. “Any attempt to stop, reduce, or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan under the Indus River Treaty would be responded to with full force and might.”
 
 

He vowed that Pakistan would not be deterred from supporting the Kashmir cause, stating, “Let there be no doubt Pakistan shall continue to support the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people till they achieve their rights through their great struggle and sacrifices.”
New Delhi did not immediately respond to Pakistan’s offer.
The offer by the prem­i­­er came as several count­ries, including Iran, Saudi Ara­bia, China and the Uni­­­ted Kingdom, intensified diplomatic efforts to ease tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
The Chinese and British envoys met with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday, while Mr Dar also spoke to his counterparts from Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Egypt. All these discussions were dominated by the Pahalgam attack.
Tensions between the two countries soared in the aftermath of the attack as India took a series of harsh measures, including suspending the Indus Water Treaty, downgrading diplomatic relatio­­ns, revoking visas for Pakistani na­­­tionals — including those und­er the South Asian Associa­tion for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) visa exemption scheme — and halting bilateral trade. Security measures were also heightened.
Pakistan mirrored India’s steps and went further by banning Ind­ian airliners from using its airspa­­ce and warning it could suspend all bilateral agreements, including the landmark Simla Agree­ment, which underpins rela­­tions between the two countries.
While India has stopped short of directly blaming Pakistan, officials have hinted at cross-border involvement, a claim Islamabad has firmly denied.
UNSC slams attack
The UN Security Council also condemned the “terrorist” attack in the Indian occupied Kashmir, as the 15-member body also released Pakistan’s statement outlining its retaliatory countermeasures to New Delhi’s “reckless” steps announced in the wake of the April 22 incident.
 
 

In a press statement cited by the state-run APP, the council members called for accountability and international cooperation to bring the perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack to justice.
They expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the governments of India and Nepal, extending wishes for a speedy recovery to those injured in the attack.
Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, the council members reaffirmed. They underscored that such acts are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomever committed.
The council members urged all states, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with all relevant authorities.
They reaffirmed the need for states to combat by all means threats to international peace and security resulting from acts of terrorism, in accordance with the UN Cha­rter and other obligations under international law.
Meanwhile, the UN Security Council released the press statement issued at the conclusion of Pakistan’s National Security Committee meeting, which was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday, as an official document. The Pakistani statement contained the retaliatory decisions taken during the NSC’s deliberations.
In a letter, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad transmitted the statement to the UN Security Council President for April, Jerome Bonnafont of France, on Friday.
“The letter has been issued as an official document of the Security Council under the agenda item ‘India-Pakistan Qu­­estion’,” the council president told the members.
Separately, a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the UN chief was paying “very close attention” to the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.
“I don’t agree with your comment, (but) we are paying very close attention to the situation bet­ween India and Pakistan,” Spok­esperson Stephane Duja­rric told a New York Post reporter at the regular noon briefing at UN Hea­dquarters in New York.
Following a question from APP whether the UN chief planned to speak to the leaders of India and Pakistan on his return from Rome, Mr Dujarric said that he hoped to have something on it later. At this, the Post reporter commented, “Amazing, by the way, two nuclear countries … might go to war may merit such little attention…?” “I don’t agree with your comment (but) we are paying very close attention to the situation between India and Pakistan,” Mr Dujarric responded.

The participants of the rally, led by PkMAP Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal and Dr Hamid Achakzai, gathered in Quetta Metropolitan Corporation compound before the rally. They chanted slogans against the deportation of Afghan refugees and Peca Act.
They marched on various streets of the provincial capital carrying party flags, placards and banners inscribed with their demands.
The rally after reaching Manan Chowk converted into a public meeting which was addressed by Mr Ziaratwal, Dr Abdul Hamid Khan Achakzai, Abdul Haq Abdal, and others.
The speakers told the protesters that Afghan refugees came to Pakistan through UNHCR and spent over 40 years in the country. They made social relations with local people, established their business along with the people of Pakistan and now the government is sending them back to Afghanistan forcibly instead of giving them citizenship, the gathering was told.
They said that the West granted citizenship to those people who spend five years while the Pakistan government sent them after 40 long years. They demanded that Afghan “Kadwal” should not be repatriated rather be given Pakistani Citizenship and as Pakistani citizens will spend their lives peacefully according to the constitution and law of the land.
They condemned the treatment being done with the Afghan refugees while sending them to their country as said that their three generations during their stay as refugees obtained medical, engineering and other disciplines in Pakistani universities. They said that Afghan refugees should be recognized Pakistani citizen and issued citizenship certificate.

The warning was issued on World Malaria Day, as both WHO and Pakistan  called on all stakeholders to urgently intensify efforts to contain the  growing threat to the country and the region.
“Malaria is a major global threat, and we are seeing firsthand how  climate change is increasing both the risk and the cases in our  country,” said Federal Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal. “Despite  challenges, Pakistan is fully committed to end this disease. It is not  just a health imperative — it is an investment in a healthier, more  equitable, safer, and more prosperous future for every nation.”
Under the international theme, “Reinvest, reimagine,  reignite,” WHO urged all stakeholders to join the big push to end malaria and support Pakistan’s efforts so that the response is not  undermined by a lack of resources.

Floods and rising temperatures have been identified as major factors to the surge in cases, with a reported peak of 2.7 million cases in 2023

The catastrophic 2022 floods triggered 6.6 million additional cases  over the 2022–2024 period — including a peak of 2.7 million cases in  2023, compared to 399,097 cases in 2021. As a result, the malaria burden  in WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region surged to an estimated 10.2  million cases in 2023 — a 137 per cent increase compared to 2015.
Despite the challenges, significant progress has been made over the  past decade in prevention and treatment. In partnership with WHO and  with support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and  Malaria, Pakistan screened more than 11.4 million suspected cases in  2024 and treated 2 million confirmed malaria patients.
Additionally, 7.8m insecticide-treated nets were distributed  in 22 high-burden districts, contributing to a reduction in cases from  2.7m in 2023 to 2m last year.
“WHO is proud to partner with Pakistan to continue saving lives by  preventing and treating malaria,” said Dr. Dapeng Luo, WHO  Representative in Pakistan. “We have proven that investing in malaria  response saves lives, but we are also seeing how climate change is  hampering progress, posing a threat not only for Pakistan, but also for  the region and the world. We know how to end malaria, and we can do it  if all stakeholders invest and work together to reinforce the response  and adapt to the new risks triggered by climate change.”
According to data from 5,575 medical facilities across 80 endemic  districts, climate change and related impacts such as rising  temperatures and frequent flooding have led to an upward trend in  malaria cases and heightened risk of outbreaks.
Other contributing  factors include increasing poverty, limited access to quality  diagnostics and treatment, deteriorating security in Balochistan, tribal  areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and health care access issues in Sindh.
Evidence  shows that malaria control efforts are effective, but sustained and  coordinated action will be essential to mitigate the effects of climate  change, save lives and secure a healthier future for Pakistan.

Elected members of the GB Assembly, religious leaders, civil society members, and students participated in the rallies.
The marchers announ­ced their unflinching support to Pakistan’s armed forces to defend the country from any misadventure from India. They also carried placards inscribed with slogans such as “GB will never allow illegal occupation of water”.

Speaking at a news briefing at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, at the conclusion of his visit to attend the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group, Mr Aura­ngzeb disclosed that Pakistan has asked China to augment its existing currency swap line by an additional 10 billion yuan (approximately $1.4bn).
Pakistan currently mainta­ins a 30bn yuan swap line with China. “From our perspective, getting to 40bn renminbi would be good,” the minister said.
Explaining Islamabad’s priorities, Mr Aurangzeb emphasised that addressing the trade imbalance with the US was more important for Pakistan than the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs. He noted that President Trump was determined to boost US exports to trading partners as part of his broader trade agenda.

Aurangzeb requests China to boost yuan swap line

Currently, Pakistan exports approximately $5.2bn worth of goods to the US, while imports from the United States stand at around $2bn, creating a surplus of about $3.2bn in Pakistan’s favour. “We are looking at the possibility of addressing this imbalance by importing more goods such as American cotton and soybean,” he said.
The minister added that following President Trump’s ann­ouncement of new tariffs, Pak­istan’s ambassador in Washing­ton contacted the United States Trade Representative (USTR) the very next day. “Now a delegation will come for formal talks. The date of the visit will be decided after I return to Islamabad,” he said.
Indus Waters Treaty dispute
Asked if Pakistan had sought the World Bank’s intervention after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty last week, Mr Aurangzeb responded: “If required, we will come to it when it’s appropriate.”
The 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, brokered by the World Bank, governs the use of rivers shared by India and Pakistan and recognizes the Bank’s arbitral role in resolving disputes. So far, both nations have eng­aged with the World Bank to address differences under the treaty.
Mr Aurangzeb said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet have already deliberated on the issue and were prepared to move forward. “We condemn terrorism wherever it happens. We want good relations with all our neighbors but it takes two to tango,” he remarked.
He added that tensions between India and Pakistan were “a part of life” and stressed the need to “move with it and move on”.
Asked about the potential economic fallout from the recent tensions following the killing of 26 people at a tourist site earlier this month, the minister acknowledged that it was “not going to be helpful.”
Diplomatic sources told Dawn that due to the busy schedule of World Bank officials during the Spring Meetings, Pakistani diplomats could not immediately raise the issue. “We are also waiting for instructions from Islamabad to proceed,” the sources said.
China commitments, Panda Bond plans
During his meetings in Washington, Mr Aurangzeb also engaged with Chinese officials, including Finance Minister Lan Fo’an, to seek extensions in Pakistan’s debt repayment schedules and additional financial support.
He confirmed that Pakistan has asked China to extend the repayment period for its guaranteed debt and to increase the existing $4.3bn currency swap arrangement, aiming to bolster Pakistan’s critically low foreign exchange reserves. “He was assured that China would roll over Pakistan’s $4bn cash deposit with the IMF,” officials said.
Discussions with China also included the rescheduling of debt owed to the Chinese Export-Import (Exim) Bank during the duration of Pakistan’s ongoing IMF programme. Pakistan is seeking to reschedule debt maturities until September 2027. Aurangzeb noted that a similar request had been made to China last year, but formal approval was still pending.
Pakistan has also made significant progress in preparations to issue its first “Panda Bond” — a bond issued on China’s domestic market, denominated in yuan. Talks with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Asian Develop­ment Bank (ADB) for providing credit enhancements for the bond issue had been “constructive”, Mr Aurangzeb said.
“We want to diversify our lending base and we have made some good progress around that — we are hoping that during this calendar year we can do an initial print,” he added.
China has been actively promoting currency swap arrangements with emerging economies like Argentina and Sri Lanka in recent years as part of its broader strategy to internationalize the yuan.
Progress with IMF
Mr Aurangzeb said he also expects the IMF Executive Board to approve, in early May, the staff-level agreement for a new $1.3bn arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing $7bn bailout programme.
Approval from the board would trigger the disbursement of a $1bn tranche under the programme, which Pakistan secured in 2024. The IMF programme has played a critical role in stabilising Pakistan’s fragile economy, providing much-needed external financing and boosting market confidence.

Talking to the media on Saturday, the minister said that Pakistan’s stance on the Indus Waters Treaty was “clear and firm”. He said the treaty could only be revoked through mutual consent between Pakistan and India and could not be unilaterally suspended.
He said that Pakistan has an undeniable right over every single drop of water under the treaty. He further said that India’s baseless statement only damaged its credibility on the global stage, highlighting India’s involvement in terrorist activities across various countries, including Canada.
 
 

Pakistan would not allow even a single drop of water from its rivers to be diverted unlawfully, he said.
“No one can steal the water of our rivers,” he said, adding that international bodies are already engaged in the matter to ensure a fair resolution.
Speaking at the second convocation of Ghazi University in Dera Ghazi Khan, Mr Leghari said terrorism remained a national challenge and vowed that the government fully supported all efforts to eradicate it.
He said he supported a public Jirga recently held by Mir Badshah Qaisrani in support of law enforcement agencies, saying, “We endorse every measure taken in the defence of the country.”
The federal minister affirmed that Pakistan was fully capable of defending itself.
He also reiterated that the fight against terrorism would continue until its complete eradication, emphasising the unflinching resolve of the country’s armed forces and law enforcement agencies. However, he criticised former prime minister Imran Khan for allegedly allowing the return of 40,000 terrorists from Afghanistan, stating that Pakistan was still dealing with the consequences of that decision.
Meanwhile, a letter purported to be from India’s water resources ministry — circulating on social media — appeared to officially convey New Delhi’s wish to suspend implementation of the IWT.
Dawn could not immediately verify the authenticity of the letter, written by India’s Jal Shakti ministry secretary Ms Debashree Mukherjee to Pakistan’s ministry of water resources secretary Syed Ali Murtaza on April 24.
Neither the minister for water resources nor the Indus Water Commissioner responded to Dawn’s requests for confirmation and comment on the letter’s contents.

Trump told TIME magazine that talks were taking place and that Chinese President Xi Jinping had called him, an assertion he repeated to reporters as he was leaving the White House on Friday morning for Rome to attend the funeral of Pope Francis.
“China and the US are NOT having any consultation or negotiation on #tariffs,” China shot back in a foreign ministry statement posted by the Chinese embassy in the US. 
“The US should stop creating confusion.” 
Trump, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One later on Friday, said it would be a win if China would open up its markets for US products and that tariffs could make that happen.
“Free up China. You know, let us go in and work China,” he said. “That would be great. That would be a big win, but I’m not even sure I’m going to ask for it because they don’t want it open.” 
On Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing abides by international rules on US-imposed tariffs and would seek solidarity with other countries.
“Certain countries adhere to their own priorities, engage in bullying pressure and coercive transactions, and provoke trade wars for no reason, exposing their extreme egoism,” Wang said on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Kazakhstan.
The back-and-forth adds to the substantial uncertainty surrounding Trump’s erratic tariff policy, not just around China, but also as it pertains to the dozens of countries scrambling to strike their own deals to ease the burden of the hefty import taxes he has unleashed since returning to the White House in January.
His team of negotiators was conducting what amounted to a lightning round of trade talks with foreign officials who had swarmed Washington this week for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group.
But while Trump officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, touted indications of swift progress, many of their counterparts were more circumspect. Finance chiefs at the IMF were heading home with renewed urgency to diminish the risks presented by the tariffs.
“I’m walking away from these meetings with a clear sense of everything that is at stake and the risks that are there for jobs, for growth, for living standards all over the world,” Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said.
“The meetings here... reminded me of why we need to leave no stone unturned in the next few weeks and months to see how we can reduce that uncertainty.”   
De-escalation 
While clarity on whether deals are actually being struck to avoid the imposition of even steeper tariffs in early July, there were signs of some de-escalation.
China exempted some US imports from its steep tariffs as business groups said Beijing has allowed some US-made pharmaceuticals to enter the country without paying the 125 per cent duties that Beijing imposed earlier this month in response to Trump’s 145pc tariffs on Chinese imports.

Assange mingled with thousands of mourners just outside St Peter’s Square, where world leaders including US Presi­dent Donald Trump were gathered to say farewell to the head of the Catholic Church.
“Now Julian is free, we have all come to Rome to express our family’s gratitude for the pope’s support during Julian’s persecution,” Assange’s wife Stella said in a message cited on the Wikileaks X page.
Julian Assange was released in 2024 under a plea bargain after years of incarceration for publishing hundreds of thousands of confidential US government documents. The plea bargain was agreed with the US administration under former president Joe Biden, who was also at the funeral.
Assange spent most of the previous 14 years either holed up in the Ecuadoran embassy in London to avoid arrest, or locked up at Belmarsh Prison in the British capital. 
“Our children and I had the honour of meeting Pope Francis in June 2023 to discuss how to free Julian from Belmarsh prison,” Stella Assange said. “Francis wrote to Julian in prison and even proposed to grant him asylum at the Vatican,” she said.
The Assange family were near the top of the Via della Conciliazione, the wide avenue that leads up to St Peter’s Square, which was packed for the funeral. Assange’s case remains deeply contentious.

Moscow had previously accused Kyiv of being behind the blast on Friday which killed senior Russian general Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy head of the main operational directorate of the military’s General Staff.
“Ukrainian special services agent Ignat Kuzin, born in 1983, a resident of Ukraine, who planted explosives in a Volkswagen Golf in the city of Balashikha in the Moscow region, killing Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik, was detained,” the FSB said in a statement.
According to the FSB, Kuzin had rigged the car with a homemade explosive device, which he took from a Ukrainian special service stash in the Moscow region, and the bomb was then detonated remotely from Ukraine.
The suspect, who might be facing a life sentence on terrorism charges, is now being questioned by the officers, Russia’s investigative committee said.

The Istanbul general prosecutor’s office said on Saturday it had issued warrants for 53 people, 47 of whom had been detained, over a corruption probe into opposition mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who was himself arrested last month.
Imamoglu’s party, the main opposition CHP, said the arrests were to counter its efforts to block the proposed Istanbul canal project, intended to connect the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara. The project is backed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Speaking at a rally on Saturday, Ozgur Celik, head of the CHP in Istanbul, accused the government of having “revived” the project just after Imamoglu’s arrest.

The project proposes to connect Black Sea to Sea of Marmara

The deputy chairman of the CHP parliamentary group, Gokhan Gunaydin, also argued that “the real reason for these arrests is the Istanbul Canal”. But the government’s department for combating disinformation has denied the accusations.
“The operation follows the investigation opened on March 19 against the mayor for corruption,” it said. From his cell, Imamoglu also denounced the arrests, blaming “a handful of ambitious people... who started filling empty files with lies and slander”.
‘No coincidence’
Imamoglu was arrested for alleged corruption on the day he was named the CHP’s candidate for the 2028 presidential race. He is regarded as the most high-profile politician in opposition to Erdogan, whose AKP has ruled Turkiye since 2002.
Imamoglu’s detention sparked huge crowds rallying in nightly protests outside Istanbul City Hall. The demonstrations quickly spread across the country in what became Turkiye’s biggest wave of unrest since 2013.
Among those detained on Saturday was Imamoglu’s aide and brother-in-law Kadriye Kasapoglu and city hall officials, Turkish media reported.
The Bir Gun news site, which is close to the opposition, said raids were underway in the homes of those detained in Ankara, Istanbul and Tekirdag in the country’s north-west.
“Today’s operation is no coincidence,” Celik said on X. Istanbul’s Water and Sewage Authority had ordered the demolition and shutdown of construction sites along the canal route, he said.
The project was initiated by Erdogan in 2011 when he was prime minister. The plan is to relieve congestion in the Bosphorus Strait, a 50-kilometre-long, 150-metre-wide and 25-metre deep stretch.

The worshipper was stabbed dozens of times in the village of La Grand-Combe, in the Gard region of southern France. His killer was still at large on Saturday, regional prosecutor Abdelkrim Grini said.
Investigators are now treating the killing as a possible Islamophobic crime. 
The alleged perpetrator sent the video he had filmed with his phone, showing the victim writhing in agony, to another person, who then shared it on a social media platform before deleting it.
The killing itself was not shown on the images posted on social media, but was filmed by security cameras inside the mosque. In his own footage the killer notices these cameras and is heard saying: “I am going to be arrested that’s for sure”.
According to another source, the suspected perpetrator, while not apprehended, has been identified as a French citizen of Bosnian origin who is not a Muslim.

Auto stakeholders appear concerned over reservations shown by the IMF on tax relief proposed in the New Electric Vehicle Policy (NEVP) 2025-30 when Pakistan gears up for an EV revolution to come on a par with developing countries. 
The IMF reportedly asked the government not to incentivise the EV revolution by reducing taxes and tariffs.
Sources said that the Fund believes that the EV sector should be given some subsidy separately instead of reducing taxes and duties on EVs to avoid any policy distortion.
Uncertainty has gripped the auto sector after the IMF expressed reservations over huge incentives offered in the NEVP and recommended a tariff rationalisation plan.
However, the NEVP draft has ignored HEVs and mainly focused on incentivising battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and PHEVs. After IMF’s reservations, it is not clear whether the NEVP draft is still intact or held in abeyance.
Besides, according to the draft of the National Tariff Policy (NTP) 2025-30 and subsequent discussion with the IMF, the overall tariff structure will gradually be rationalised to 20 per cent on the end product. The policy also proposes phasing out additional customs duties and regulatory duties.
Some assemblers express surprise that discussions with the IMF on tariff rationalisation are going on despite the Auto Industry Development and Export Plan (AIDEP) 2021-2026, which will expire in June 2026.
Dewan Farooqui Motors Ltd Chief Executive Waseemul Haq Ansari said as long as the charging infrastructure is in the developing stage and not supportive, assemblers will be introducing PHEV/HEV and EVs with slow charging options. As soon as the fast-charging stations are built, battery electric vehicle volumes will significantly increase.
As the world, especially China and Europe, are aggressively shifting towards EVs, the government is also focusing on adapting a complete eco-system, including the local manufacturing of solar panels, battery energy storage systems (BESS) and battery electric vehicles. He said the government is expected to announce the comprehensive EV policy soon.
Globally, the market share for Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles is shifting towards PHEV and EV and BEV will gradually capture significant volume. Waseem hopes those who are buying HEVs and PHEVs will finally shift to pure EV in future.
However, he said the under-discussion tariff rationalisation plan to finalise the EV policy has caused anxiety among the assemblers, and a lot of careful study is required to follow their future projects as the new tariff structure will come into force from July 2026 as there is no clear information about it.
Auto sector players must see whether the new tariff plan will maintain the current difference between the completely knocked-down kits (CKD) and completely built-up (CBU) units. Reduced duty on CKD will encourage assemblers to bring new models, but in case CBU duty is also reduced it will be difficult for the assemblers to survive as the market will be flooded with new and old imported models, thus putting the local assembly of vehicles in danger, CEO DFML said.
After the highest-ever US tariffs on China, he said Pakistan needs to immediately establish a lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility to lead towards exporting locally assembled electric vehicles to other countries.
As the electrical components cost around 50pc of the total vehicle, he added that Chinese companies are studying the possibility of transferring their manufacturing facility to Pakistan to export their products globally subject to the attractive tariff structure.
On the expectation that more Chinese EV assemblers will move to other countries, including Pakistan, he said, “It appears that in the current uncertain conditions, Chinese companies will only prefer CBU operations in Pakistan subject to the attractive tariff structure.”
Auto part marker and exporter Mashood Ali Khan believed that the NEVP policy is continuing, and some OEMs have resumed manufacturing operations for Hybrids and EVs.
Japanese automakers in Pakistan are bringing HEVs, while Chinese companies only focus on EVs. Under the present economic scenario, HEVs and EVs in local assembly operations may lead towards localisation and affordable prices for the broad population, he hoped.
Mashood said more Chinese EVs assemblers may move to other countries like Pakistan to avoid disruption in export after the highest tariff imposed on China by the USA.
Pakistan’s EV market is still in its infancy, constituting a negligible portion of the country’s total vehicle population due to several challenges, including high upfront costs, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of consumer awareness, he said.
Sohail Usman, director at Regal Automobiles, which assembles the SERES EV SUV, said consumers’ confidence in pure EVs is missing due to a lack of charging stations and infrastructure. As a result, they rely on HEVs and PHEVs.
“The future is only EVs and PHEVs. Sales of fossil fuel vehicles will go down automatically when charging stations will fully develop,” he said. He believed the NEVP 2025-30 is being fine-tuned and may be unveiled in the budget 2025-26. He said after the imposition of high import tariffs by the US, more Chinese EV assemblers would go to other countries, inc­l­uding Pakistan, to keep their production and exports active.

But there are also those to whom populism is not a spectre but a solution to decades of malpractice, corruption and exploitation by economic and political elites. Therefore, many observers once believed that populism was tailor-made for leftist forces to sweep in and take-over. 
But populism as we know it today has largely emerged on the right. What’s more, in the West, it has also been embraced by the urban working classes. Elsewhere — especially in countries such as India, Pakistan, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil, Tunisia and Argentina — populism has largely attracted the support and votes of the middle-classes. Populism’s trajectory in these countries has been rightward as well.
One of the most prominent theories explaining this is that, in the West, due to the outcome of neoliberal economics, the urban working classes and rural segments felt ignored and abandoned by urban ‘liberal’ elites who took control of the mainstream parties that previously used to strive for working class interests. 
In regions where right-wing populism has been embraced by the middle classes, these classes bemoan that ‘corrupt’ mainstream parties are only interested in engaging with the lower classes because these still constitute the larger percentage of the electorate. 

Far from being a spontaneous uprising of the people, modern populism has evolved into a carefully curated performance that is produced, packaged and sold by the very elites it claims to oppose

In the US and the UK, political scientists and sociologists have started to deconstruct populism to explore what exactly lies at its core. This deconstruction has segmented populism into three types: political, economic and cultural. There has been an increased interest in sociologists to especially explore populism’s cultural aspects.  
This is not to suggest that the three are in any significant way different from each other. Quite the contrary. Political populism carries in it rhetoric moulded from perceptions gestating in sections of society that believe that, after being thoroughly exploited, they are being sidelined and ignored by elites whose economic and political interests are not tied to the interests of these sections anymore. 
Political populism’s response in this regard is ‘economic populism’ or rhetoric/action that appeals to the sentiments of those who believe they’re being exploited/ignored by the elites. The response is often delivered in the shape of promises of creating more jobs for the working classes or (in the ‘Global South’) about creating more employment opportunities and space in politics for the middle classes. 
It is, however, the cultural turn that the study of populism has taken that is providing some fascinating insights into why populism has mushroomed in the manner it has from the 2010s. This cultural turn is the study of ‘cultural populism’ and how it provides staying power to present-day political and economic populisms. 
Interestingly though, ‘cultural populism’ — a term popularised in 1992 by the British cultural theorist Jim McGuigan who passed away in December — initially emerged from his study of popular/pop culture. According to McGuigan, popular culture products had stopped being understood in a more critical manner and were being celebrated and eulogised by sociologists as manifestations of art by, of and for the ‘masses’.
According to McGuigan, this was “a wholly illusory and ideologically naïve view” that did not take into account the political economy in which the popular culture industry operates, and the politics of those producing this culture’s products. 
In his 2009 book Cool Capitalism, McGuigan furthered his thesis by stating that a more critical exploration of popular culture products shows that cultural populism had little to do with any kind of cultural rebellion by the ‘masses’, but that it was more about “capitalism incorporating disaffection into capitalism itself.” 
For example, any nature of popular art/fashion/trend exhibiting itself as being rebellious, ‘cool’ or radical is often the brainchild of lucrative cultural industries which turn subversion, rebellion and anger into saleable commodities that are enthusiastically consumed by specifically targeted consumers. 



 
But what has this to do with political populism? Quite a lot. In 2020, cultural analysts Professor Jo Littler and Marie Moran referenced Jim McGuigan’s critique in their study of cultural populism. According to Littler and Moran there is a relationship between the economy and culture. More than a decade ago, cultural products shaped by popular media began to heighten the presence of economic and social crises (both imagined and real).
The media strengthened a narrative in which the crisis was due to ‘exploitation’, ‘corruption’, immigration, and a failure of the established order. It found a ready market for this angry/activist strand of ‘journalism.’ The ironic bit was, those funding this media-driven narrative were from an economic elite (‘media barons’). 
This thesis restates McGuigan’s conclusion that capitalism incorporates disaffection into capitalism itself. So, one can therefore posit that, in the last two decades, certain economic and political issues began being co-opted by media elites in a faux-angry manner. 
This faux anger was then sold as a commodity to the people. This greatly helped generate support for the kind of populism that mushroomed in the Global North as well as in the Global South. Its emergence wasn’t organic. It was manufactured. 
As mentioned, political populism uses economic populism to make certain pledges that include promises of sweeping economic reforms and so-called ‘pro-people’ economic policies. But it is cultural populism that thrills political populists and their audiences the most. According to the Indian academic Professor Somnath Ghosh, political populists often tie their populist economic promises to a mixed bag of emotive issues related to language, race, religion, ethnicity and morality. 
In fact, European political populism has been more cultural than economic. It has created an ‘other’ in the shape of the violent Muslim migrant who is apparently undermining European culture and threatening to destroy European values and the continent’s Christian heritage. 
In the US as well, populism is largely cultural, despite Donald Trump aggressively displaying a form of economic populism. But his core constituency remains Christian nationalists, Evangelical Protestants, social conservatives and ‘nativists’ who believe the US was supposed to be a white, Protestant Christian state built on ‘traditional American values.’ 
In Asia, populism’s constituency is largely middle class, which seamlessly fluctuates between modernity and traditionalism, pop culture and piety, patriotism and protest, conservatism and consumerism, and — at times — between liberalism and outright reactionary-ism. It is thus one of populism’s most unstable variants. 
Like populism in general, cultural populism too aims to demonise and demolish an ‘other’, and a group of elites. On the one hand, present-day populism may be the co-opted product of the very elites it rails against and, on the other hand, the result of one elite using populism to degrade a competing elite.

A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the intelligence-based operations (IBO) were conducted on Friday and Saturday.
The ISPR said eight terrorists were “sent to hell” after troops effectively engaged them at their location during an IBO in Karak district based on the reported militant presence.
It said that four more were killed by the security forces in another IBO in North Waziristan district.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of soil, Lance Naik Usman Mohmand (age: 28 years, resident of Charsadda district) and Sepoy Imran Khan (age: 26 years, resident of Kurram district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom,” the ISPR said.
It added that troops “successfully neutralised” three more terrorists in another encounter in South Waziristan district’s general area of Gomal Zam.
The ISPR said weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists who were actively involved in numerous terror activities.
It added that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the areas. “Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” the ISPR concluded.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-04-26 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26153039a989f5a.jpg?r=154735' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906709/businesses-across-country-remain-closed-in-solidarity-with-palestinians' target='_blank'><strong>Businesses across country remain closed in solidarity with Palestinians</strong></a><br><p>Various cities across the country on Saturday observed a shutter-down strike called by the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) against the ongoing Israeli assault in Gaza and to show solidarity with the Palestinians.
The strike was announced by JI central chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, as he delivered a fiery speech to the party’s ‘Palestine Solidarity March’ in Islamabad. The demonstration protested against the Israeli atrocities in Gaza and took place on the Islamabad Expressway.
The Israeli offensive, which began in response to Hamas’s unprecedented attack on October 7, 2023, has killed more than 51,000 Palestinians and destroyed much of the housing and hospital infrastructure in the enclave. The death toll is feared to be much higher due to thousands still missing under the rubble.
A strike was observed today in twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Quetta.  Other parts of Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan also remained shut. Shops and markets remained closed and vehicles largely stayed off the roads.

In Karachi, several leaders of the trade bodies participated in the protest, including All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir, Cooperative Market General Secretary Aslam Khan, Paper Market Syed Liaquat Ali etc.
Other than Karachi, the strike was observed in other cities of the province including Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Mirpurkhas, Ghotki, Nawabshah, Thatta, Jacobabad, Kandhkot, and Shikarpur.

Meanwhile, solidarity rallies were also taken out by JI and other religious parties from morning to evening.
The rally in Larkana was led by Sindh JI Ameer Kashif Saeed Sheikh and Ameer District Advocate Nadir Ali Khosa.
In Punjab, a shutter-down strike was observed by the business community across the province. All business centres and shops were closed in Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Jhelum.
JI) chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that he was not the one to take credit for the countrywide strike, rather, he would appreciate the efforts of the traders and business owners.
“There could not be a greater portrayal of unity than this [strike],” the JI chief said at a protest in Lahore.
Rehman said that people had gathered in support of Palestine in large numbers in all four cities, adding that there was “no colour, race, language or sect” among the people. “Everyone is standing up for the oppressed people and are against the oppressors,” he said.
A similar strike was observed in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan as markets, shops, and other commercial centres there remained closed.

Balochistan JI provincial chief Maulana Hidayatur Rehman Baloch thanked the people for making the strike peaceful and successful, adding that if “we unite against oppression, coercion and lawlessness, we will become a great force”.
The shutter-down strike was also observed across KP.
