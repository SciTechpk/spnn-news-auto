Growing numbers are finding work in the business of death as South Korea undergoes massive demographic change, with birth rates among the lowest in the world and almost half the population aged 50 or older.
Students at the Busan Institute of Science and Technology carefully draped a mannequin in traditional Korean funeral cloth, smoothing the fabric as if over real skin, before gently lowering it into a coffin.
“With our society ageing, I thought the demand for this kind of work would only grow,” said Jang Jin-yeong, 27, a funeral administration student.
Another student, 23-year-old Im Sae-jin, decided to enter the field after his grandmother died.
“At her funeral, I saw how beautifully the directors had prepared her for the final farewell,” he said.
“I felt deeply grateful.”
‘Like portraits’
More and more South Koreans are also living — and dying — alone.
Single-person households now account for around 42 per cent of all homes in Asia’s fourth-largest economy.
A new profession has emerged reflecting that statistic: cleaners who are called in to tidy up homes after their occupants, most of whom lived alone, have died.
Former classical musician Cho Eun-seok has cleaned many homes where people were found dead, sometimes months after their passing.
Their homes are “like their portraits”, Cho, 47, told AFP.
He described heartbreaking traces: hundreds of neatly capped soju bottles and dusty boxes of gifts that were never opened.
South Korea has the highest suicide rate among developed nations, and these “lonely deaths” include those who died alone by their own hand.
Cho recently began receiving calls from used-car leasing companies to clean vehicles later found to be where clients ended their lives.
He is also developing a device to detect signs of unattended deaths that he said can harm the environment, causing pest infestations and forcing the disposal of belongings from entire households.
In summer, the smell spreads fast: “within three days it seeps into everything — the fridge, the TV — and nothing can be saved.”
The home of a woman who had died recently in her late eighties was still filled with traces of her life when AFP visited — an old air conditioner, bottles of cosmetics and a portable toilet, while several walking sticks stood by the door.
‘Everything must be cleared away’
The work sometimes requires more than just cleaning.
Kim Seok-jung once cleared the home of a late lyricist and found a set of songs she had not shared with her relatives. He turned them into a song for the bereaved family.
And Cho remembered a high school girl who lived alone in a gosiwon — a cramped room typically less than five square metres — after she escaped domestic violence.
He visited once a month to clean. The teenager, suffering from depression, had been unable to tidy up herself.
Piles of belongings and rotting food covered the bed, and the air was thick with flies.
But she carefully looked after a small box, insisting Cho never throw it away.
She took her own life in that small room a year later.
When Cho returned to clean, he found that a hamster had been living in the box all along.
Beside it sat her guitar — she had dreamed of becoming a musician.
“The moment I saw the hamster, all I could think was that I had to save it and keep it alive,” Cho said.
Kim Doo-nyeon, a veteran in the funeral business, said he has a growing number of recruits in their twenties.
“When people live together, they share things… even if one person dies, those items remain,” he said.
“But when someone dies alone, everything must be cleared away.”
Back at class in Busan, I’m admitted to some trepidation about his chosen career path.
“I am scared,” he said.
“No matter how much you prepare, facing a deceased person is frightening.”</p><small>2025-11-02 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/021130548ba91e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952729/peshawar-ctd-official-dead-2-injured-as-explosives-detonate-at-police-station' target='_blank'><strong>Peshawar CTD official dead, 2 injured as explosives detonate at police station</strong></a><br><p>A Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official was martyred in Peshawar on Sunday morning, while two others were injured when explosives stored in a police station went off.
Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmad confirmed the casualties of the incident at the CTD police station in a statement.
“Preliminary assessment shows that an explosion occurred due to the detonation of old explosive material stored in the police station’s ammunition room. Fire has also spread to other ammunition, causing further explosions,” the statement read.
Police and security forces cordoned off the area, as “clearance [was] going on”, the CCPO said.
He added that the Bomb Disposal Unit, along with rescue and fire brigade services, were working accordingly.
Citing a preliminary assessment, the statement said, “Police sources confirm that this incident does not appear to be a terrorist attack”.
A separate statement issued by the CCPO said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed has sought a detailed report from the CTD additional IG within five days.
The stated cause of today’s incident is similar to how a blaze destroyed the city police station in the Swabi district last year.
On Sept 26, 2024, an explosion ripped through the second floor of the city police station in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swabi district, resulting in three deaths and injuries to around two dozen people.
The building of the district’s largest and central police station was completely destroyed and still awaited reconstruction a year later.
Officials said that 600 kilogrammes of explosives were kept in the police station, which caught fire, but it was not known as of last month how those explosives caught fire.
Fire incidents usually occur due to a combination of human negligence, faulty infrastructure, poor safety standards, and environmental factors. Peshawar has faced frequent residential and commercial fires, as well as periodic industrial infernos.
In July, four people were killed and two others were injured after a fire broke out in a house located in Peshawar’s Kochi Bazaar, rescue officials said.
 
 

In October 2024, a blaze at a tissue paper factory in the city’s Hayatabad area was doused after more than 26 hours in an operation involving 130 fighters and 31 fire tenders.
In June 2024, a fire broke out in the Nauthia Phattak area of Peshawar, destroying at least 80 shops mostly selling used goods and injuring three people.</p><small>2025-11-02 09:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02144644ea52be3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952730/rain-delays-womens-world-cup-final-toss-between-india-south-africa' target='_blank'><strong>Rain delays Women’s World Cup final toss between India, South Africa</strong></a><br><p>Rain and a wet outfield delayed the toss for the Women’s World Cup final between India and South Africa in Mumbai on Sunday.
Both teams are looking for their first title in the 50-over tournament, with a full house expected at the 45,000-capacity DY Patil Stadium.
Toss was delayed by 30 minutes to 3pm (2:30pm PKT) with the start revised to 3:30pm, although more drizzle threatened to push that back again.
India have been runners-up twice, in 2005 and 2017, and reached their third final after beating seven-time champions Australia in a thriller.
South Africa’s women are in their first ODI World Cup final after they beat four-time winners England in the other semi-final.
Speaking ahead of the decider, India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said winning the World Cup could be a turning point for the women’s game in the cricket-crazy country.
 
 

“Last time when we reached the final and came back to India we saw a big change,” Kaur told reporters on Saturday.
“Women’s cricket moved ahead and we saw many girls on the ground.
“So I am sure that if we win this final, we will see many more changes and we will see more cricket, not only on the international level but also on the domestic level.”
“So I think we are really looking forward to that moment when we will see women’s cricket in a more serious manner and we will see more girls (playing),” she said.

Indian players like Kaur and Smriti Mandhana have become household names in the world’s most populous nation since the Women’s Premier League T20 tournament began in 2023.
Jemimah Rodrigues played a champion’s knock with an unbeaten 127 to help India chase down a record 339 against holders Australia in the semi-finals.
“I think it’s a proud moment for me and the entire team,” Kaur said.
“I am sure the entire country must be also very proud of the way we have played the last two games and, yeah, it’s a big day.”
South Africa, led by Laura Wolvaardt, beat four-time winners England to reach their first ODI World Cup final.
Wolvaardt said the pressure on the home team could work in South Africa’s favour at DY Patil Stadium, which has a capacity of 45,000.
“I think with the whole crowd behind India, probably a sold-out stadium, it’s going to be a very exciting opportunity,” Wolvaardt said.
“But at the same time, I think it puts a lot of pressure on them as well. So yeah, I think it sort of plays in our favour, hopefully.”
Only Australia, England and New Zealand have ever won the tournament since it began in 1973.
Kaur said a new champion will be good for the sport.
“Because of that we are seeing more excitement,” she said. “And for us to reach the final is also very special, not only for us but for the Indian fans who have been a big support for us.”</p><small>2025-11-02 09:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02142638715dd85.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952736/trump-threatens-us-military-action-in-nigeria-over-treatment-of-christians' target='_blank'><strong>Trump threatens US military action in Nigeria over treatment of Christians</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Saturday said he has asked the Defence Department to prepare for possible “fast” military action in Nigeria if the West African nation fails to crack down on the killing of Christians.
The US government will also immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation and top oil producer, Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
If the United States sends in military forces, it would go in “‘guns-a-blazing,’ to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” Trump wrote, without providing any evidence of specifics about the treatment of Christians in Nigeria.
 

Screengrab from Donald Trump’s Truth Social post

Trump called Nigeria a “disgraced country” and warned its government must move quickly. “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!” he wrote.
Abuja had no immediate reaction to Trump’s threat of military action. The White House also had no immediate comment on the potential timing of any US military action.
Although the US Department of Defence referred Reuters to the White House for comment on Trump’s threat, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth released a social media post of his own.
“The Department of War is preparing for action,” Hegseth wrote on X. “Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.”
 






Trump’s post on Nigeria came a day after his administration added Nigeria back to a “Countries of Particular Concern” list of nations that the US says have violated religious freedom. Other nations on the list include China, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, and Pakistan.
Before Trump posted his attack threat, Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu earlier on Saturday pushed back against claims of religious intolerance and defended his country’s efforts to protect religious freedom.
“The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians,” Tinubu said in a statement, citing “constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.”
Nigeria’s Foreign Ministry, in a separate statement, vowed to keep fighting violent extremism and said it hoped Washington would remain a close ally, saying it “will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion. Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.”
The US military footprint in West Africa was significantly diminished when about 1,000 troops withdrew from Niger last year. While the US sometimes has small groups of troops in the region to take part in drills, the largest US military base on the continent is in East Africa in Djibouti, which hosts over 5,000 troops and is used for operations in the region.
Trump put Nigeria on ‘concern list’ during first term
Trump had designated Nigeria a country of concern during his first term in the White House. His Democratic successor, Joe Biden, removed it from the US State Department list in 2021.
On Friday, Trump said “thousands of Christians” were being killed in Nigeria by “radical Islamists”, but offered no details.
Nigeria, which has 200 ethnic groups practising Christianity, Islam and traditional religions, has a long history of peaceful coexistence, but it has also seen flare-ups of violence among groups, often exacerbated by ethnic divisions or conflict over scarce resources.
The extremist armed group Boko Haram has also terrorised northeast Nigeria, an insurgency that has killed tens of thousands of people over the past 15 years. Human rights experts have said most Boko Haram victims have been Muslims.
US lawmakers such as Representative Tom Cole, a Republican who chairs the US House of Representatives Appropriations Committee, hailed Trump’s move on Friday, citing what they called “the alarming and ongoing persecution of Christians across the country.”
The committee’s fiscal 2026 national security appropriations bill included increased funding for international religious freedom programs and support for programs supporting communities in Nigeria targeted by extremist violence.
Trump’s redesignation of Nigeria as a country of concern opens the door to a range of policy responses, such as sanctions or waivers, but they are not automatic.
Some religious groups pressed Trump for the redesignation in a letter last month, according to a copy on the Hudson Institute think tank’s website.
“Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria. Thousands of Christians are being killed. Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter,” Trump wrote without offering any specifics. He also called on the US House of Representatives Appropriations Committee to investigate.</p><small>2025-11-02 09:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/021500566c7e4f7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952734/ji-chief-criticises-sindh-govts-e-challan-system-calls-for-improving-karachis-infrastructure' target='_blank'><strong>JI chief criticises Sindh govt’s e-challan system, calls for improving Karachi’s infrastructure</strong></a><br><p>Jamaat-i-Islami emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman on Sunday criticised the Sindh government’s e-challan initiative, calling it a “drama” meant to burden citizens instead of improving the city’s transport and road infrastructure.
In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred. Last month, the system was officially inaugurated, drawing a mix of praise and criticism from the public.
Speaking at an event in Karachi today, the JI chief said, “While the government was issuing challans worth Rs5,000, Rs10,000, and even Rs25,000 to Karachi’s commuters, it had failed to provide the city with a viable transport system.”
“When the same challan is Rs200 in Lahore, and Rs5,000 in Karachi, isn’t the criticism on the Pakistan People’s Party valid?” he questioned.
Citing World Bank reports, he said Karachi required around 15,000 buses, but the Sindh government had brought in only 400. According to the 2023 census, Karachi’s official population stood at 20.36 million.
“The entire city has been forced onto motorcycles and Qingqi [rickshaws] because no large-scale transport system exists,” he said, adding that the number of motorbikes in Karachi had now exceeded five million.
The JI leader accused the PPP of “qabza siyasat” (politics of grabbing). “The party has wasted 30 to 40 years of our city and ruined generations,” he said, adding that the PPP had done nothing meaningful for Karachi in the last 15 years.
Naeem also criticised the stalled and poorly executed mega projects launched in the city, including the S-III project, Karachi Circular Railway, Green Line, Red Line, and Orange Line bus services.
 
 

“The KCR has been inaugurated six to eight times by different governments, but still isn’t being made,” he pointed out. “The Green Line stopped midway, and the Red Line has destroyed University Road.”
Praising the efforts of JI’s local town leadership, Hafiz Naeem said the party’s leadership had started a “new journey” in nine towns despite limited resources.
“We said earlier that we will work beyond our means. But the problems of sewerage, sanitation, and garbage management, which are the responsibility of the [Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation] and Mayor Murtaza Wahab, are also being handled by JI’s town chairman and people of the union council (UC),” he said.
He highlighted that JI’s local leadership had resolved long-running sewerage issues in areas such as North Nazimabad by connecting drainage lines to Gujjar Nullah.</p><small>2025-11-02 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02132300806088a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952735/shahid-khaqans-health-has-improved-says-awaam-pakistan-after-cardiac-issue' target='_blank'><strong>Shahid Khaqan’s health has improved, says Awaam Pakistan after cardiac issue</strong></a><br><p>Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi’s health has improved after a cardiac issue yesterday, his Awaam Pakistan party said on Sunday.
Abbasi complained of pain in his shoulder yesterday morning and was “immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where doctors diagnosed a cardiac issue during examination”, Awaam Pakistan spokesperson Dr Zafar Mirza said in a statement.
“The doctors provided him with timely treatment, after which his health has improved significantly, and he is resting at the hospital,” the statement added.
It prayed for the speedy recovery of the Awaam Pakistan chief and urged the media to be considerate of his “private life and privacy”.
 






Awaam Pakistan co-founder Miftah Ismail also said on X that Abbasi’s “health condition continues to improve, and he is now resting comfortably”.
“We expect and pray for his quick and full recovery. I thank friends who have been calling to ask about his health,” the former finance minister added.
 






Anchorperson Nadia Mirza and journalist Asad Toor expressed their wishes on X for the ex-premier’s swift recovery.
 






 






Abbasi and Ismail were previously part of the PML-N but parted ways and launched their Awaam Pakistan party in July 2024 — the idea of which had been floated over a year prior.
Abbasi had tested positive for the coronavirus in June 2020, when numerous other politicians were also contracting the pandemic disease.
In 2019, when imprisoned in an accountability case, Abbasi said a medical board had recommended he undergo surgery. According to his medical report, he had been suffering from hernia pain, gallbladder pain and hypertension.</p><small>2025-11-02 09:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631714-ex-pm-shahid-khaqan-abbasi-hospitalised-after-chest-pain' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi hospitalised after chest pain</strong></a><br><p>

Consumers who have invested up to Rs1 million or more are being told to purchase the AMR meters for Rs52,000, while their existing green meters, which they had earlier bought, will be taken away by the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (Iesco).
A number of consumers have approached the Prime Minister’s Portal, seeking relief and requesting the government to stop Iesco from forcing them to purchase new meters.
However, an Iesco official said that although it was principally decided to replace the meters, the implementation has been temporarily put on hold, and a policy will soon be announced in this regard.

Consumers approach PM Portal against demand to replace meters worth Rs52,000 each

It is worth mentioning that a green meter is a bi-directional smart meter that tracks both the electricity a solar-powered home uses and the surplus energy it sends back to the national grid through net metering.
After every three months, the consumption and production are calculated, and the amount is either debited or credited accordingly.
 
 

Solar consumer Muhammad Naeem told Dawn that he was shocked to see the bill, which mentioned that he must replace his green meter with an AMR meter.
“I visited the Iesco office and was told that a demand notice worth Rs52,000 would be issued to me and that I would have to pay the amount. I installed the solar system less than a year ago, investing a little under a million rupees. I have a number of questions: is it mandatory for all green meter holders to get the meter replaced with an AMR meter?” he said.
Another consumer, Maqbood Ahmed, said that when he visited the Iesco office, he was informed that the replacement would make it easier for Iesco staff, as they would no longer need to visit for meter reading or calculations.
When this scribe visited the Iesco office in Sector I-10, an official who introduced himself as Mr Amir said that a large number of solar consumers were visiting the office after seeing the instructions on their bills.
“However, we don’t have a clear policy yet. What I can tell you is that demand notices will be issued, and consumers will have to pay Rs52,000 for the new meter. We don’t know if the meter charges can be deducted from the bills. Consumers should wait for the final policy,” he said in response to queries.
When contacted, an official at Iesco’s Monitoring and Complaint Cell, identified as Mr Imran, said that although some SDOs had issued demand notices, the process had been put on hold as many consumers claimed their meters were still under warranty and questioned why they should bear the cost.
“Several people have also approached the PM Portal, and their applications have been forwarded to Iesco. Therefore, it has been decided to formulate a policy on the matter,” he explained.
Iesco spokesperson Raja Asim, while talking to Dawn, said that the decision to replace green meters with AMR meters was taken for implementation across the country, not by Iesco alone.
He assured that a policy would be framed keeping in view the consumers’ concerns and that all necessary steps would be taken to provide relief.

The island’s confirmed deaths remain at 19 as of Saturday, though Health Minister Christopher Tufton told a briefing, “I would imagine it’s more… because there are still places that we have had difficulties reaching.”
Haiti’s Civil Protection department, meanwhile, said at least 31 people have been killed there as a result of the storm.
Melissa tore across Jamaica as a ferocious top-level Category 5 hurricane, the most powerful storm ever recorded on the island, with sustained winds peaking at 185 miles (nearly 300 kilometers) per hour while drenching the country with torrential rain.
Hospitals in western Jamaica were particularly hard-hit, prompting officials to deploy several field hospitals in the coming days to shore up health responses.
 


The first such field hospital — in Black River, the capital of the hardest hit province — “is expected to be delivered sometime tomorrow and immediately we’ll begin to deploy and to set up that facility,” Tufton said.
“That facility will come fully equipped, which will include an operating theatre and other critical diagnostic equipment, and some team members to support the local team,” he said, adding officials expect the hospital to be up and running in the coming week.
Additional hospitals are expected to pop up with aid from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and several countries, including Spain, Canada and India, Tufton said.</p><small>2025-11-02 07:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631707-islamabad-man-who-assaulted-traffic-policemen-arrested' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad man who assaulted traffic policemen arrested</strong></a><br><p>

Justice Raheel Kamran issued a detailed judgment on a petition filed by one Azhar Ijaz Khawaja who had challenged the orders of a family court of Model Town-Lahore and an additional district & sessions judge, directing him to pay monthly maintenance to his mother, Riffatun Nissa.
The family court had ordered Khawaja and his other three brothers to pay Rs5,000 per month as interim maintenance to their mother by the 14th day of each month. When the payments were not made, the family court struck off their defence and decreed the suit under Section 17-A of the Family Courts Act.
The appellate court/sessions court also upheld that order, prompting the petitioner to approach the LHC.

Accepts a son’s plea against lower court verdict over ‘irrelevant’ section, ‘premature action’

The petitioner’s counsel argued that family courts have no jurisdiction over parental maintenance claims and that Section 17-A, which provides for striking off the defence in case of non-payment, applies only to maintenance for wives and children.He contended that the lower court had acted hastily by passing a decree even before the due date for payment had expired.
 
 

Opposing the plea, the mother’s counsel maintained that under Islamic law and moral obligations, sons are bound to maintain their parents if they are in need and have no independent means of income.
Justice Kamran also sought assistance from amicus curiae Advocate Muhammad Saad Khan, who opined that the Family Courts Act’s term “maintenance” is broad enough to include claims by parents.
The judge, after examining the law and Islamic principles, held that parents can legally file maintenance suits against their children in family courts.
Referring to paragraph 371 of D.F. Mulla’s Principles of Muhammadan Law, the judge noted that Islam obligates children “in easy circumstances” to maintain their poor parents.
However, the judge clarified that Section 17-A applies exclusively to maintenance cases filed by wives or children. Thus, its penal consequences — including the striking off of defence for non-payment — cannot be applied in suits filed by parents against their sons.
Justice Kamran, nevertheless, maintained that family courts can still grant interim maintenance orders for parents under their general powers to prevent destitution.
The judge observed that the family court in the case in hand acted prematurely by invoking coercive measures before the 14-day payment deadline, terming it a “misapprehension of jurisdiction” and a “denial of due process.”
Allowing the petition, the judge set aside the orders of the family court and the sessions court, remanding the case for fresh proceedings in accordance with law.
The judge has clarified an important legal question, ensuring that the elderly and dependent parents have an accessible legal remedy for maintenance while protecting the due process rights of defendants in such cases.
Justice Kamran directed the family court to decide the case afresh expeditiously and forwarded a copy of the judgment for compliance.

KARACHI: Senior Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader and former chief minister of Sindh Aftab Shaban Mirani passed away on Saturday after a brief illness, his party and family said.
They stated that he had been unwell for several days and was recently discharged from a private hospital in Karachi.
According to family sources, his funeral prayers were offered at Masjid Baitus Salam in DHA on Saturday night, and he was laid to rest at the Gizri graveyard.
A large number of people, including Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and other PPP leaders, attended his last rites.
 






Mirani, a senior politician from Shikarpur, had a long and distinguished political career spanning several decades. He was among the senior-most leaders of the PPP and was known for his close association with the late prime ministers Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto.

President, PM express deep sorrow over demise of seasoned PPP leader

He served as the 18th chief minister of Sindh in 1990. Later, during Benazir Bhutto’s second tenure, he held the key portfolio of defence minister of Pakistan from October 1993 to November 1996.
Mirani was elected multiple times to the National Assembly of Pakistan from his home constituency in Shikarpur, representing the PPP. He won seats in the general elections of 2008, 2013 and 2018, serving as a member of the NA from 2008 till 2023.
Over the years, he played an active role in parliamentary affairs and was respected for his moderate views and strong party loyalty.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed deep sorrow over the demise of Mirani, calling him “a senior parliamentarian and a loyal leader of the PPP.”
In his condolence message, the president said that Mirani’s political wisdom and commitment to democratic values would always be remembered.
President Zardari also prayed for the departed soul and extended heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed grief over the passing of the senior politician, saying that the late PPP leader rendered valuable services for the country and its people.
“Aftab Shaban Mirani’s political and public service contributions will be remembered with respect,” the PM said, praying for eternal peace for the departed soul and strength for his family in this difficult time.
CM Shah, who visited Mirani at a private hospital last week, also expressed deep sorrow, calling his death a great loss to the province and the PPP.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also expressed deep sorrow and grief over the passing of Mirani and said that with his demise, the PPP has lost a sincere, loyal, and dedicated leader devoted to public service.

“Sadly, a number of the victims we’ve found were minors,” Alfonso Durazo, governor of Sonora state, said in a video message as he announced the toll of 23 dead and another 11 injured.
Durazo said the survivors were being treated at hospitals in the city of Hermosillo, where the explosion took place.
“I have ordered an extensive and transparent investigation to determine the causes of the incident and figure out those responsible,” he said.
 






The prosecutor’s office said in a statement that “the working assumption is that the incident was accidental, and the investigation is looking into a transformer located inside the store“.
“Once the firefighters allow access into the building … it will be possible to precisely determine the cause of the incident,” it added.
The explosion happened at a Waldo’s store in the city centre.
“Nobody will face this pain alone. From the very first moments, emergency, security and health services responded with great professionalism and commitment, controlling the situation and saving lives,” the governor said.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed her condolences on X “to the families and loved ones of those who died.”
“I have been in contact with the Sonora governor, Alfonso Durazo, to provide support where needed. I’ve instructed Interior Secretary Rosa Icela Rodriguez to send a support team in order to assist the families and the injured,” she continued.
 


Mexican media reports said customers sought refuge inside the store after the explosion, only to become trapped by the flames. Images in local media showed the building’s facade blackened from the fire, with windows shattered.
Newspaper El Universal said the explosion occurred around 2pm (1am PKT) and that nearby businesses opted to close their doors in order to prevent the fire from spreading there.
Local authorities urged members of the public to avoid the area of the explosion, and cancelled celebrations scheduled to be held that day in honour of the Day of the Dead holiday.</p><small>2025-11-02 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/69060a075e531.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952559/smokers-corner-insider-or-outsider' target='_blank'><strong>SMOKERS’ CORNER: INSIDER OR OUTSIDER?</strong></a><br><p>In 1923, an Indian migrant to the United States, Bhagat Singh Thind, went to the US Supreme Court to argue that he should be treated as a ‘Caucasian’ (white person). 
Thind had arrived in the US in 1913 for higher studies. He was granted US citizenship in 1918, but it was revoked under a 1906 law that only allowed “free white persons” to be eligible for US citizenship. Five years later, Thind and his lawyer, S. G. Pandit, went to the court, where they argued that the law did not apply to Thind because he belonged to the “Aryan race.” Even though a Sikh, Thind described himself as a high-caste Indian whose ancestors were Aryan.
At the time, various pseudoscientific theories about race were popular among many white Europeans and Americans. These theories placed the white race on top of the “Great Chain of Being.”
 
 

According to the legal scholar Ian Haney López, Thind tried to prove that, by being a “high-caste, of full Indian blood”, he was a Caucasian as per certain anthropological definitions of the time. But Thind lost the case.
This case highlights the intriguing manner in which many South Asians often tried to come to terms with the Western cultural and political ethos of the early 20th century. In his 2006 study of the Indian middle class milieu in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the German academic Markus Daechsel demonstrated that many Hindu and Muslim notables were smitten by racial theories developed in the West.

From colonial racial theories to Hindu nationalism and Islamophobia, South Asians’ struggle for identity in the West remains as complex — and revealing — as ever

They claimed that the roots of these theories (which they accepted as “scientific truths”) could be found in the genealogy of South Asian people. For example, some Hindu Indians, especially those from higher castes, internalised the colonial idea of Caucasian supremacy to elevate their social status. They insisted they were part of the original Aryan people, of which Western Caucasians were a branch.
Similar claims were also aired by many Indian Muslims. However, the Muslims evolved the claims to mean having Arab and Persian ancestries that built great civilisations, which then went on to inspire the rise of modern Western civilisation.
South Asian Hindus and Muslims who adopted ‘Western ways’ were severely criticised by those who claimed to be the original Aryans, or from civilisations that had inspired the growth of modern Western civilisation. This was their way of coming to terms with Western political, economic and social dominance in a world in which Hindu and Muslim empires had long collapsed.
 
 

Then, unable (or unwilling) to compete with the technologies and ideas driving modern Western civilisation, many Indian Hindus and Muslims turned to filling the ‘spiritual void’ that they believed Western civilisation had plunged into in its pursuit of materialistic goals.
From the mid-1960s till the mid-1970s, Western countries were flooded with South Asian Hindu preachers and gurus, and Muslim ‘Sufi’ masters. They wanted to spiritually enrich (for a fee) the ‘spiritually bankrupt’ West. To the South Asian gurus and the ‘Sufis’ in the West, this began to signify the overcoming of amoral Western superiority through the ‘moral/spiritual superiority of the East.’
This did not go unnoticed, though. From the 1980s onwards, right-wing Christian groups in the West started to formulate their own strands of spiritualism and morality that, to them, were at odds with ‘Eastern spiritualism.’ They viewed the practices of the gurus and ‘Sufi’ masters as products of the ‘perversities’ of the 1960s’ counterculture in Europe and the US, and at odds with the West’s ‘white Christian heritage.’
South Asian Hindu and Muslim diasporas in Europe and the US responded by detaching themselves from the ‘perversities’ and becoming more active components of ‘Western materialism.’ Hindu diasporas were more successful in doing this than Muslim diasporas. 
The latter retreated and ghettoised themselves within the confines of more puritanical (and less esoteric) variants of Islam. This retreat signified a desire to overcome ‘amoral’ Western environs and ideas with the moral superiority of the puritanical and highly ritualised variants of Islam that the South Asian Muslim diaspora in the West began to adopt.
 


Right-wing Christian groups and white nativists/nationalists saw this as a threat to the ‘Western way of life’, its Christian heritage, and a refusal by Muslim migrants to become part of the dominant culture.  This resulted in increasing cases of Islamophobia. Muslims who had seamlessly adopted Western culture saw the adoption of puritanical Islam by their contemporaries as a defeatist ploy.
Recently, Hindu interest groups in Europe and the US have reported an increase in attacks against Hindus and their places of worship. Unlike the South Asian Muslim diaspora in the West, the Hindu diaspora successfully became a more vital component of Western economies. So what has triggered cases of what is now referred to as Hinduphobia?
In the last three decades, the Indian Hindu diaspora rose to become an enterprising lot. They then began to couple this with Hindu nationalism. In the 1990s, Hindu nationalism came to the surface with great force in India. This nationalism — strengthened by the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India — promoted a strong, prosperous and ‘culturally proud’ India. This resonated immediately with the Indian Hindu diaspora’s economic aspirations.
Yet, the increasing displays of this cultural pride, backed by newfound wealth in the West, have begun to be viewed by many white Westerners as a show of arrogance and an unwillingness to get assimilated — especially during a time when many Western economies and democracies have begun to struggle.
Last week, I came across a middle-aged white American in Seattle. He’s an assistant professor of sociology at a university. He said that, when he was in his early twenties, an Indian friend of his used to mock him as a spiritually bankrupt person who had lost all contact with his soul. Decades later, the friend became a prosperous businessman in Seattle and a leading overseas donor to the BJP. His son now sits in the sociology class of the assistant professor. The professor said that the son does not hesitate in telling him that he (the son) belongs to a superior race that gave birth to the Caucasian races of the West.
According to the assistant professor, “Due to the embracing of Hindu nationalism, the economic advancement of the Indian diaspora in the US has been offset by a regressive and reactionary cultural ethos, mostly within the higher caste, middle-class Hindu communities.” 
He then added: “This is not going down well with a lot of Americans, who have begun to see many such Indians as arrogant, crass and antagonistic towards Western culture.”

In a statement on X, he said: “I firmly believe that Pakistan’s growing population and expanding administrative needs make the creation of new provinces an urgent national requirement.
“It is time to reorganise our four existing provinces — Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan — into three new administrative units each, named North, Central, and South, while preserving their original provincial identities.”
Aleem Khan, who is also the president of the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP), an ally of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), termed his proposal a significant step toward improved governance.
 






He further said that such restructuring would bring governance closer to the people, ensure efficient delivery of public services, and allow chief secretaries, inspectors general of police, and high courts to function more effectively within manageable jurisdictions. “For decades, the debate on new provinces has remained limited to politics and slogans. Now is the time for serious, consultative action to make this vision a reality,” he added.
 
 

Mr Khan said creating new provinces would not divide Pakistan but instead strengthen national unity, improve economic management, and enhance stability through balanced regional development.
“Let us work together to establish administratively feasible, people-centered provinces, so that every citizen’s voice is heard and their problems are solved at their doorstep,” he remarked.
Meeting with Iran’s envoy
Later, during a meeting with the Ambassador of Iran to Pakistan, Reza Amiri Moghadam, Communication Minister Aleem Khan reaffirmed his commitment to facilitating smoother cross-border movement of goods between Pakistan and Iran.
He expressed hope that bilateral trade between the two countries could reach Rs10 billion, emphasising that all necessary measures would be taken to address issues related to the entry and exit of Iranian trade trucks at border points.

Prices are forecast to drop by seven per cent in both 2025 and 2026, driven by weak global economic growth, a growing oil surplus, and persistent policy uncertainty.
Falling energy prices are helping to ease global inflation, while lower rice and wheat prices have helped make food more affordable in some developing countries. Despite the recent declines, however, commodity prices remain above pre-pandemic levels, with prices in 2025 and 2026 projected to be 23pc and 14pc higher, respectively, than in 2019.
The global oil glut has expanded significantly in 2025 and is expected to rise next year to 65pc above the most recent high, in 2020. Oil demand is growing more slowly as demand for electric and hybrid vehicles grows and oil consumption stagnates in China.
Brent crude oil prices are forecast to fall from an average of $68 in 2025 to $60 in 2026 — a five-year low. Overall, energy prices are forecast to fall by 12pc in 2025 and a further 10pc in 2026.

World Bank sees prices falling 7pc in 2025 and 2026 as weak growth and oil surplus drag markets

Food prices are also easing, with declines of 6.1pc projected in 2025 and 0.3pc in 2026 soybean prices are falling in 2025 because of record production and trade tensions but are expected to stabilise over the next two years. Meanwhile, coffee and cocoa prices are forecast to fall in 2026 as supply conditions improve.
However, fertiliser prices are projected to surge 21pc in 2025, reflecting higher input costs and trade restrictions, before easing 5pc in 2026. These increases are likely to further erode farmers’ profit margins and raise concerns about future crop yields.
Precious metals have reached record highs in 2025, fuelled by demand for safe-haven assets and continued central bank purchases. The price of gold — widely viewed as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty — is expected to increase by 42pc in 2025.
It is projected to increase by a further 5pc next year, leaving gold prices at nearly double their 2015-2019 average. Silver prices are also expected to hit a record annual average in 2025, rising by 34pc and further 8pc in 2026.
Commodity prices could fall more than expected during the forecast horizon if global growth remains sluggish amid prolonged trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Greater-than-expected oil output from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) could deepen the oil glut and exert additional downward pressure on energy prices. Electric-vehicle sales, which are expected to increase sharply by 2030, could further depress oil demand.
Conversely, geopolitical tensions and conflicts could push oil prices higher and boost demand for safe-haven commodities such as gold and silver. In the case of oil, the market impact of additional sanctions could also lift prices above the baseline forecast.
Extreme weather from a stronger-than-expected La Nina cycle could disrupt agricultural output and increase electricity demand for heating and cooling, adding further pressure to food and energy prices. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) and growing electricity demand to power data centers could raise prices for energy and for base metals like aluminum and copper, which are essential for AI infrastructure.
Instead of using price-control schemes, the report recommends that countries foster more diverse and efficient production, invest in technology and innovation, improve data transparency, and promote market-based pricing to build long-term resilience to price volatility.

Shaheen picked up 3-26, being the standout of Pakistan’s bowling attack, in which Faheem Ashraf and debutant Usman Tariq picked up two wickets each, as South Africa were restricted to 139-9 after being put into bat.
Babar then provided an anchor in the chase with a brilliant 68, featuring nine fours, as Pakistan eased to victory with six balls to spare.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated the team on X, saying, “Very well-played boys in Green!”
He also commended Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and his team for their “great efforts”.
 






In a statement, Naqvi hailed Babar’s batting and Shaheen’s bowling skills for playing an “important role” in the win.
Conveying his congratulations to Captain Salman Agha, Head Coach Mike Hesson and other players, Naqvi said “teamwork, hard work and professional approach” led to the victory.
 






Shaheen got Pakistan off to a flyer with two wickets halfway through the first over and almost bagged a third victim two balls later.
Opener Quinton de Kock’s stumps were undone on the second ball of the innings with a delivery that jagged back, found an edge and clattered into the woodwork.
On the very next ball, Lhuan-dre Pretorious then spooned a catch to Usman Tariq at short fine-leg.
Pakistan were in dreamland when the umpire adjudged Dewald Brevis lbw on the first ball of a spectacular opening over, only for the decision review system to show that the ball was going to rise over the stumps.
South Africa were rocking and their first boundary only came on the penultimate ball of the third over when opener Reeza Hendricks punched Shaheen away to the extra cover fence.
Things were otherwise kept tight by Shaheen’s new ball partner, Salman Mirza, who came off a sparkling performance in the second match of the series a day earlier, where Pakistan had shot down South Africa for 110 to level the series, giving little away.
Faheem, player-of-the-match on Friday, gave away just two runs in the fifth over with Salman bowling a tidy sixth as South Africa crawled to 22-2 at the end of the powerplay.
 






Brevis, though, broke the shackles with two sixes off spinner Mohammad Nazwaz in the seventh over — the first straight down the ground and the second over deep midwicket.
Brevis (21), though, was gone soon after with debutant spinner Usman Tariq getting his maiden T20I wicket with the second ball of his career; the South African batter finding Babar Azam at long-on as he tried to go big once again.
The incoming Matthew Breetzke didn’t last long, seeing his stumps shattered by Nawaz with a ball that straightened after pitching in the following over as South Africa slipped from 38-2 to 42-4.
Skipper Donovan Ferreira breathed fresh impetus with a six off Usman, as South Africa reached 56-4 halfway through their innings, and then upped the ante with two sixes and a four in the 11th over bowled by Nawaz.
But Ferreira’s big-hitting spree didn’t last long as, after making 29 off 13, he holed out to his counterpart Salman Ali Agha at mid-off in the following over by Faheem.
South Africa were six down on the next ball with George Linde finding Hasan Nawaz at midwicket with Pakistan firmly on top.
Hendricks’ long, patient stay at the crease ended in the 15th over when he top-edged Usman to Hasan at deep backward square to depart for 34 off 36 with two fours.
 






The incoming Andile Simelane then hoisted Shaheen for the fourth six of the innings to set South Africa’s total beyond Friday’s below-par effort, but departed after making 13 when Salman Mirza had him caught at midwicket in the 18th over.
Shaheen bagged his third wicket when he sent back Lizaad Williams in the penultimate over, but Corbin Bosch (30 not out) ensured South Africa reached a respectable total.
Sahibzada Farhan got Pakistan’s first runs in the chase with a six over long-off on the third ball of their innings, but lost his opening partner Saim Ayub in the second over — the left-hander miscuing to Ferreira of Bosch.
Babar, arriving to adoring cheers from the crowd, got his first four on the ninth ball he faced with a sumptuous pull off Williams and then cut him away for another two deliveries later.
Babar was in the mood and swept Linde for a one-bounce four in the following over as Pakistan reached the end of the powerplay at 36-1.
Sahibzada then got his second boundary, driving Ferreira down the ground for four, but departed soon after when the South African skipper had him caught at deep midwicket for 19 on the last ball of the seventh over.
In the face of spin from both ends, Babar and captain Salman Ali Agha sought to steady the chase with just one boundary coming in overs eighth to 10th, by the end of which Pakistan were 64-2.
Boundaries, however, came thick and fast in the 12th over by Ottneil Baartman — Agha’s edge flying to the third man fence after a misfield before Babar got three in a row to raise his half-century off 36 balls.
 






Babar, who returned to the side for the series, was putting on a show and got another two boundaries in the 14th over of Bosch as Pakistan closed in on the target.
Babar and Salman, who was providing able support at the other end, however, couldn’t take Pakistan to the end.
Salman had just got his second boundary but perished on the next ball, having made 33 off 26, when he chipped Williams to Simelane in the 16th over.
Babar fell in the next over, when he pulled Bosch to Hendricks at deep backward square to bring an end to his 47-ball knock.
Two more wickets followed Babar’s fall as Hasan was caught off Williams and Silemane cleaned up Nawaz, but Pakistan eventually wrapped it up with an over to spare.</p><small>2025-11-02 04:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0209474718d2763.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952653/tax-net-expands-with-892000-new-filers' target='_blank'><strong>Tax net expands with 892,000 new filers</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has linked the filing of 892,419 new tax returns for the tax year 2025 to rising public confidence in the government’s reform agenda.
The premier’s remarks followed the Federal Board of Revenue’s announcement that the tax department received 5.912 million tax returns for tax year 2025, up from 5.025m returns in tax year 2024, marking a 17.65 per cent increase. The last date for filing the tax returns was Oct 31.
An official announcement issued by the Prime Minister’s Secretariat has commended the FBR for achieving a historic milestone. He expressed deep gratitude to the public for demonstrating civic responsibility and trust in the government’s economic policies.
Highlighting the inclusion of new filers into the tax net, Prime Minister Shehbaz said this surge reflects growing public confidence in the government’s reform agenda. “We are sincerely thankful to the people for their support,” he stated.

PM Shehbaz links surge in new returns to FBR digitisation drive

Mr Shehbaz attributed the positive outcomes to ongoing tax system reforms, calling them a blessing and a sign of progress.
He emphasised merit as the cornerstone of FBR’s institutional culture, noting that capable and hardworking officers are being encouraged while underperformance is being actively discouraged.
Individual tax filings surge in FY25, with a sharp rise in returns accompanied by payments. The FBR recorded a significant uptick in individual tax filings for the year 2025, with the total number of returns reaching 5.805 million — an 18.18pc increase from the 4.912m filed in the previous year.
Of these, 3.599m returns were submitted along with tax payments, marking a 19pc rise compared to 3.024m paid filings in 2024.
The total tax revenue collected through these returns climbed to Rs69.02bn in FY25, up from Rs60.15bn the year before — reflecting a year-on-year growth of 10pc.
According to the announcement, the prime minister underscored his personal oversight of FBR’s digitisation efforts, chairing weekly meetings to ensure transparency and efficiency.
He noted that tax filing procedures have been simplified, and automated clearance systems at ports have helped curb corruption and improve performance.
The government has launched a simplified tax return form in Urdu for salaried individuals to make tax filing easier.
To combat the informal economy, the government has expanded the use of point-of-sale systems, effectively reducing sales tax evasion.
The prime minister also pointed to a Rs9bn increase in tax revenue along with the filing of tax returns compared to the previous year as clear evidence of the success of FBR’s reforms.
He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to further reforming the FBR and pledged continued efforts to eliminate corruption and the shadow economy. “We are working day and night to ensure a fair and transparent fiscal system,” he concluded.

Against the backdrop of this upheaval, I was seeking some temporary respite from the uncertain, often ugly and violent world, and surfing the net for content that could serve as a mild analgesic, even anaesthetic, and got lucky. And you’d be hard-pressed to realise how very lucky.
What I found on a video-streaming social media platform was a window to a Pakistan that was uplifting, life-affirming and reassuring. I don’t watch much of our TV channels for the simple reason that it is largely a case of more of the same.
News and current-affairs programmes (NCA, as we media people call this genre) are anything but NCA. These are mostly designed to either serve as homage to the ego of the ‘anchor’ or are entertainment with politicians from across the political divide, socking it to each other.
These offer near-zero insights and are often as pleasant as a cockfight that leaves the poor birds bloody and debilitated. One learns nothing. And if watching two (or more) people talking over one another in a pointless, escalating shouting match does not do anything for you, as is the case with me, sitting in front of the idiot box becomes an exercise in futility.

One man’s love for music made a difference because that is the upside of authoritarianism.

But back to more pleasant things. So, on the video-streaming platform I found some clips from a talent hunt show called Pakistan Idol. Having lived through the Zia years as a young college and then university student and then as a journalist in the nascent years of my professional life, I was sure that the culturally barren society that the dictator sought to create would remain so.
 
 

Of course, the democratic interludes did resuscitate the ‘cultural scene’ somewhat, but it was left to another authoritarian leader, a proponent of ‘enlightened moderation’, to revive it in a bit more structured manner. Yes, one man’s love for music made a difference because that is the upside of authoritarianism. It suddenly became kosher for high civil and military officials to be seen enjoying a musical evening and patronising art and artistes.
Once an interviewer, half mockingly, asked Malakah-i-Mouseeqi Roshan Ara Begum if those who showed up in large numbers to her live events understood the classical music that was her forte. The indomitable classical artiste par excellence smiled and said: “Mere sunnay walay do qism ke hein. Ek woh jo raag jaantay aur samajhtay hein aur doosray woh jo kan rasiya hein. Mere liye donon qabile ehtaram hein.” (Those who listen to me are of two kinds: first, those who understand classical music; and second, those whose ‘ear’ is discerning and can tell when they hear good music. I value both).
Although my soldier-father could sing classical music and could tell apart one raag from another with consummate ease, I count myself in the ‘kan-rasiya’ category. I wish I could have learnt the intricacies of each raag and its defining characteristics but remain grateful for a discerning ‘ear’.
 
 

Having read criticism of some of the Pakistan Idol judges and their alleged lack of nous to be able to ‘judge’ others, it was easy to see in the worst of cases, they were ‘kan rasiya’. Almost all of them were able to tell what was good singing.
Some of the songs (ghazal, geet, nazm) chosen by the contestants took me to back to my childhood, as I grew up in a household where artistes, singers and musicians were held in high esteem and musical evenings were the norm. How else other than a privilege can you describe watching as a child in awe maestros of the calibre of Ustad Umrao Bundu Khan and Muneer Khatoon performing in our drawing room, emptied of all its furniture for a ‘farshi nishist’.
For Ms Khatoon, I recall my father telling me years later that he needed to get special permission from the GHQ to invite the ‘Indian classical artiste’ to our home whilst she was on a visit to Pakistan. I remember him telling me how what was possible in the first half of the 1960s would be impossible after the 1965 war — and perhaps even more so today.
In my formative years, whether it was a ghazal evening in an army mess, the Services Club or the Karachi Press Club, literally a one-minute walk from where we lived on Ingle Road in the mid-1960s up to 1966-67, I always accompanied my parents. Annu (Bhai) Uncle (Dawn journalist Anwer Husain), my father’s university classmate, would always invite us.
 
 

I was thus able to listen to my heart’s content Farida Khanum, Iqbal Bano and Mehdi Hasan among others. Much later, after my parents’ passing, during the 1983 MRD movement, I watched a defiant Abida Parveen singing up a near-revolution at the KPC.
Because the Pakistan Idol had some of the contestants singing songs of so many of the asataza including Melody Queen Nur Jahan, it was but understandable that I was flooded with memories, nostalgia. The quality of the singing whether it was a ghazal, thumri, nazm or geet was so good. Pakistan is abundant in talent. It is bursting at the seams actually. Its flaws lie elsewhere.
Pakistan Idol performances triggered a desire to indulge in a listening session lasting long hours over several days, on headphones. I wonder what it was like for my wife who had to hear pretty loud cries out of nowhere of ‘wahwahwah … kiya kehnay … bohot khoob’. As for me, at least for now I feel rejuvenated and prepared to face the cruel world.

According to the International Federation of Journalists, at least 99 journalists and media workers have been killed so far this year, mostly in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan. The Committee to Protect Journalists notes that the persistent failure to prosecute perpetrators has emboldened those who target reporters, spreading fear and eroding the public’s right to know. Unesco, meanwhile, warns that nine out of 10 journalist murders worldwide remain unsolved, revealing how deeply impunity has taken root.
 


 
 

The stories behind these numbers are those of immense courage and loss: Palestinian-American reporter Shireen Abu Akleh, shot dead in 2022 while covering an Israeli raid; Mexico’s Javier Valdez Cárdenas, murdered for exposing drug-cartel links; Slovakia’s Ján Kuciak, killed for investigating corruption. Their families still wait for justice, while governments evade responsibility. CPJ observes that the pattern of impunity stretches from autocracies to democracies. This is proof that the failure to protect journalists is a global moral collapse, not a regional flaw.
This year’s global theme — ‘Chat GBV: Raising Awareness on AI-facilitated Gender-Based Violence against Women Journalists’ — captures a newer, more insidious front. Technology-facilitated gender-based violence has grown exponentially, with deepfakes, doxxing and algorithm-driven harassment used to discredit women and deter them from public life.
The anonymity of digital platforms, combined with the speed and scale of generative AI, has created a hostile environment where smear campaigns can spread worldwide within minutes and remain online indefinitely. Such abuse is not only psychological warfare but a deliberate attempt to push women out of journalism. When women journalists retreat from digital spaces, society loses voices essential to fair and diverse storytelling.
The picture is no less grim in Pakistan. Freedom Network’s impunity report for 2025 recorded a 60pc rise in attacks and legal actions against journalists between November 2024 and September 2025, documenting 142 cases nationwide. Government authorities were responsible in seven out of 10 incidents, while Islamabad and Punjab each accounted for 28pc of violations.
 
 

The Pakistan Press Foundation’s 2025 review corroborates this pattern, listing over 137 cases of threats, arrests, and assaults during the same period — including 35 physical attacks, eight arrests, and 22 cases under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act. Both groups warn that such actions are eroding the fragile gains once promised by Pakistan’s journalist-safety laws. Despite the early adoption of these laws, enforcement is weak and commissions largely dormant.
Until the state shows the will to investigate attacks credibly, reform Peca, and confront the online persecution of women journalists, impunity will remain the unspoken law of the land.

The inauguration of the Grand Egyptian Museum, or GEM, marks the end of a two-decade construction effort hampered by the Arab Spring uprisings, pandemic and wars in neighbouring countries.
“We’ve all dreamed of this project and whether it would really come true,” Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly told a press conference, calling the museum a “gift from Egypt to the whole world from a country whose history goes back more than 7,000 years”.
Spectators including President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi gathered late on Saturday before an enormous screen outside the museum, which projected images of the country’s most famous cultural sites as dancers in glittering pharaonic-style garb waved glowing orbs and sceptres.
 


‘New chapter’ for Egypt
They were accompanied by Egyptian pop stars and an international orchestra decked out in white beneath a sky lit with lasers, fireworks and hovering lights that formed into moving hieroglyphics.
 
 

By opening the museum, Egypt was “writing a new chapter in the story of this ancient nation’s present and future,” Sisi said at the
opening.
The audience included German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Tshisekedi, and the crown princes of Oman and Bahrain.
The museum’s most heavily promoted attraction is the expansive collection of treasures from Tutankhamun’s tomb, uncovered in 1922, including the boy-king’s golden burial mask, throne and sarcophagus, and thousands of other objects.
A colossal statue of Ramses II that sat for decades in a downtown Cairo square bearing the pharaoh’s name now adorns the grand entry hall.

The LHC bench held earlier this year that such cases should ordinarily be heard by a single judge.
The IHC’s detailed order, authored by Justice Mohammed Azam Khan in a criminal appeal, elaborates the constitutional and statutory basis for assigning National Accountability Bureau (NAB)-related cases to division benches of two or more judges.
“Proceedings under the National Acco­untability Ordi­nance are not routine writs or criminal matters; they concern institutional accountability, protection of public money and constitutional guarantees of fair trial,” the ruling emphasised.
The court argued that accountability proceedings involve complex constitutional and statutory questions of public importance and therefore require adjudication by more than one judge to ensure consistency, fairness, and institutional confidence.

IHC mandates division benches for NAB cases, contradicts LHC ruling

The judgement examined Article 192 of the Constitution, which it said empowers each High Court to frame rules for distributing business between single judges and larger benches.
 
 

The IHC observed that the NAO, as a special law dealing with public office holders, falls into a category of cases with statutory intricacy or greater public consequence that warrants the scrutiny of more than one judge.
Referring to Article 192 and the Islamabad High Court (Procedure) Rules, the bench stated that the jurisdictional assignment of NAO cases to a division bench is a “constitutional safeguard intended to maintain judicial balance, avoid inconsistency, and uphold the integrity of the accountability process.”
The court also addressed Section 32 of the NAO, which specifies that appeals from accountability courts must go before a division bench. It said this provision reflects the legislature’s intent for higher judicial scrutiny, supporting the principle that all proceedings under the ordinance should be similarly handled.
This interpretation, however, is in direct contrast to an April ruling from the LHC’s Rawalpindi bench, delivered by Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Tariq Mahmood Bajwa.
The judges held that constitutional petitions should be heard by a single judge, citing court rules that allow it unless a law expressly mandates otherwise. They argued that Section 32 of the NAO only authorises division benches for appeals from final judgements, not for initial petitions.
They said that bypassing single judges for such petitions deprived litigants of their right to appeal and contravened Article 10A of the Constitution.

The landmark ruling by Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas settles a long-standing jurisdictional dispute between the two federal regulators and clarifies that the CCP holds statutory authority to ensure fair competition in all sectors, including telecommunications.
The judgement was issued on Saturday in a series of writ petitions filed by major mobile network operators — Jazz, Telenor, Zong and Ufone — challenging the CCP’s show-cause notices and inquiries. The companies had argued that since the telecom industry is already regulated by the PTA under the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organisation) Act, 1996, the CCP could not exercise parallel oversight.
Rejecting this argument, Justice Minhas held that the Competition Act, 2010 gives the CCP exclusive jurisdiction to regulate market competition across all sectors of the economy, without exception.

Court says CCP should act against anti-competitive practices instead

He observed that the PTA’s functions are limited to licensing, tariff approval, spectrum management, and technical regulation — not issues of market dominance or collusive behaviour.
 
 

“The PTA may regulate services, licensing, and technical compliance, but it is the Competition Commission that ensures fair play and prevents abuse of market power,” the judge wrote in his detailed verdict. “The existence of a sectoral regulator does not oust the jurisdiction of the CCP in enforcing the Competition Act.”
The court emphasised that the CCP’s jurisdiction covers all undertakings — whether in telecom, banking, energy, or manufacturing — and that no special exemption exists for telecom operators. Justice Minhas described the CCP as the “federal watchdog for fair competition,” responsible for protecting consumers and markets from anti-competitive conduct, price-fixing, and cartelisation.
He also clarified that the IHC had territorial jurisdiction over the matter since both the CCP and PTA are headquartered in federal capital and the impugned proceedings originated from the CCP’s Islamabad office.
 
 

During the hearings, the CCP argued that the telecom operators’ petitions were an attempt to evade lawful investigation into alleged market collusion and abuse of dominance.
The commission maintained that restricting such matters solely to the PTA would leave anti-competitive behaviour unchecked in the telecom sector.
Justice Minhas endorsed this view, noting that “the presence of a sector-specific regulator cannot create an enclave of immunity from general competition law”. He observed that Pakistan’s legislative framework, modelled on international best practices, envisions coexistence — not exclusion — between the CCP and other regulators.
Concluding the judgement, Justice Minhas reaffirmed that the CCP has the legal and constitutional mandate to regulate competitive behaviour in the telecom sector, while the PTA’s role remains confined to technical and operational regulation.

• Pakistan issues over 2,100 visas to Indian Sikh pilgrims
LARKANA: Amid a festive atmosphere, a special train carrying hundreds of devotees left Larkana on Saturday for Nankana Sahib to participate in the 556th birth anniversary celebrations of Baba Guru Nanak.
A large number of pilgrims from Larkana and Qambar-Shahdadkot districts — including men, women, elders, and children — boarded the special train, as Hindu Panchayat Chairman Harish Lal, along with other community leaders, bid them farewell at the Larkana Railway Station before its departure for Rohri.
Once the special train reaches Rohri, its bogies will be attached to another train bound for the destination.
The devotees are expected to return on November 7 after attending the birthday rituals of Guru Nanak.
 
 

According to the Railway Station Master, the special train carrying 234 devotees left for Rohri under strict security arrangements supervised by Station Master Ayaz Abbasi, with the assistance of district police and railway police.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government has finalised all arrangements for the celebrations taking place from Nov 3 to 6 at Nankana Sahib.
A high-level delegation, comprising Chairman Cabinet Committee on Law and Order Khawaja Salman Rafique, Provincial Minister for Minorities Affairs Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora, and Secretary Home Dr. Ahmad Javed Qazi, visited Nankana Sahib on Saturday to review the preparations.
 






Punjab Minister for Minorities Affairs Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora said the celebrations will begin with the Akhand Paath and culminate with the main event and Nagar Kirtan on November 5 at Gurdwara Janam Asthan.
He said around 30,000 pilgrims, including 2,100 from India, are expected, and all security and hospitality arrangements have been finalised.
Indian Sikh pilgrims have been issued visas  for Pakistan, the first major allowance after travel between the  arch-rival nations was frozen during conflict in May.
While there was no immediate response from New Delhi, Indian newspapers reported on  Saturday that the government would allow “selected” groups to travel for a 10-day festival to celebrate the founder of the Sikh faith.
The Pakistan High Commis­sion in New Delhi had issued “over 2,100 visas to Sikh pilgrims from India”.
Schools closed in Nankana
A three-day holiday has been declared for all schools and colleges in Nankana City from November 4 to 6, while Baba Guru Nanak University will remain closed from November 3 to 6 for the birth anniversary celebrations.
Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique said special hospital wards in Lahore and Faisalabad will be set up to facilitate Sikh pilgrims attending Guru Nanak’s birth celebrations.

• Fawad says leading efforts to pave way for dialogue, get PTI chief released from jail
LAHORE: After PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi was hospitalised in the provincial capital, three former PTI leaders arrived in his hospital room, ostensibly to convince the incarcerated party vice chairman to join their ‘release Imran Khan campaign’ — a move rebuffed by Mr Qureshi.
According to his lawyer Rana Mudassar Umer, former leaders Fawad Chaudhry, Imran Ismail, and Maulvi Mahmood managed to gain access to Mr Qureshi on Thursday when he was alone in his room.
“Shah Mahmood Qureshi was surprised to see them and immediately asked the police on duty to call his lawyer, who had left just a minute ago, and tell him some ‘guests’ had arrived,” Rana Mudassar said, adding by the time he got back, the ex-PTI leaders had already gone. He said the visitors stayed only a little over 10 minutes and left without any political discussion with Mr Qureshi.
The unannounced visit came after one of the three leaders was reportedly denied permission to meet Mr Qureshi.
Sources said the former PTI leaders have also attempted to give the impression that another PTI leader, Asad Umar, was also on board with their decision to launch an outreach campaign for Mr Khan’s release. Mr Umar, however, said he was not part of this group. He said he advised the trio against the hospital visit, as it would create friction in the party, while Mr Qureshi’s family would also be disturbed.
“I am not part of this campaign…a group of politicians is trying to highlight,” he told Dawn. The former PTI leader also clarified his stance in a tweet.
“Though any effort for the release of Imran Khan and other jailed leaders is good, but I am not part of the newly launched ‘Release Imran Khan’ campaign,” he said, adding that he learned from newspapers that he was a part of this campaign led by some former party leaders.
 






Paving way for dialogue
On the other hand, ex-PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry, in a video message, said they were trying to bring the political temperature down in the country and make the release of Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi possible, besides getting the right of bail for political prisoners acknowledged in the country.
He said they were trying to create an environment in which a dialogue could take place. “The political temperature can come down in the country only if the PTI takes one step back and the government takes a step forward.”
He claimed that he had also met Ejaz Chaudhry and other leaders and was happy that they too agreed that the political temperature should come down in the country. He said his group members would meet PML-N senior ministers as well as Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
 


Mr Qureshi’s lawyer, however, termed the remarks by Fawad Chaudhry “deception” and said the former PTI leader did not even visit the incarcerated PTI leadership in the Kot Lakhpat jail, either on Thursday or Friday. The jail trial continued from 10:30am to 4:30pm, he said, questioning the motive behind the hospital trip.
He said PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed and Omer Sarfraz Cheema were united and standing by Imran Khan, who had repeatedly announced that he would not make any deals with the establishment or the government and would fight his cases on legal grounds.
 
 

Besides Mr Qureshi, who is expected to undergo a surgical procedure for gallbladder stones next week, Omer Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed were also hospitalised. According to sources, the home department and jail administration were not offering proper medical services to the incarcerated leaders in Kot Lakhpat jail.
The lawyer said the courts had been ordering the shifting of Qureshi to the hospital for the past six weeks, but the administration was not complying with the directives. Eventually, he said, Mr Qureshi underwent two check-ups and was advised to be admitted to the hospital.
“Qureshi is undergoing different lab tests and is expected to be operated upon during the next week,” the lawyer stated.
He also claimed that Dr Yasmin Rashid was also denied regular physiotherapy sessions despite her medical condition.

Officials said that adequate arrangements had been made both at the immigration offices and at the exit-zero point to facilitate the return of stranded families, who had been impatiently waiting for the border to reopen since Oct 12.
They added that Afghan nationals holding temporary identity or registration cards, as well as those without any such documents, were allowed to return to their homeland.
However, Afghan nationals possessing valid visas in their passports were not permitted to go beyond the Michni check post. Officials said that the focus was on first easing the burden by sending back “illegal” aliens, while legal cross-border movement would be resumed at an appropriate time.
Local sources said that the majority of the families which were stranded in Jamrud and Landi Kotal were deported from different parts of Punjab prior to the closure of the border.
The local administration had arranged temporary accommodations for returning Afghan families at the NLC terminal in Jamrud and at safe roadside locations in Landi Kotal. Most of these families had been staying inside the vehicles they had hired for their journey back, with very limited resources.
It was also learnt that the Pakistani authorities on Saturday allowed empty vehicles, which had earlier transported returning families of refugees to Afghanistan and became stranded on the Afghan side following the sudden border closure on Oct 12, to return.
The return of families continued late into Saturday, with officials stating that the process would continue in the coming days.

Hamid Khan group won one seat and an independent candidate claimed the remaining position.
As per the unofficial tally, Abdul Rehman Har Bajwa emerged as the top scorer with 1,369 votes, followed closely by Raja Aleem Abbasi with 1,351 votes, Chaudhry Hafeezullah Yaqoob 1,295 votes, Mohammad Zafar Khokhar 1,288 votes and Asif Irfan 1,126 votes.
The candidates backed by the government — Abdul Rehman Har Bajwa, Raja Aleem Abbasi and Asif Irfan — were declared successful.
Chaudhry Hafeezullah Yaqoob, representing the Hamid Khan group, also secured a seat while Mohammad Zafar Khokhar won as an independent candidate.
A total of 21 candidates contested the elections. Under the rules, five candidates securing the highest number of votes are declared members of the bar council.
 
 

As soon as the results were announced, supporters of the winning candidates celebrated their victory on the court premises. They beat drums, chanted slogans and distributed sweets among colleagues and friends.
The polling was held at the Judicial Complex, where 20 polling stations were set up. To ensure transparency and fairness, 20 judges were appointed as returning officers for the electoral process.
Voting began at 9am and continued until 4pm with a one-hour break. Despite the high turnout and intense competition, the election process remained peaceful with no untoward incidents reported.
Strict security arrangements were in place throughout the day with law enforcement personnel deployed at the polling venues to maintain order and facilitate smooth conduct of the elections.
The bar council elections are considered an important indicator of lawyers’ political alignments and often reflect broader trends in national legal politics with the government and opposition-backed groups vying for influence within the legal fraternity.

“Now don’t ask all these questions. Ask such things in private,” he said while responding in an interview on Samaa TV show ‘Mere Sawal’ on Friday, when asked to confirm whether Pakistan had conducted the missile test or not.
The question came in the wake of a “rare lenticular cloud formation” observed over Quetta in the early hours of Tuesday that left the public puzzled over the phenomenon and its origins.
When asked about the matter earlier this week, Asif had dismissed the online chatter of a hypersonic ballistic missile test as mere speculation.
 
 

Citizens had reported sighting the phenomenon around morning prayers from many parts of Balochistan and speculation was rife about the likely cause. Many social media accounts hinted that the cloud formation was the result of a missile test or a new technology tested by the military.
In a post on X later in the day, the Pakistan Meteorological Department said the sight was a “lenticular cloud formation” which was observed early morning over the Koh-i-Murdar region.
“The cloud appeared before sunrise, persisted for approximately 20 minutes, and dissipated just prior to sunrise.”
 






As per the United Kingdom’s Met Office, lenticular clouds are lens-shaped orographic wave clouds that are formed when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.
“These strange, unnatural-looking clouds sometimes form downwind of hills or mountains … They look a lot like the traditional shape of flying saucers in science fiction, and real lenticular clouds are believed to be one of the most common explanations for UFO (unidentified flying object) sightings across the world,” it said.</p><small>2025-11-02 02:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02072653830c7d4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952669/israel-strikes-gaza-claims-returned-bodies-not-of-prisoners' target='_blank'><strong>Israel strikes Gaza, claims returned bodies ‘not of prisoners’</strong></a><br><p>• Hamas insists Tel Aviv declined offer to provide samples for testing
• Says warships opened fire towards shores of Khan Yunis
JERUSALEM: Israel claimed on Saturday that three bodies it received from Gaza the night before were not prisoners held in the Palestinian territory, as a Hamas security source reported fresh strikes in the south.
Despite occasional flare-ups, a fragile truce has been holding in Gaza since Oct 10, based on a US-brokered deal centred on the return of all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead.
Israel’s military told AFP that a forensic analysis revealed that three bodies it received via the Red Cross on Friday were not those of any of the deceased captives still to be handed over as part of the ceasefire deal.
 
 

Hamas’s armed wing said on Saturday that it had handed over bodies it had not positively identified, saying that Israel had declined its offer to provide samples for testing and “demanded the bodies for examination”.
“We handed them over to pre-empt any enemy claims,” the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said.
After the start of the truce, Hamas returned the 20 surviving prisoners still in its custody and began the process of returning the remains of the dead.
Of the 17 bodies returned since the start of the ceasefire, 15 were Israelis, one was Thai and one was Nepalese.
Israel has accused Hamas of not returning the dead prisoners quickly enough, but the Palestinian group says it will take time to locate remains buried in Gaza’s ruins.
In its statement on Saturday, the Al-Qassam Brigades called on mediators and the Red Cross to provide the “necessary equipment and personnel to work on recovering all the bodies simultaneously”.
Hamas and Israel, meanwhile, have traded accusations of breaking the ceasefire.
A Hamas security source told AFP on Saturday that Israel had carried out several air strikes in the south at dawn, and that “warships opened fire towards the shores of Khan Yunis”.
Earlier in the week, the Israeli military launched its deadliest night of bombing since the truce after one of its soldiers was killed in south Gaza, with the territory’s civil defence agency reporting more than 100 people killed.

PROLOGUE
Following the four-day May war between Pakistan and India — sparked by India’s military aggression — certain propitious events seem to have raised Pakistan’s regional and international profile and, on the surface, diminished India’s.
Reference to US President Donald Trump’s praise for Pakistan resulting in warmer US-Pakistan relations, lower US tariffs on Pakistani exports, Pakistan’s participation in Trump’s so-called Middle East peace plan and a strategic pact with Saudi Arabia have got most analysts to declare that Pakistan is now in a geopolitical sweet spot. This assessment requires nuance.
States inevitably respond to external stimuli, but national security — a much broader concept — cannot merely rest on fortuitous events or the immediate. It is a set of systemic objectives, pursued through a complex structure of governmental and non-governmental actors, institutions, and bureaucracies. A system-analytical approach is therefore essential to evaluate foreign policy success, moving beyond the ephemeral nature of opportunistic gains. In other words, lottery wins are about serendipity, not strategy.

In the wake of recent diplomatic wins and military successes, Pakistan appears resurgent. But beneath the surface lies the volatile reality of a state stretched thin due to hostile neighbours to the east and west, and because of deepening crises within — which have rendered Pakistan unable to retreat, yet ill-equipped to advance

THE THREE FRONT PROBLEM
The central point of this article is that, far from being in a sweet spot, Pakistan might just be in more than a spot of bother. To clarify, I don’t intend to look the gift horses in the mouth. The absence of what’s good would have made matters worse and so what’s good is always welcome. My contention is that just like one swallow does not make summer, a few favourable developments do not mean Pakistan is out of the woods; nor do they address the country’s structural weaknesses. If anything, Pakistan is facing a three-front conflict and lacks the depth, resources and strategies to resolve these conflicts. 
In the east, we have a traditional adversary; in the west, a simmering conflict has boiled over. At home, the state is now in conflict with the citizens and, in at least two parts, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan, the conflict has not only turned bloody but developed linkages with the conflicts in the east and west.
This is an untenable situation for any state, even one that is very powerful and resourceful. Each of the three conflicts has to be analysed not just on the basis of its own dynamics but also how and where they might interact, making the situation and its resolution more complex. It’s also important to see what necessary condition(s) must be met before the state can move to the sufficient condition(s) for such mitigation. 
The caveat is that I have no panacea. The complexity of human affairs defies any attempt to quantify it in mathematical terms and quod erat demonstrandum it. Structural analyses cannot rest on prescriptions that might seem obvious but ignore the constraints the structure puts on them. It is not enough to say that if we do A, B and C, that would result in D, E and F. The real issue is why A, B and C cannot be done even when doing so offer the optimal courses of action.
That said, and before I attempt to analyse the three conflicts I have identified, let’s look into how and when a conflict can move from emergence and escalation to de-escalation and a negotiated settlement.
MUTUALLY HURTING STALEMATE
The term ‘Mutually Hurting Stalemate’ (MHS) was coined by the late American political scientist I. William Zartman and was articulated in his 1985 book Ripe for Resolution: Conflict and Intervention in Africa. The concept has since been refined and written about by several other scholars of conflict resolution and has become a cornerstone of modern conflict analysis and mediation theory.
At its core, MHS describes a point in a conflict where the warring parties perceive that they cannot win through continued escalation or military means. This is a necessary, though not sufficient condition. The parties must also determine that the cost of continued conflict is becoming intolerable or is worse than the anticipated benefits of a settlement.
To this end, Zartman says perception is central: the stalemate must be perceived by the warring parties. Zartman et al also argue that an objective stalemate observed by an outside analyst or potential mediator is irrelevant if the parties continue to believe that victory is possible.
Put another way, the hurting element of the stalemate must have three elements: 1) pain (the cost in human lives, economic devastation, political instability, international pressure or military attrition is high and escalating); 2) the determination that it will be unbearable in the future — ie the parties foresee that the situation is likely to get worse, not better, if the conflict continues; and 3) the “way out” — the parties must believe that a negotiated solution is possible, the other side is also feeling the pain and may be ready to talk. 
This is where mediators often play a critical role. The third element was where Zartman refined his MHS framework under the Ripeness Theory (the moment is ripe) and introduced the concept of Mutually Enticing Opportunity (MEO). While MHS is often necessary to make the parties want to talk, it is not always sufficient to make them agree. The pain can drive them to the table but, once there, they need a positive vision of the future to seal a deal. That’s where the MEO comes in to complement the MHS.
A successful peace process often requires both. For instance, in Northern Ireland, the MHS was the prolonged and bloody stalemate of The Troubles. The MEO was the vision of power-sharing and economic cooperation laid out in the Good Friday Agreement, which gave all parties a tangible benefit to saying “yes”.
In contrast, the Angolan civil war continued despite interventions by external powers (the US, the Soviet Union, Cuba, South Africa). The mediation efforts prevented a clear MHS from forming because the external powers would prop up their preferred side, giving them hope for victory and thus prolonging the conflict. A true MHS emerged only when these external supports wavered, forcing the parties to confront the reality of their unwinnable situation.
Let’s now get to our conflicts.
THE INDIA-PAKISTAN CONFLICT
I begin with the India-Pakistan conflict because, notwithstanding its complexity and historical trajectory, it is also, unfortunately, the most traditional and taken-for-granted conflict. Like eczema, it has almost become an autoimmune disorder that wavers between periods of remission, recrudescence and flare-ups.
I have written about this conflict before, so I will keep it short. At the moment, there’s no MHS between India and Pakistan for two broad reasons: military and political. Being military peer competitors, neither can compel the other to change course. Decisive victories and defeats (rare occurrences, by the way) can lead to changing the status quo, as do protracted, hurting conflicts.
Post-World War II, while Germany was comprehensively defeated, the victorious European powers too, especially France, were in no better condition than the vanquished. With the US-led reconstruction plan and money, the Alsace-Lorraine region, a bone of contention between France and Germany since the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, became the basis for cooperation and the emergence of the European Coal and Steel Community.
That situation does not obtain between India and Pakistan. Even after India defeated Pakistan in 1971, the crescendo of its military prowess against Pakistan, it did not have the capacity to defeat West Pakistan. That situation has not changed — in fact, as demonstrated by short and sharp skirmishes since 2019, Pakistan has fast closed the conventional asymmetric gap between itself and India and might even have surpassed it in certain capabilities.
The second important factor is the impact Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindutva-driven ideology has had on India’s domestic politics. In the 11 years that Modi has been in power, with nearly four still remaining, he has presented himself as the strong leader India always needed. That ‘strength’ has not meant much vis-a-vis China, but it has been fully on display in relation to Pakistan. The setbacks in 2019 and 2025 have further inflamed Modi. He just cannot afford, politically and ideologically, to change course. That would be political suicide.
Domestic politics, like in any International Relations system analysis, is also moot in Pakistan’s case. Given the fragility and divisiveness of internal politics and uneven civil-military relations, the May war was a godsend for the army. Since 2021 it drives a plug-in hybrid where the civilian side is the inconsequential EV for democracy-friendly suburban consolation, while the vehicle still runs primarily on the army’s internal combustion engine. Add to that the highly controversial results of the February 8 national elections and the army needed a selling point. Modi obliged. 
In a bizarre confluence of domestic politicking on both sides, Modi in India and the hybrid regime in Pakistan needed a win. By the looks of it, both have got it — or at least that’s what their perception is, given the differential between the actual conflict and its projection in the media.

For now, far from experiencing a mutually hurting stalemate, the two sides believe they have the space for military modernisation, honing their operational doctrines, addressing weaknesses and bolstering strengths. 
Further, and this is a bigger problem, given its bidirectional causality, rulers in both countries continue to choreograph victory orchestras for political reasons, which further shrink the space for them to move to a cooperative paradigm. This means that continued conflict has higher payoffs than peace. Corollary: the two sides are primed for another round, not for de-escalation and negotiation.
PAK-AFGHAN BLUES
In January this year, I wrote in these pages about the history of Pak-Afghan relations and Kabul’s irredentism so I won’t go into those details. But just to recap, Afghanistan was the only country that refused to recognise Pakistan at the formation of the new dominion as a successor state to the Government of India. Kabul argued that Pakistan’s northwest frontier “should not be recognised as a part of Pakistan until the [Pakhtuns] of that area had been given the opportunity to opt out for independence.”
While Afghanistan withdrew the negative vote in October 1947 and both sides exchanged ambassadors in February 1948, Afghanistan’s irredentism has refused to go. Successive governments have wanted to ‘reclaim’ Pakistani territory up to the east of Indus River, what’s described in geographical terms as cis-Indus. The irredentism has continued to lurk across decades. It has re-emerged with the unelected Taliban government in Afghanistan, with various Taliban leaders calling the border a “hypothetical, imaginary line.”
Two points must be flagged: trouble between Pakistan and Afghanistan at different times has owed to Kabul’s revanchism; and Pakistan’s policy, for all its flaws, has been a response to that and an attempt to find a partner in Kabul who will recognise the border and live amicably with Pakistan.
For various reasons — details are outside the scope of this piece — that has not happened. Once again, Pakistan has failed to get Kabul to accept the border, refrain from interfering in Pakistan’s western and north-western districts through overt and covert actions, and to keep a recognised, peaceful border soft to help the tribes on both sides through positive engagement. Ironically, Kabul wants a soft line not as a border but to ingress into Pakistan, forcing Islamabad to harden the border.
Cross-border attacks by the self-styled Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have continued. The group now has Afghan fighters too. The Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan (TTA) continues to dissemble about the presence of the TTP in Afghanistan, even though Pakistan has directly talked to the TTP in Afghanistan multiple times. The TTP’s presence in Afghanistan has also been constantly flagged by the United Nation Security Council’s 1373 Committee, which deals with counter-terrorism.
Recently, when Pakistan struck targets inside Afghanistan after a major attack on security forces inside Pakistan, the TTA/TTP combine attacked Pakistani posts at multiple points along the border. This begot Pakistani retaliation, in which many TTA/TTP personnel were killed and some border posts captured. Kabul sued for a ceasefire, which Islamabad ignored until Qatar and Turkiye stepped in.
Talks in Qatar resulted in a statement that failed to mention the ‘border’ or acknowledge the presence of the TTP in Afghanistan or any reference to the group and its activities as terrorism. Similar fate has befallen the round of talks in Istanbul. Kabul has rejected Pakistan’s demand for a verifiable end to the TTP’s presence and its cross-border attacks. Instead, it has threatened to mount suicide attacks in Islamabad if Pakistan strikes targets in Kabul.
Given the structures of the problem, any deal is unlikely to hold. What will get Pakistan out of this problem from hell: talks, war, or a combo of jaw-jaw and war-war. At best it will depend on the ebbs and flows of the problem. Use of force must translate into utility of force — in other words, simply killing and destroying someone or something means nothing unless it opens up space for a dialogue and settlement.
For reasons totally different from the threat in the east, the use of force has limited utility against Afghanistan in terms of deterring it. Afghanistan is not a state in any modern sense of a state, at least not with the Taliban at the helm. To put it in perspective, Afghanistan is not India, which is far more powerful but vulnerable, like most states, precisely because a conflict would make it (as it would any state) lose much in economic, infrastructural and military terms.
Other factors being constant, deterrence works when states are configured in similar ways. It seeks to maintain the status quo between them — a state can prevent another state from undertaking an undesired action by influencing the other state’s perception of the costs, benefits and risks of an action. Whether it is deterrence by denial (convincing an opponent that he will not get his objectives should he start one) or punishment (the threat of counter-force and counter-value targeting against the adversary), the strategies require understanding the adversary’s pain points. 
Afghanistan is not a target-rich country. Both the TTA and TTP cadres are expendable. Ideology infuses stoic fatalism. The kind of low-intensity conflict the TTP is fighting and the TTA is supporting doesn’t really require big numbers. It can attrit without big numbers. 
The TTA wants Pakistan’s tribal districts to be controlled by the TTP. TTP obliges by presenting demands that cannot be accepted by the state: 1. reversing the legislative decision to merge erstwhile Federally Administrated Tribal Areas (Fata) into KPK; 2. TTP be allowed to return to their areas with their arms; 3. all troops to be withdrawn from the area; 4. all prisoners on terrorism charges be released and allowed to return to their areas; 5. Fata to be administered on the basis of “Sharia Law”; 6. no interference by the state in Fata’s affairs.

This is classical salami slicing. The TTA wants to capture Pakistani territory through the TTP, its kinship proxy. The TTP wants to exploit the territory to creep deeper into the Pakistani heartland. This is what former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef meant when he recently said that, while Afghanistan did not have fighter jets, missiles and ground air defences, it had something that could really hurt Pakistan: ideological presence inside Pakistan.
The current dispensation has decided that it will use force if challenged. The implications of that policy or how it should be formulated are outside our present purpose. What is important to flag, however, is the upshot: like in the east, in the west too, neither side has reached an MHS. If anything, Kabul has now shaken hands with New Delhi, which further complicates the situation for Pakistan. It also incentivises India and Afghanistan to continue with the present course. 
Result: we will continue to see the conflict unfolding with its ebbs and flows.
SIMMERING CAULDRON
We now come to the third front: internal. It has two elements: structural fragility and violence in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Structural fragility itself contains multiple aspects — dismal Human Development Index (HDI); political instability and repression; economic woes; institutional decline; violent religio-political mobs and utter disregard for any rules of the game.
I refer to HDI because, as literature tells us, it is a good indicator of the broader governance issues that result in policy failures or flip-flops and is a reflection of a country’s performance in key areas like health, education and standard of living. But there are other issues too: inequality, poverty, human security, empowerment, gender discrimination, lack of upward social mobility etc. Literature also tells us how any number of states have suffered and moved from continued fragility to failure. 
I don’t have to muster arguments to detail where Pakistan stands on all these indices or metrics, if you will. The data is readily available and presents a very dismal picture. Data also indicates that Pakistan, structurally, is an internally weak entity if one moves away from the shiny display of military toys and Trump’s praise of its “great leaders.” 
At the most basic, Pakistan has failed to invest in human resource, the engine that drives development and innovation. This is not a conflict per se (though some would argue it is in class, gender and other terms) but it establishes the fragility of Pakistan’s present and future in no uncertain terms and impacts sustainment.
Political instability is another structural problem, the result, according to literature, of weak institutions, colonial state structures, extractive elites, failure to integrate ethnic groups and aggregate interests. Some would even refer to a flawed state construction. 
Political instability has had its highs and lows, the nadir being the secession of East Pakistan. Much has been written about it by scholars of note. The paradox is that, while the state is structured to cause instability, its response to instability becomes repressive, creating a dispiriting cycle. At that point, the state becomes, to phrase it in Orwellian terms, like a man who takes to drinking because he feels himself to be a failure and then fails all the more completely because he drinks. 
Pakistan has the form of democracy. It just doesn’t have the substance. The Constitution has been keelhauled multiple times. For all its flaws, the result again of political and organisational interests, it is the document that establishes the compact and gives us the succession principle through elections. But it can’t enforce what it says. That enforcement must come through a normative acceptance of its role.
In Balochistan, sub-nationalist groups are fighting the state in order to secede while the genuine political voices in the province have been sidelined and are persecuted. The issue becomes more intractable because the groups fighting the state have got sanctuaries on contiguous foreign soils and, at least in the case of Balochistan, are also being sponsored by India, which has ramped up its sub-conventional war against Pakistan. That nexus makes it even more difficult for the state to unilaterally change its approach to dealing with these groups. This is also a point we noted above apropos of the TTA.
So where do we go from here?
EPILOGUE
The state, as currently configured, thinks it can tackle all three fronts. It also believes that the internal front is the easiest to deal with. It can beat up protestors and even shoot at them. It can throw political leaders and dissenters in the slammer and let them rot in there. They pose no real threat because social upheavals only happen in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal. It also believes that Balochistan is a counter-terrorism problem and it has the means to deal with it. Ditto for KP. 
Game theory has a term: Nash equilibrium (remember the film A Beautiful Mind, with Russell Crowe playing John Nash?). In a game, the players reach a situation in which every (or each) player will continue with their chosen strategy because none has the incentive to unilaterally deviate from it, after taking into consideration the opponent’s strategy. Whether it results in a stalemate or a mutually damaging spiral, the strategy won’t change.
If State A is going to keep its troops at the border, my best option is to also keep my troops deployed, because withdrawing would be seen as weakness and would weaken my security. State B’s thinking will be the exact same logic in reverse. As should be obvious, the best possible decision may not be an optimal outcome but the players are nonetheless locked in it.
The State of Pakistan is now in a Nash equilibrium on all three fronts. In mediaeval/Elizabethan times, fighting external enemies was a noble activity and internal dissent was a viperous worm. That’s where we are stuck. 
The state needs to mitigate at least one front, the internal, but it won’t. The best possible decision is not optimal, but the effect has become the cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form.
Giving a way out is just an academic exercise. None of the players will take it.
