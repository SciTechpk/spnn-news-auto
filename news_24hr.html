The Canadian province of Ontario said it would pull the offending anti-tariff ad on Monday so that negotiations could restart, after Trump alleged that the ad misrepresented the views of fellow Republican Reagan.
 






But Trump showed no sign of backing down, saying Ontario should not have let it air during the first two games this weekend of baseball’s World Series.
Adding extra spice to the row, the World Series features a Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays, facing a US team, the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Blue Jays thrashed the Dodgers 11-4 in the first game on Friday.
“Canada got caught cheating on a commercial, can you believe it?” Trump told reporters before heading on a trip to Asia.
“And I heard they were pulling the ad — I didn’t know they were putting it on a little bit more. They could have pulled it tonight,” Trump added.
After a reporter said the ad would be pulled on Monday, Trump replied: “That’s dirty play. But I can play dirtier than they can.”
 






Trump announced on his Truth Social network on Thursday that he had “terminated” all negotiations with Canada over what he called the “fake” ad campaign.
Less than 24 hours later, Ontario premier Doug Ford said he was suspending the ads after talking to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about the spiraling row with Washington.
“In speaking with Prime Minister Carney, Ontario will pause its US advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume,” Ford said in a post on X.
 






‘Crooked ad’
The Canadian ad used quotes from a radio address on trade that Reagan delivered in 1987, in which he warned against ramifications that he said high tariffs on foreign imports could have on the US economy.
It cited Reagan as saying that “high tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,” a quote that matches a transcript of his speech on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library’s website.
The Ronald Reagan foundation wrote on X on Thursday that the Ontario government had used “selective audio and video” and that it was reviewing its legal options.
 






Trump said on Friday night that it was a “crooked ad”, adding that “they know Ronald Reagan loved tariffs”.
Trump and Carney are both set to be at a dinner on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in South Korea on Wednesday.
But Trump said he had no plans to meet Carney.
The latest twist in relations between the United States and Canada came just over two weeks after Carney visited Trump at the White House to seek a relaxation of stiff US tariffs.
On Friday, Carney had sought to calm the situation, saying that his country was ready to resume “progress” on trade talks “when the Americans are ready”.
Canada has “to focus on what we can control, and realize what we cannot control,” he added as he headed to Asia.
Trump’s global sectoral tariffs — particularly on steel, aluminum, and autos — have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and squeezing businesses.
For now, the United States and Canada adhere to an existing North American trade deal called the USMCA, which ensures that roughly 85 per cent of cross-border trade in both directions remains tariff-free.
But in a speech on Wednesday, Carney said that the United States has raised “its tariffs to levels last seen during the Great Depression”.
“Our economic strategy needs to change dramatically,” Carney added, saying the process “will take some sacrifices and some time.”</p><small>2025-10-25 06:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/251056566dd34dd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951148/thailands-former-queen-sirikit-dead-at-93-palace' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand’s former queen Sirikit dead at 93: palace</strong></a><br><p>Thailand’s former Queen Sirikit, the mother of the current King Vajiralongkorn and wife of the nation’s longest-reigning monarch, died late on Friday at the age of 93, the palace said.
The royal family is venerated in Thailand, treated by many as semi-divine figures and lavished with glowing media coverage and gold-adorned portraits hanging in public spaces and private homes nationwide.
Throughout her 66-year marriage to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Sirikit carved a dual reputation as a fashionista and the nation’s caring matriarch — with some Western media featuring her on magazine covers and comparing her to former US first lady Jackie Kennedy.
“I had heard that she had been unwell and, given that she was in her 90s, I knew this day would come,” 53-year-old housekeeper Sasis Putthasit said early on Saturday in the capital Bangkok.
“But I didn’t expect it to be today,” Sasis told AFP.
“I feel sad because she was a mother figure to the country, and now she’s gone.”
Sirikit had “suffered several illnesses” while hospitalised since 2019, including a blood infection this month, the palace said in a statement.
“Her majesty’s condition worsened until Friday and she passed away … at Chulalongkorn hospital at age 93,” it added.
King Vajiralongkorn has assigned members of the royal family to begin a year-long mourning period, the palace said.
From early on Saturday, Thai news anchors were seen wearing black during the morning broadcast, a sign of public mourning.
Her passing “marks a profoundly significant event for the Thai Royal Family and the entire nation, given her immense popularity and deep connection to the late king who remains deeply revered”, Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a former Thai diplomat and academic who studies the monarchy, told AFP.
Pakistan offers condolences
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari expressed “deep sorrow” at the former queen’s passing and conveyed his condolences to King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the royal family, and the people of Thailand.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened at Sirikit’s passing.
“The people and government of Pakistan join me in extending our deepest condolences to His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the royal family, and the people of Thailand. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time of national grief,” he said.
 






‘Mother of the Nation’
King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s remarkably lengthy reign from 1946 until 2016 was bookended by World War II and the first inauguration of US President Donald Trump.
Though Bhumibol’s son inherited the throne about nine years ago, many still revere him as the nation’s most steadfast figurehead — and Sirikit as his constant companion.
She retired from the public eye in recent years as she suffered from ailing health, her privacy sealed by strict lese majeste laws that limit what can be reported about the royal family.
But in her glamorous heyday in the 1960s she mingled with US presidents and superstars such as Elvis Presley, while at home touring Thailand to visit villagers in rural areas.
She was referred to as the “Mother of the Nation” and her birthday was designated the country’s Mothers’ Day.
The reigning Chakri dynasty dates back to 1782 but the succession from King Vajiralongkorn is unclear as he has not formally named an heir.
He has seven children including five sons — four from an earlier marriage who have been officially disowned, and his 20-year-old son Dipangkorn Rasmijoti.
While the royal family is still held in very high regard by most Thais, it faced unprecedented public dissent during street protests in 2020.
Tens of thousands of young protesters took to the streets demanding widespread political reforms including changes to the monarchy — a public challenge to the royals’ status never seen in Thailand before.
Though Thailand’s constitution places the monarchy above politics, Sirikit drew public attention when she attended the funeral of a royalist protester in 2008.
When her husband King Bhumibol died, Thailand observed a year-long mourning period.
Authorities ordered flags to fly at half-mast for 30 days, banned weddings and concerts, and instructed citizens to wear black.
Former Queen Sirikit’s body will lie in state at the Grand Palace’s Dusit Thorne Hall in the capital Bangkok, according to the palace.</p><small>2025-10-25 05:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2510274717ed5dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951017/lahorites-breathe-most-polluted-air-in-world' target='_blank'><strong>Lahorites breathe most polluted air in world</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Lahore was declared the world’s most polluted city on Friday as a hazardous blanket of smog enveloped the metropolis, prompting authorities to issue a severe public health warning.
The crisis was quantified by alarming data, with the city’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching a “hazardous” level of 362.
The situation was even worse in specific neighbourhoods, with the Shalimar area recording a staggering AQI of 690, followed by Shadman at 611 and Syed Maratib Ali Road at 609.
 
 

Other areas, including Iqbal Town, Lower Mall, and the Civil Secretariat also registered levels falling in the “emergency range”, posing serious health risks to the residents.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department has forecast no immediate respite, warning that a thick layer of smog is likely to persist over eastern Punjab, with a further increase expected in the coming days.

Met Office sees no immediate respite

The department explicitly identified industrial pollution and vehicle emissions as the primary drivers of smog and highlighted that children, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions are at the highest risk of respiratory illnesses.
In response to the escalating crisis, Punjab’s Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb says the government is following a comprehensive strategy to combat the environmental emergency.
Smog could severely disrupt daily life and businesses, she warned.
 






“For the first time in Punjab’s history, a ban has been imposed on the use of plastic bags,” Ms Aurangzeb says.
The minister stresses the need for the people’s cooperation in combating smog, stating, “Air pollution cannot be controlled without public cooperation.”
 
 

She says that brick kilns across the province are being shifted to cleaner zig-zag technology, a dedicated “Smog War Room” has been established for Punjab, and a helpline set up for the public to report environmental violations.
Furthermore, she says that the government has launched a public awareness campaign for a clean environment and it is the collective responsibility of the people to eliminate the causes of smog and keep the atmosphere clean.
Health experts appealed to residents of Lahore to take all necessary precautions such as wearing masks and limiting outdoor exposure as the city continues to grapple with the suffocating haze.
Published in Dawn, October 25th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-25 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/25093858d71db1e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951056/committee-formed-to-probe-asps-mysterious-death' target='_blank'><strong>Committee formed to probe ASP’s mysterious death</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A three-member committee has been constituted to probe the death of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Adeel Akbar, who died from a bullet wound under unexplained circumstances in Islamabad.
A police spokesman told Dawn that the committee comprises deputy inspectors general (DIGs) of police and is headed by director general of Islamabad Safe City Authority, DIG Headquarters Haroon Joya. Other members include DIG Operations Jawad Tariq and DIG Security Atiq Tahir.
The committee was formed under the directions of the inspector general of police (IGP) Islamabad, with instructions to submit its report within 48 hours. It has been tasked to determine the facts surrounding the death of ASP Akbar, who was serving as Superintendent of Police (SP) Industrial Area Zone and to establish whether it was an accident, suicide, or murder, as well as to identify the possible causes and motives.
Police officers, speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity, said the committee will also summon a doctor for questioning regarding his social media and press statements claiming that the ASP had visited him at Pims and his private clinic and had shared personal information.

Three-member panel given 48 hours to submit report; sources say police not ruling out accident, suicide, or foul play

According to the officers, Mr Akbar was on his way to the Establishment Division and had spoken to an officer he was scheduled to meet.
 
 

However, the officer informed him that he was not in the office, after which Mr Akbar asked his driver to take a U-turn near the Foreign Office.
Meanwhile, the late officer’s operator informed him that an officer from the Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) wanted to speak with him and sent him a message. Mr Akbar last spoke with the PAS officer regarding a professional matter and said he would ask the station house officer about it.
The officers said the late officer had recently been transferred to Islamabad from Balochistan and had expressed security concerns. A week ago, he had received a new official vehicle and had its windows fully tinted.
He had also inquired about the official weapon issued to his staff, citing security concerns. His operator informed him that he had an SMG (submachine gun), which Mr Akbar asked to see.
The operator removed the magazine and checked the chamber before handing it to him. Akbar then asked about the magazine and the number of bullets. The operator replied that he had 50 bullets and handed him the magazine on his request.
A short while later, as the vehicle reached Jinnah Square near the Serena Hotel underpass, the driver and operator heard a gunshot. They found Akbar slumped in his seat with a bullet wound to his forehead.
The operator immediately informed police communications, stating that “SP City took the weapon from us and shot himself near Serena.”
A team from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency later visited the scene, examined the vehicle and weapon, and collected samples. His mobile phone was recovered from the vehicle and has been taken into custody to be handed over to the FIA for forensic examination.
Mr Akbar had recently been shortlisted for a Fulbright Scholarship and had received the official letter on October 6. He was scheduled to appear for the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) on Friday (October 24).
The officer’s driver and operator have been taken into protective custody and are being kept at a police building in I-9.
 






The incident has not yet been registered in any police record, including the daily diary. Further legal action will be taken in light of the committee’s inquiry report.
According to police officers, the incident appears to be accidental, as Akbar was supposed to meet an officer regarding his promotion shortly before his death. He was reportedly anxious about his promotion but was also actively pursuing the Fulbright scholarship, had scheduled his TOEFL test, and had sent his academic degrees for verification, indicating that he was focused on his career and personal growth, with no apparent signs of suicidal intent.
He had also spoken normally to a PAS officer just minutes before the incident. When the gunman handed him the SMG, Akbar had followed normal safety procedures to ensure there was no bullet in the chamber, the sources said. “There is a possibility that while inserting the magazine and holding the weapon upright, it accidentally discharged,” they said.
The angle of the gunshot was measured at 65 degrees between the eyebrows. Experts noted that it is extremely difficult to commit suicide with an SMG, as individuals typically place such weapons under the chin.
The officers said that while the evidence suggests an accidental discharge, other possibilities cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the investigation remains open, they added.

The regulations, introduced through BPRD Circular No.1 of 2025, had mandated streamlining of account opening and customer onboarding processes by all institutions under the SBP’s regulatory ambit, including Banks, DFIs, MFBs, Digital Banks, and EMIs. As per the circular, issued on July 25, all SBP-regulated entities (REs) need to “streamline the account opening/customer onboarding process and improve the customer experience”.
One of the new requirements introduced was that biometric verification of the account or wallet operator should be made the primary verification method for all accounts and digital wallets. The prevailing system had allowed operators to take up to 60 days to complete biometric verification before a debit block was imposed on their account.
With the new regulations going into effect starting October 25, industry sources expressed fears that potentially tens of millions of account-holders who have not completed biometric verification could lose the ability to operate them. They also expressed concerns that the regulations may prevent individuals operating foreign currency accounts from sending or receiving remittances.
Financial institutions were given three months to comply with the requirements, which are part of customer due diligence and onboarding-related requirements under the SBP’s Anti Money Laundering/Countering Financing of Terrorism/Counter Proliferation Financing Regulations.
The scope and applicability of the SBP’s regulations pertaining to digital accounts and wallets had been expanded in the ‘Consolidated Customer Onboarding Framework’ introduced in July, and the change now “covers both in-branch and remote onboarding, and is applicable for opening accounts/wallets for Individuals and Entities (legal persons/arrangements), including Local Currency and Foreign Currency accounts, and explicitly mentioning Roshan Digital Accounts” and applies to all “SBP Regulated Entities (REs), including Banks, DFIs, MFBs, Digital Banks, and EMIs”.
The new framework also requires a “consolidated approach”, regardless of whether the onboarding process was performed in-branch or remotely. In the earlier framework, released in 2022, use of NADRA Verisys was allowed for verification at the time of account opening, while biometric verification was to be completed within 60 days.
However, under the 2025 framework, biometric verification will be the primary method for “customers with CNIC/NICOP/POC/ARC/POR cards prior to establishment of the relationship/opening of the account/wallet”.</p><small>2025-10-25 04:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630391-house-help-living-a-millionaires-life-arrested-in-karachi-for-theft' target='_blank'><strong>House help living 'a millionaire's life' arrested in Karachi for theft</strong></a><br><p>

The incident marks the second kidnapping of labourers in the region in four days. The first incident took place three days earlier, although it was only made public by the officials yesterday.
Levies officials said over two dozen armed men stormed the camp and crushing plant of a private construction company late on Thursday in the Naal area, about 80 km from the district headquarters of Khuzdar.
“They set at least eight vehicles and other machinery on fire and took away workers with them [to an] unknown destination,” a senior Levies force official in Naal said.

Assailants also set ablaze many vehicles; incident comes days after gunmen abducted nine labourers in Mastung

The company manager, Zulfiqar Ahmed, said the attackers initially took 20 people.
 
 

“The armed men kidnapped 20 labourers from the camp but two of them were freed later on their way to an unknown destination,” Mr Ahmed said. He confirmed that the abducted workers belong to the Sindh.
The labourers were working on a road project for the D. Baluch construction company, which is building roads to connect Naal with the areas of Washuk and Basima. Officials said that at least eight vehicles were completely gutted and other machinery was damaged in the attack.
Security forces have launched a search operation in the area to find the kidnapped workers and the armed group responsible.
In the previous attack, unidentified gunmen kidnapped nine labourers as they were returning home from their work on an under-construction building site. The assailants also hijacked the pickup truck in which the workers were travelling, all at gunpoint in the Dasht area of Mastung district.
No one has claimed responsibility for either of the recent kidnapping incidents.

The opposition Congress party blamed the change of plan on Mr Modi’s fear of meeting President Donald Trump. The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation grouping, as well as associated meetings, will be held from Oct 26 to 28 in Kuala Lumpur.
The Hindu said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had not provided any reason for Mr Modi’s decision, though the paper quoted Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as saying that Mr Modi had cited the “ongoing Deepavali celebrations” as the reason for the change in plans.
The MEA announced that External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will represent Mr Modi and lead the Indian delegation at the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur on October 27. Asean is a key pillar of India’s Act East Policy and Asia-Pacific vision, the ministry said.
 



Congress says Indian PM’s change of plans betrays his reluctance to meet Trump

The Congress claimed that Mr Modi was attending the summit virtually instead of travelling to Malaysia to avoid “being cornered” by Mr Trump.
Taking to social media platform X, Congress communication chief Jairam Ramesh said it was “one thing to post messages in praise of President Trump, but far too risky to be physically seen with the man who has claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia”.
“The reason why Mr Modi is not going is simple. He just doesn’t want to be cornered by President Trump who will also be there. He refused an invitation to attend the Gaza peace summit in Egypt a few weeks back, precisely for this reason,” Mr Ramesh said.
“It’s far too risky for him. The PM may well be recalling that old hit Bollywood number: “Bachke rehna re baba, bachke rehna re,” he added.
 


In a separate post on X, Mr Ramesh reacted to a news report quoting a Reliance Industries spokesperson who said the company would recalibrate its import of Russian oil to align with the priorities of the Indian government. “Modi Proposes, Reliance Disp­oses, Trump Exposes,” he said.
 






“Had a warm conversation with my dear friend, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia. Congratulated him on Malaysia’s Asean Chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits. Look forward to joining the Asean-India Summit virtually, and to further deepening the Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Mr Modi in a statement.
 






In a statement posted on social media platform ‘X’, Mr Ibrahim said he discussed details of the 47th Asean summit with Mr Modi.
“He [Prime Minister Modi] informed me that he will attend virtually due to the ongoing Deepavali celebrations in India at that time. I respect his decision and extended my greetings for a happy Deepavali to him and the entire people of India.”
The East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur will draw a host of dignitaries, including President Trump. It was expected that the venue would provide a meeting opportunity for Mr Modi and Mr Trump, especially as the India-US relations remain uneasy after Mr Trump imposed punitive tariffs on India because of India’s purchase of Russian crude oil.
The Hindu said Mr Trump and Mr Modi exchanged greetings on Deepavali on Tuesday as India-US negotiations for a trade pact continue. The two sides, however, gave differing takes on the conversation.
It said President Trump was telling a group of prominent Indian-Americans and Indian Embassy officials in the White House that the telephone call focused on a trade deal, the purchase of Russian oil and “no war with Pakistan” and the Indian sources maintained that Pakistan was not discussed during the call.
Officials had earlier given mixed signals about Mr Modi’s travel plans for Kuala Lumpur, saying that the Bihar election campaign required the PM’s attention. Earlier, President Trump had invited Mr Modi to the Sharm el-Sheikh peace summit for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, but India was represented at the event by Kirti Vardhan Singh, Minister of State for External Affairs.

• Lawmakers demand parity in police salaries with other provinces
• CM Bugti proposes committee to review legislators’ pay and perks
QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Friday adopted two resolutions, calling for the inclusion of the province’s major development projects in the second pha­se of the China-Pakistan Eco­no­mic Corridor (CPEC) and for the upgradation of Margha Kabzai to the status of a sub-division.
The house also discussed making the salary structure of Balochistan Police equivalent to that of other provinces. In addition, a proposal was referred for review to the Finance Committee regarding an increase in the salaries of assembly members.
Soon after the session started, which was presided over by Spe­aker Captain (R) Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, the Emir Jamaat-i-Is­l­ami Balochistan, Maulana Hid­a­yatur Rehman, through a call-attention notice, drew attention to the disparity in salaries of Ba­­lochistan Police personnel compared to other provinces.
He said the police had rendered countless sacrifices for maintaining peace in the province, yet their salaries remained significantly lower than those of other provincial forces, leading to frustration among the ranks.
 
 

Responding to the notice, Provincial Minister Mir Shoaib Nosherwani acknowledged the issue and assured the House that the government would take necessary steps to bring police salaries on par with other provinces.
Later, Dr. Muhammad Nawaz Kabzai of JUI-F presented a resolution urging the government to grant tehsil status to Margha Kabzai, a backward area with a population of around 110,000 comprising the Babbar, Sherani, Khosti, and Kabzai tribes.
He said that despite its geographical importance, Margha Kabzai had long been neglected, and residents were forced to live without essential services. The resolution called for immediate administrative action to declare the area a sub-division. After a brief discussion, the House unanimously approved the resolution.
In another significant move, Maulana Hidayatur Rehman presented a resolution demanding that Balochistan be included in CPEC Phase-II projects. He said that while billions of dollars have already been spent under the CPEC framework, the people of Balochistan had not reaped any tangible benefits.
He criticised the federal government for excluding the province from the ongoing CPEC Phase-II initiatives. “We do not seek charity in the name of fuel savings. We are proud Baloch and Pashtuns who only demand our fair share in CPEC,” he said.
Supporting the resolution, BNP-Awami MPA Mir Asadullah Baloch stated that had CPEC been implemented properly, the province would not be facing security challenges today.
 
 

During the session, National Party MPA Kulsoom Niaz Baloch raised a point of order suggesting a review of lawmakers’ salaries and perks. Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai responded that after Punjab, the Balochistan Assem­bly members already receive the highest salaries in the country.
JUI-F’s Shahida Rauf raised concerns over the recent abduction of 18 labourers in Khuzdar, pointing out that 27 workers had been kidnapped in Balochistan within a week.
Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, while addressing the House, proposed that lawmakers’ salaries should be reviewed and brought in line with those of Punjab Assembly members. He suggested forming a committee to examine the matter, which the speaker accepted, directing that the issue be referred to the Finance Committee for detailed consideration.

In his dissenting note on the court’s judgement issued in a case pertaining to the killing of Mohammad Hayat Mirza, a Karachi University student, in Turbat, Justice Minallah said that there can be “no tolerance” for such acts and conduct by law enforcement agencies and their members.
In 2020, police arrested a soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), Shadiullah, on charges of killing Mirza and started an investigation after registering a case against him. The case was registered against the suspect on the complaint of Mohammad Murad Baloch, the brother of the deceased.
The convicted had appealed to the SC following his sentencing by a trial court. The trial court, in a judgment on January 20, 2021, convicted the appellant under Section 302(b) (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code and he was sentenced to death.
 
 

However, the SC issued its 2-1 majority verdict on Shadiullah’s plea on September 17, 2025, a written order for which was issued yesterday. According to the verdict, the death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.
The ruling was issued by a three-member bench comprising Justices Athar Minallah, Irfan Saadat Khan, and Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, among whom Justice Minallah dissented.
“In a society where grievances relating to enforced disappearances, use of excessive force, abuse of power, extra-judicial killings and violation of fundamental rights by law enforcement agencies are widespread, impunity in case of crimes committed against the citizens becomes the most aggravated form of transgression of law,” Justice Minallah stated.
“The gravity intensifies when a citizen falls victim to aggression by a law enforcement agency or its officers and members,” he said. “Any such act or conduct is intolerable in a society governed under the Constitution.”
Justice Minallah said that the rule of law is “eroded” when law enforcers take the law into their own hands and “arrogate to themselves the role of a judge
and an executor”, adding that the appellant had abused his position of
authority and trust.
“The officers and members are provided weapons and ammunition
for the exclusive use to protect the people and to serve them in their best
interest,” he said in his note.
“As a uniformed disciplined force, each officer and member of the FC Balochistan is presumed to be highly trained and that each would demonstrably display high standards of professionalism and exemplary conduct at all times while dealing with the civilian population for whose
benefit they have been entrusted with onerous duties and obligations,” he stated.
Deterrent punishment, he said, is not only to maintain a balance between the gravity of wrong done by a person but “also to make the offender an example for others as a preventive measure for reformation of the society”.
“In the case of heinous crimes committed with premeditation and in a gruesome manner, no leniency ought to be shown to the culprits,” Justice Minallah said.</p><small>2025-10-25 03:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68fc033543d43.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951132/a-us-pakistan-opportunity' target='_blank'><strong>A US-Pakistan opportunity</strong></a><br><p>AS someone who’s lived and worked between Pakistan and the United States, I’ve seen this relationship rise with hope and fade with frustration. Still, I’ve never stopped believing in its potential. So when Pakistan dispatched its first-ever shipment of rare earth and critical minerals to the US recently, it felt like more than a transaction — it felt like a meaningful signal.
According to international reports, the shipment — containing copper concentrate, antimony, and rare earth elements — was sent under a $500 million investment deal between US Strategic Metals and Pakistan’s Frontier Works Organisation. It wasn’t just a commercial exchange; it showed that the two countries can still build something lasting through cooperation and mutual trust.
The world is going through a massive energy and technology shift. From electric cars to renewable grids, the modern economy now depends on minerals most people never think about. The International Energy Agency projects that global demand for these materials will triple by 2030, with certain battery minerals increasing thirtyfold by 2040.
 
 

Meanwhile, the overconcentration of mineral processing in a few countries has become a shared vulnerability. Diversifying supply chains isn’t just smart economics anymore — it’s a matter of trust and long-term security. Pakistan, sitting on vast and largely untapped reserves, could play a real part in reshaping that global balance.
For decades, Pakistan’s mineral wealth has been a story of promise without delivery. Estimates suggest the country’s reserves exceed $6 trillion in value. From Reko Diq’s copper and gold to newly confirmed rare earth and gold deposits in Gilgit-Baltistan, the potential has always been there — it’s the follow-through that’s been missing.
The modern economy depends on minerals most people never think about.
And yet, this isn’t just a story about rocks or maps. It’s about people — a young and ambitious nation of 240 million, and a government that seems more open than ever to responsible investment. The growing interest from US policymakers and investors shows that Pakistan might finally be ready to join the global minerals value chain in a serious way.
If this partnership’s going to succeed, it must avoid repeating the extractive models of the past. What Pakistan and the US need now is a framework built on sustainability, inclusion, and shared prosperity — one that ensures value is created within Pakistan, not merely extracted from it.
That vision can be achieved through five guiding principles. The first is joint exploration and mapping, combining US technical expertise with Pakistan’s on-ground knowledge to responsibly assess and manage resources. The second is environmental stewardship — holding all partners to international standards to safeguard fragile ecosystems, water sources, and local livelihoods.
The third pillar is infrastructure investment, not only in mining zones but also in the surrounding regions, so that roads, ports, and energy systems lift the broader economy rather than serving isolated projects. Equally important is community inclusion, ensuring that local residents benefit directly through employment, training, and equitable revenue sharing. Finally, the long-term goal must be in-country processing — building refining and beneficiation capacity within Pakistan so that the nation moves from exporter of raw materials to creator of value.
 
 

This approach would allow both countries to prove that resource partnerships can be transparent, fair, and mutually beneficial — a model for how economic cooperation can strengthen trust rather than dependency.
Beyond corporate responsibility, the government has an equally important role in making sure this opportunity turns into long-term progress. Islamabad should consider applying to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a global framework that promotes open reporting of mining contracts and revenues. That step alone would boost investor confidence and signal a clear commitment to clean governance.
Equally important is setting up transparent revenue management mechanisms, ensuring that mineral proceeds flow through audited public channels and support social and economic development priorities aligned with Pakistan’s fiscal responsibilities under its IMF programme. Finally, the inclusion of community development clauses within all mineral contracts should be made binding, guaranteeing that local populations share directly in the prosperity generated from their land.
By adopting these reforms, Pakistan can make sure its mineral wealth becomes a national asset rather than a temporary windfall — a base for sustainable, responsible growth.
Handled right, a US-Pakistan minerals partnership could go far beyond supply chains. It could strengthen regional stability, create thousands of jobs, and offer Pakistan a genuine path to sustainable growth. More importantly, it could show that resource partnerships can be transparent, ethical, and fair — a model for how developing economies can negotiate on equal footing.
For the US, Pakistan represents a credible partner in securing critical minerals. For Pakistan, it’s a chance to unlock economic potential while protecting sovereignty and community rights. Both countries now have the opportunity to move past old habits and co-write a new story — one rooted in mutual respect, shared prosperity, and forward-looking growth.

Published in Dawn, October 25th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-25 03:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68fc02a6bc87e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951131/reshaping-economic-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Reshaping economic ties</strong></a><br><p>TWO developments augur well for reshaping Pakistan’s economic relationship with the world. First, the dismantling of USAID closes a long and painful chapter of dependence and misplaced expectations between Pakistan and America. Even if Washington attempts to revive a similar programme, Pakistan should avoid bilateral aid and its political strings. Second, the finance minister’s declaration that Pakistan will not seek international aid for the 2025 floods is a turning point. Together, these two decisions can lay the foundation for a new model of economic engagement — bilateral, regional, and multilateral — based on dignity, self-reliance and mutual respect. Meanwhile, it’s assumed the recent Pak-Afghan agreement in Doha will minimise security risks to the economy.
This shift comes at a time when Pakistan’s global image has improved after the May 2025 conflict with India. Ties with China, Türkiye and Azerbaijan remain close, and new diplomatic openings have emerged. President Donald Trump’s warmth towards Pakistan, the prime minister’s inclusion in the ranks of Muslim leaders formulating the Gaza Plan, and development and defence initiatives with Saudi Arabia have enhanced our stature. How can Pakistan build its future economic relations on the foundation recently laid? Should this moment be seen yet again as a transient geopolitical opportunity to extract rents and sustain the economy through windfalls? Will we continue dispatching PMs and army chiefs abroad to solicit deposits from ‘friendly’ states, to bolster our reserves or avert default? Are we condemned to sacrifice economic sovereignty through repeated IMF programmes that offer temporary stability but leave the economy without job-creating growth?
 
 

The current convergence of favourable external circumstances provides a rare window to chart a new course. A benign geopolitical environment, coupled with renewed international respect, should compel us to rethink our economic strategy decisively, abandoning forever the path of dependence, rent-extraction and perpetual crisis manage­ment. The goal of Pakistan’s external economic engagement should be the creation of a coherent and durable framework that frees the country from dependence on IMF programmes and annual rollovers from Saudi Arabia, China and the UAE. The new framework must prioritise the generation of non-debt-creating foreign exchange and mobilisation of domestic resources by raising the gross domestic savings rate and attaining debt sustainability, with remaining financing needs met through international capital markets.
A sustainable external position begins with a competitive export sector. Immediate reforms should focus on easing constraints on exports and industrial growth through a transparent, predictable export facilitation scheme, rationalisation of excessive taxation, restoration of export financing and realistic energy pricing — steps that must be implemented consistently and in genuine consultation with exporters. Frequent reversal of policies and bureaucratic unpredictability have undermined business confidence.
The second pillar is attracting FDI from countries with abundant capital and a strategic interest in Pakistan — China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, whose sovereign wealth funds seek higher global returns. Pakistan can position itself as a promising destination if it ensures i) security of investors, their personnel, and property; ii) non-interference by government agencies; and iii) freedom to repatriate profits, dividends and interest payments. During the early 2000s, FDI peaked at $5 billion to $6bn under an investment-friendly regime, underscoring what can be achieved through coherent policy and investor confidence. However, FDI must be export-oriented, medium-technology-intensive and employment-generating. Domestic investors should also be treated with parity and respect.
 
 

Third, demographic trends in advanced economies — especially Japan, South Korea, Germany, and Western Europe — offer significant opportunities. Aging populations and labour shortages are driving these countries to gradually open their markets to skilled foreign workers, despite populist opposition. Pakistan should negotiate country-specific manpower export agreements aligned with each nation’s demographic and skill needs. It must identify the required technical, linguistic and social skills, and create targeted training programmes at home. Vocational institutes should work closely with host-country employers to ensure certification and employability. Managed migration of skilled workers can relieve domestic unemployment pressures and create sustained foreign exchange inflows through remittances.

We have an unprecedented opportunity to redefine our external economic relationships.

Fourth, Pakistan should actively seek scholarships from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germ­any and China for advanced studies in STEM disciplines. In return, it should bring foreign faculty to universities here to assist in curriculum design, modern pedagogy, assessment reform industry linkages and commercialisation of research. Universities must be freed from excessive bureaucratic control and granted autonomy with accountability within a reformed governance structure to become globally competitive.
Fifth, partnerships with China, Türkiye and Azerbaijan offer a promising frontier — transferring dual-use technologies from the defence sector to civilian industries. Our defence institutions and research organisations have significant technical expertise to be applied in manufacturing, electronics, precision engineering and materials science. Private sector participation should be encouraged.
Sixth, Pakistan’s links with multilateral institutions must evolve. The World Bank’s 10-Year Partnership Strategy for Pakistan has shifted its focus towards project lending in education, health, nutrition, water, technology, and infrastructure — true engines of long-term growth. This approach should replace past reliance on budgetary and balance-of-payments support, which fostered complacency and discouraged domestic resource mobilisation. Other multilateral partners must be encouraged to align their programmes with this development-oriented model. International cooperation must serve as a catalyst for capacity building, not a crutch for short-term financing. If applied with discipline, these measures can provide instruments for reshaping our economic ties based on productivity, partnership and self-reliance. The following framework illustrates potential areas of cooperation:
The US: Investment and joint ventures in mid- and high-technology industries; venture capital and private equity for startups; scholarships and faculty exchange. China, Türkiye, Azerbaijan: application of defence technologies to civilian industries; accelerated implementation of CPEC II. Japan, Korea, Germany: country-specific manpower export agreements. Saudi Arabia and GCC: sovereign wealth fund investment in projects such as Petrochemical complex and infrastructure.
The closure of the aid-dependent chapter and a more favourable geopolitical climate present an unprecedented opportunity to redefine our external economic relations. The path forward lies in building competitiveness, attracting investment and leveraging innovation to transition from a crisis-prone, aid-dependent state to a self-confident, productive economy integrated with the global system on an equal footing.

The case, which centred on alleged vote buying at its 2023 leadership primary, is one of a growing number of prosecutions targeting the Republican People’s Party (CHP) that critics say are politically motivated.
The lawsuit sought to overturn the result of the primary that elected Ozgur Ozel and could have ousted him as party leader.
It was thrown out by the court on the grounds that one of the complainants was ineligible to file the lawsuit and that the basis for the case had become moot since the CHP had since held a fresh vote, re-electing its leadership.
 
 

The verdict triggered applause from spectators, among them a Ummu Gulsun Seyfi, 75, a party stalwart since 1977, who accused the government of political meddling “instead of dealing with people’s problems”.
Onur Yusuf Uregen, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the result was a “surprise” and vowed to appeal.
Although the full decision has not been released, CHP lawyer Ali Yigit Koca told AFP that the judge understood that subsequent party leadership elections meant there was no basis for the case.
“The fact the CHP held an extraordinary congress in April must have convinced the judge to declare the procedure moot,” he said. The CHP held another leadership congress in September.
Ozel, who was reelected at both meetings, hailed the decision. “On one side, there is the government targeting democracy and seeking to eliminate the ballot box, on the other, the democrats who fight against it,” he said at CHP’s headquarters.

“This meeting of mine had been planned quite a while ago, and the American side did not cancel it, despite a number of recent unfriendly steps. We will continue the dialogue,” Dmitriev said.
US President Donald Trump hit Russia’s two biggest oil companies with sanctions this week to press the Kremlin leader to end Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
Trump spoke to Putin last week and said he planned to meet Putin soon, but Trump later cancelled that summit, saying it could take place another time.
“The Russia-US dialogue will continue, but it is certainly only possible if Russia’s interests are taken into account and treated with respect,” Dmitriev said.
 


He declined to say who he was meeting and predicted that the US oil sanctions would backfire.
“They will only lead to gasoline costing more at American gas stations,” said Dmitriev.
Citing sources with knowledge of the visit, CNN reported earlier on Friday that Dmitriev was expected to meet Trump administration officials  “to continue discussions about the US-Russia relationship”.
 
 

Axios reported that Dmitriev would meet Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff in Miami on Saturday. The state TASS news agency quoted Dmitriev as saying he would also meet other people he did not name.
Dmitriev, who has developed a good working relationship with Witkoff, declined to say whether arrangements for a new Trump-Putin meeting would be on the agenda of his talks.

• Sugarcane output estimated at 84.7m tonnes, rice at 9.4m tonnes
ISLAMABAD: The federal government has set a wheat production target of around 30 million tonnes for the Rabi season 2025-26, banking on adequate water availability in Punjab and Sindh — the two main wheat-producing provinces.
The wheat production target for the Rabi season 2024-25 was set at 27.92m tonnes, but the government exceeded it by achieving 28.42m tonnes.
The target for 2025-26 was approved at a meeting of the Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA), which also finalised the wheat policy to ensure farmers receive fair support prices, enabling them to cover production costs and earn reasonable profit margins, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of National Food Security and Research on Friday.
In light of recent floods, the FCA recommended launching a campaign for early wheat sowing, ensuring the availability of quality certified seed of improved varieties through a track-and-trace system, timely and affordable fertiliser supply, and the proper use of herbicides. It also called for wider dissemination of production technology through electronic and print media, greater access to agricultural credit, and bringing cultivable and barren wastelands under wheat cultivation through corporate farming.
 
 

Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain, who presided over the FCA meeting, said the policy reflects the government’s commitment to safeguarding farmers’ interests and achieving self-sufficiency in staple food commodities.
Production targets for other Rabi crops were fixed at 393,000 tonnes for gram, 8.916 million tonnes for potato, 2.788m tonnes for onion, and 659,000 tonnes for tomato. The committee also reviewed seed availability for Rabi crops.
The director general of the Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department informed the meeting that the availability of certified seed for Rabi 2025-26 will remain satisfactory.
Regarding water availability, the Irsa Advisory Committee anticipated no shortage of water for Punjab and Sindh during Rabi 2025-26, allocating 33.814m acre-feet (MAF) of water to the provinces.
 
 

The Meteorological Department informed the meeting that below-normal precipitation is expected in most parts of the country during November and December, while near-normal rainfall is likely in January 2026.
The committee emphasised the use of new wheat seed varieties for improved production, suggesting the sowing of drought-tolerant and rust-resistant varieties, and the development of high-yielding, heat-tolerant varieties in response to climate change. It also called for strengthening provincial seed production systems and building farmers’ capacity to produce and maintain pure seed varieties.
The FCA highlighted the need to prevent curtailment of agricultural land to ensure maximum cultivation area and urged the use of innovative technologies, such as those developed by Suparco and the Land Information and Manag­ement System, for production forecasting and better planning. The committee also stressed the adoption of climate-smart agriculture techniques.
The meeting was informed that sugarcane production for 2025-26 is provisionally estimated at 84.7m tonnes from an area of 1.146m hectares, showing an increase of 5.5 per cent in area and 5.9pc in production over FCA targets.
Rice production for 2025-26 is estimated at 9.417m tonnes from an area of 3.039m hectares, indicating an increase of 21.9pc in area and 2.7pc in production compared to targets. Mungbean production is estimated at 150,800 tons. The availability of certified wheat seed for Rabi 2025-26 will meet 44pc of the total requirement.
 
 

In line with the government’s agenda to promote the agriculture sector, the minister appreciated the State Bank of Pakistan’s efforts to enhance agricultural credit flow. The SBP has set an indicative agricultural credit disbursement target of Rs2.572 trillion for fiscal year 2025 — 16.3 per cent higher than the preceding year’s Rs2.250tr.
Currently, 47 financial institutions are providing agricultural loans, including five major commercial banks, 13 medium-sized private banks, six Islamic banks, two specialised banks (ZTBL and PPCBL), 11 microfinance banks, and 10 microfinance institutions or rural support programmes.
During FY25, lending institutions disbursed Rs2.577tr, achieving 100.2pc of the annual target and recording 16.3pc growth compared to Rs2.215tr disbursed in the corresponding period last year. The committee was also informed that the supply of urea and DAP fertilisers is expected to remain stable during the upcoming Rabi season.
The minister reiterated the government’s resolve to ensure food security through coordinated federal and provincial efforts. He said farmers are the backbone of the country’s progress, and their prosperity remains a top government priority.
He also underscored the importance of timely policy implementation, impr­oved irrigation management, mechanisation, and greater investment in research and development to ensure sustainable agricultural growth.

• FO says truce largely holding since Doha
• Insists Islamabad entering this round with same ‘sincerity of purpose’
ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Friday hoped that the fresh round of talks with Afghanistan beginning today in Istanbul would lead to the formation of a mechanism to monitor Afghan Taliban actions aimed at preventing cross-border terrorist attacks.
“Pakistan looks forward to the establishment of a concrete and verifiable monitoring mechanism in the next meeting to be hosted by Turkiye in Istanbul on Oct 25, 2025, to address the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil towards Pakistan and prevent any further loss of life of Pakistanis,” the new Foreign Office spokesperson, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, said at his maiden weekly media briefing.
Saturday’s scheduled meeting in Istanbul follows the first round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks mediated jointly by Qatar and Turkiye in Doha on Oct 18-19. The Doha round resulted in a permanent ceasefire and a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for consolidating lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
“We welcome the agreement between Pakistan and Afghanistan, finalised in Doha, Qatar, on Oct 19, 2025, as a first step in ensuring regional peace and stability,” Mr Andrabi said.
 


The truce agreed in Doha has largely held, with no major terrorist attacks reported since, according to the Foreign Office.
“We are taking part in the second round of talks in Istanbul with the same sincerity of purpose, with the same sincerity of intent with which we participated in Doha,” the spokesman said.
Kabul also confirmed the meeting in Istanbul. Afghan interim administration spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said its delegation is led by Mawlawi Rahmatullah Najeeb, deputy minister at the Ministry of Interior, according to the Turkish news agency Anadolu.
“The remaining issues [with Pakistan] will be discussed in the meeting,” Mr Mujahid said in a post on X. The Afghan delegation had left Kabul for Istanbul, he added.
 


The Istanbul round offers an opportunity to move from temporary calm towards a structured, verifiable peace framework with mechanisms for monitoring, verification and sustained dialogue through technical committees.
Turkish officials have indicated that a technical committee in Istanbul will review details of the ceasefire, inc­l­uding terrorism, migration and border security.
In essence, Doha produced the political breakthrough, while Istanbul is expected to operationalise it by defining what constitutes cross-border terrorism, how violations will be verified and how disputes will be resolved.
Turkiye’s deep counterterrorism experience against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its familiarity with insurgent challenges along porous borders give Ankara both diplomatic credibility and practical insight into Pakistan’s difficulties with Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.
Its role is further strengthened by the longstanding Pakistan-Turkiye counterterrorism cooperation, including consultations held earlier this year.
 
 

For Pakistan, Turkiye represents a trusted partner capable of designing a mechanism that both sides can rely on, shifting the peace process from ad hoc diplomacy to institutionalised peace-building.
In Istanbul, Pakistan is expected to seek concrete and verifiable commitments from the Afghan side to eliminate the TTP threat from its territory.
The agenda includes dismantling known TTP sanctuaries, arresting or expelling key figures and defining clear timelines and benchmarks for measurable action such as raids, arrests and destruction of safe houses.
To ensure implementation, Islamabad plans to propose mechanisms for intelligence-sharing, cross-border coordination and real-time monitoring of militant movements and financing.
Pakistan also supports establishing a third-party oversight structure, potentially co-chaired by Turkiye and Qatar, to verify progress and address non-compliance.
Additional priorities will include securing Afghan assurances against providing safe havens to hostile groups, strengthening border control, ensuring financial transparency on militant funding and holding regular review meetings to assess compliance.
“During the Doha talks, the basic focus was to stop the terrorist attacks from Afghan soil into Pakistan.
And in order to do that, we should have a verifiable, empirical mechanism to ascertain that the Afghan Taliban regime in Kabul is taking concrete actions to stop such attacks,” the Foreign Office spokesman said.
He said the continuation of the ceasefire demonstrated the progress achieved in Doha.
“In effect, the Doha talks and outcomes were fruitful. We would like the trend to continue in Istanbul and post-Istanbul,” Mr Andrabi said.
The spokesman said that trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan would remain suspended for now.
“Afghan transit trade is closed … It is not taking place because of the factors that you were aware of. There was considerable discussion on this question during last week’s briefing as well. Till the evaluation of the security situation, this transit trade will remain closed,” he added.

Going by the government’s signals, a formal ban had seemed imminent after TLP cadres clashed with the state in a deadly showdown last week. The immediate trigger was the administration’s refusal to let the outfit march on Islamabad in supposed solidarity with Gaza. This would be the second time the religiously inspired party has been banned. The last proscription in 2021 lasted only a few months, but this time the state appears intent on sustaining the ban. However, one should keep in mind that extremist parties and groups have been banned earlier too, but have re-emerged under new monikers.
 
 

PML-N leader and adviser to the PM Rana Sanaullah has said that the state had no issue with the TLP’s religious views and the ban was not designed to ‘eliminate’ the party. Rather, it was supposed to purge “anti-state and terrorist elements”. Going by this logic, if the aim is to target individuals who break the law, why does the state ban parties and groups?
Moreover, in the past, how many heads of militant groups, sectarian outfits and extremist parties have been tried for their crimes? The state’s history of banning groups — from the Musharraf era to date — does not inspire confidence, as outfits are proscribed on paper, but cases against their leaders and active cadres are not diligently pursued. There is also the genuine fear that the powers that be may apply the labels of ‘terrorism’ and ‘extremism’ to ban political parties that have fallen afoul of the state.
 
 

In reality, the policy of banning groups is tragicomic. Nacta’s current list of proscribed organisations contains over 80 entries, with some going as far back as 2001. Most of the groups that populate this list ascribe to jihadi, sectarian or extremist ideologies, with a smattering of separatist and ethno-nationalist outfits. But the modus operandi of ‘banned’ groups is to restart work under new names after the ban. For example, Jamaatud Dawa, an incarnation of Lashkar-i-Taiba, has at least 10 aliases, most of which are banned. Moreover, sectarian outfit Sipah-i-Sahaba, which now operates under the ASWJ moniker, has worked under three different names, some banned, others not.
The point is that unless the leaders and members of extremist groups are prosecuted for their crimes — promoting terrorism, inciting violence, hate speech, etc — the state’s attempts to impose bans will not work. The state has banned TLP today, but until those associated with it who have broken the law are prosecuted, it may re-emerge tomorrow in an even more extreme form.

Officials denied reports that Islamabad had partially opened the border crossing at Chaman for Afghan transit trade. Even pedestrians are not allowed to cross the border from both sides, they added.
“The border has been closed for the last 12 days and not opened for any commercial activities so far, including transit trade,” a senior customs official told Dawn.
The official added that there were very few transit trade trucks parked at the Chaman crossing.
The district administration officials also said that they have not yet received any instructions from the authorities from Islamabad about the opening of the border.
 
 

The border opens for a very limited time for Afghan refugees, who were reaching Chaman from different areas of Balochistan and Karachi, to return to their home country.
Officials said only vehicles repatriating the household goods of Afghan refugees and returning to their country via the Chaman border were allowed to travel through the border.
However, traders hope that the situation would be relaxed after a meeting between officials from Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul today.
‘Customs staff ready’
Separately, the FBR announced that customs staffers are stationed at border points and ready to resume the clearance process as soon as it reopens and the situation returns to normal.
The announcement from the tax department follows the build-up of over 1,000 trucks loaded with transit cargo, export consignments, and imported goods at the border stations with Afghanistan.
The disruption stems from the suspension of customs clearance for both exports and imports at major border crossings — Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda — effective Oct 12, and at the Chaman border from Oct 15.
An official announcement of the FBR said that bilateral trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan is temporarily halted due to security concerns at the border customs stations
Before the suspension of bilateral trade took effect, customs officials successfully processed and cleared 363 import vehicles at Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda crossings, falling under the jurisdiction of Northern region of Appraisement.
At Torkham, clearance of 23 import vehicles remains pending due to the failure of importers to file goods declarations. The vehicles are carrying non-perishable items such as fabric, paint, peanuts, and pulses. Customs authorities are expected to process the consignments promptly once the required declarations are submitted by the respective importers or their clearing agents.
With respect to exports, 255 vehicles remain parked inside the Torkham terminal due to the ongoing border closure, while around 200 more are stranded along the Jamrud–Landi Kotal road. Meanwhile, no import vehicles are pending clearance at the Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda border stations.
Customs clearance operations at the Chaman Border Customs Station have remained suspended since Oct 15. As a result, five import vehicles and 23 export consignments are currently awaiting processing. Notably, the exporters have opted not to dray off their consignments, choosing instead to wait for the resumption of cross-border trade.
In terms of transit cargo, approximately 495 vehicles are queued for border crossing at Torkham and Chaman. Of these, the majority — 412 vehicles — are stranded at Chaman, while the remaining 83 are held up at Torkham, the announcement added.

• Calls for allowing KP CM Afridi’s meeting with Imran Khan
• KP’s Kundi says his office will play role of bridge between Centre and province
PESHAWAR: Punjab Gov­ernor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan on Friday said the alliance between his PPP and the PML-N was a political “compulsion” rather than an act of affection, aimed at maintaining political stability after the 2024 general elections.
“At least two parties had to join forces for the formation of the government,” he added while addressing a press conference with his Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa counterpart Faisal Karim Kundi at the Governor’s House in Peshawar.
The Punjab governor noted that the alliance serves the country’s interests. “Pakistan is our top priority,” he added.
Mr Khan conceded that party workers from both sides were finding it difficult to accept the alliance.
 
 

“The PPP’s inclusion in the government was borne out of necessity, not choice, and it has come at a political cost for our party,” he said, warning that even a minor irresponsibility could derail the system.
Mr Khan further said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had assured the PPP that its concerns would be addressed soon, even though PML-N leaders had admitted they could not meet several commitments.
CM’s meeting with Imran
The Punjab governor also said that KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi should “definitely” be allowed to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
“There is democracy [in the country], and in my view, politicians should be dealt with in a political manner. The court has given [Mr Afridi] the permission to meet [Imran Khan], and if there is no legal hindrance, I see no reason why the meeting should not take place,” he said in response to a question.
He also urged the KP government to have working relations with the federal government.
“You need to hold talks to get your rights though a political process,” he added.

He said the PPP owned the 26th Constitution Amend­ment and it was not rolled out of compulsion, noting that it would not have become possible without his party’s support.
The Punjab governor said that his party had no knowledge about the 27th Consti­tution Amendment, adding that the PPP would only back it if is satisfied there was nothing wrong in it.
‘Role of bridge’
Speaking on the occasion, KP Governor Kundi said CM Afridi recently took oath and his cabinet was yet to be finalised as he was in Rawalpindi to meet his party’s founder.
“I understand that every political party has its own age­nda but whenever it involves province, I have already suggested a parliamentary jirga should be formed to talk to the federal government,” he said, noting that issues could be discussed in Council of Common Interest meetings.
He said that after merger of the tribal districts with KP, the province’s population had increased, adding that the PM had committed to hold meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC) in August but it was delayed due to floods.
“My doors are open. The Governor’s House will play role as a bridge between the provincial and federal government for peace and development of the province.”
While talking about military operations in the province, Mr Kundi said the instable law and order situation in the merged districts was worsening with each passing day. “There is no other way except for intelligence-based operations.”
He said representatives of the federal government visited Kabul and the Afghan interim government was asked not to allow India and Israel use its land against Pakistan.
Mr Kundi noted that 80 per cent of the militant attacks in KP were being carried out in connivance with Afghanistan, adding that except for a facilitator, all the attackers on police training schools in Dera Ismail Khan were Afghan nationals.

• First Barelvi group to be declared proscribed
• Rana Sana claims TLP was created to ‘steal PML-N votes’, rules out negotiations
• Tanzeemat Ahl-i-Sunnat raises concerns over mosque takeovers

ISLAMABAD: With the government’s ban on Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) now in force, the once-influential religio-political group finds itself increasingly isolated as, unlike after the previous ban in 2021, no major religious or political party has come forward in its defence this time around.
The Ministry of Interior on Friday formally notified the ban on TLP, a day after the Punjab government’s proposal was ratified by the federal cabinet.
The notification, SRO 2011(1) of 2025, highlighted that the TLP has been declared a proscribed organisation under Section 11B(1)(a) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and placed on the Act’s First Schedule.
The party may appeal to a review committee comprising officers of the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Ministry of Interior within 30 days.
The National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) has issued an advisory to all provinces, law enforcement agencies, the banking sector, the Election Commission and other stakeholders regarding restrictions applicable to entities listed on Schedule I.
 
 

These include sealing party offices; curbs on promotional material (literature, posters, banners, printed and digital content); a bar on press statements and press conferences; financial sanctions and prohibitions on financial support; and limits on political and social activity.
Meanwhile, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah claimed on Friday that the TLP was “created in a bid to cut into PML-N’s vote bank”, Dawn.com reported.
Speaking to Geo News, Mr Sanaullah, in response to a question regarding TLP’s future as a political party and whether it was being kept as an option to be used against rival political parties, agreed that TLP had been used in the past for that purpose. The group “was created to steal votes from the PML-N’s vote bank”, he said.
However, he denied that TLP’s current fate had anything to do with its previous use as a proxy group, stating that “it was up to the federal cabinet to decide on any dissolution plans”.
The TLP has become the third religio-political party, and the first from the Barelvi school of thought, to be declared proscribed. It’s also the first political party to be proscribed twice, as it was briefly banned in 2021 by the PTI-led government. That ban was lifted after the party reportedly pledged to renounce violence.
Asked if the government was open to negotiating with the now-banned group if it provided any assurances, Mr Sanaullah said, “I think there can be no reassurance after you have already violated reassurances that were made previously”.
On a question on whether TLP can still contest elections as a political party, the PM’s aide said: “It is very difficult for a party to function while they are banned under the ATA” and maintained that “the party cannot take part in any elections”.
 
 

Earlier bans under the ATA have targeted groups across the spectrum. Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) and Tehreek-i-Jafria Pakistan (TJP) were banned in 2002. Both had sympathisers in political and religious circles.
TJP remained part of the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA) as well as the Milli Yakjehti Council (MYC). The SSP, with support largely within Deobandi networks and some former militant groups, later saw one of its leaders elected to the National Assembly.
By contrast, no major religious group from any of the country’s four main sects, nor any political party, has publicly extended support to the TLP following the latest decision.
One reason no group is backing the TLP is that most political and non-political organisations seem hopeful that the leaders and workers of the banned group would now join their original parties that they belonged to before 2015.
Mosques sealed
Following the announcement, the Punjab government moved to seal and take over mosques linked to TLP supporters.
Hafiz Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi, member of the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) and part of the first official negotiating team in 2021, opposed any move that would obstruct prayers.
Social media speculation suggested that mosques linked to Barelvi adherents might be handed over to Deobandi administrators. However, Mr Ashrafi later clarified that no such transfer would take place.
The Tanzeemat Ahl-i-Sunnat Pakistan — an umbrella body of almost all political and non-political groups of the Barelvi sect, but which the TLP never joined — raised concerns over mosque takeovers. Senior leader Mufti Gulzar Naeemi said they suspected the Punjab Auqaf Department’s actions.
“After negotiations with the Islamabad administration and other districts of Punjab, all sealed mosques have been reopened for prayers, and where prayer leaders had gone into hiding, replacement clerics have been appointed by the Auqaf Department in consultation with Tanzeemat,” Mufti Naeemi said.
TLP’s leadership originally belonged to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC). The late Allama Khadim Hussain Rizvi founded TLP in 2015, primarily focusing on issues related to the honour of the finality of Prophethood.
SIC chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza said, “We have always objected to the politics of violence from any platform belonging to the Barelvi school of thought because it will be more harmful for the whole nation compared to the benefits achieved out of that struggle.”
In 2021, prominent figures Mufti Muneebur Rehman, businessman Aqeel Karim Dhedhi (AKD) and Saylani Welfare Trust Chairman Bashir Qureshi acted as guarantors for the TLP in talks that led to the lifting of the earlier ban.
However, Mufti Muneeb has remained silent after the latest ban. Sources said Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi recently met Mufti Muneeb and reminded him of the October 2021 undertaking that TLP would not take the law into its own hands or challenge the writ of the state.
Mr Ashrafi told Dawn that the TLP had “constantly violated its own commitments” and alienated senior clerics by “harassing or misbehaving” with them.
“They ridiculed everyone who tried to pacify them; that is why nobody wants to speak on their behalf now,” he said.

Yesterday, the religiopolitical party was banned by the federal cabinet. In the 2018 general elections, the TLP was estimated by political analysts to have cost the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) at least 15 closely contested national seats across Pakistan. The party secured nearly 2.2 million votes, mostly from Punjab and Karachi, during the elections.
Earlier today, the interior ministry notified a ban on the TLP, saying that the federal government had “reasonable grounds” to believe the religiopolitical party was connected to terrorism, after nationwide TLP protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, Rana Sanaullah, in response to a question regarding TLP’s future as a political party and whether it was being kept as an option to be used against rival political parties, agreed that TLP had been used in the past for that purpose and went on to quip that “it was created to steal votes from the PML-N’s vote bank”.
However, the premier’s advisor denied that TLP’s current fate had anything to do with its previous use as a proxy group, stating that “it was up to the federal cabinet to decide on any dissolution plans”.
“I am not in a position to talk on behalf of the cabinet,” he said, expressing optimism that the decision to dissolve the party will be made.
When asked if the government was open to negotiating with the now-banned group if it provided any assurances, citing TLP’s 2021 ban and its subsequent lift, Sanaullah responded, saying, “I think there can be no reassurance after you have already violated reassurances that were made previously”.
He stressed that “any party, whether political, religious, or academic, involved in terrorist activities is liable to be banned under clause 11b of the Anti-Terrorism Act”.
In response to a question on whether TLP can still contest elections as a political party, the PM’s aide said: “It is very difficult for a party to function while they are banned under the ATA”, and maintained that “the party can not take part in any elections while it is still banned under the ATA.”
Detailing the next steps following the ban, he said, “Now that the government has notified the ban, within the next three days, all these grounds will now be sent to TLP for review, after which it will have 30 days to file an appeal in a high court via a writ jurisdiction”.
However, he clarified that the ban on the party “stands within the review period and also during the appeal period,” emphasising that “there is no space for accommodating the party”.
On the matter of potential dissolution, he elaborated that, “the first step here is the review and then the appeal”.
“How will a party that has been banned act as a political party? If their offices and assets have been sealed, how will they function?”
According to analysts, the final decision to ban a political party rests with the Supreme Court under the Constitution.
“The federal government shall, within 15 days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, whose decision on such reference shall be final,”  according to Article 17(2) of the Constitution.
The government can also invoke Section 212 of the Elections Act 2017 to seek the dissolution of a political party. Any declaration is subject to adjudication by the Supreme Court.
The TLP was formed in 2015 out of a protest campaign seeking the release of Mumtaz Qadri, a police constable who had assassinated the former governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, in 2011 over his calls to reform the blasphemy laws and release Asia Bibi, who had been accused of blasphemy. Qadri was later executed.
The group founded a political party at Qadri’s funeral in 2016, which was attended by thousands of people.</p><small>2025-10-24 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24220009a516c65.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950991/palestinian-factions-agree-to-hand-gaza-to-technocrat-committee' target='_blank'><strong>Palestinian factions agree to hand Gaza to technocrat committee</strong></a><br><p>The main Palestinian political factions, including Hamas, said on Friday they had agreed that an independent committee of technocrats would take over the running of post-conflict Gaza.
During a meeting in Cairo, according to a joint statement published on the Hamas website, the groups agreed to hand “over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a temporary Palestinian committee composed of independent technocrats”.
It said the committee would “manage the affairs of life and basic services in cooperation with Arab brothers and international institutions”.
The statement also said the factions had agreed to work on unifying a common position “to confront the challenges facing the Palestinian cause”.
It called for a meeting of all forces and factions to “agree on a national strategy and to revitalise the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people”.
Hamas is not part of the PLO, which is dominated by its longtime rival Fatah.
An informed source told AFP on Thursday that delegations from Hamas and Fatah met in Cairo to discuss the second phase of a US-backed ceasefire plan in Gaza.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that both sides agreed to “continue meetings in the coming period and to work on organising the Palestinian internal front in the face of the challenges posed by the Israeli government”.
Alongside the Hamas-Fatah talks, Egypt’s intelligence chief Hassan Rashad met senior officials from key Palestinian factions.
They included Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, as well as the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine — both factions within the PLO.
Hamas and Fatah have a history of deep political rivalry, which flared into fighting for a time after a 2006 election, and which has hindered efforts at Palestinian national unity.
In December 2024, they agreed to create a committee to jointly administer post-conflict Gaza. The agreement was criticised, particularly by members of Fatah.
Hamas, which seized power in the territory in 2007, has already made it clear that it does not wish to govern the post-conflict territory, but has pushed back against the insistence that it disarm its fighters.
Rubio seeks quick deployment of international Gaza force
Separately, top US diplomat Marco Rubio voiced hope of soon putting together an international force to police the ceasefire in Gaza.
The secretary of state visited Israel on the heels of Vice President JD Vance as part of an all-out effort by the United States to persuade both Hamas and Israel to respect the truce.
Rubio said it was critical for the deal to create “the conditions for the stabilisation force to come in as soon as it possibly can be put together”.
He expressed optimism for a durable end to the two-year Gaza conflict as he met Israeli, US and other Western forces monitoring the ceasefire from inside a vast converted warehouse in southern Israel.
The deal, spearheaded by President Donald Trump, calls for an international force to oversee security after Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas.
In Gaza, families were still trying to find their way back to their ruined homes — in many cases only to find they lie in areas controlled by Israeli forces beyond the so-called “Yellow Line”.
“Some young men from our family risked their lives, they went to inspect the destruction in our area, and told us that my house was destroyed,” said 42-year-old Hani Abu Omar, a displaced Palestinian speaking to AFP at a tented encampment in Al-Zawayda.
“All my life I’ve been working, earning, and doing everything I can to build a house.”
 
 

Israel’s campaign in Gaza since October 2023 has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians and left hundreds of thousands homeless and hungry.
Fighting has died down since the October 10 ceasefire, but aid flows are still restricted and Gaza is divided between Hamas territory in the ruined cities and a wide band of land outside the Yellow Line still held by Israel.
The arrival of an international security force may unlock reconstruction funds — US officials vow none will go to Hamas-held areas — but the troop-contributing countries have yet to be confirmed.
Rubio confirmed that Israel would enjoy vetoes on the force’s composition, amid reports Israel has objected to Turkiye’s participation.
“There’s a lot of countries that have offered to do it. Obviously as you put together this force, it will have to be people that Israel is comfortable with,” he said.
Turkiye, a Nato member and one of the region’s strongest militaries, was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel.
But, under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, it has welcomed Hamas leaders and been a vociferous critic of Israel, which Erdogan accuses of committing genocide in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.
Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority state, has said it is ready to send troops to Gaza.
The United Arab Emirates, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020, has already been involved in ceasefire monitoring.
Rubio said the US may seek a UN mandate for the force, as some countries need the world body’s imprimatur to deploy troops.
But he again rejected any future role for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, which Israel has banned from its territory.
Some 200 US soldiers have deployed to the Civil-Military Coordination Centre, where uniformed troops from a dozen countries were seen mingling in the hastily-assembled rented space.
Overhead screens showed the staff’s latest findings, including what it said was a new abundance of fruit, vegetables, cheese and coffee getting into Gaza.
Another projection showed the day’s schedule and ended with words from Trump that read like a motivational saying: “A new and beautiful day is rising. And now, the rebuilding begins.”
The Trump administration has been increasingly firm with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who in March brushed aside an earlier ceasefire and ordered a major new offensive.
Netanyahu has sought to downplay any perception of tension with the US, his most crucial military and diplomatic backer.
Israel is still waiting for Hamas to return the remains of 13 of 28 dead hostages it promised to hand over.
Hamas said today it had received “clear guarantees” from mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye that “the war has effectively ended”.</p><small>2025-10-24 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24214944f4423d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950987/pakistan-among-possible-destinations-to-resettle-exiled-palestinian-captives' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan among possible destinations to resettle exiled Palestinian captives</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is among four possible destinations that are being considered to receive exiled Palestinian captives, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club (PPC), a non-governmental organisation established in 1993 to support political prisoners in Israeli occupation jails.
They were freed in exchange for Israelis held in Gaza, but instead of going home, 154 former Palestinian prisoners were exiled to Egypt, where they are confined to a hotel and kept under tight surveillance. All of them had been sentenced by an Israeli military court to life in prison on charges of murder, belonging to Palestinian resistance groups banned by Israel and more.
But when a ceasefire took effect in Gaza earlier this month, the group was put on buses and sent to Egypt, where authorities have put them in a five-star hotel that they cannot leave without clearance. Egypt first received 150 exiled prisoners in January, and more than eight months later, most of them are still in the same hotel, their fate undecided.
PPC official Hasan Abd Rabbo told AFP that the men remain in Egypt with accommodation costs covered by Qatar, while talks are underway over resettlement. He said possible destinations include Pakistan, Qatar, Turkiye and Malaysia.
“We were separated from our families for 20 years,” Murad Abu al-Rub, a 45-year-old who spent two decades behind bars for alleged murder and for belonging to a Palestinian organisation banned by Israel, told AFP.
Now, he is living in uncertainty and under close surveillance, far from the Palestinian city of Jenin where he was born.
“Nothing has changed. I still can’t see my mother or my siblings,” Abu al-Rub told a team of AFP journalists who were able to access the hotel.
Since the US-brokered ceasefire took hold on October 10, Hamas has freed all 20 surviving Israelis in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinians, most of whom returned to Gaza and the West Bank.
During previous truces in the conflict, thousands of other Palestinian prisoners were freed in similar exchanges.
The vast majority of those with life sentences were exiled to Egypt, which has formal ties with Israel and played a key mediation role.
Rights groups have long criticised Israel’s use of military courts to try Palestinians suspected of security offences, saying they do not offer fair trial guarantees.
Uncertainty
In Egypt, the 154 men are not free to move, and they have no work permits and no idea what comes next. The government has not issued any formal statement about their status.
“No Arab country wanted to take us in,” said Abu al-Rub, who was imprisoned for the alleged killing of four Israeli soldiers in 2006 in an operation by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade.
In the hotel corridors, the men spend hours on the phone, speaking to relatives.
“When I was arrested, my little sister was 15,” Abu al-Rub said. “I didn’t recognise her when I saw her on a video call.”
Over 19 years, he was shuffled through eight different Israeli prisons, never staying more than a few months in each.
Conditions
Kamil Abu Hanish, who spent 22 years in Israeli prisons, was jailed allegedly for murder and for belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), according to Israel’s justice ministry records.
He described the relief of being freed from jail.
“It was like moving between two worlds … from a world of shackles and locked doors to a world of freedom and open space,” he said.
But he also described his final hours in custody as some of the harshest.
“Dozens of prisoners were tied together with ropes. They blindfolded us and forced us to kneel. Then they made us lie face down with our hands bound,” said Abu Hanish.
Before Hamas’s October 7 attack, prisoners could study, play sports and attend daily discussion groups, he said, with inmates recounting a tradition of protest and rebellion in order to obtain these rights.
“We played volleyball and table tennis and held three educational sessions a day,” Abu al-Rub said.
“We had no rights left — even the simplest,” he said, adding that pens, paper, films, TV and newspapers were banned after October 7.
“Everything we had, including clothing and blankets, was confiscated. We were left sleeping on iron beds” during winter.
 
 

Palestinian, Israeli and international rights groups have documented similar claims of mistreatment, but Israel denies any such violations and says its prison service operates in accordance with the law.
According to the Palestinian Authority, nearly 11,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli custody, on charges related to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Mahmoud al-Ardah, 50, also jailed on murder and other security charges, said the last two years were the worst.
“Daily beatings and humiliation,” said the man, accused of belonging to the Islamic Jihad organisation.
“In the last two years, I suffered more than in the previous 30.”
In 2021, Ardah was one of six inmates who escaped Israel’s Gilboa prison by digging a tunnel with spoons and improvised tools. He was rearrested and put in solitary confinement.</p><small>2025-10-24 17:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24204750a027925.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950986/4-rare-brydes-whales-sighted-off-gwadar-coast-wwf-p' target='_blank'><strong>4 rare Bryde’s whales sighted off Gwadar coast: WWF-P</strong></a><br><p>In a rare sighting, four Bryde’s whales have been spotted off the coast of Gwadar, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-P).
In a post on X, the organisation said the group was sighted a day ago by local fishermen near Gwadar (Demi Zur) by local fishermen, who immediately reported the incident to WWF-Pakistan as part of its citizen science initiative.
“The whales were spotted by a fishing boat captained by Amir Dad Karim, who noticed movement on the calm sea about 5 kilometres north of their operation area. On approaching, they found a pod of baleen whales, later identified as Bryde’s whales, likely moving toward coastal waters to feed.”
The organisation said the Bryde’s whale (Balaenoptera brydei) is one of the three baleen whale species known from Pakistani waters — the other two are the blue whale and the Arabian humpback whale — adding that it lives in warm and temperate oceans and mainly feeds on schooling fish such as sardines, anchovies and mackerels, which are abundant along the country’s coastline.
It said the species was listed as “data deficient” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List and remained poorly studied globally.
“Like all other cetaceans, they are protected under Pakistan’s wildlife, fisheries, and international trade laws.”
“Such rare sightings remind us of the rich marine life along Pakistan’s coast and the importance of protecting it for generations to come,” it said.
 






WWF-Pakistan has strengthened its efforts to conserve marine mammals by developing a national databank of cetaceans — whales, dolphins, and porpoises — through the innovative citizen science initiative that engages fishermen, scientists and the public in reporting marine life sightings along the country’s coastline.
“Citizen science allows us to collect vital information about marine species that would otherwise go unrecorded,” said Muhammad Moazzam Khan, technical adviser at WWF-Pakistan. “This recent sighting is a promising indicator of a healthy marine food web.”
Pakistan’s waters have seen several sightings of Bryde’s whales in recent years, though some have ended tragically.
 
 

The last recorded incident was in November 2023 when a dead Bryde’s whale was found near Jiwani, close to the Pakistan-Iran border. Another was stranded in the same region in May 2023.
Rab Nawaz, senior director for biodiversity at WWF-Pakistan, praised the active participation of coastal communities in supporting conservation efforts.
“Fishermen in Sindh and Balochistan have played an essential role by sharing information about marine mammals and adapting fishing methods to prevent whale and dolphin entanglement. Their collaboration demonstrates the power of local knowledge in protecting endangered species,” he said.
Established in 1970, WWF-Pakistan is the country’s largest environmental organisation, with over 300 staff working across 32 offices. The organisation’s ongoing marine conservation projects aim to protect biodiversity, promote sustainable fishing practices, and ensure the long-term health of Pakistan’s coastal and ocean ecosystems.</p><small>2025-10-24 16:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24151616cd35282.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950966/sp-2-other-policemen-martyred-as-back-to-back-blasts-rock-kps-hangu' target='_blank'><strong>SP, 2 other policemen martyred as back-to-back blasts rock KP’s Hangu</strong></a><br><p>Three cops, including a superintendent of police (SP), were martyred as back-to-back blasts rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu on Friday, according to police.
KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed shared these details with Dawn.com, saying that the first blast targeted a police checkpost in the jurisdiction of Bilyamina police station.
He said no policemen were usually deployed at the checkpost, adding that some policemen were on their way to the site when a second blast took place near their vehicle.
Three policemen were martyred in the second blast, which was caused by an improvised explosive device, the IG said.
Kohat division’s Regional Police Officer (RPO) Abbas Majeed shared further details of the incident while speaking to the media in Hangu.
He said police security was on high-alert today in Hangu, as well as in other districts of Kohat.
Police had been carrying out a search and strike operation in the area and had also cordoned off a location at a distance of around 100 metres from the targeted checkpost since 10am, the RPO said. He added that the checkpost, an old one, was used by law enforcement personnel to rest during breaks when they would cordon off a nearby location.
“There was no one at the checkpost at the time of the incident,” he said, adding that an IED blast took place at the checkpost at 2pm. “However, since no police personnel were present there, there were no casualties.”
The RPO said SP (Operations) Asad Zubair, along with a police party, had left for the checkpost following the first blast. “As their vehicle approached the location, an IED blast occurred near the checkpost. Fitna-al-Khawarij had planted a more powerful IED there in comparison to the one used in the first blast.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is term designated for the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) by the state.
RPO Majeed said the second blast was a “big” one, which resulted in the death of two policemen on the spot. Meanwhile, SP Zubair was taken to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries, he added.
The official said a large police party was carrying out a search operation at the site of the incident.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi sought an immediate report from the IG following the incident and called a session of the apex committee on the law and order situation in the province, a statement from the CM office said.
It added that the CM had “strongly condemned” the incident and termed it “unfortunate”.
The statement further quoted him as saying that the “elements involved [in the incident] would be taken to task at all costs. Cowardly attacks cannot demoralise the CTD (counter-terrorism department) and police”.
He added the sacrifices of the martyred police personnel, which also included a superintendent of police, “will not go in vain” and that  “all resources will be used to establish peace”.
CM Afridi also prayed for the martyred personnel and their families, the statement said.
Condemnations
President Asif Ali Zardari “strongly condemned” the “attack in Hangu carried out by India-backed Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists,” a statement on the PPP’s X account said.
Fitna al-Hindustan is a term used by the state to frame India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
The statement on the PPP’s account quoted President Zardari as saying: “Terrorists are enemies of the country’s peace and stability. Their cowardly acts are unacceptable.”
He paid tributes to the policemen martyred in today’s blasts, saying that the nation was “proud of the sacrifices of its brave soldiers”.
The president lauded the resolve and courage of police in the fight against terrorism and prayed for the martyred policemen, as well as their families, the statement said.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the police had always played a frontline role in the war against terrorism.
“We are determined to completely eradicate terrorism from the country,” he said.
 






Earlier, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also “strongly condemned” the blasts, a statement posted on his ministry’s X account said, adding that he paid tributes to the martyred police, including SP Zubair.
He also extended condolences to the families of the martyred policemen.
“The sacrifice of martyred SP Asad Zubair and two other police personnel will not go in vain. The sacrifices of the officers and personnel of KP Police cannot be forgotten,” the statement quoted him as saying.
 






Former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur also expressed sorrow over the martyrdom of policemen in the incident.
“Saddened to hear about the martyrdom of SP (Operations) Asad Zubair and two [other] policemen during an IED attack in Hangu. KP police, security forces and the brave people of KP have been paying the price for our peace with their blood,” he posted on X.
 






Uptick in terror incidents
Pakistan has been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan since TTP broke a ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022. Ending the ceasefire agreement, the TTP had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Today’s blasts take place five days after law enforcers foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in KP’s Bannu district on Oct 19. According to police, the failed attack was carried out by the TTP and targeted the Baka Khel police station and three terrorists were killed as cops opened fire on them.
Previously on Oct 18, unkn­own assailants had launched a rocket and gun attack on the Azam Warsak police station in South Waziristan. According to police, the attackers targeted the police station from multiple directions, but the police and the Frontier Corps personnel responded swiftly, forcing the assailants to flee. No casualties were reported in the incident.
Prior to that, on the night of Oct 17, police had intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station.</p><small>2025-10-24 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630317-ihc-grants-police-one-week-extension-to-locate-missing-nccia-official' target='_blank'><strong>IHC grants police one-week extension to locate missing NCCIA official</strong></a><br><p>

“India will not sign any trade deal in a hurry,” Goyal said during a speech at the Berlin Global Dialogue, referring to European Union and the US concerns over India’s continued purchases of Russian oil.
Alongside ongoing EU free trade pact negotiations, India is in trade talks with the United States, which has imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian exports.
US President Donald Trump said this week he spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi mainly about trade, and that Modi had assured him India would limit its oil purchases from Russia.
Goyal said New Delhi would take a measured approach.
An official aware of the ongoing trade talks with the US told reporters in New Delhi that the two countries are sorting out the language of their agreement.
“We are very near as far as deal is concerned,” the official said, adding that both countries are “converging on most of the issues”.
New Delhi has been resisting US demands to allow market access for American grains and dairy, citing the need to protect the livelihoods of small farmers. But India could consider allowing some corn and soymeal imports, trade and industry sources said.
After the United States sanctioned Russia’s top oil producers on Wednesday, Indian refiners — major buyers of cheap Russian oil — said they are set to sharply cut imports, potentially clearing a key hurdle to a US-India trade deal.
Goods exports to the US fell to $5.43 billion from $6.87bn in August, as tariffs hit shipments of goods such as textiles, shrimp, and gems and jewellery, data released by the Commerce ministry showed.
The EU, United Kingdom and the United States are pressuring New Delhi to scale back imports of discounted Russian crude, which the Western nations argue help fund Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.
India has long defended its energy purchases as essential for ensuring affordable supplies and energy security, but Indian refiners are now poised to sharply curtail imports of Russian oil to comply with new US sanctions on two major Russian producers.</p><small>2025-10-24 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/24183722007cea1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950980/at-least-8-terrorists-killed-during-ibo-in-kps-tank-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>At least 8 terrorists killed during IBO in KP’s Tank: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>At least eight “Indian-sponsored” terrorists were killed during an Intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank district as part of operation “Azm e Istehkam”, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
In today’s operation in Tank, “troops effectively engaged terrorist locations, and after an intense fire exchange, eight Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
“On 24 October 2025, on [the] reported presence of Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Tank District,” the statement read.
In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij, mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
Weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, the ISPR said.
It added that the slain terrorists “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies as well as killing of innocent civilians.”
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored Kharji found in the area as relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan [who] will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement added.
In June last year, the federal government approved a reinvigorated and re-energised national counter-terrorism campaign, Operation Azm-i-Istehkam.
On Oct 16, Security for­ces killed 34 “India-ba­cked” terrorists during multiple operations across KP over the course of three days, the military’s media wing said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan after the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-10-24 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/241745068668c39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950976/isp-says-its-internet-services-will-be-fully-restored-across-country-by-monday' target='_blank'><strong>ISP says its internet services will be fully restored across country by Monday</strong></a><br><p>Internet service provider Stormfiber on Friday said that its internet services will be fully restored by Monday following disruptions over the past week across the country.
On October 20, internet users in Pakistan complained of service degradation and slow browsing speeds on certain ISPs, which was once again attributed to a fault in the submarine cable. There was no statement or acknowledgment from the ISPs in question, the IT ministry, or the regulator, Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA).
When approached for comment, IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja attributed it to the global shutdown of Amazon cloud services. However, many internet users claimed they had been informed by their ISP that services were suffering due to cable damage.
In a statement issued today, the company said, “We expect to fully recover the lost capacity within 72 hours (by 11:59pm on Monday, 27 October 2025),” adding that it had “immediately restored over 60 per cent of the affected capacity by procuring and activating additional bandwidth on alternate cables.”
“We are continuing to add more capacity and reroute traffic to improve peak-time performance, with newly procured bandwidth coming online via UAE, Oman, and Hong Kong,” the statement said.
It continued: “Incremental capacity will be added in staged activations prior to that, so many customers will experience noticeable improvement before then.”
The statement by the internet service provider added that its teams were working round the clock with “international partners to restore full performance and resilience”.
Detailing the outage, Stormfibre said, “Over the past few months, several regional submarine cables that carry much of the country’s traffic, including IMEWE and SEA-ME-WE4 have experienced outages.
The PEACE cable system originates in China and connects to Pakistan.
According to the PTA, the cables landing in the country are operated by PTCL, Cybernet and TransWorld Associates.
Three undersea cable networks operated by the PTCL are AAE-1 (Africa, Asia and Europe), SMW4 (South-East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe) and the IMEWE (India-Middle East-Western Europe).
“To mitigate the impact on our users, the Cybernet Network Operations team proactively procured additional submarine capacity on alternate paths, including the PEACE cable,” the statement said.
However, as per the company, on Oct 20, at approximately 5:30pm “the PEACE cable also suffered a cut in the Red Sea near Sudan.”
“This caused evening peak-time congestion and intermittent slowdowns for our users,” it said.
Internet users in Pakistan often face disruptions due to persistent submarine cable faults.</p><small>2025-10-24 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630286-security-forces-kill-eight-terrorists-in-tank-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill eight terrorists in Tank IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The development came during the hearing of a petition filed by Rozina Usman for the recovery of her husband Muhammad Usman. She alleged that four armed individuals abducted her husband on October 14. At the previous hearing, the court had given the police three days to locate the missing official.
Resuming the hearing of the case today, Justice Muhammad Azam Khan asked the police about the progress made in the case.
“What is the progress? You were given three days,” said the justice.
District Superintendent of Police (DSP) Legal Sajid Cheema informed the court that investigations were “underway” to trace the NCCIA official, adding that the senior superintendent of police investigation was looking into the matter.
“The missing deputy director was investigating the Ducky Bhai case,” the DSP said, referring to a case involving popular YouTuber Saadur Rehman.
The police official added that the “rest of the people investigating this case are also missing” and added that the police station investigating the case was in Lahore.
The senior police official also informed the court that the petitioner, Rozina, was previously in Lahore and then in Islamabad, according to data available till October 18. He said that her last address was Empress Road in Lahore, after which her phone had been switched off.
“When the investigating officer went to her house, he reported that the house was locked,” he said. Cheema added that the NCCIA official’s last location was pinpointed to Islamabad’s F-6 sector.
“If the WhatsApp data is found, everything will be known,” he claimed.
Meanwhile, the petitioner’s lawyer, Rizwan Abbasi, reiterated that his client was also “missing” after moving the plea in the IHC. He said that the last call the petitioner received was a threat to withdraw her plea.
At one point, the judge said that she might have been staying with her parents or her relatives.
“If she did go, did she go there willingly?” asked her lawyer. “A person was kidnapped from the federal capital; ten days have passed,” Abbasi added.
The court also ordered police to check Usman’s WhatsApp records to assist the investigation.
The DSP sought a week’s duration from the IHC to investigate the WhatsApp data. The court, accepting the request, granted another week for the recovery of the abductee and adjourned the hearing until next Friday.</p><small>2025-10-24 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630270-punjab-governor-says-ppp-pml-n-alliance-born-out-of-necessity-not-love' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab governor says PPP-PML-N alliance 'born out of necessity, not love'</strong></a><br><p>
