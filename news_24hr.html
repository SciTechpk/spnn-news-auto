Earlier today, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, claimed that Pakistan had carried out overnight strikes in the neighbouring country. In a post on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. The military spokesperson rejected the allegations.
Asked in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ about whether Pakistan was denying carrying out any strikes or civilian casualties during the alleged strikes, the defence minister replied: “Both things are non-existent at this time. We do react and retaliate, but [targeting] civilians is not at all our manner. We have a disciplined force that has traditions and a code of conduct; we are not a ragtag group like the Taliban, who neither have a code of conduct nor religion nor traditions.”
“But you know, hope should always be present unless all limits are crossed. But today, we are completely writing them off and we have no good hope from them.”
A question about the Taliban’s stated intent to retaliate according to Islamic law irked the defence minister, who asked which Islamic law the Afghan Taliban follow that requires them to live in their neighbour’s home for decades and then spill blood.
“Is this some self-invented Shariah of their own? This is not the Shariah of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).”
When asked about the timing of any retaliation, Asif said Pakistan’s well-wishers, including Turkey, Iran and Qatar, were urging regional peace, arguing it would benefit everyone and create jobs for all, including Afghans.
He added that the Afghan Taliban were more than welcome to pursue and open up trade with India through whichever route they wanted, adding that Pakistan did not care for it.
“All these goods are ultimately sold in our market.”
Pushed for a response on the Taliban’s threat, the defence minister downplayed it as merely words and said it was meaningless to take them seriously or trust them. “There will be no greater idiocy than trusting them,” he added.
Asif maintained that Pakistan had pursued cordial relations, adding that he himself welcomed the Afghan Taliban after they retook Kabul and made frequent visits to Afghanistan, but “I don’t think we have gained any dividends, successes, or changes in their behaviour from these visits; there has been no change in their attitude.”
The defence minister reiterated that the Afghan Taliban were ultimately destroying their own country.
He expressed the belief that the situation would eventually escalate to a point where regional neighbours seeking peace would intervene..
“It won’t take long; otherwise, they will be isolated and their total isolation will ultimately result in a collapse,” he added.
Pak-Afghan relations
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
Last week, the Foreign Office said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.</p><small>2025-11-25 21:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25204715d41827c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957299/aleema-pti-supporters-continue-sit-in-near-adiala-jail-as-negotiations-with-police-make-no-headway' target='_blank'><strong>Aleema, PTI supporters continue sit-in near Adiala Jail as negotiations with police make no headway</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder and ex-premier Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, is continuing a sit-in near Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail after she was again denied a meeting with her incarcerated brother on Tuesday.
Earlier tonight, Islamabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) (Investigations) Rana Tanveer arrived at the scene to negotiate with Aleema and her sisters to disperse the protesters.
However, negotiations between the police and the party supporters failed, with the PTI adamant on continuing the sit-in. They are expected to continue the demonstration overnight.
A livestream by the PTI from earlier this evening showed a massive crowd sloganeering, with riot police present in the area.
 






Aleema and her sisters — Noreen Niazi and Dr Uzma Khan — were stopped at Factory Naka by police, upon which PTI supporters started sloganeering and staged a sit-in. Majlis Wahdaat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas also joined the demonstration.
At Factory Naka, Aleema told reporters that she would stay at the sit-in site until she was allowed to meet Imran and questioned the presence of a large number of police personnel.
“At this time, it is the law of the jungle; they (authorities) should be concerned that if they do not proceed according to the constitution and law, Pakistan will face the law of the jungle.”
Aleema also condemned the treatment of her and her sisters last week, calling female police personnel “shameless”.
“These policewomen think that they will make the [Punjab Chief Minister] Maryam Nawaz happy and get promotions by doing this,” she said. “If they want to arrest us, we are not afraid.
Meanwhile, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh uploaded a video on X showing the party’s Karachi General Secretary Arslan Khalid at the protest.
“The police are doing the same thing again,” he said, referring to the use of force to disperse the protesters.
“Our brothers and sisters are safe and the PTI’s workers are here to protect them,” he added. “Our demand is the release of Imran Khan.”
 






Earlier today, Aleema told a reporter that she had a legal right to visit her brother in prison.
“We come here legally, as is our legal and constitutional right,” she said. “If we are attacked, it is unconstitutional. As Imran Khan said, the rule of law is being buried.”
 






Last week, the party said that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters from outside Adiala Jail, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with the party founder.</p><small>2025-11-25 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25232238fb347ca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957317/pti-to-release-white-paper-over-alleged-election-rigging-corruption' target='_blank'><strong>PTI to release white paper over alleged election rigging, corruption</strong></a><br><p>The PTI has decided to release a white paper which will “disclose” evidence of the government’s alleged role in rigging the recent by-elections, corruption, the poor law and order situation in the country, malintent in recent legislation and the economic meltdown in Pakistan.
Party stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser told Dawn he was hopeful that the white paper would be released next month, as different teams would be working on it and all the findings would be compiled.
He alleged that the recent rigging in the by-elections, especially in Haripur, once again proved that the incumbent government had failed and become unpopular.
“The white paper will cover all issues, including economic conditions, corruption, election rigging, law and order situation, etc,” Qaiser said. “Moreover, we will also give the comparison of the performance of the incumbent government with the tenure of PTI.”
Replying to a question, Qaiser said that the legal team headed by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja will look into issues related to law, election rigging and legislation passed by the government as part of the white paper.
“It is a fact that the incumbent government has passed a number of bills and has done legislation, but not a single legislation was done to address the issues of the masses,” he added.
 
 

Regarding the section of the white paper dealing with economic downturn and corruption, Qaiser said that party leaders, including Taimur Khan Jhagra, Muhammad Zubair and Muzzammil Aslam, would work on it.
“Similarly, other teams will work on different issues and in the end all will be compiled in the white paper, which will be released next month,” he said.
While talking to media persons earlier, Raja also announced that the white paper would be released, but said that “the law will also be followed”.
He said that during the hearing in the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Ali Bukhari demanded that all party members should receive the same treatment, as leaders from Punjab travelled to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and made statements, but the ECP did not take the issue up seriously.
“The KP chief minister has directed that the bureaucracy must implement the law and there should not be rigging,” Raja said. “It is the duty of the CM to ensure that the laws are implemented and followed.”
KP CM Sohail Afridi said that he has informed the ECP that, in case of rigging, legal action would be taken against the officials.
“In Haripur, presiding officers were KP government servants, but the returning officer was from the ECP and his office employees were from the federal government, so they issued Form 45 despite ‘pressure’,” he said.
Replying to a question, the CM said that the PTI would continue criticising policies that violate the law and claimed that Form 45 has signatures of polling agents from both sides, but the tickers shared from the RO office were different.
CM Afridi also said that the federal government should pay Rs3 trillion to the KP government so that development work could get started.
“The movement for the release of Imran Khan is ongoing and will continue,” he added.</p><small>2025-11-25 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/252317532dad8dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957316/barrick-committed-to-reko-diq-copper-project-says-interim-ceo' target='_blank'><strong>Barrick committed to Reko Diq copper project, says interim CEO</strong></a><br><p>Barrick Mining Corp remains committed to its Reko Diq copper mine in Pakistan, one of the world’s largest undeveloped deposits of the metal, its interim CEO said on Tuesday after reports of a possible withdrawal.
The $7 billion project in Balochistan is held in an equal partnership between the company and the government and is expected to start production by the end of 2028.
Barrick’s board had raised the possibility of splitting the company’s assets, which could include an outright sale of the Reko Diq mine and the company’s African assets, Reuters reported this month, citing sources familiar with the company’s thinking.
“Barrick remains committed to the Reko Diq project and to Pakistan,” Mark Hill told Reuters.
Security, scale, stake
Balochistan suffers frequent attacks by terrorists, making security a major concern for the mine. The project also requires a railway line upgrade to transport copper concentrate to Karachi for processing abroad.
Lenders, including the International Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank, among others, are assembling a financing package exceeding $2.6bn.
The Reko Diq project added 13 million ounces to Barrick’s gold reserves in 2024 and is expected to produce 200,000 metric tonnes of copper a year in its first phase, doubling after expansion, with projected free cash flow of more than $70bn over 37 years.
Pakistan’s mineral play
The remarks from Barrick underscore Reko Diq’s importance to both Pakistan and the company, with Islamabad counting on the mine to anchor its minerals strategy while the Canadian miner advances one of its largest long-term projects.
Sources familiar with the company’s thinking told Reuters this month that board members and some shareholders worry that exposure to riskier assets in Pakistan and Africa may be weighing on Barrick’s valuation compared with its safer North American operations, particularly in the context of any potential takeover interest.
Barrick returned to Pakistan in 2022 after a years-long legal dispute was settled, and the mine has since become a flagship investment for the country as it seeks to draw more capital into its minerals sector.</p><small>2025-11-25 18:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635546-no-hopes-from-ragtag-taliban-regime-anymore-says-defence-minister' target='_blank'><strong>'No hopes' from ragtag Taliban regime anymore, says defence minister</strong></a><br><p>

Devout Hindus believe that Ram was born in Ayodhya around 7,000 years ago, but that during the rule of the Mughal Empire, the Babri Masjid mosque was built on top of his birthplace in the 16th century. Thousands of Hindu activists, led by politicians of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), demolished the mosque in 1992. The Ram Temple was built at the site of the destroyed mosque and was inaugurated last January.
The FO condemned the flag hoisting at the site and stated that judicial processes allowing the construction of the temple over the mosque “speak volumes about the Indian state’s discriminatory approach towards minorities”.
“This reflected a broader pattern of pressure on religious minorities in India and deliberate attempts at eroding Muslim cultural and religious heritage under the influence of majoritarian Hindutva ideology,” the statement added.

The FO warned that other historic mosques in India face similar threats of desecration or demolition, while Indian Muslims continue to experience growing social, economic and political marginalisation under the majoritarian BJP.
It called on the international community to acknowledge rising Islamophobia, hate speech, and hate crimes in India and urged the United Nations to play a role in safeguarding Islamic heritage and minorities’ religious and cultural rights.
Pakistan also urged the BJP government to “uphold its responsibilities by ensuring the security of all religious communities, including Muslims, and by protecting their places of worship in accordance with international human rights obligations”.</p><small>2025-11-25 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/251752178f03fbd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957292/australian-govt-app-allows-visa-applicants-to-submit-passport-biometric-details-on-phone' target='_blank'><strong>Australian govt app allows visa applicants to submit passport, biometric details on phone</strong></a><br><p>The Australian government on Tuesday announced that visa applicants can apply through the Australian Immi App, which allows them to directly submit facial biometric and passport information through their phone.
In a post on X, Australian High Commissioner to Pakistan Tim Kane wrote that applying for a visa from Pakistan “just got easier”, attaching a link to the Australian Department of Home Affairs website.
 






The website states that the Immi App, available on both Android and iOS, is available for eligible applicants to provide their passport details and a facial image.​
“To provide your identity information using the Australian Immi App, you need to have a Requirement to provide personal identifiers (biometrics) letter with a Visa Lodgement Number (VLN) commencing with AUI or AUH [and a] valid passport,” the Australian home department said.
It added that the applicant’s mobile device requires location access and near-field communication to be enabled, with permission for the Immi App to use the phone’s camera.
A five-step guide was also shared on how to perform the biometric identity check.
“The Australian Immi App will send your passport details and facial images to the Department of Home Affairs,” the website stated, adding that unless there is an error, the applicant’s account should be updated within 24 hours.</p><small>2025-11-25 16:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635540-pakistan-warns-world-of-escalating-islamophobia-heritage-desecration-in-india' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan warns world of escalating Islamophobia, heritage desecration in India</strong></a><br><p>

The large majority of Gaza’s two million people were forced from their homes during Israel’s two-year ground and air onslaught in the small, crowded enclave triggered by Hamas’ October 2023 attack, with many now living in tents and other basic shelters.
A ceasefire has broadly held since mid-October, but the conflict demolished much of heavily built-up Gaza, including basic infrastructure, leaving grim living conditions for most people.
“This suffering, this rain — and the low-pressure weather systems haven’t even started yet. It’s only the beginning of winter, and we’re already flooded and humiliated,” Um Ahmed Aowdah said outside her tent as rain pelted down on Tuesday. “We haven’t received new tents or tarps. Our tarp is two years old and our tent is two years old — they’re completely worn out.”

Amjad Al-Shawa, head of the Palestinian NGOs Network, said there was an urgent need for at least 300,000 new tents to house the roughly 1.5m people still displaced from their homes.
The Palestinian Civil Defence Service said thousands of tents housing displaced families had been inundated by rainwater or damaged by torrential rainstorms over the past week.
Some tents were completely washed away as floodwaters rose 40 to 50 centimetres above ground level in some areas of the coastal enclave, while a field hospital had to suspend operations due to flooding, medics and witnesses said.

The United Nations said on Monday that while it was working to bring winter supplies into Gaza, the number of trucks able to enter the enclave was limited by Israeli curbs on aid groups.
Gaza authorities say Israel is not letting in as much aid as was promised under the ceasefire deal. Aid agencies say Israel is preventing many essential items from entering.

Israel says it is complying fully with obligations under the truce deal and does not stop any aid from entering Gaza, and that aid agencies have been inefficient in distributing it or have failed to prevent theft by Hamas. Hamas has denied stealing aid.</p><small>2025-11-25 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/251948551a0f23b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957302/ali-tareen-bows-out-as-multan-sultans-owner-after-franchise-denied-renewal' target='_blank'><strong>Ali Tareen bows out as Multan Sultans owner after franchise denied renewal</strong></a><br><p>Ali Khan Tareen bowed out as owner of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Multan Sultans on Tuesday after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) did not extend him a renewal offer.
The development comes as all five remaining franchises have renewed their agreements with the league for the next 10 years over the past two days, with Islamabad United and Karachi Kings being the latest to do so.
Tareen announced his departure in a note posted on X, describing the decision as a difficult but unavoidable conclusion to an increasingly strained relationship with the PCB.
“Despite the financial losses year after year, I never once thought about walking away,” he wrote. “The Sultans have always meant more to me than just numbers. And I have always been willing to go as far as needed to protect it.”
Acknowledging that his forthright views had not always been well received, Tareen said he had “always spoken his mind”, even when it put him at odds with the league’s management.
“I never learned how to play it safe or just play along,” he said. “And if staying means compromising those principles there is only one choice I can make. I would rather lose this team while standing on my feet than run it from my knees. So, this is goodbye.”
Tensions between the PCB and Tareen had escalated earlier this year after he publicly questioned the board’s commitment to strengthening the PSL amid increasing competition from T20 leagues worldwide. He had argued that the PSL leadership was not taking sufficient steps to protect the league’s standing as a leading T20 brand.
The dispute worsened after the PCB issued Tareen a legal notice for what it termed a “breach of contractual obligations”, prompting him to respond with further criticism. The resulting standoff eventually evolved into a complete breakdown in relations.
Tareen had maintained in recent weeks that he had not been approached regarding a renewal. His claim was borne out on Tuesday as the PCB moved ahead with franchise extensions for all other teams, leaving Multan the only side not offered continued ownership under its existing holder.
With his departure, Multan Sultans enter a period of uncertainty over their future ownership, even as the franchise remains one of the PSL’s most consistent performers on the field.</p><small>2025-11-25 16:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25210412ca4335f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957306/pm-shehbaz-to-visit-bahrain-from-nov-26-27-to-deepen-bilateral-linkages-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to visit Bahrain from Nov 26–27 to deepen bilateral linkages: FO</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will visit Bahrain from November 26-67 in a visit aimed at deepening linkages with the gulf country, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Tuesday.
In a press release issued today, the FO said: “The visit is expected to reinforce the traditionally warm and cordial ties, identify new avenues of partnership, and deepen people-to-people linkages, contributing to mutually beneficial cooperation.
“This official visit underscores Pakistan’s continued engagement with the Kingdom of Bahrain, aimed at fostering a results-oriented and strategic partnership between the two countries.”
It added the visit reaffirmed the “longstanding and multifaceted relationship” between the two countries.
 






The FO said PM Shehbaz will hold high-level engagements with Bahrain’s leadership to further enhance bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, investment, energy, technology, education, and culture.
He will be accompanied by a high-level delegation, including Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, federal ministers and senior officers.
The two countries in September had agreed to enhance cooperation in the fields of counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics and immigration.
The agreement was reached during a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and his Bahraini counterpart, General Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa.
The two sides had also agreed to establish a Joint Working Group to enhance collaboration across multiple sectors, including counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, coast guard operations, border security, immigration and police training.
They also decided to sign Mem­oranda of Understanding covering extradition, mutual legal assistance, and specialised battalion training.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the weapon system is capable of engaging targets both at sea and on land “with high precision”.
“The system is equipped with state-of-the-art guidance and advanced manoeuvrability features,” the ISPR said in a statement.
“The flight test was witnessed by Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Chief of the Naval Staff, senior scientists and engineers.”
The ISPR deemed the successful test launch “a testimony to Pakistan’s technological prowess and Pakistan Navy’s unwavering commitment to safeguard national interests”.

US and Ukrainian officials are trying to narrow the gaps between them over a peace plan, with core issues still unresolved and Ukraine wary of being strong-armed into accepting a deal largely on the Kremlin’s terms.
“Late Monday and throughout Tuesday, Secretary Driscoll and team have been in discussions with the Russian delegation to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine. The talks are going well and we remain optimistic. Secretary Driscoll is closely synchronised with the White House … as these talks progress,” said US Army Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Tolbert, a spokesperson for Driscoll.
The exact nature of the discussions was not immediately clear, and it was not known who was in the Russian delegation. A US official said that Driscoll, who has emerged as a point man for US diplomatic efforts on Ukraine, was also expected to meet Ukrainian officials while in Abu Dhabi.
Underlining the high stakes for Ukraine, its capital Kyiv was hit by a barrage of missiles and hundreds of drones overnight in a Russian strike that killed at least six people and disrupted power and heating systems. Residents were sheltering underground, wearing winter jackets, some in tents.

US policy towards the war has zigzagged in recent months.
A hastily arranged summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August raised worries in Kyiv and European capitals that the Trump administration might accept many Russian demands, though it ultimately resulted in more US pressure on Russia.
The latest US peace proposal, a 28-point plan that emerged last week, caught many in the US government, Kyiv and Europe off guard and prompted fresh concerns that the Trump administration might be willing to push Ukraine to sign a peace deal heavily tilted toward Moscow.
The plan would require Kyiv to cede more territory, accept curbs on its military and bar it from ever joining Nato — conditions Kyiv has long rejected as tantamount to surrender.
The sudden push raises the pressure on Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is now at his most vulnerable since the start of the war after a corruption scandal saw two of his ministers dismissed, and as Russia makes battlefield gains.
Zelensky could struggle to get Ukrainians to swallow a deal viewed as selling out their interests.
He said on Monday the latest peace plan incorporated “correct” points after talks over the weekend in Geneva.
“The sensitive issues, the most delicate points, I will discuss with President Trump,” Zelensky said in his nightly video address.
Zelensky, who could visit the US in the next few days, said the process of producing a final document would be difficult. Russia’s unrelenting attacks on Ukraine have left many sceptical about how peace can be achieved soon.
“There was a very loud explosion, our windows were falling apart, we got dressed and ran out,” said Nadiia Horodko, a 39-year-old accountant, after a residential building was struck in Kyiv overnight.
“There was horror, everything was already burning here, and a woman was screaming from the eighth floor, ‘Save the child, the child is on fire!’”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said an amended peace plan must reflect the “spirit and letter” of an understanding reached between Putin and Trump at their Alaska summit.
Macron warns against European capitulation
A group of countries supporting Ukraine, which is known as the coalition of the willing and includes Britain and France, was set to hold a virtual meeting on Tuesday.
“It’s an initiative that goes in the right direction: peace. However, there are aspects of that plan that deserve to be discussed, negotiated, improved,” French President Emmanuel Macron told RTL radio regarding the US-proposed plan. “We want peace, but we don’t want a peace that would be a capitulation.”
He added that only the Ukrainians could decide what territorial concessions they are ready to make.
“What was put on the table gives us an idea of what would be acceptable for the Russians. Does that mean that it is what must be accepted by the Ukrainians and the Europeans? The answer is no,” Macron added.
In a separate development, Romania scrambled fighter jets to track drones that breached its territory near the border with Ukraine early on Tuesday, and one was still advancing deeper into the Nato-member country, the defence ministry said.
Tensions have risen along Europe’s eastern flank in recent months after suspected Russian drones breached the airspace of several Nato states.</p><small>2025-11-25 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/251401483c3d584.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957270/pakistans-atmosphere-almost-clear-of-ash-plume-from-volcanic-eruption-in-ethiopia' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s atmosphere ‘almost clear’ of ash plume from volcanic eruption in Ethiopia</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s atmosphere is “almost clear” of the ash plume from a volcanic eruption in Ethiopia, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) spokesperson Anjum Nazeer Zaighum said on Tuesday, adding that the ash cloud was now present over parts of India.
The Hayli Gubbi volcano, located in Ethiopia’s Afar region about 800 kilometres northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border, erupted for several hours two days ago. The eruption sent a column of ash and smoke rising nearly 45,000 feet into the atmosphere.
The dangerous ash plume from the eruption had drifted across the Red Sea and disrupted operations on one of the world’s busiest air routes. By Monday, the plume had spread east over Yemen and Oman and was tracking toward the airspace of Pakistan and India, forcing airlines to cancel flights or fly costly detours.
The Met Office spokesperson said the ash plume was first detected in Pakistan about 60 nautical miles south of Gwadar around 10am on Monday. Zaigham said the ash plume remained over areas in Pakistan for around 18 to 20 hours.
He added that the Met Office had issued a volcanic ash advisory for the aviation industry for the first time in Pakistan’s history following the development. “In total, three advisories were issued,” he said.
“At present, it [ash plume] is present over parts of India and Pakistan’s atmosphere is almost cleared,” the spokesperson said.
He also clarified that the ash plume had no environmental impact in Pakistan as it moved at altitudes above 45,000 feet and with a speed of 15 to 20 kilometres per hour.
“It was too high,“ he said, adding that Pakistan would have faced environmental effects if the eruption had occurred in a country more closely located.
 






Ash cloud over India
Local Ethiopian media rep­orted that the explosion from the eruption caused tremors felt as far away as Djibouti and plunged surrounding settlements into darkness.
Officials and experts described the event as one of the most extraordinary volcanic awakenings in the region’s history. There is no evidence the volcano had erupted in more than 10,000 years, scientists said.
Meanwhile, airlines began cancelling flights post-noon on Monday as the ash moved across the Red Sea.
Air India said it had cancelled 11 flights on Monday and Tuesday to make precautionary checks on aircraft that had flown over some locations after the eruption.
Smaller peer Akasa said it had scrapped scheduled flights to Middle East destinations such as Jeddah, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi scheduled during the two days.
India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation said that only a few flights had been rerouted as a precautionary measure, and that the airports authority had issued a notice to all affected planes.
The ash cloud is moving towards China and is expected to clear Indian skies by 7:30pm today (7pm Pakistan time), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in a statement.
The Hindustan Times reported yesterday that Indian carrier IndiGo cancelled six flights, including routes originating from Mumbai and southern India. Another IndiGo flight, bound for Abu Dhabi from Kannur, was diverted to Ahmedabad.
“The Pakistan airspace is shut for Indian airlines, hence the Indian airlines are expected to be impacted,” a Mumbai airport official said on Monday regarding the re-routing challenges. “We have started keeping a record of this and are monitoring the situation.”

The move comes as several US tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon and OpenAI make a beeline for the world’s most populous nation, seen as a critical growth market where nearly a billion users access the internet.
Under the partnership, Google’s AI Futures Fund and Accel will co-invest up to $2 million in each startup, Prayank Swaroop, partner at Accel, told Reuters in an interview, with the investments focused on the wide areas of entertainment, creativity, work and coding.
 






The announcement comes after Google in October said it would invest $15 billion over five years to set up an AI data centre in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, its biggest-ever investment in the country.
Its AI Futures Fund, launched six months ago, has funded over 30 companies, including Indian webtoon startup Toonsutra and United States-based legal-tech firm Harvey.
Google has also teamed up with India’s largest telecom operator, Reliance Jio, to provide free access to Gemini AI for 505m users.
“We firmly believe that the founders in India, they are going to be playing a leading role in defining that next era of global technology,” Jonathan Silber, co-founder and director of Google’s AI Futures Fund, said.
“… we think that it’s critical to invest in the early stage. Particularly in key markets like India, so that we can be at the forefront of investing in the next generation of AI leaders.”
India’s AI market is projected to reach $17bn by 2027, according to IT industry body Nasscom and consulting firm BCG.
Global AI spend is seen at nearly $1.5 trillion in 2025, and will exceed $2tr in 2026, as per market research firm Gartner.</p><small>2025-11-25 15:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2517265392c90c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957289/outgoing-cjcsc-general-mirza-pays-farewell-visit-to-coas-munir-air-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Outgoing CJCSC General Mirza pays farewell visit to COAS Munir, air chief</strong></a><br><p>Outgoing Chairman Joint Chief of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza paid a farewell visit to Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
During the meeting, the army chief commended General Mirza for his “exemplary leadership, strategic foresight, and dedicated service to the Pakistan Armed Forces”, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“He (COAS) lauded the CJCSC’s pivotal role in enhancing tri-services synergy, strengthening joint operational preparedness, and advancing Pakistan’s national security objectives at the strategic level,” ISPR said.
Furthermore, Field Marshal Munir also highlighted General Mirza’s contributions towards regional stability, military diplomacy, and the strengthening of Pakistan’s partnerships with friendly countries, as per ISPR’s statement.
“General [Mirza] expressed gratitude to the COAS and the armed forces for the support extended during his career,” the statement said. “Upon arrival at GHQ, the CJCSC laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-e-Shuhada and was presented a guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army.”

CJCSC meets air chief
Separately, General Mirza also visited Air Headquarters in Islamabad where he was received by Pakistan Air Force Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, ISPR said.
“[The air chief] commended the CJCSC’s exemplary services and his pivotal role in strengthening tri-services synergy,” according to ISPR’s statement. “He appreciated [General Mirza’s] significant contributions towards national defence and reaffirmed PAF’s unwavering resolve to continue working closely with sister services to eradicate the menace of terrorism.”
Furthermore, the statement added that the CJCSC expressed his satisfaction over the combat readiness of air force and the progress achieved through its modernisation and upgradation initiatives.
“He lauded the professionalism and dedication of PAF personnel in safeguarding Pakistan’s aerial frontiers and acknowledged the vital role of the Service in the national fight against terrorism. He also appreciated the seamless coordination among the tri-services and expressed confidence that this cooperation would continue to flourish in the years ahead,” it said.

Abolishment of CJCSC office
Earlier this month, the national security establishment was restructured through Amendment in Article 243 of the Constitution and the subsequent changes in the legislations governing Army, Air Force and Navy.
The legislation also abolished the office of CJCSC, the tri-service post designed to maintain institutional balance and coordination within the armed forces.
The dissolution of the chairman’s office, effective November 27, would formally end nearly five decades of joint-service representation in armed forces decision-making at least during war time.</p><small>2025-11-25 14:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/251647470436aea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957296/fazl-objects-to-legislations-enacted-to-combat-child-marriages-and-domestic-violence-protect-transgender-people' target='_blank'><strong>Fazl objects to legislations enacted to combat child marriages and domestic violence, protect transgender people</strong></a><br><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Tuesday strongly objected to recent legislations aimed at reducing domestic violence, protecting children from child marriages, and safeguarding transgender community’s rights.
On November 13, the National Assembly also passed a bill — awaiting the Senate’s approval — to protect people against domestic violence in Islamabad. A day later, the Balochistan Assembly adopted a bill to ban child marriages with a majority, amidst a protest by opposition lawmakers, including JUI-F’s Younis Zehri.
In September, the Balochistan cabinet approved the province’s first-ever transgender policy to ensure the community’s social and economic inclusion.
Addressing the media in Islamabad today, the JUI-F chief said, “Some legislation has been enacted regarding the marriage of children below the age of 18 years, regarding transgenders, and regarding domestic violence.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill 2025 aims to establish an effective system of protection, relief and rehabilitation of women, men, transgender persons, children and any vulnerable person against domestic violence. It provides jail terms ranging from six months to three years, and a fine of up to Rs100,000, if the offence does not fall under the Pakistan Penal Code.
Speaking about child marriages, Fazl took exception to terming those under 18 as “na-baaligh” (minors), asking which sect’s Islamic laws stated as such.
“Strengthening the law to the point that if a marriage or nikkah is done before 18, it will be called sexual abuse and will be interpreted as rape, and a punishment will be given accordingly,” he said.
Pakistan is home to over 19 million child brides, with nearly 1 in 6 young women married before the age of 18, according to the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef).
 
 

While Sindh and the Islamabad Capital Territory already enforce 18 as the minimum marriage age for girls, the Punjab government is also set to introduce the Child Marriage Restraint Act to set the same threshold.
During his media talk, the JUI-F chief also criticised the Protection of Women Bill 2006, which had been introduced amid opposition from religious parties during Gen Pervez Musharraf’s dictatorship, to amend widely criticised Hudood laws.
He pointedly said the PPP had voted in favour of that bill, and “today as well, hindrances were being created in the way of permitted nikkah”. The PPP is in power in Balochistan, where the recent anti-child marriage bill and the transgender policy were introduced.
Fazl went on to term it a “weird point” and a “joke” that, although child marriages would be considered as rape, a child born out of it would be legitimate. “And the father will be bound to pay for its expenses,” he added.
It is unclear whether any of the recent legislation specified this. However, in March, the Lahore High Court ruled that a biological father was under an obligation to maintain his child even if born as a consequence of rape.
On the legislation pertaining to the transgender community, Fazl sought the “justification” for individuals born as a “complete male or a complete female” being allowed to change their gender.
“Perhaps, they do not even have as much freedom there in the West as we have given them here in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” he claimed.
The JUI-F chief said he did not “expect” such decisions from the government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his PML-N.
He alleged that the new laws were being passed on an “agenda” of the United Nations. He described laws and conventions enacted by international rights bodies as “slavery”.
Fazl objects to ‘lifetime perks’ under 27th Amendment
During his media briefing, Fazl also “completely rejected” the recently enacted 27th Amendment, which had been assailed by other opposition parties as well.
While praising the armed forces’ performance and courage during the May conflict with India, Fazl objected to the “lifetime perks” given to top military officers.
“These are perhaps such unique perks that Pakistan’s democratic society does not require them at all,” the senior politician said.
 
 

He urged President Asif Ali Zardari and the three services chiefs to reject the lifetime immunity offered under the 27th Amendment themselves.
Fazl expressed his reservations about the PPP “playing a role in the backslide of democracy instead of raising the slogan of democracy”, as it could not block the changes that were earlier opposed during the 26th Amendment.
The JUI-F chief said the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) and the Supreme Court Shariat Appellate Bench’s jurisdictions were not kept in mind when drafting the 27th Amendment. He contended that appeals against FSC decisions would be marred by confusion about whether the SC would hear them or the Federal Constitutional Court.

For many women, it’s perimenopause</strong></a><br><p>The forties may have gained a reputation for being the age when bad things happen to a woman’s body, but there is no magic to this number.
Every woman goes through these physiological changes in their own time. The 40s is, however, the age when perimenopause is most likely to hit women, and it is good to know what changes to expect and how to combat them.
Perimenopause can be loosely defined as the prep time that a female body takes to transition into menopause, and it is here that hormones such as oestrogen and progesterone start to destabilise.
The most notable changes a woman faces physically at this time are weight gain, a deteriorating skin texture, and exhaustion. Doctors have noted that this particular weight gain is not just visible on the scale — it settles distinctly on the hips, giving the body a more rotund look.
The loss of oestrogen and progesterone is directly responsible for saggy and more dehydrated skin, fine lines and the loss of skin suppleness due to decreasing collagen.
Dr Kazi Azmiri Hoque, RMO at the Obs Gyn Department of Meditech General Hospital, mentions, “Women can sometimes lose the softness of their face, and even the litheness of their build during this process, and gain some facial hair.”
Women hitting this age also often complain of losing hair volume, but this is not common to everyone.
One of the most important jobs of oestrogen is to keep young joints greased — women losing this hormone in their 40s, therefore, often complain of joint stiffness, bone and back pain over time, especially if they have a BMI on the higher side.
Women also lose muscle mass and strength by up to 15 per cent during this time, increasing the risk of fractures and osteoporosis.
Other effects of hitting pre-menopause include vision changes and dry eyes, a weak pelvic floor, especially for women who have given birth, sleep challenges, fatigue and consequent brain fog.
These, however, are only the tip of the proverbial iceberg of perimenopause.
Oestrogen provides a buffer against cardiovascular ageing and even insulin sensitivity. A decrease in the hormone could therefore render women more vulnerable to cardiovascular risks and strokes, and increase the risks of Type 2 diabetes. 
Wild fluctuations of hormones before the last period may cause irregular periods, hot flashes and night sweats, vaginal dryness, and wild mood swings in women.
“One of the reasons women dread menopause is because they feel that this would mean the end of sexual desire and physical love, but this is far from the truth,” shares Azmiri. “In fact, libido remains unchanged and sexual relations can continue well into menopause.”
Vaginal dryness may be an issue during this time, but lubricants can help make things better. While these are all intimidating factors to consider, not every woman goes through all these factors, and definitely not all at once.
“Oftentimes, women find themselves dealing with teenage children in their 40s, or ailing parents,” confides Azmiri. “These are stressors which may manifest themselves in the form of aches and pains. Most doctors group these ailments under menopause, making it a villainous stage in women’s lives.”
However, there are several ways in which a woman can combat the negative effects of perimenopause in her 40s. She can choose to switch to a healthy lifestyle, incorporating a balanced diet, for instance.
A dietician will be especially beneficial here, as they can chalk out a phytoestrogen-rich diet including foods like flaxseeds, soy, and lentils, balance blood sugar levels, and order a reduction in nicotine, caffeine, and alcoholic beverages.
Women can also take up regular exercise, leaving behind a sedentary way of life, and practice stress management techniques such as yoga or meditation. A good sleep hygiene, such as a solid eight-hour shut-eye and a no-screens rule an hour before bedtime, can help counter fatigue and brain fog.
More than anything else, having a good sense of awareness of what is going on in your body means that half the battle is already won. Knowing and expecting, and to some extent perhaps even combating the signs of perimenopause, can make your 40s much less daunting, allowing you to embrace this milestone age as a special number, not a dreaded one.

Investi­gators and intelligence agencies are hunting for facilitators and support networks behind the attack, which saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage.
Questioned about the progress of the investigation and whether any evidence had come to the fore about the assailants being Afghan citizens, IG Hameed said: “We are saying this because, based on the evidence so far, when someone does not have a citizenship record, they are assumed to be Afghan or something similar.”
He confirmed that authorities had identified the location where the terrorists spent the night before attacking the FC Headquarters. However, he added that no facilitators had been arrested so far.
IG Hameed added that the CCTV footage showing their arrival was obtained and the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) was working to verify their identities.
The KP police chief elaborated that the authorities were also determining the route the terrorists used to enter Peshawar.
 


He further said that the terrorists’ motorcycle was seized and fingerprints taken from the vehicle were now part of the ongoing forensic investigation.
IG Hameed highlighted that recent measures taken by the KP Police had significantly reduced terrorist incidents, and the provincial police force was being equipped with weapons, modern technology, including anti-drone systems, and bulletproof jackets and vehicles for officials and police stations.
He praised the bravery of the KP Police, noting that despite operating in a stressful environment, the force continued to make sacrifices for peace in the region.</p><small>2025-11-25 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635486-cjcsc-gen-sahir-pays-farewell-to-munir' target='_blank'><strong>CJCSC Gen Sahir pays farewell to Field Marshal Munir: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The statement by the head of the military’s media wing came hours after the Afghan Taliban spokesperson accused Pakistan of attacks in Khost, Kunar and Paktika provinces.
According to state broadcaster Pakistan TV, the military spokesperson refuted the claims of conducting strikes inside Afghanistan. “Pakistan Army has not attacked civilians inside Afghanistan,” it quoted him as saying.
 






“Whenever Pakistan attacks someone, it announces it,” he said, according to local media.
“In our view, there are no good and bad Taliban,” he said, adding that there was “no distinction” between terrorists.
“The Taliban government should make decisions as a state, not as non-state actors,” said Gen Chaudhry. He also wondered how long the current set-up in Afghanistan would remain an interim one.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
Last week, the Foreign Office said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.
Gen Faiz court martial proceedings
The military spokesperson also addressed the court martial proceedings against former intelligence chief Gen (r) Faiz Hameed. “The trial is a legal matter; there should be no speculation about it. There will be an immediate announcement when the matter reaches its final conclusion.”
Gen Hameed has been in custody since August 2024 and the military annou­nced the initiation of court martial proceedings on Aug 12, 2024, on the charges of violating the Army Act and misconduct filed by the owner of a private housing society.
The army said in December 2024 that he was indicted by a military court on three counts — engaging in political activities, violating anti-espionage laws, and abusing his authority.
The case against Gen Hameed was made following a Supreme Court ruling in November 2023, which directed petitioner Moeez Ahmed Khan, owner of Islamabad’s Top City housing society, to pursue grievances thro­ugh appropriate channels, including the Ministry of Defence.
Khan had alleged that a May 12, 2017, raid on his property by Pakistan Rangers and Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) officials resulted in the seizure of valuables, including gold, diamonds, and cash, under the pretext of a counter-terrorism operation. This is one of the most high-profile court martial cases in Pakistan Army’s history, as Gen Hameed is the second three-star general and the first former ISI chief to face such proceedings.
Under military laws, an indictment follows a court of inquiry and a summary of evidence, which form the basis for framing cha­rges. Following his indictment, Gen Hameed will be allowed to hire legal representation.

Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Tarar detailed the correspondence between these four facilitators and TTP commanders in Afghanistan. Displaying their pictures, Tarar identified them as the suicide bomber’s handler Sajidullah alias Sheena, Kamran Khan, Muhammad Zali and Shah Munir.
The minister said Mehsud “planned this attack through his commander Daadullah”, whom Sajidullah met in 2023, 2024 and in August 2025 as well. He added that Daadullah and Sajidullah “remained in touch through an app”.
 


Tarar identified Daadullah as a resident of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur, adding that he was currently in Afghanistan.
He also played a video statement of the man he identified as Sajidullah, who the minister said arranged the suicide jacket and brought the bomber, Usman Shinwari, to the site of the attack.
“He was planning this incident in collaboration with Noor Wali Mehsud’s commander Daadullah. Their target was to carry out such an act in either Rawalpindi or Islamabad,” Tarar said, highlighting that the country evaded a “major loss”.
The minister said Sajidullah joined the TTP in 2015 and received training in various TTP camps across Afghanistan. He also visited the neighbouring country’s Jalalabad city in 2024.
During his 2024 visit, Sajidullah met Daadullah to “plan this suicide bombing and hired two more people upon his return”, who were Zali and Khan.
Then, in August 2025, Sajidullah and Zali visited Afghanistan together, Tarar said. According to the minister, they first met TTP militant Abdullah Jan alias Abu Hamza in Shigal district, where they stayed overnight, then met Daadullah in Kabul’s Arzan Qimat neighbourhood.
“Daadullah conveyed the orders of Noor Wali Mehsud to them, that they have to carry out a suicide bombing in the areas of Rawalpindi, Islamabad,” Tarar said.
“Once back in Pakistan, Sajidullah met with Shinwari, the suicide bomber,” who Tarar said was a resident of Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province.
 
 

Detailing the correspondence between Sajidullah and Shinwari, the information minister said they scouted multiple locations but “failed to reach their target” due to security.
“There is no doubt in the fact that all of this was orchestrated from Afghanistan. Daadullah is present in Afghanistan, [and] the main perpetrator, named Sajidullah, was also trained in Afghanistan.”
Tarar further said that the bomber was also a resident of Afghanistan.
After playing Sajidullah’s video statement, Tarar asserted, “This is very clear-cut evidence that the TTA (Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan) and the TTP jointly did this.”
The minister said the four men arrested had “some role in some capacity in the suicide bombing”. He noted that the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and the Intelligence Bureau (ID) had arrested them within 48 hours of the incident during a joint operation.
He said a “huge racket” had been uncovered through the arrests of these four terrorists, terming it a huge success for the CTD and the IB.
The PML-N leader affirmed that security and law enforcement agencies, along with the armed forces, were fully active to eliminate terrorism.
Alleged terrorist details facilitating attack
In the video statement played during the press conference, the man identified as Sajidullah said he went to Afghanistan in 2016, met Abu Hamza and returned to Pakistan after receiving training for a month.
Sajidullah said he met with Abu Hamza during his 2023 visit to Kunar, and then days later, went to Daadullah’s hideout, who “brainwashed and forced me to take an oath of allegiance”.
“Six months ago, Daadullah contacted us and told us to come to Afghanistan and told me to bring my friend along as well,“he said, adding that subsequently, he and Zali headed to Jalalabad.
They met with Daadullah at his residence, where the TTP commander tasked them with transporting the suicide jacket provided by him to the bomber, according to Sajidullah’s account.
“We came to Peshawar and went to Akhun Baba Graveyard,” Sajidullah said, adding that he picked the jacket from there and entrusted it to Munir to “keep it safe”.
 
 

A few days later, Sajidullah continued, he was informed that a man from Afghanistan named Usman would contact him. “He stayed with me for one to two days. I said he was a guest when my family members asked about him,” Sajidullah said, adding that he later had Munir provide shelter to Usman.
However, Munir also said he could not leave Usman alone with his children, and therefore, Munir’s “cousin” Zali rented a room from a man named Muhammad Ali, Sajidullah added.
He further said he told the suicide bomber to arrange his accommodation on his own after 15 to 25 days had passed. Then, on November 11, the day of the blast, Sajidullah said he picked up the jacket from Munir, and both of them, along with Zali, “made [Usman] wear the jacket”.</p><small>2025-11-25 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25143228f7852eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957278/dar-meets-irans-security-chief-reaffirms-commitment-to-enhancing-cooperation-on-regional-international-issues' target='_blank'><strong>Dar meets Iran’s security chief, reaffirms commitment to enhancing cooperation on regional, international issues</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar met Ali Lari­ja­­ni, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Secu­ri­­ty Council, on Tuesday, with the two sides reaffirming their commitment to “enhancing cooperation on regional and international issues of mutual interest”, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
The two also agreed to “deepening bilateral ties in diverse areas” between Islamabad and Tehran, the FO posted on social media platform X.
 






Lari­ja­­ni reached Pakistan on Monday and is expected to meet Pakistan’s political and military leadership during the visit.
His trip follows Speaker of Iranian Parliament Bagher Ghalibaf’s visit to Islamabad last month, marking the second high-level Iranian delegation to Pakistan in weeks.
In a post on X before landing in Pakistan, Larijani said: “Iran and Pakistan are two important and influential countries in ensuring lasting security in the region, and we always pay close attention to the brotherly relations between the countries of the region.”
He also said that “Iranians will never forget” the support extended to them by the people of Pakistan during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.
Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Reza Amiri Moghaddam termed the visit “unprecedented” in a post on X.
“This historic milestone marks a pivotal moment at which the already solidified and time-tested relations between our two brotherly nations are set to enter another strategic phase.
“In light of the rapidly evolving global landscape and the emerging dynamics within our regional ecosystem, the need to further strategise and elevate our bilateral relations has become more imperative than ever — an objective that will be meaningfully advanced through this significant visit,” he added.
 






In August, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian had also visited Pakistan. Pezeshkian and his delegation had met the top civilian and military leaders of the country, and among the matters discussed during the visit was Israel’s onslaught in Gaza.
 
 

Pezeshkian had expressed his desire to raise bilateral trade to $10bn, while the need to jointly combat terrorism, especially along the border in Balochistan, was also discussed.
The Iranians had further sought to join Pakistan and China in expanding regional trade as part of the Silk Road initiative. At least 12 memoranda of understanding and deals were signed covering various sectors.
In October, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had visited Iran. He had also met Pezeshkian during the visit.</p><small>2025-11-25 10:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/250841314285aa2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957247/pakistan-carried-out-strikes-in-afghanistan-claims-taliban-spokesman' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan carried out strikes in Afghanistan, claims Taliban spokesman</strong></a><br><p>Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, claimed on Tuesday that Pakistan had carried out overnight strikes in the neighbouring country.
In a post on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces.
No official statement has been issued by Pakistan thus far.
The strike was reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
Last week, the Foreign Office (FO) said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.</p><small>2025-11-25 10:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635428-islamabad-suicide-attack-plotted-by-ttp-chief-in-afghanistan-info-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad suicide attack plotted by TTP chief in Afghanistan: info minister</strong></a><br><p>

He also alleged that he was not given enough time to prepare for the case, which was registered by the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA).
Mazari and Chattha have been accused of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country in the case.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Mohammed Afzal Majoka resumed proceedings in the case in Islamabad today, where court-appointed defence counsel Advocate Shakeel Jatt alleged he was approached at around 4pm yesterday to represent Imaan and Chattha.
He said that he had not been provided the case file to prepare in time.
Moreover, he said that he had “received 15 questions with the instructions that he should ask them during today’s cross-examination”, without giving any specific details.
Addressing Judge Majoka, he said he was told, “You have to do this tomorrow.”
The lawyer said he could not argue the case under such circumstances.
“I am in favour of a fair trial. I cannot ask questions that are dictated [to me]. My conscience does not allow this,” he said, stressing that every accused person had the right to a fair and impartial trial under the Constitution.
Advocate Jatt sought adequate time from the court to prepare before cross-examining witnesses. He said that without properly studying the case file, he would not be able to fulfil his professional responsibilities.
The judge accepted his request for more time and adjourned the hearing till November 27 (Thursday).
Mazari had previously alleged that the court had “forcibly appointed [a] state defence counsel” for her and Chattha.
Mazari and Chattha were indicted in the case on October 30, a day after the latter was arrested outside the courtroom over non-appearance. Mazari said that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom”.
Speaking to reporters after his release, Chattha had maintained that he had appeared in court five minutes ahead of time for the proceedings on October 29, but the judge had issued an arrest warrant “to his face”.</p><small>2025-11-25 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25123520b13bade.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957265/india-issues-demarche-to-china-after-woman-from-arunachal-detained-mocked-by-shanghai-airport-officials-reports' target='_blank'><strong>India issues demarche to China after woman from Arunachal ‘detained, mocked’ by Shanghai airport officials: reports</strong></a><br><p>India has issued a demarche to China after a woman from Arunachal Pradesh alleged that she was detained at the Shanghai airport by immigration officials for 18 hours, who “mocked” her and said that the territory was not part of India, according to Indian media.
China says Arunachal Pradesh is a part of South Tibet — a claim India has repeatedly dismissed. Beijing has renamed places in the northeastern Himalayan state multiple times, prompting strong reactions from New Delhi.
The woman, named Pema Wangjom Thongdok, said in yesterday’s interview to ANI that she was an Indian citizen residing in the United Kingdom for about 14 years. Thongdok said she was travelling from London to Japan’s Osaka via Shanghai on November 21, when Chinese authorities held her back for 18 hours.
 






Detailing her “very long ordeal”, Thongdok alleged that Chinese immigration officials at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport declared her visa as “not acceptable” and her Indian passport as invalid.
She further said the officials “mocked” her, saying Arunachal Pradesh was not a part of India.
“You’re Chinese, you’re not Indian,” the woman quoted them as saying.
“The airline staff of China Eastern and about two other immigration officers were speaking in their language and saying […] ‘Arunachal’ and laughing and calling it ‘China, not India’,” Thongdok told ANI, describing the immigration and airline staff’s behaviour as “very humiliating [and] questionable”.
Frustrated by their conduct, she reached out to the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing, resulting in officials intervening to help her leave the country.
“We are part of India … We speak ‘shuddh Hindi’, we don’t understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian,” Thongdok told ANI.
 


“They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh, which they claimed is Chinese territory,” Thongdok had said on social media platform X on November 23 (Sunday), referring to Chinese immigration officials and China Eastern Airlines’ staff.
 






On Monday, The Print quoted a source as saying that a “strong démarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place”.
“Our consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally and extended the fullest assistance to the stranded passenger,” the source added, terming Thongdok’s detention based on “ludicrous grounds”.
“Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory, and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports,“ they added, according to the publication.
Other Indian publications, including Press Trust of India, Hindustan Times, The Wire and ANI, also reported the same, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Following the incident, Thongdok wrote to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the foreign secretary, asking them to ensure that any Indian citizen does not face such a situation in the future, The Statesman reported.
The incident comes as both China and India, for the past year, have been seeking to put aside differences lingering since their 2020 border standoff.
Sources in India’s MEA, as per The Hindu, said that at a time when both sides were working to improve ties, such actions by the Chinese side introduced unnecessary obstructions to the process.</p><small>2025-11-25 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2512211351fd6b2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957267/pakistan-tennis-icon-aisam-qureshi-calls-time-on-illustrious-career' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan tennis icon Aisam Qureshi calls time on illustrious career</strong></a><br><p>The next chapter in Pakistani tennis began with the close of another as top-ranked player Aisamul Haq Qureshi announced his retirement from professional tennis at the opening ceremony of the ATP Challenger Pakistan in Islamabad on Monday night.
Bringing the international event to home soil was a dream come true, Aisam, who is president of the Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF), said at a press conference for the event earlier this month.
“I don’t know if my tears are for my career or hosting the challenger cup as president,” the visibly emotional 45-year-old joked as he addressed the audience on a chilly evening.
PTF described his retirement as the “conclusion of an era”.
“His legacy will continue to inspire upcoming players and contribute to the growth and recognition of tennis across the nation,” the federation said in a post on social media.

The right-hander turned pro in 1998 and was the only Pakistani tennis player to have played in a Grand Slam final at the 2010 US Open in both the men’s and mixed doubles.
Aisam achieved a career-high singles ranking of 125 in December 2007, and a doubles ranking of 8 in June 2011 with recently-retired partner Rohan Bopanna of India, according to the ATP Tour, who honoured Aisam and seven other retired stars at the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin earlier this month.
“Obviously it’s an amazing feeling [to be here],” said the former Top 10 star, who is one of only four men to win the ATP’s Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award twice.
“Growing up as a Pakistani, a young kid, I never thought I would have such a long career to start with. Playing with the top guys, at the top tournaments, and qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals also four times. It’s been amazing, and this is like a full circle,“ Aisam had said.
“The ATP was like a second family to me. I’ve had some ups, I’ve had some downs, but overall, I think it was a mutual friendship and trust that I gathered the most.”
 






The tennis star made his final tour-level appearance in a Davis Cup tie in Paraguay in September. He won 18 tour-level doubles crowns, including two ATP Masters 1000 titles.
He is also the most successful Davis Cup player in Pakistan’s history, with the team most notably reaching the World Group play-offs in 2005.
Aisam’s efforts on the humanitarian front were recognised as he and partner Bopanna were honoured with a Peace and Sport award for their ‘Stop War Start Tennis’ campaign, with the goal of playing a match on the Pakistan-India border.
He is also the recipient of the Pride of Pakistan award in 2004 and the Salam Pakistan Youth Award in 2007.</p><small>2025-11-25 08:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25115905e067097.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957266/trump-signs-order-for-initiating-process-of-labelling-muslim-brotherhood-chapters-as-terrorist-organisations' target='_blank'><strong>Trump signs order for initiating process of labelling Muslim Brotherhood chapters as terrorist organisations</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Monday evening, directing agencies to initiate the formal process for designating certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organisations.
The Muslim Brotherhood is already outlawed as a terrorist group in some countries, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. More recently, Jordan banned it in April of this year.
Signed at the White House on November 24, the order specifically mentioned its chapters in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt.
It stated that it “sets in motion a process by which certain chapters or other subdivisions of the Muslim Brotherhood shall be considered for designation” as both foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs) and specially designated global terrorists (SDGTs) under US counterterrorism laws.
 






The directive described the Brotherhood as having developed into a “transnational network” since its founding in Egypt in 1928, with chapters across the Middle East that, according to the order, “engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilisation campaigns” that harm their regions, US citizens, and American interests.
The order highlighted activities attributed to Brotherhood chapters in Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt.
It cited the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which led to Tel Aviv’s relentless military campaign in the Palestinian enclave, stating that the Lebanese chapter’s military wing “joined Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian factions to launch multiple rocket attacks against both civilian and military targets within Israel”.
The White House document further noted that “a senior leader of the Egyptian chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood … called for violent attacks against US partners and interests”.
It added that the Jordanian chapter’s leaders “have long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas”.
“It is the policy of the US to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the capabilities and operations” of chapters that may be designated under this process, the order said.
It also instructed agencies to act to “deprive those chapters of resources, and thereby end any threat” they posed to US nationals and national security.
Implementation timeline
The executive order also established a clear timeline. Within 30 days, the secretaries of State and Treasury must submit a joint report evaluating which chapters should be designated.
After that, the order directed that the relevant department must, within 45 days, take “all appropriate action” to complete the designations under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood has been the subject of long-running debate within US policymaking circles.
 
 

Some chapters have functioned as political parties participating in elections, while others have been accused by regional governments of supporting militant groups.
Past US administrations resisted designating the organisation outright, citing its diverse branches and concerns over destabilising political consequences.
Trump’s order marks the most detailed administrative mechanism yet to evaluate specific national chapters individually rather than treating the Brotherhood as a monolithic entity.
Last week, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is also a Republican like Trump, had designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation at the state level.</p><small>2025-11-25 08:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25102921c42777b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957260/pindi-police-say-3-arrested-after-video-of-girls-hair-being-forcibly-cut-goes-viral-on-social-media' target='_blank'><strong>Pindi police say 3 arrested after video of girl’s hair being forcibly cut goes viral on social media</strong></a><br><p>Rawalpindi police have stated that three suspects have been arrested after a harrowing video of a girl’s hair being forcibly cut went viral on social media.
The video, which has been making the rounds on social media since Tuesday, shows a man standing over what appears to be a young girl and cutting her hair with a pair of scissors while others in the background watch.
Subsequently, another video also surfaced on social media, purportedly of the victim, in which she alleged that the incident occurred one-and-a-half months ago in Rawalpindi’s Christian Colony. She also alleged that she was beaten and threatened, adding that four men were involved in the incident.
In a statement early on Tuesday, Rawalpindi police commented on the incident. The statement referred to the victim as a “girl”.
“A video of a girl being beaten and her hair being cut has come forward, after which a video statement also came forward,” the statement said.
The incident took place in Rawalpindi and Islamabad a month and a half ago, the statement said, adding that it was not reported to the police earlier.
It went on to say that the Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Hamdani had taken notice of the incident, adding that police had gotten in touch with the girl in the video.
“Legal action is being taken at her request at the Naseerabad Police Station,” it said.
“Three accused have been taken into custody in light of the victim’s statement,” the statement added.
It said that crimes pertaining to violence, coercion and exploitation of women would not be tolerated.
“All the accused involved in the incident will be arrested and punished to the fullest extent of the law,” the statement quoted the Rawalpindi CPO as saying.
 






A first information report (FIR) of the incident has been registered under Sections 337V (intentional uprooting of hair) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered on behalf of Duty Foot Constable (DFC) Asad Hussain at the Naseerabad police station in the early hours of Tuesday against four named and “a few other” unidentified suspects.
It said that “a video went viral on social media, including on Facebook, in which some people can be seen forcibly cutting the hair of a girl”.
Upon further investigation, it was found that the incident had occurred in Christian Colony, the FIR said, adding that the suspects had committed a serious crime by forcibly cutting the girl’s hair and then widely sharing the video on social media.
Last night, Islamabad police also commented on the incident, saying that it had taken place in Rawalpindi and not in the capital’s Lohi Bher area as was being reported.
“Islamabad police have traced the girl and have recorded her statement,” it said. Police further said that they had “conducted raids” and taken those involved into custody.
“However, since the incident took place in Rawalpindi, the suspects are being handed over to the police concerned,” it added.

Last week, Imran’s sisters had camped outside Adiala Jail, where the PTI founder is currently incarcerated, along with other PTI members after being denied a meeting. According to the PTI, Aleema Khan, Dr Uzma Khan and Noreen were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when they were manhandled and “violently detained” by police.
Videos shared by the party on social media platform X showed workers, Aleema and Uzma gathered around Noreen, who appeared visibly shaken. “Those women were dragging [her] on the road,” Aleema said as Noreen’s hands trembled.
In a post on X on Monday, the PTI said Noreen had filed a formal complaint with the Punjab IG over the “brutal assault and unlawful detention of peaceful citizens”.
 






The party also shared the two-page letter, in which Noreen called the incident “deeply disturbing”. She said the violence was “brutal and orchestrated” and was carried out without provocation.
According to her, her and her sisters had for weeks been denied access to see Imran without justification, leading them to “peacefully and democratically protest” over concerns for his condition. She said that they were also accompanied by members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet, lawyers and party workers.
“We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct,” she said.
“Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel,” she said.
“At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries,” she said.
Noreen also recounted that other women were slapped and dragged, and peaceful citizens were rounded up in vans, only to be later abandoned in remote areas in the middle of the night.
“The fact that ministers and elected officials from another federating unit were subjected to this violence further underscores a dangerous erosion of political comity and the misuse of provincial police power to suppress legitimate political expression,” she said.
She said that the police’s conduct was part of a “broader and troubling pattern” of indiscriminate force used against peacefully protesting citizens over three years, reflecting a “troubling impunity”.
Noreen called the Punjab police’s conduct “not only indefensible (but) wholly criminal, illegal, morally reprehensible, and in direct contradiction to the foundational duties of any law enforcement agency in a democratic society”.
She said their actions amounted to actionable criminal offences as they were in breach of the provisions of the Police Order 2002.
She called on the Punjab IG to immediately initiate proceedings against all police personnel who participated in and authorised the incident, or failed to prevent it.
She also requested the preservation and impartial review of “all visual evidence” from the incident and the constitution of an impartial inquiry that treated peaceful citizens “as criminals”.
On November 20, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had also expressed concern and called for an inquiry into the alleged mistreatment of the PTI protesters.
In a post on X, the HRCP had expressed concerns over the reports of Imran’s sisters being “manhandled” and noted that the rights of prisoners’ families to meet their relatives and the right to peaceful assembly are protected under national and international human rights law.
“The HRCP calls for a transparent inquiry and urges authorities to ensure the rights, safety and dignity of all involved are fully respected,” it added.
Subsequently, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter to his counterpart in Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, had also raised concerns over the incident and the obstruction of the incarcerated ex-premier’s visitation rights.</p><small>2025-11-25 07:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635381-pakistan-airspace-clear-as-ethiopian-volcano-ash-moves-towards-india' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan airspace clear as Ethiopian volcano ash moves towards India</strong></a><br><p>

A statement by the ISPR said that security forces conducted the IBO on Monday, based on the reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement said.
It added that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists in the area.
The ISPR also said that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue with full pace to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operation, saying that they were achieving “major successes” against terrorism under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam.
“The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in the war against terrorism,” the PM said. “We are determined to completely eradicate all kinds of terrorism from the country.”
 






Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The latest in the string of terror incidents is a suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary’s (FC) headquarters in Peshawar yesterday morning, in which three FC men were martyred and 12 injured.
The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to the FC headquarters, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage.
The three attackers ostensibly planned to target the FC’s weekly assembly near the main gate on Sonehri Masjid Road, where around 400 personnel had gathered.
According to the state-run APP, initial investigations revealed that all three terrorists involved in the attack were Afghan nationals.</p><small>2025-11-25 05:50</small></div><hr>
