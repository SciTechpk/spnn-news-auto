On Monday night, Canada delivered a verdict that seemed less an embrace of Mark Carney and more a desperate clinging to the idea that someone — anyone — could out-think Donald Trump.
Carney, the rookie Liberal leader once better known for polishing interest rate forecasts than kissing babies, managed the improbable: he steered the battered Liberal Party to a fourth consecutive mandate. If not quite a coronation, it was nonetheless a remarkable reversal of fortune in a political landscape that had seemed destined, mere months ago, to turn Tory blue.
Victory, however, came with an asterisk. The Liberals are perched at 168 seats — enough to govern, but short of the 172 needed for a majority. Carney will lead a minority government, where survival will depend on managing a fractured parliament.
The election, a compressed five-week sprint, had been pitched as an epic duel between Carney’s supposed steadiness and Pierre Poilievre’s populist fervour. In the end, neither man’s vision truly captured Canadian hearts. Instead, it was Donald Trump, Canada’s accidental kingmaker, who overshadowed all.

With a fractured parliament at home and a belligerent Trump abroad, new PM now faces a daunting road ahead

Trump’s incendiary musings about annexation, his tariffs on Canadian goods, and his open contempt for Canadian sovereignty spooked voters more effectively than any Liberal attack ad could. A contest that would have been about housing affordability and carbon taxes turned into a referendum on national survival.
 
 

In an eerie echo of old fears, Carney sounded the alarm across the land: America is trying to break us so they can own us.
The Liberals’ campaign, with Carney at the helm, became less about Trudeau’s legacy and more about existential dread. The message: steady hands were needed to navigate the storm.
It worked — just enough to secure another mandate.
It is tempting to paint Carney as a man forged by the moment. A political outsider, coaxed into leadership by a desperate party. The narrative writes itself, and Carney leaned into it: “My government will work for and with everyone,” he declared early Tuesday morning, promising to heal divisions and govern for all Canadians.
But the shiny technocratic armour came with dents. Throughout the campaign, Carney struggled to reconcile his carefully crafted image of competence with the blood sport of electoral politics. And while voters may have ultimately chosen his brand of managerial steadiness over Poilievre’s ideological fury, it was no sweeping endorsement. The Liberals squeaked past, not soared.
For a man whose career had been built in the vaulted halls of global finance, the House of Commons will feel claustrophobic.
Meanwhile, Pierre Poilievre, who had appeared just months ago to be on the verge of a major breakthrough, faced a significant setback in his own backyard.
Losing ground to Liberal Bruce Fanjoy in Carleton, Poilievre delivered a concession speech with the tone of a politician determined to regroup and re-engage. The Conservatives may have lost the election, but they made tangible gains, particularly in Ontario, where they clawed back blue-collar ridings and suburban belts.
The irony? Poilievre was punished not for fighting Trump, but for not knowing how. His early campaign was a confused mess — one part MAGA cosplay, one part grievance-mongering — while Trump steamrolled his way into the centre of the Canadian electoral conversation.
By the time Poilievre tried to pivot, it was too late.
And then there was Jagmeet Singh — the man who lost not just his party’s relevance but his own seat.
The NDP’s collapse, especially in BC and Atlantic Canada, turned the 2025 election into a two-party race. Singh, ever the optimist, defended his legacy even as he walked off the stage. But there was no mistaking the NDP’s irrelevance; Canada’s progressive heartland shifted, not left or right, but inward — voting for survival in an age of trade wars and nationalist sabre-rattling.
Singh’s resignation was not a shock. It was an inevitability.
Carney now inherits a challenging mandate. His task: to stare down a belligerent US president while holding together a minority parliament that may not share his urgency or priorities.

Domestically, he has pledged to end interprovincial trade barriers, build infrastructure, and craft a unified economic policy. Lofty promises. Delivering them will require dealing with a parliament where support is tenuous, and enemies lie in wait.
Internationally, he must sit across from Donald Trump and navigate a negotiation that often feels more like a hostage situation.
Carney’s much-vaunted technocratic competence may keep the wolves at bay for now. But competence alone rarely stirs lasting loyalty. And as history shows, minority governments in Canada often falter — whether through ambition or inertia.
The Liberals have bought themselves time. How long it lasts, and at what cost, is still to be seen.
In an election shaped by uncertainty and hard choices, Canadians have once again opted for caution over upheaval.
The coming months will test whether this can deliver the stability Canadians hope for.

The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 1,717.35 points, or 1.5 per cent, to stand at 113,154.83 from the last close of 114,872.18 at 9:53am.
At 10:38am, the index declined by by 2,073.42 points, or 1.8pc, from the last close.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the decline to “news of likely attack in next few days”.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “Investors are worried about potential Indian military action against Pakistan, concerns that have intensified following the information minister’s press briefing.”
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, echoed the same sentiments.
He said that the market was under pressure following the information minister’s “statement last night suggesting that India may take military action within the next 24–36 hours”.
“The market in the short term will most likely follow newsflows of Pakistan-India tensions,” he added.
Earlier in the day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the next 24 to 36 hours amid tensions between the two countries after the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir last week that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad, albeit without proof.
On Tuesday, India gave its military “operational freedom” to respond to the Pahalgam attack.
Speaking to the media hours after the development, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”
He said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region”, adding that it was completely “reckless”.
Indian shares flat as HDFC Bank offsets Bajaj Finance losses, Pakistan jitters
Meanwhile, Indian shares were muted as gains in heavyweight HDFC Bank helped offset pressure from tensions with Pakistan, while Bajaj Finance declined despite posting a rise in fourth-quarter profit.
The Nifty 50 was down 0.05pc at 24,324 and the BSE Sensex lost 0.07pc to 80,236.6 as of 10:43am.
Both benchmarks swung between 0.2pc gains and 0.2pc losses in early trade.
“For now, geopolitical tensions (with Pakistan) have overtaken (US) tariffs in investors’ minds,” said Anita Gandhi, founder and head of institutional business at Arihant Capital Markets.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi granted military chiefs freedom to respond to last week’s attack in Kashmir, Reuters reported on Tuesday.
The Nifty volatility index has risen in five of the six sessions since the attack in Kashmir.
Six of the 13 major sectors declined on Wednesday, while the small- and mid-caps fell 0.6pc and 0.1pc, respectively.
Non-bank lender Bajaj Finance fell 5.4pc, leading losses on the Nifty, despite posting a higher quarterly profit, as brokerages flagged weak pre-provision profit and higher credit costs as negatives.

India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan’s political and military leadership have strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
The tensions between the arch-rivals have intensified in the past few days, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Pakistan had reinforced its forces and was ready for any incursion by India, while on the other side, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his military “operational freedom” to act on the Pahalgam attack.
In a televised statement issued hours after Modi’s move, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to carry out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”
He said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region” and it was completely “reckless”.
 


“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,” the minister said, adding: “We have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.”
Being a responsible state, Tarar noted, Pakistan “openheartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation” by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.
“Unfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,” he stressed.
The information minister said the “evasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India’s real motives”.
“Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,” he  added.
Tarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.
“The international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of [an] escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India.”
He reiterated the nation’s resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs.
Meanwhile, as concerns over a potential breakdown of peace grew, shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) slumped by over 2,000 points in intraday trade today.
The April 22 attack killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
In the latest development, the Pakistan Army yesterday shot down two Indian quadcopters after they violated the country’s airspace along the Line of Control (LoC) in two separate areas of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), official sources said.
 
 

The first drone was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops. The second unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in Poonch division’s Satwal sector.
The downing of the drones occurred amid continued exchange of fire along the LoC in Leepa Valley since the night of April 25, breaking a period of relative calm in the region. No casualties were immediately reported.
According to IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Indian cyberattack attempts on the websites of some ministries have been foiled as well.
Also yesterday, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the right to retaliate. He informed the Senate that intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.

India okays ‘operational freedom’ to army amid calls for restraint
A week after the Pahalgam attack, Modi yesterday told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source who was not authorised to speak to the media told AFP.
The government released video images of a stern-faced Modi holding a closed-door meeting with his army and security chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.
Last week, Modi vowed to pursue those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.
“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.
 
 

Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. Analysts say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.
Amid escalating tensions, friendly countries and global powers have urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, advising them to solve the matter through diplomatic engagement.
Last night, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan “as early as today or tomorrow”.
She said the US was reaching out to both parties regarding the Kashmir issue, and is expected to tell both sides not to escalate things any further.
Bruce said that Rubio was also encouraging leaders and foreign ministers from other nations to reach out over the issue.
Following the Pahalgam attack, US President Donald Trump had extended his “full support” to India. He later downplayed the regional tensions, saying the dispute would get “figured out”.
 


Iran has already offered to mediate, and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”. In the past few days, Dar has also spoken to the foreign ministers of China, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary to brief them about Pakistan’s concerns.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint”, with its chief Antonio Guterres yesterday offering “his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”.
In his phone call with the UN chief on Tuesday, PM Shehbaz encouraged him to counsel India to “act responsibly and exercise restraint”.
The worst attack in recent years in occupied Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when a person rammed a car packed with explosives into a security forces convoy, killing 40 and wounding 35.
Indian fighter jets carried out air strikes on Pakistani territory 12 days later. The next day, Pakistan Air Force undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.</p><small>2025-04-30 05:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/3010235758356c1.jpg?r=102435' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907504/oil-falls-3pc-on-weak-demand-outlook' target='_blank'><strong>Oil falls 3pc on weak demand outlook</strong></a><br><p>NEW YORK: Oil prices fell about three per cent to a two-week low on Tuesday as investors braced for Opec+ to boost output and worried US President Donald Trump’s tariffs would hit the global economy and slow demand for the fuel.
Brent crude futures fell by $1.70, or 2.6pc, to $64.16 per barrel at 1:34 p.m. EDT (1734 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude dropped by $1.55, or 2.5pc, to $60.50.
Both benchmarks were on track for their lowest closes since April 10.
Trump’s aggressive tariffs on imports into the US have made it probable the global economy will slip into recession this year, according to a majority of economists in a Reuters poll.
China, hit with the steepest tariffs, has responded with its own levies against US imports, stoking a trade war between the top two oil-consuming nations. Analysts have sharply lowered their oil demand and price forecasts.
“Trade between China and the US has slowed to a semi-embargo type flow. Every day that passes without some kind of deal with any of our significant trade partners brings us one day closer to a global demand destruction situation,” Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho, said in a note.
The US trade deficit in goods widened to a record high in March as businesses ramped up efforts to bring in merchandise ahead of Trump’s sweeping tariffs, suggesting trade was a large drag on economic growth in the first quarter.

• Marco Rubio expected to speak to Indian, Pakistani counterparts today
• Airports operating as usual, authorities say
NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Nar­endra Modi has given his military “operational freedom” to respond to a deadly attack in India-held Kashmir last week, which New Delhi has tri­ed to pin on Pakistan, wit­hout offering any evide­nce to support the claim.
A full week after the Pahalgam attack, which claimed the lives of over two dozen tourists, Modi held a closed-door meeting with the heads of the three armed services, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.
During the meeting, he told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source told AFP.
No further details have been released from the meeting, which was held at the Indian PM’s resident on Tuesday.
It comes a day after Defence Minister Kha­waja Asif warned of a possible Indian incursion, saying that the next few days were crucial and Pakistan was prepared for any eventuality.
Last week, Modi had vowed to pursue those who carried out the attack, as well as those who had supported it.
“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said on Thursday. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.
 
 

Following the high-level meeting, the Indian media began speculating about a “possible response”.
The bellicose statem­e­nts have prompted worr­ies of a rapid spiral into mil­itary action, with several nations, including ne­i­ghbouring China, cal­l­ing for restraint and dialogue.
Late on Tuesday night, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan “as early as today or tomorrow”.
She said the US was reaching out to both parties regarding the Kashmir issue, and is expected to tell both sides not to escalate things any further.
Ms Bruce said that Rubio was also encouraging leaders and foreign ministers from other nations to reach out over the issue.
 


Earlier, UN Secr­e­­tary-General Antonio Gu­t­erres held calls Tues­day with Pakistan’s prime minister and India’s foreign minister to express “deep concern at rising tensions”, his spokesman said.
The United Nations chief “underscored the need to avoid a confrontation that could result in tragic consequences. He offered his good offices to support de-escalation efforts,” spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
 
 

According to the PM Office in Islamabad, during their telephone call, PM Shehbaz rejected the Indian accusations as bas­e­less and categorica­lly rejected any attempt to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam incident.
He reiterated his call for a transparent and neutral investigation into the incident, and expre­ssed serious concerns over India’s attempts to delegitimise the Kashmiri freedom struggle by using the bogey of “terrorism”, as well as its widely documented state-sponsored terrorism in the occupied territory.
He also pointed to India’s weaponisation of the waters of the Indus Basin as being unacceptable as it was the lifeline of around 240 million people.
No airport closures
Amid fears of airspace closures due to rising tensions with India, rumours of a possible closure of airports began circulating on social media on Tuesday night.
However, authorities confirmed that this was not true, and both domestic and international flight operations continued as usual.
For example, a flight from Islamabad to Doha departed on Wednesday at around 12.40am.
 
 

According to flight information at Islamabad International Airport (IIAP), another flight arrived from Sharjah at 11:43pm on Tuesday night.
A senior official at IIAP told Dawn the airport was fully functional for both domestic and international flights, while an official from Lahore airport also confirmed that flight operations were running smoothly.

Addressing a press conference at the bypass, Ka­­rachi Bar Association Pre­sident Amir Nawaz Wara­ich and Sindh High Court Bar Association President Sarfraz Ali Metlo said the decision to end the sit-in was made after receiving assurances from the government and the issuance of an official notification addressing their concerns.
They confirmed that the notification issued by the government incorporated all points raised by the lawyers’ community. Based on this, the lawyers’ committee decided to end the protest, they said, adding that further meetings regarding the canals issue will continue.
The lawyers’ leaders said the government had pledged to provide the ne­­cessary legal documentation by May 7.

Traffic restored on National Highway after protest camps removed

These documents will detail all matters related to the legal and professional rig­hts of lawyers. Following this as­­surance, the lawyers’ committee expressed satisfaction with the outcome.
The lawyers reiterated their commitment to def­ending national interests and pledged that the legal community would maintain an active role in monitoring the government’s implementation of its pro­mises.
 
 

They expres­sed hope that similar issues would not arise in the future and that lawyers’ rights would be fully safeguarded. They descri­bed their movement as a successful struggle ag­­­­a­­i­nst injustices done to Sindh.
The lawyers’ leaders appealed to their colleagues to return to their professional responsibilities, highlighting the importance of unity in resolving national issues through dialogue.
Meanwhile, the process of dismantling protest camps began, and two-way traffic was restored on the National Highway.
Earlier, the Sindh government delegation held talks with the lawyers’ co­­mmittee at the High Court Bar Association office in Sukkur. The delegation was led by Law Minister Zia Lanjar and included District Council Chairman Kumail Haidar Shah, Suk­kur Commissio­ner Fayyaz Abbasi and Deputy Com­missioner M.B. Dharejo.
The lawyers were represented by Amir Nawaz Waraich, Sarfraz Ali Metlo, Qurban Ali Malano and others.
After the meeting, Zia Lanjar and Kumail Shah held a joint press conference. “We came here for negotiations with the lawyers’ committee and appe­aled to our friends to end the sit-in at Babarloi Bypass,” Mr Lanjar said.

The court announced the discharge of 11 individuals, including Mr Ash­raf, in the long-running Karkey Ship Rental Power reference, where the Nat­ional Accountability Bur­eau had alleged corruption amounting to Rs22 billion.
The Turkish energy com­pany involved, Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uret­­im A.S., had also filed a $1.2bn arbitration claim against Pakistan at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The claim was later withdrawn, reportedly following backchannel negotiations facilitated by the Pakistani government.
In a second reference concerning the Bakhi Power Project in Sheikhu­pura, the court discharged six more individuals, in­­c­luding a former chairman of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda).
Separately, in the Sha­rqpur Power Project reference, the court acquitted all accused, effectively closing proceedings in all three major cases.
The Rental Power Pro­jects were introduced during the PPP’s tenure to ad­­dress the chronic power shortages plaguing the co­­untry. However, the initiative was marred by widespread allegations of corruption, inefficiency and lack of transparency.

The first drone was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops.
The second unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in the Satwal sector of Poonch division.
Security sources said the swift action by the Pakistan Army foiled the enemy’s nefarious attempt at spying and once again demonstrated the force’s vigilance, professionalism, and combat readiness.
“The Pakistan Army is fully prepared to respond promptly and effectively to any aggression by the enemy,” a military source said.

Troops continue to trade fire in Leepa Valley

The downing of the drones occurred amid continued exchange of fire along the LoC in Leepa Valley since Friday night, breaking a period of relative calm in the region.
The Indian army, which often stokes tensions under the BJP government, claimed that its troops and Pakistani forces had exchanged fire overnight. While the Pakistan Army did not release a formal statement, military sources confirmed that Pakistani troops were responding to Indian shelling.
 
 

A video clip shared by military sources showed two Indian posts being precisely targeted by Pakistani forces in the Leepa sector. No casualties were immediately reported.
Tuesday’s incidents add to a string of similar aerial violations by Indian surveillance drones over the years, most of which have been swiftly countered by Pakistani forces.
In 2020 alone, three Indian quadcopters were downed after intruding into Pakistani territory. On May 29, a drone was shot in the Nekrun sector of Neelum Valley after crossing 700 metres from India’s Kanzalwan sector.
Just two days earlier, another was intercepted in the Rakhchikri sector of Poonch district after breaching airspace by 650 metres. On April 9 the same year, a drone was destroyed in Sankh sector of Haveli district after intruding 600 metres.

The terrorist attack in Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir and the massacre of some two dozen tourists seem to have provided the excuse the Modi government has been looking for to escalate its warmongering. Jingoism has reached new heights. Rational voices are being drowned in a cacophony of insanity. The Line of Control is already heating up with the exchange of fire between Indian and Pakistani troops.
New Delhi is building a case for its aggression by trying to blame Pakistan for the Pahalgam terrorist attack. But it has failed to substantiate its allegation. The major reason for India’s vehemence is that the terror attack has shattered the narrative that the situation in occupied Kashmir is completely normal and that the people have accepted New Delhi’s decision to abrogate the held territory’s autonomous status. The Modi government is not willing to accept its own intelligence failure.
 
 

Some Indian analysts say that such a daring attack in one of the most protected areas could not be possible without local support for the militants. The fact is that even the use of brute force has failed to crush the Kashmiris’ struggle for their right of self-determination. According to the New York Times, “India has not officially identified any group as having carried out the massacre, and it has publicly presented little evidence to support its claim that Pakistan was behind it.”
While Indian officials maintain that their investigation is still continuing, the Modi government has already implicated Pakistan in the terrorist attack.
To back their assertion, according to international media reports citing officials, “In the briefings to diplomats at the foreign ministry, Indian officials have described Pakistan’s past patterns of support for terrorist groups… .” Interestingly, within hours of the terrorist attack, New Delhi announced a series of punitive actions against Pakistan. While addressing an election campaign in Bihar, the Indian prime minster warned of “unimaginable punishment for the attackers and their backers”.

Indian leaders in their hubris seem to forget the perils of military escalation.

It’s apparent that the Modi government’s war cry against Pakistan is an attempt to divert the world’s attention from its own failure in the occupied territory. There are strong indications that India plans to launch military strikes on multiple targets despite the absence of any evidence of Pakistan being linked to the latest terrorist attack.
 
 

Even a limited military strike by India could lead to a wider conflagration. The Indian calculation that military actions against Pakistan could be kept below the nuclear threshold is fallacious. It would be an extremely dangerous escalation in one of the world’s most volatile regions. The two South Asian nations have been on the brink of conflict many times previously. But the situation today appears to be far more serious with the cessation of all diplomatic channels between the two countries.
India’s decision to unilaterally suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, whic has survived three wars between the two countries, is ominous. Although it may not be possible to block the water flow, Pakistan sees India’s reckless action as a “declaration of war”. Islamabad has announced its own retaliatory actions.
New Delhi seems to have forgotten the lesson of its 2019 air incursion and Pakistan’s swift response that downed an Indian fighter plane. It was American diplomatic intervention that prevented the further escalation of a situation that could have gone completely out of control, with disastrous consequences for regional peace. Indian leaders in their hubris seem to forget the perils of military escalation in a highly combustible environment. The belief that war can produce quick results is extremely dangerous. It’s much easier to start a war than to end it. However powerful a country may be, it cannot command the outcome.
There are so many lessons to be learnt from various wars in recent history, which ended in humiliation even for the most powerful countries. One cannot but agree with the words of an international diplomat that “the more the conflict goes on, the more difficult it will be to have a diplomatic solution”.
The illusion of achieving quick military success often leads to endless quagmires. It is particularly pertinent in the India-Pakistan case. The two countries have been locked in a forever war — overt as well as covert. They have long been blaming each other of fighting a proxy war. The slogans of punishing Pakistan or punishing India only close the door for the resolution of outstanding issues.
 
 

What happened in Pahalgam must be condemned, but the tragedy should not be used for warmongering. There is also a lesson for Pakistan, where, too, there is no shortage of warmongers flaunting the country’s nuclear capability or making some other irresponsible remarks, as the defence minister did. It’s not in our interest to exacerbate the situation. There is a need to adopt a more rational approach even in the face of provocation. There is a need to step back from the brink.
The outcome of war is always uncertain, and fighting often produces unintended consequences. There is a tendency for wars to expand, become costlier and last longer than expected. The breakdown of diplomatic ties between India and Pakistan has certainly made communication more difficult, but there are other international channels that should be used to bring down the temperature and create an atmosphere for dialogue.
In 2002, there was imminent threat of a full-fledged war between the two countries, but sanity prevailed. Not only was war prevented, but a more substantive peace process between India and Pakistan was also witnessed. Unfortunately, the war hysteria orchestrated by the ultranationalist Modi government has closed all avenues for negotiations.
India is under the illusion that it has the military superiority to dismantle Pakistan. New Delhi has chosen this time to escalate matters when the world is preoccupied with other major conflicts. But it must understand that the flames of war could also cost India dearly.

Barrister Aqeel Malik, the minister of state for Law and Justice, told Reuters that the government was working on plans for at least three different legal options, including raising the issue at the World Bank, which is the treaty’s facilitator.
It is also considering taking action at the Permanent Court of Arbitration or at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where it could argue that India has violated the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, he said.
“Legal strategy consultations are almost complete,” Barrister Aqeel said, adding that a decision on which cases to pursue would be made “soon”, and would likely include pursuing more than one avenue.

Barrister Aqeel says issue will be taken up on multiple fronts; SCBA forms body to provide legal assistance in the matter

Indian officials did not immediately respond to a Reuters request seeking comment.
 
 

New Delhi had last week held the World Bank-mediated Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 in abeyance after an attack in the Pahalgam tourist resort in occupied Kashmir, saying the suspension would last until “Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”.
Islamabad flatly denies any involvement in the attack, and in response to New Delhi’s actions, also suspended all trade and closed its airspace to Indian airlines.
Barrister Aqeel added that a fourth diplomatic option that Islamabad was considering was to raise the issue at the United Nations Security Council.
“All the options are on the table and we are pursuing all appropriate and competent forums to approach,” he told Reuters.
“The treaty cannot be suspended unilaterally and cannot be held in abeyance, there is no provision within the treaty,” said Malik.
Government officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately because the treaty has allowed it to only build hydropower plants without significant storage or dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan.
But things could start changing in a few months and farmers, already hit by climate-change related water shortages, have raised concerns.
SCBA body to assist govt
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has constituted a committee to provide legal assistance to the federal government to help raise the issue of Indus Water Treaty of 1960 at appropriate forums.
The committee will be chaired by its president along with SCBA Secretary Salman Mansoor, Balochistan High Court Bar Association President Mir Attaullah Langove, Sindh High Court Bar Association President Barrister Sarfraz Metlo, as well as Barrister M.H. Subhani and Hafiz Ahsan Khokhar.
In a statement, the country’s apex body of lawyers said it remains steadfast in its role as a watchdog for the protection of fundamental rights, adherence to international treaties and the preservation of national dignity and sovereignty.
 
 

Beyond being a formal accord, the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 is essential to Pakistan’s very existence and prosperity.
The treaty, which was mediated by the World Bank, expressly asserts that none of its signatories can unilaterally terminate, withdraw from, or hold it in abeyance, the statement said.
Yet, India has suspended this very treaty in contravention of international laws, the statement said, adding that the association viewed the unilateral suspension of the treaty as an unnecessary move, aimed at disrupting the downstream water flow.

In an official statement issued on Tuesday, the Pakistan High Commission condemned the latest attack, which took place at approximately 5:18am on April 27.
The assailant, identified by British police as Ankit Love, reportedly hurled stones and splashed saffron paint on the outer wall of the High Commission, shattering several windows and staining the building’s nameplate. He was apprehended shortly after the incident by the Metropolitan Police.
The High Commission linked the act of vandalism to a larger, more aggressive protest that occurred days earlier on April 25, involving members of the Indian and British Indian community.

UK minister calls for calm among diaspora communities

Protesters shouted anti-Pakistan and Islamophobic slogans, and clashed with law enforcers.
 
 

“We expect that the British law enforcement agencies would prosecute Ankit, as well as the raucous protesters detained on Friday, in accordance with the relevant British laws,” the statement said.
Expressing concern over the escalating hostility, the statement from the mission reminded the UK government of its obligations under the Vienna Convention to protect diplomatic missions. It also reiterated its demand for enhanced security at Pakistani diplomatic posts across the UK.
“This is not the first incident where the High Commission of Pakistan or our Consulates in the United Kingdom have been attacked,” the statement read.
The Pakistan High Commission confirmed it is in contact with British police to obtain further details about Ankit Love, whose nationality has not yet been disclosed.
Reuters adds: Meanwhile, UK Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer has called for calm between Indian and Pakistani communities, after lawmakers voiced concerns that tensions over the Pahalgam attack in India-held Kashmir could spill into the diaspora.
“These issues have long been discussed with passion on British streets  and we call on sides, all community leaders, all involved to call for  calm at a time of tension in the region,” Hamish  Falconer told parliament.
Falconer appeared in parliament to answer an urgent question  on the situation, where lawmakers raised concerns about media reports of  ill-tempered protests outside India and Pakistan’s high commissions in London.
The British government’s long-standing position is that India and Pakistan are responsible for finding a solution to the situation in held Kashmir that takes into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people, he told parliament.

• PPP lawmaker endorses call for Imran’s participation in proposed multi-party moot
ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the right to retaliate, as he concluded his speech in the Senate on the recent tensions with India and diplomatic overtures deployed by Islamabad to contest New Delhi’s allegations in light of the Pahalgam attack.
The Senate session also witnessed a call by PPP lawmaker Syed Masroor Ahsan, who endorsed the idea floated by the PTI seeking the involvement of PTI chief Imran Khan in the multi-party conference to send a “message of unity” in the country.
The idea initially floated by PTI’s Ali Zafar was recalled by PTI’s Aon Abbas in his speech on Tuesday, in which he said PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, and PTI founder Imran Khan should participate in the moot to send a strong message.
 
 

PPP’s Masroor Ahsan, while endorsing the idea, observed that the government should show flexibility and listen to the opposition. “Both sides need to set aside egos,” he remarked. Earlier, at least three senators, Allama Nasir Abbas, Gurdeep Singh and Dost Muhammad, called for the release of Imran Khan from the Adiala jail.
However, PML-N Senator Nasir Butt said Imran Khan would have to face the law and prove his innocence to secure his freedom.
Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI chided former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for his purported silence over the Pahalgam attack and demanded that the political leadership make strong statements over the issue.
Stern response
Meanwhile, FM Ishaq Dar said Pakis­tan would pay back India in the same coin, but it would not initiate an attack.
Sharing details of Pakistan’s diplomatic overtures following the escalation in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, he said foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary have been taken on board about Pakistan’s concerns.
He said he also spoke directly to the prime minister of Qatar. Mr Dar praised China and Turkiye for expressing clear support for Pakistan in the wake of the crisis.
“I walked them through what happened — India’s psyche, its history and our concerns about what intentions it may have in light of that history,” he told the House. Mr Dar said intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.

Referring to the 2019 Pulwama attack that killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel and was blamed on a Pakistan-based militant group, the deputy prime minister noted that New Delhi had used the incident as a pretext to revoke Article 370 of its constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.
The region was subsequently absorbed into India’s union territory framework, a move Pakistan has repeatedly condemned. Ishaq Dar also said that India had been attempting to alter the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which determined the water-sharing mechanism between both countries, for the past two years, citing changing circumstances.
“I have my doubts, much like other people, that this drama was staged to suspend this treaty,” he said while referring to the Pahalgam attack. He said there was no evidence that it was a false-flag operation. “What we do say with full confidence is that Pakistan has nothing to do with this [attack].”
According to Mr Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered an independent investigation into the Pahalgam attack fully knowing that Pakistan had nothing to do with it. He also made it clear that any meddling with Pakistani waters by India will not be tolerated at any cost and will be taken as an act of war.
Meanwhile, the House unanimously passed “The Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention (Implementation) Bill, 2025” and “The National Commission for Minorities’ Rights Bill 2025 brought before it as a supplementary agenda.

• Says not a single shred of evidence shared by New Delhi to substantiate allegations against Islamabad
• Information minister claims India ‘planning something’ over next 24-36 hours
• Pakistan tells UN it has evidence of regional adversaries’ involvement in Jaffar Express incident
ISLAMABAD: Military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tues­day accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
Lt Gen Chaudhry was sp­e­aking at a press conference convened to show “how India is executing” terrorism inside Pakistan and said terrorism was the “basic thing” in the ongoing tense phase of ties bet­ween the neighbours. Pak­is­tan and India downgra­d­ed ties after tensions spi­ked in light of the April 22 att­ack in Pahalgam, in which 26 people were killed.
“It has been seven days since the Pahalgam att­ack, yet not a single shred of evidence has been provided to substantiate the baseless allegations levelled against Pakistan,” Gen Chaudhry said.
Based on intelligence ava­ilable with the Pakis­tani security agencies, he claimed India had activa­ted its terror networks to carry out attacks inside Pakistan.

“…they tasked all their assets, terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Kha­w­arij (the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan) and the ind­e­pen­dent terrorist cell like one presented today to inc­r­ease their activity,” he said.
He specifically cited the killing of 54 TTP fighters — described as the largest ever in a single incident — during a recent cross-border attack attempt from Afg­hanistan. He said the attack by the TTP’s largest formation, or “Tashkeel”, was “sponsored, facilita­ted, and abetted by India”.
India’s terror network
Gen Chaudhry provided details of Abdul Majeed, a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India, who was arrested last Fri­day (April 25) and linked to one of the terror networks.
“We will present to you how India has been found to operate a terror network inside Pakistan in which explosives, IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and other materials are being provided to terrorists to target not only military but also innocent civilians,” he said. He added that the evidence could be examined by any independent agency.
According to Gen Chaudhry, Majeed was apprehended from a bus terminal in Jhelum, where he was planning to carry out an attack. “An IED, two mobile phones, and Rs70,000 were recovered from him,” he said.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Investigations revealed that the network he was a part of included four Ind­ian military personnel in addition to Majeed. These Indian operatives were part of Indian military intelligence.
Majeed was allegedly recruited by Major Sandeep, an officer stationed in India-occupied Kashmir. His handler was identified as Subedar Sukvinder, a junior commissioned officer (JCO) of the Indian Army. Major Sandeep and Subedar Sukvinder were said to have tasked and guided Majeed. Other network members included Havildar Amit, also known as Adil Aman, and an unidentified Indian soldier.
Intercepted conversations between Majeed and his handlers were also played during the briefing and a timeline of Majeed’s activities and the funds he received was also shared. Majeed is accused of involvement in four sabotage attempts, including a botched one.
The first IED was delivered to Majeed last September in Parnala, Bhimber district. He used it to attack a military vehicle on Oct 13 in Pir Kanthi, Bagh district, injuring three Pakistan Army soldiers. He received Rs180,000 for the attack.
The second IED was delivered on Nov 22 near Head Marala. The drone used in the operation crashed, and its wreckage was retrieved by Majeed. He later used the device to attack a military vehicle in Jalalpur Jattan, resulting in four “casualties.” For this, he received Rs656,000.
On March 18, Majeed planned a third IED attack near Kotli. He became cautious after observing troop movements in the area. The following day, local schoolchildren discovered and reported a suspicious package. Two IEDs were recovered from the site.
Following the recovery, Indian media falsely claimed that five bombs had been discovered in occupied Kashmir, which Gen Chaudhry dismissed as “blatant propaganda.” The fourth IED was delivered near Nadala on April 22. Majeed was instructed to target a bus station in Barnala or Bhimber, but he instead suggested Jhelum due to higher passenger traffic.
“While he was in Jhelum to do this nefarious act of terrorism, he was apprehended by law enforcement agencies,” Gen Chaudhry said. “What’s this happening? And they are serving officers, serving JCOs, serving NCOs. This is what you call state-sponsored cross-border terrorism,” he added.
‘Credible evidence’
In a late-night statement, Federal Minister for Information Atta Tarar warned that India intended to launch military action against Pakistan.
Using the baseless allegations levelled in the wake of the Pahalgam attack as a justification, India could try to launch an incursion within the next 24-36 hours, he said.
The international community should realise that India would solely be responsibility for any destruction in the case of a conflict, he said.
 


Separately, Pakistan Mission to the United Nations on Tuesday said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the Jaffar Express attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”, according to a press release.
As per the statement, Pakistan possessed “credible evidence establishing that the attack on the Jaffar Express passenger train — in which at least 30 Pakistani nationals were slain and dozens taken hostage — was externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”.

For example, on Monday, New Delhi banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels, including portals belonging to major networks such as Dawn News, ARY News, Geo News, etc. Accounts belonging to freelance journalists and cricket commentators have also been blocked. New Delhi has taken this senseless step because it believes that the channels were spreading “provocative and communally sensitive content”.
 
 

Considering the bellicose and inflammatory anti-Pakistan and anti-Muslim content being produced by many mainstream Indian channels, this justification is laughable. Other steps taken by New Delhi include blocking certain Pakistani social media handles, as well as general boycotts of Pakistani culture and sports.
Sadly, it seems that the Indian state, along with parts of its media and civil society, are creating an atmosphere for war. That would explain why the world’s self-proclaimed ‘biggest democracy’ would feel threatened by Pakistani media outlets offering alternative viewpoints. While no doubt there are jingoistic voices on this side of the border too, the sheer size and reach of the Indian media means that war hysteria can very easily grip large segments of the Indian public.
 
 

A week after the Pahalgam tragedy, India has yet to provide conclusive proof linking Pakistan to the attack. Perhaps that is why it is keen to silence Pakistani voices, so that the Indian people are not exposed to alternative viewpoints and are prevented from questioning their government about what really happened in the scenic tourist spot in held Kashmir.
Moreover, Kashmiris in India are facing revenge attacks, with around 2,000 rounded up, while the Pahalgam episode is being used to fan hatred against India’s Muslim citizens. Instead of promoting such madness, the Indian state and media would do well to adopt a more rational approach, and stop spreading anti-Pakistan and anti-Muslim hatred.

He noted that it was also important to define “public interest” when a  judge’s reputation is frequently debated within legal circles and at  different bars, labelling such discussions as being in the public  interest.
Justice Hassan made these remarks while pointing toward senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, who commenced formal arguments on behalf of five judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) before the constitutional bench.
The five-judge bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, was hearing a set of petitions against inter-se seniority of five sitting judges of the IHC namely Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz.
In their joint petition, the IHC judges urged the SC to not treat the three recently transferred judges as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.

Munir A. Malik says temporary transfers are in the very spirit of federalism

The observation by Justice Hassan came when the senior counsel, Mr Malik, contended what constituted the best public interest behind judges’ transfer from one high court to another had to be established. Any transfer done under Article 200 is a temporary in nature in the spirit of federalism, the counsel argued.
Justice Hassan, however, asked the senior counsel to define what exactly should be the period for a judge to serve after his transfer to a high court from another on a temporary basis. The counsel replied that based on the constitutional history of the country, the upper limit of transfer of the judge should be two years.
 
 

Justice Mazhar intervened to say that the other way round could be transfer for an unlimited period if a judge concedes to be transferred since the constitution does not provide any limit or period for the transferred judges to serve.
The counsel said that in case a high court has a backlog of cases of a particular nature, such as criminal cases, due to a dearth of judges having expertise in that subject, the transfer period of a judge should commensurate with the backlog of the cases.
About the term “public interest” in the judicial context, the lawyer said that the public interest should mean better administration of justice, with the underlying purpose of ensuring access to justice. Also, he said, any consideration of the public interest should be taken into account before initiating the process of transferring a judge from one high court to another.
At this, Justice Salahuddin Pan­whar commented that the counsel see­med not disputing the transfer but the seniority of judges due to the transfer.
Justice Mazhar highlighted that even the temporary transfer could affect the seniority of judges. He elaborated that if a judge opted for transfer, he would lose his seniority and become junior to his juniors. The key question of judges’ seniority would remain intact, he noted.

The counsel argued that Article 200 must be read with Article 2A that enshrines the independence of the judiciary and could not be interpreted in a way to collide with Article 175(A), which relates to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) on judges’ appointment.
 
 

Under the garb of exercising Article 200, the counsel emphasised, the president could not usurp the JCP powers on judges’ appointment. All the members of the 17-body JCP were at a par with each other and enjoy the constitutional backing to nominate candidates for their appointment as judges of the superior courts.
This power to nominate “for the appointment of judges” had not been conferred to the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) and chief justice of the two relevant high courts, according to the counsel. He argued “such transfers” were in fact for a temporary period and were in the very spirit of the federalism.
The constitution contemplates five different high courts and the JCP composition varies for each high court while the CJP become only a paterfamilias (head of the institution), he said, adding that the autonomous and independent character of the high court would be compromised otherwise.
 
 

Justice Mazhar, however, reminded him that the CJP was no more “paterfamilias” in the appointment procedure as judges were elevated with a majority vote where every member has a vote of his own.
The counsel argued that a lawyer practising in a particular province would always be considered for the appointment in the particular high court, otherwise the provincial bar would have no say in the meetings of such JCPs.
He was of the opinion the permanent vacancies in the Sindh High Court could not be filled by judges of the Islamabad High Court, he said. The counsel would continue his arguments on Wednesday.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), three terrorists were killed during an operation near Turbat in Kech district. The operation was launched based on intelligence about the presence of militants in the area.
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively eng­a­ged the khawarij location, as a res­ult of which, three terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in a sta­tement, adding that a heavy exc­h­ange of fire took place between sec­urity forces and armed terrorists.
Weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, who the ISPR said were involved in numerous attacks against security forces and the killing of civilians.

PM praises security forces, terms terrorists enemies of peace

“A sanitisation operation was conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area as the security forces of Pakistan are det­e­rmined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country,” it said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for the successful operation in Kech. In a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, he lauded the professionalism and bravery displayed by the troops and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to eradicating terrorism.
The terrorists are enemies of peace in Balochistan and oppon­e­nts of the province’s prosperity, he said, adding that the governm­ent would continue the journey of progress and development. The prime minister also reiterated that the entire nation stands by the security forces in defence of the motherland.
Ziarat IBO
In a separate incident, security forces killed seven   terrorists during an operation conducted on intelligence reports in the Choteer area of Ziarat district.
 
 

Officials said the targeted operation took place between the Chot­eer and Sanjavi areas between Mon­day night and early Tuesday. Armed militants hiding in the area opened fire on the security forces, who retaliated after taking positions.
“Heavy exchange of fire continued for two hours, during which hand grenades were also used by the militants,” an official said, adding that seven bodies were recovered from the area once the firing ceased.
Ziarat Deputy Commissioner Zakaullah Durrani confirmed the deaths and said the bodies were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, Ziarat, by Levies personnel.
He said residents had earlier blocked the Sanjavi-Ziarat road in protest against the presence of militants in the area, suspending all traffic. They initially refused to reopen the road despite negotiations by the assistant commissioner.
However, following talks led by Deputy Commissioner Durrani, the protesters agreed to end their blockade and traffic was restored in the afternoon.

A meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Petroleum presided over by Syed Mustafa Shah asked the Petroleum Division, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association to present their detailed reports on the subject for a way forward.
Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA) presented its case before the committee and protested the non-implementation of the government committee. They said the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had decided in September 2023 to revise their sale margins by Rs1.64 per litre for dealers and Rs1.87 per litre for oil marketing companies in four phases that year based on PSO’s operating cost.
The government had also committed to annual revisions in line with the inflationary trend, the PPDA representatives said, adding that early this year, the dealers had worked out a Rs2.20 per litre increase in their margins. Ogra, however, proposed to the government an increase of Rs1.40 per litre in the existing rate of Rs7.87 per litre for dealers and Rs8.64 per litre for OMCs. However, it has not been notified over the past nine months of the fiscal year.
During the ensuing discussion, a proposal for converting CNG filling stations into petrol pumps also cropped up. Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik clarified that such cases could be examined individually on a case-to-case basis under the existing petroleum policy, and there would be no immediate revision in the policy. The committee decided to defer further deliberation on this matter to its next meeting.
Addressing concerns regarding fuel quality, the minister pointed out challenges related to GST and LPG margins. He said Ogra was empowered to oversee these matters and that relevant issues would be addressed in the upcoming budget.
Ogra Chairman Masroor Khan informed the committee that petroleum prices were set every 15 days with the government approval and about 50pc of petroleum products demand was met by state-owned PSO.

He, however, suggested that mandatory tax return filing should remain unchanged for all individuals earning more than Rs0.6 million annually, he told a press conference at the OICCI head office.
He also recommended reducing the sales tax rate on goods to 17 per cent immediately, followed by a gradual 1pc annual reduction to bring it down to 15pc, matching the regional average. 
He added that harmonisation of sales tax rates between the federal and provincial governments is critical to simplifying compliance and encouraging business growth.
He called for gradually abolishing the ‘super tax’ within three years to create a more predictable and business-friendly fiscal environment.

Govt asked to phase out super tax, gradually cut corporate tax

Mr Hussain emphasised that a more equitable contribution across all sectors, proportionate to their share of GDP, could increase the tax-to-GDP ratio to approximately 14pc, which currently stands at less than 10pc.
He recommended reducing the corporate tax rate to 28pc for FY26, with a structured plan to lower it by 1pc annually, reaching 25pc within five years. This progressive reduction will align Pakistan’s corporate tax structure with other emerging economies and boost competitiveness.
On growing the tax base, OICCI chief stressed the urgent need for bringing traditionally under-taxed sectors — agriculture, real estate, and wholesale/retail trade — into the formal tax net.
On illegal cigarette trade, which results in tax losses exceeding Rs300 billion annually, he said strict enforcement measures are necessary to plug this major revenue leakage.
“Pakistan must act decisively to modernize its tax system,” Hussain said, recommending that all major petroleum products be treated as taxable supplies at the appropriate sales tax rates, ensuring a fairer and broader tax contribution from the sector.

The minimum retail price of cement will now be calculated based on the average national retail prices published by PBS under its weekly SPI report. These values will be assessed twice monthly — using SPI data relea­sed just before the 1st and 16th — and applied to the corresponding fortnightly periods starting on those dates.

At the conclusion of a two-day Joint Intergovernmental Commission (IGC), the two countries signed seven memorandums of understanding (MOUs) for cooperation in the transport, trade, business, culture and education sectors.
The 13th session of the Pakistan-Kazakhstan IGC on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation was co-chaired by Ahad Cheema, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, and Kazakhstan’s Transport Minister Marat Karabayev. 
The two sides reviewed the progress made since the last meeting and agreed on a number of new initiatives to further strengthen bilateral cooperation.

The agreement will allow the Kazakhs to use Karachi, Bin Qasim and Gwadar ports

A statement issued at the end of the IGC said the two sides agreed to accelerate finalisation of the Transit Trade Agreement and begin implementation of the ‘Roadmap for Trade and Economic Cooperation’. The two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding on electronic trade.
Connectivity and transport were key areas of IGC’s focus. Both sides reaffirmed the importance of regional trade corridors, particularly the Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Afghanis­tan-Pakistan and Kazakhstan-Uzbek­istan-Afghanistan-Pakistan routes. “It was agreed to promote their use under the International Motor Transport Agreement”. 
The successful launch of a multimodal trade corridor from Jebel Ali (UAE) to Almaty, Kazakhstan, via Pakistan, was acknowledged as a milestone in regional integration.
The parties agreed to expand cooperation between logistics companies and develop joint ventures to facilitate cross-border movement of goods through ports in Karachi, Qasim, and Gwadar.
In the agriculture sector, the two countries agreed to hold the first meeting of the Joint Working Group and share investment opportunities. Cooperation in plant protection and quarantine standards will also be enhanced. 
In the financial sector, progress was made towards signing an MoU between the State Bank of Pakistan and the Kazakhstan Agency for Regulation and Development. Pakistan offered capacity-building support to Kazakhstan through training programmes for central and commercial banking professionals.
Tourism and cultural exchange
Emphasising the need for tourism and cultural exchange, both sides agreed to promote tourism by sharing lists of certified tour operators and launching joint promotional activities. 
The Kazakh side expressed interest in opening branches of the Chess Academy and the Qazaq Batyry Mixed Martial Arts Academy in Islamabad. 
The parties also appreciated the signing of cultural cooperation agreements and agreed to name streets in Islamabad and Astana after Abai Qunanbaiuly and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, respectively.
In the field of education, the two sides agreed to establish a joint working group to strengthen academic collaboration and facilitate exchange programmes for students and faculty. 
Discussions included the possibility of setting up a science and technology centre named after K. Satbayev at NUST, Islamabad. Progress was made on several agreements aimed at enhancing cooperation in higher education, technical training, and research, the statement said.
Both sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in the field of information technology. MoUs were signed between NADRA and Kazakhstan’s National Information Technologies agency, as well as between Astana Hub and Ignite, laying the foundation for joint work in digital innovation and governance.

During a public hearing on Tuesday presided over by Chairman National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) Waseem Mukhtar, representatives of the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) said there was the possibility of increasing monthly fuel cost adjustments in the coming months given 20pc higher load demand and lower hydropower availability.
Responding to a question, a case officer of Nepra reported that the impact of about Rs52bn reduction in quarterly tariff adjustments would be about Rs1.52 per unit for the coming three months — May, June and July. Conveners representing export sector demanded that its application should come into force in April to June for which the prime minister had announced and on that basis they had booked export orders.
Nepra did not go beyond the earlier explanation of its application for May to July but it was evident that April bills were already out in some areas and could not be called back. 

Consumers will not see relief in their April bills as promised by PM Shehbaz 

The Nepra chairman disallowed representatives of Hyderabad, Multan and Quetta electric supply companies for the absence of their senior leadership and called for their explanations. 
Mr Mukhtar also expressed displeasure over the absence of power division representation and directed that a letter should also be written to the federal secretary of power.
The CPPA reported about 4.4pc increase in power consumption in March over last year and sought about Rs1.52 per unit negative quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA) for the January-March 2025 period and another three paise per unit negative fuel price adjustment (FCA) for electricity consumed in March.
The Rs1.51 per unit negative QTA, involving a total of Rs51.5bn already overcharged by all Discos for the third quarter of FY25, was already made part of the tariff reduction announced by the prime minister for three months –April to June 2025.
The lower QTA stems from a combination of lower capacity charges, operations and maintenance costs, fixed costs on account of incremental sales and fewer system losses mainly because of relative stability in the exchange rate and decline in interest rates.
The decline in fuel cost is mainly because of substantially higher costs allowed by Nepra through a 20pc increase in base tariff effective July 1, 2024. About 75pc of the total power supply during March came from domestic fuel sources, almost 20pc of that at zero fuel cost.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), which filed the petition for negative adjustment of fuel cost for March, said the power consumption was 4.4pc higher than the same month last year and almost 22pc higher than February. It reported that electricity delivered to Discos stood at 8,114 gigawatt hours (GWh) in March against 6,666 GWh in February.
The power companies have claimed in their petitions that the average fuel cost amounted to Rs9.22 per unit in March compared to Rs9.34 per unit in the same month last year.
The CPPA said about 8,409 GWh of electricity was generated at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs79.5bn (Rs9.46 per unit) in March, of which 8,114GWh energy was delivered to Discos at a cost of Rs74.85bn (at Rs9.22 per unit). However, the reference fuel cost already charged in March stood at Rs9.256 per unit, hence a refund of three paise per unit.
Hydropower lost its top position with about 15.42pc share in the overall grid owing to unfavourable hydrological conditions. Last year, hydropower contributed 28pc electricity to the grid in March. Nuclear energy emerged as the largest electricity supplier to the national grid with 26.4pc share.
The third biggest share in the national grid came RLNG at 18.17pc, followed by local coal at 16.57pc. This was followed by 11.64pc share from local local gas. Imported coal contributed 6.5pc to the national grid.

Police are searching for one suspected perpetrator, the news agency TT reported.
Police earlier said they had received calls from members of the public who heard gunshots in the city centre, and that emergency services had rushed to the scene.
“Three people are confirmed dead after a shooting […] The police are investigating the incident as a homicide,” investigators said in a statement.
Witnesses told broadcaster SVT they had heard five shots and had seen people in the area running to take cover.
Ten people were killed in February in the Swedish city of Orebro in the country’s deadliest ever mass shooting, in which a 35-year-old unemployed loner opened fire on students and teachers at an adult education centre.
Sweden has suffered from a wave of gang-related violence for more than a decade that has included an epidemic of gun violence.

PPP Union Council Chairman, Amir Bhashani, was killed on April 17 by armed motorcyclists in a suspected targeted attack near Bismillah Chowk in Orangi Town. The case was registered under terror and murder charges by the Pakistan Bazaar police.
In response, the city council last week demanded that the provincial police and law enforcement agencies promptly arrest the killers of Bhashani and bring them to justice.
According to a statement issued by Karachi District West Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Tariq Illahi Mastoi, “A police team led by SP Manghopir initiated an investigation on different aspects and conducted technical and human intelligence-based action, apprehending two suspects, namely and recovering two pistols.”
During the initial probe, it was transpired that one of the suspects was directly involved in the killing, while another was an informer who had informed his accomplices about the presence of the UC chairman at his office, the statement said.
The planning to carry out the killing was done a week before the murder based on “land and financial matters”, the statement said.
Apart from the prime suspect, two other suspects were also found to be involved in the murder planning, it said.
So far, the investigation has revealed who the real mastermind of the murder is, it added.
According to the statement, the suspects told the interrogators that the prime suspect, along with two accomplices, went to the camp UC chairman’s office in a car on the day of the murder.
It said that the accomplices stepped out of the vehicle and stayed at a nearby restaurant, waiting for two hired assassins while the prime suspect remained seated in the car.
After the arrival of the assassins, the accomplices, with the help of the prime suspect, killed Bhashani, the statement said.
Later on, the suspects left in their car while hired assassins fled on their motorcycle, it added.
While the two suspects were under police custody, concerted efforts were underway to arrest the four remaining suspects in the case, SSP Mastoi said in the statement.</p><small>2025-04-29 18:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2921592732d14b3.jpg?r=215956' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907384/1-killed-3-injured-in-gunfight-between-terrorists-peace-committee-in-kps-lakki-marwat-police' target='_blank'><strong>1 killed, 3 injured in gunfight between terrorists, peace committee in KP’s Lakki Marwat: police</strong></a><br><p>The killing of an elderly man and the injuring of his two relatives and a neighbour by terrorists sparked a fierce gun battle between the assailants and members of a local peace committee in the Begukhel area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district late Monday night, according to police.
The incident reflects the escalating militant presence in Lakki Marwat, where attacks have become more frequent in recent months despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.
“The incident happened last night in the Begukhel village. Members of the peace committee living there had deployed guards around the village for protection when militants decided to attack them. They used RPGs and other heavy artillery to attack, and in retaliation to the attack, the peace committee members also opened fire to resist.
“During the exchange of fire, one local lost his life while two others sustained injuries. The militants fled from the scene following the exchange. We have registered an FIR (first information report) against unknown assailants,” Shahid Marwat, spokesperson for Lakki Martwat Police, told Dawn.com.
A police handout said that the terrorists attacked the villagers near their house, killing Gul Badshah, 65 and injuring his brother Khan Badshah, 56, his son Naseer Khan, 25, and neighbour Munawar Khan, 58.
The attack sparked a fierce gunfight between the armed members of the peace committee and terrorists, which continued for one hour, the handout said.
Per the handout, an injured Naseer told police that the family had heard gunshots at midnight, which compelled them to step out of their houses.
“As soon as we stepped outside, armed men opened fire on us with light and heavy weapons from the eastern side,” he said, according to the handout.
He said that he, his father, uncle and another relative were injured in the attack.
The handout said that later, Naseer’s father succumbed to injuries.
“Members of the peace committee retaliated to the attack and an exchange of fire continued for nearly an hour, he was quoted as saying in the handout.
When the fire exchange stopped, the members of the peace committee took the dead and wounded to the hospital.
The complainant told police that around three dozen terrorists had come to the village to attack the members of the peace committee who used to guard the area at night.
The assailants, he said, also used rocket and grenade launchers, as a result of which the heaps of harvested wheat caught fire and were destroyed.
The complainant added that the main gate of the house was also damaged in the attack.
Police said they were investigating the incident after registering a case against unknown assailants under Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (premeditated murder), 324 (attempt to murder), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage etc.) of the Pakistan Penal Code, Section 5 of the Explosive Substance Act and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
Local elders reaffirmed on Sunday that residents would fight anti-peace elements side by side with police so as to effectively eradicate the menace of terrorism from the Lakki Marwat district.
They showed resolve during a meeting with district police officer Mohammad Jawad Ishaq held at Abbasa police post in Kurrum Par region.
The elders and police officials discussed matters pertaining to law and order and police actions against miscreants and criminal’ gangs.
Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. While security operations brought a period of relative calm, militant activity has resurged in recent years, straining local peace efforts and heightening fears of renewed instability.</p><small>2025-04-29 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602428-pakistan-asks-uk-to-prosecute-indian-protestors-involved-in-violence-threats' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan asks UK to prosecute Indian protesters involved in violence, threats protesters</strong></a><br><p>

Relations between Pakistan and India have plummeted to their lowest level in years following the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 men, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks on civilians in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
 




Says India has not provided evidence for “baseless allegations” against Pakistan
Says India has been found operating a terror network inside Pakistan targeting not only military but also innocent civilians
Says forensic analysis of retrieved materials shows “irrefutable evidence” of Indian terrorism


Following the incident, New Delhi, without providing any evidence, implied Pakistan backed the attackers — an allegation that Islamabad has strongly denied. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
Lt Gen Chaudhry said that seven days had passed since the Pahalgam incident but, so far, India had not provided a “shred of evidence” for its “baseless allegations” against Pakistan.
“We will present to you how India has been found to operate a terror network inside Pakistan in which explosives, IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and other materials are being provided to terrorists to target not only military but also innocent civilians,” he said.

The army’s spokesperson said the evidence he was presenting was just “one small part” of India’s “state-sponsored terrorism”.
“Four days ago, on April 25, an Indian-trained and sponsored terrorist, who was a Pakistani citizen, was arrested near the Jhelum bus stand from whom one IED, two mobile phones, and Rs70,000 were recovered,” he said, adding that further investigation yielded an Indian-origin drone from his house along with Rs1 million in cash.
The DG ISPR said that a forensic analysis of the retrieved materials showed “irrefutable” evidence that could be examined by any credible independent agency.
“The handler was a junior commissioned officer (JCO) of the Indian army, Subedar Sukvinder,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “The Indian officer had sent an IED and instructed the terrorist to collect it from a point.
“The evidence I’m putting forth before you [shows] how India is carrying out terrorism in Pakistan [through] serving officers and JCOs of the Indian army.”
He said further forensic analysis showed the involvement of four Indian army officials in the situation: Major Sandeep Verma alias Sameer, the main handler and a commanding officer of the Indian army in occupied Kashmir; Subedar Sukvinder alias Sikander; Havildar Amit alias Adil Aman: and another Indian soldier.
He said that Major Sandeep had hired terrorist Abdul Majeed and aired an alleged audio exchange between the two discussing the mode of payment.
“Just see, just hear what is being said by an Indian serving major. He is saying that ‘we conduct terrorism from Balochistan to Lahore’; He is telling the details of entry and how terror financing is carried out,” Chaudhry added.
The DG ISPR said the audio clip was “what you call irrefutable evidence of state-sponsored terrorism” collected from just one terrorist cell that the military was putting forth in today’s press conference.
Chaudhry said the Indian-trained terrorist had carried out four acts of militancy through IED attacks and that the IEDs were transported through drones.
He added that it was not the Indian intelligence agency RAW but the Indian army that was doing such activities of state-sponsored terrorism.
“The terrorist’s fourth attack took place after the Pahalgam incident,” he said, adding that a location near Nadala was shared with Majeed to retrieve the IED on April 22 and carry out the attack the next day at a populated bus stand.“
The DG ISPR said the terrorist was apprehended on April 25.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
This, he said, was manifested two nights back when security forces killed 54 terrorists attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district.
DG ISPR said the total number of terrorists killed was 71 so far after 17 more were taken out later.
Earlier today, the Pakistan Army shot down an Indian quadcopter drone near the Line of Control (LoC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, state media reported. The development came as Indian and Pakistani soldiers reportedly traded fire along the Line of Control for a fifth straight night, after four years of relative calm.
Separately, speaking about the situation at the border, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that “everything is being monitored,: stating that if an incursion were to take place, then Pakistan would “respond accordingly”.
Responding to a question about whether the rise in tension had something to do with the elections in India, the interior minister said that the Indian government had “many motives”.
Indian links in Jaffer Express attack
Earlier today, the Pakistan Mission to the United Nations said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the Jaffer Express attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”, according to a press release issued today.
The Jaffar Express train was hijacked on March 11 when Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages.
Security forces launched a two-day operation, concluding on March 12. DG Chaudhry had said that all 33 terrorists were neutralised, but no hostages were harmed in the final rescue phase.</p><small>2025-04-29 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602422-rain-thunderstorm-forecast-from-may-1-as-heatwave-set-to-ease' target='_blank'><strong>Rain, thunderstorm forecast from May 1 as heatwave set to ease</strong></a><br><p>

The clarification followed reports from [multiple] Pakistani media outlets last week, which claimed that over 67,000 Pakistani pilgrims might experience delays in their Haj travel due to millions of Saudi Riyals intended for their expenses being erroneously transferred to an incorrect bank account.
“Recent claims in some Pakistani media outlets about ‘Haj funds being sent to the wrong Saudi account’ are baseless and stem from a misunderstanding of the Haj account management system and the ministry’s official electronic Haj platform, which ensures the highest standards of transparency and accuracy,” Arab News Pakistan quoted an official of the Saudi Ministry of Haj and Umrah as saying.
According to the report, the official said that while Pakistan’s religious affairs ministry had finalised all contracts for its pilgrims without significant issues, several Pakistani private firms missed the deadline to secure their pilgrims’ contracts.
He told the outlet that this recurring issue from previous years has led to incomplete entry processes, preventing these pilgrims from participating in Haj in the Kingdom.
Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reprimanded officials from the religious affairs ministry for their alleged negligence that jeopardised the departure of 67,000 potential Pakistani pilgrims this year, assuring that he would take up the matter with the Saudi government to resolve the issue.
Local media had reported that private Haj operators failed to meet the Kingdom’s requirements, depriving the 67,000 intending pilgrims of performing Haj this year.
However, private Haj operators blamed the Saudi government for the delay, claiming they had sent the payments before the deadline, but the Saudi software system crashed.
The final date for issuing visas was April 18, as per the Saudi deadline, leaving the fate of the 67,000 pilgrims uncertain.
Meanwhile, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported that Pakistan’s Haj 2025 operations officially began on Tuesday morning, with the departure of the first Haj flight from Islamabad to Madinah.
“The inaugural flight, PK-713, took off at 5:21 AM, carrying 427 pilgrims who will perform the sacred journey in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” the report said.
In 2025, Pakistan’s Haj quota was set at 179,210, with half of the quota meant to be managed by private Haj operators. However, only 23,000 people were able to go under private operators.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-04-29 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602394-ispr-dg-addresses-presser-after-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR presents 'irrefutable' evidence of Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>
