<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/01055106adfcba3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976825/how-us-iran-tensions-could-shape-world-markets' target='_blank'><strong>How US-Iran tensions could shape world markets</strong></a><br><p>The United States and Israel launched strikes on Iran on Saturday, targeting its leadership and plunging the Middle East into a new conflict that President Donald Trump said would end a security threat and give Iranians a chance to topple their rulers.
The strikes put nearby oil-producing Gulf Arab countries on edge as fears of escalation grew, and Tehran responded by launching missiles towards Israel.



Here’s how the conflict could play out across world markets.
Oil spike
Oil is the main barometer of Middle East tension.
Iran is a major producer and lies opposite the oil-rich Arabian Peninsula across the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20 per cent of global oil supply passes. Conflict could limit oil entering the global market and push up prices.
Brent crude traded on Friday around $73 a barrel, already up by a fifth this year.
Some oil majors and top trading houses suspended crude oil and fuel shipments via the Strait of Hormuz because of the attacks, four trading sources said on Saturday.
William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said that even if the conflict was contained, Brent might rise to about $80, which was the peak during the 12-day war in Iran last June.
A prolonged conflict affecting supply could cause oil prices to jump to around $100, potentially adding 0.6-0.7 percentage points to global inflation, he said in a note.
Wild swings, everywhere
The conflict is likely to exacerbate volatility across global markets, which have already swung wildly this year owing to Trump’s tariffs and a sharp tech selloff.
The VIX volatility index has risen by a third this year, and implied US bond volatility is up 15 per cent.
Currency markets are unlikely to be immune, analysts say.
The dollar index fell by around 1pc during the June war, CBA notes. But that fall was short-lived and unwound after three or four days.
“In current circumstances, the size of the fall will depend on how large and how long-lasting the conflict is expected to be,” CBA analysts said in a note a week ago.
“If the conflict was long-lasting and disrupted oil supplies, we expect the US dollar would lift against most currencies except the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. The US is a net energy exporter and so benefits from higher oil and gas prices that would result from a disrupted oil supply.”
Israel’s shekel will almost certainly be another mover — Iran quickly retaliated against Israel on Saturday.
It dropped 5pc at the start of the June war and also reacted after Israel struck Iran’s Damascus consulate in April 2024 and when Iran launched missiles at Israel that October.
All episodes were short-lived and followed by quick shekel rebounds. However, JPMorgan said it could be different this time if the conflict and a rise in market risk premia proved more persistent.
“This would especially be the case if confrontation with Iran also triggers more intensive operations against Iran’s proxies,” the Wall Street bank said.
Safe havens do their thing
The Swiss franc, widely regarded as a safe haven in times of turmoil, is expected to face further upward pressure, creating a headache for the Swiss National Bank. It is up 3pc this year against the US dollar.
Investors could also make another dash for gold, which has had a record run and is up 22pc so far in 2026, and into silver, which has also been on a roll.
The conflict could also add to demand for US Treasuries, whose yields have been falling in the past few weeks.
The outlier has been Bitcoin, no longer seen as a haven. It fell 2pc on Saturday and has shed more than a quarter of its value in two months.
Watch Middle East markets
Trading in bourses in the Middle East on Sunday, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, will provide an initial indicator of investor sentiment. While these markets are highly correlated to oil prices, an escalating conflict could ripple through the economies.
“I suspect markets will be down if these hostilities continue through the day,” said Ryan Lemand, chief executive officer and co-founder of Neovision Wealth Management. Depending on the scale of the conflict, Gulf equities could drop by 3-5pc, he said.
Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index dropped 1.3pc in five days through Thursday, its second consecutive week of declines. Dubai’s main market, which reopens on Monday, fell in the last two weeks.
Airline and defence stocks
Global airlines cancelled flights across the Middle East on Saturday, and their stocks could be under pressure if the conflict spreads and forces more airspace closures.
European weapons makers, up 10pc this year, could see more demand.</p><small>2026-03-01 00:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/010322425ad4f18.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976762/who-is-ayatollah-ali-khamenei' target='_blank'><strong>Who is Ayatollah Ali Khamenei?</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump says Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei “is dead”.
His claim came hours after Israel and the US launched an attack on Iran and followed reports quoting Israeli officials as saying that Khamenei had been assassinated.
But, subsequent Iranian media reports said that Khamenei was “steadfast and firm in commanding the field”.
Khamenei, 86, became Iran’s highest authority in 1989, following the death of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
He remained in power after overcoming 1999 student demonstrations, 2009 mass protests sparked by disputed presidential elections and 2019 demonstrations that were brutally suppressed.
He also survived the 2022-2023 “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement sparked by the death in custody of Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.
As supreme leader, he has held ultimate control over Iran’s political, military and religious institutions, shaping domestic policy and guiding foreign relations.
An article published in Al Jazeera says “critical to Khamenei’s power is the loyalty of two of Iran’s premier security institutions – the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Basij paramilitary forces, which have hundreds of ⁠thousands of volunteers”.

 

Khamenei has upheld the conservative vision of his predecessor, Khomeini, quashing the ambitions of elected presidents who sought more open policies at home and abroad. Under his rule, authorities have sidelined reformists pushing for less confrontation with the West.
He backed the 2015 nuclear deal brokered with world powers and pragmatist former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, which briefly eased Iran’s isolation. But tensions spiked after US President Donald Trump abandoned the accord in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.
Israel has long seen him as a destabilising force in the Middle East, citing his alleged backing for a network of militant allies.
When Israel and Iran fought a 12-day air war in June 2025, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened to assassinate him, saying the supreme leader “cannot continue to exist.”
Khamenei was forced to go into hiding during the war, which exposed deep Israeli intelligence penetration of the Islamic republic that led to the killing of key security officials in air strikes.
But he survived that war and, after nationwide protests again shook Iran earlier this year, he emerged defiant as ever.
Tight security
Khamenei lived under the tightest security, and his relatively infrequent public appearances were never announced in advance or broadcast live.
As supreme leader he never set foot outside the country, a precedent set by Khomeini following his triumphant return to Tehran from France in 1979.
Khamenei’s last known foreign trip was an official visit to North Korea in 1989 as president, where he met Kim Il Sung.
There has long been speculation about his health given his age, but there was nothing in his most recent appearance to fuel any new rumours.
Khamenei’s right arm was partially paralysed following an assassination attempt in 1981 that authorities have always blamed on the People’s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) group, one-time allies of the revolution now outlawed in the country.
‘I am opposed’
Repeatedly arrested under the late Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza for his anti-imperial activism, Khamenei, shortly after the Islamic revolution, became Friday prayer leader of Tehran and also served on the front line during the Iran-Iraq war.
He was elected president in 1981 following the assassination of Mohammad Ali Rajai, another attack blamed on the MEK.
During the 1980s, Khomeini’s most likely successor was seen as the senior cleric Ayatollah Hossein Montazeri, but the revolutionary leader changed his mind shortly before his death after Montazeri objected to the mass executions of MEK members and other dissidents.
When Khomeini died and the Islamic republic’s top clerical body the Assembly of Experts met, it was Khamenei whom they chose as leader.
Khamenei famously initially rejected the nomination, putting his head in his hands in a show of despair and declaring, “I am opposed”. But the clerics stood in unison to seal his nomination and his grip on power has never slackened.
Khamenei has worked with six elected presidents, a far less powerful position than supreme leader, including more moderate figures, such as Mohammad Khatami, who were allowed to make stabs at cautious reform and rapprochement with the West.
But in the end, Khamenei always came down on the side of hardliners.
He was believed to have six children although only one, Mojtaba, had public prominence. He was placed under sanctions by the United States in 2019 and is one of the most powerful backstage figures in Iran.
A family dispute also caught attention: his sister Badri fell out with her family in the 1980s and fled to Iraq in the war to join her husband, a dissident cleric.</p><small>2026-02-28 23:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/01000945b3c2eed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976674/govt-hikes-petrol-price-by-rs8-high-speed-diesel-by-rs5' target='_blank'><strong>Govt hikes petrol price by Rs8, high-speed diesel by Rs5</strong></a><br><p>The government on Saturday raised the price of petrol by Rs8 per litre and that of high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs5.16 per litre for the next fortnight, according to a press release issued by the Petroleum Division.
Following the increase, the price of petrol has jumped from Rs258.17 to Rs266.17 while the HSD price now stands at 280.86.
According to the press release, the government has revised the petroleum products’ prices based on the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority’s recommendations.
The new prices are effective from March 1, the press release said.
Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of the middle and lower-middle class.
While the heavy transport sector runs on HSD, its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.</p><small>2026-02-28 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/01000107dbad0b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976671/pakistan-have-underperformed-says-salman-agha-after-t20-world-cup-exit' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan ‘have underperformed’ says Salman Agha after T20 World Cup exit</strong></a><br><p>A disappointed Salman Agha said his team had “underperformed” after they exited the T20 World Cup on Saturday, but held back from making an “emotional” decision on his future as Pakistan captain.
Pakistan were knocked out on net run rate despite beating Sri Lanka in their final Super Eights match in Kandy on Saturday.
“We have underperformed in the whole tournament,” Agha told reporters.
“We are out of the semis due to our failure in decision-making in pressure situations.”
Opener Sahibzada Farhan became the only player to score two hundreds in the same T20 World Cup as Pakistan posted 212-8.
But they failed to restrict Sri Lanka to 147 and New Zealand went through to the semi-finals.
“Farhan was outstanding in the tournament but none of the other batters could come up to expectations,” said Agha, who only managed 60 runs in seven tournament matches.
Sri Lankan skipper Dasun Shanaka hit 76 not out off 31 balls with eight sixes as Sri Lanka scored 207-6 to lose by five runs.
A rained-off Super Eights opener against New Zealand and a defeat to England left Pakistan needing to beat Sri Lanka by a massive margin to advance.
“(Head coach Mike) Hesson and I take the responsibility as we selected the eleven for the matches,” said Agha, who added he would not make an immediate call on whether to stand down as captain.
“I will go back and take some time to decide,” he said.
“Because at this point in time, stepping down would be an emotional decision.”</p><small>2026-02-28 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/28230917b7c1eb1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976661/pm-chairs-meeting-on-overall-security-situation-in-country-directs-authorities-to-ensure-strict-measures' target='_blank'><strong>PM chairs meeting on overall security situation in country, directs authorities to ensure strict measures</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday directed all relevant institutions at the federal and provincial levels to immediately ensure comprehensive and effective security measures in view of the prevailing situation.
The premier chaired a high-level review meeting in Lahore on the overall security situation in the country, according to the report.
The development comes in the wake of Pakistan launching  Operation Ghazab lil-Haq after the Afghan Taliban opened unprovoked fire on multiple locations across the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Thursday.
PM Shehbaz emphasised that all institutions must discharge their responsibilities with mutual coordination and complete harmony.
The participants of the meeting informed the prime minister that all security agencies were on alert in light of the current situation and that all necessary measures were being taken to safeguard national security.
In view of the evolving situation in Iran, which was struck by US and Israel earlier in the day, the premier directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take all necessary steps to ensure the safe repatriation of Pakistanis in the country.
He directed that they be brought back safely to Pakistan via Azerbaijan.
In this regard, the prime minister further directed the ministry to immediately contact the government of Azerbaijan.
PM Shehbaz stated that the people of Pakistan and the armed forces were fully prepared at all times to safeguard the country’s security, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
“Under the leadership of Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, the armed forces of Pakistan are performing their duties in the best possible manner with national spirit and dedication,” he said.
The prime minister further said, “The entire nation salutes the sacrifices being rendered by the security forces in the war against terrorism.”</p><small>2026-02-28 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/282034563f233f2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976494/pakistan-regrets-outbreak-of-hostilities-in-middle-east' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan regrets outbreak of hostilities in Middle East</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday regretted the “breakdown of talks and outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East”.
The statement came after United States and Israel launched strikes on Iran, plunging the region into a renewed military confrontation. Subsequently, several Gulf Arab states said they were targeted by Iranian missiles after Tehran pledged to retaliate against the strikes.
In a statement, the FO said, “Pakistan regrets the breakdown of talks and outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East. Pakistan condemns the unwarranted attacks against the Islamic Republic of Iran. These attacks come at a time when diplomatic efforts were underway to reach a peaceful and negotiated solution.”







The ministry maintained that such a course of action “will undermine the peace and stability of the entire region, with far reaching consequences”.
Pakistan also “strongly condemned” the attacks by Iran against the brotherly countries of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
“[Pakistan] … stands in solidarity with all these brotherly countries and underscores the need to exercise maximum restraint,” the ministry said, adding the unprovoked attacks constituted “blatant violations of the sovereignty of the brotherly Gulf states”.
The FO also said that Pakistan condemned the unfortunate death of a Pakistani national in the UAE during the “dastardly attack” and urged all sides to “refrain from any further actions that may undermine the security and territorial integrity of other regional countries”.
PM speaks to Saudi prince, UAE president, Qatari emir
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the premier strongly condemned the serious regional escalation that had taken place as a result of the Israeli attack on Iran, followed by the “regrettable attacks on other Gulf countries”.
“While assuring the Saudi leadership of Pakistan’s full solidarity and support in the current situation, the prime minister said that Pakistan would always stand with its Saudi brothers and sisters, at all times to come, and under all circumstances,” the statement said.
“The prime minister said that Pakistan was ready to play a constructive role at this difficult time and prayed that the blessings of the holy month of Ramadan would bring peace to the region at the earliest,” it said.
PM Shehbaz also took to X and said, “Pakistan stands in full solidarity with Saudi Arabia and our brotherly Gulf countries in this perilous time. We remain ready to play a constructive role for peace and pray that the blessings of Ramadan bring calm and stability to our region.”







He also spoke to UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. According to the PMO, he strongly condemned the “the serious regional escalation” resulting from the Israeli attack on Iran earlier today, followed by the “regrettable attacks against the UAE as well as in other Gulf countries”.
The premier also expressed his sadness at the tragic demise of a Pakistani national in the missile attack on Abu Dhabi, the statement said.
“He assured the UAE leadership of Pakistan’s solidarity and support in the current crisis and said that Pakistan would always stand with its Emirati brothers and sisters, consistent with the close fraternal bonds between both countries, that had withstood the test of time,” the statement added.
PM Shehbaz also posted about the conversation on X.







In a subsequent post, he said he had also spoken to Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani on the phone “to express Pakistan’s strong solidarity with the brotherly people of Qatar”.
“We strongly condemn the  serious regional escalation from the Israeli attack on Iran earlier today, which was followed by the regrettable attacks against Qatar as well as in other Gulf countries.
“I reaffirmed Pakistan’s full solidarity with the brotherly State of Qatar. Pakistan will continue to support all efforts for peace and stability in the region,” PM Shehbaz said.







Dar speaks to counterparts from Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar
Further, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar “strongly condemned the unwarranted attacks against Iran” in a phone call he received from the Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
According to the FO, the two leaders “reviewed the evolving situation in Iran and the wider region”.







The statement said Dar “strongly condemned the unwarranted attacks against Iran” and called for an immediate halt to escalation through “urgent resumption of diplomacy to achieve a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis”.
Meanwhile, Dar also spoke to Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.
“Both leaders expressed deep concern over the unfolding regional developments, and agreed to remain in close contact on the evolving situation,” the FO said.







He also spoke to his United Arab Emirates counterpart, Abdullah Bin Zayed al Nahyan.
“Both leaders exchanged views on the evolving regional situation, expressed serious concern over recent developments, and agreed to remain in close contact,” the Foreign Office said.







The foreign minister also spoke to his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, and the two “exchanged views on the evolving regional situation and agreed to stay in close contact”.
“Both leaders conveyed serious concern about the ongoing attacks in the region, including those on Qatar, and underscored the urgent need for de-escalation,” an FO statement said.







Travel advisory for Pakistani nationals
Separately, the FO also issued a travel advisory for Pakistani nationals.
“For their safety and security, Pakistani nationals are advised to avoid all non-mandatory travel to the Islamic Republic of Iran,” it said.
“Pakistani nationals currently residing in Iran must exercise caution, remain vigilant, minimize non-essential travel, and stay in regular contact with the Pakistani Missions,” it said.

The advisory issued by the office of the Karachi additional inspector general of police, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said, “Karachi has been placed on high alert following increased military tensions between Pakistan and Afghan Taliban forces near the Pak-Afghan border.”
“Police and other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) have strengthened surveillance and tightened security at key entry-exit points, transportation hubs, sensitive and important places to pre-empt potential security threats,” it said.
In the safety guidelines for residents and visitors, the Karachi police urged them to stay vigilant and alert to announcements from local police, law enforcement and provincial officials.
The advisory urged the citizens to report suspicious activity and immediately notify local police or emergency services if they observe unusual movements, unattended packages, unfamiliar persons loitering in sensitive areas, illegal foreigners or any other suspicious activity.
It also urged citizens to follow the directions of security personnel and comply promptly with instructions from police checkpoints or clearance operations.

 

Further, it urged citizens to verify information and to avoid spreading unverified rumours or “panic content” on social media. The advisory pointed out to a recent fake threat alert on social media related to a few shopping centres and commercial areas that caused “fear and panic” in public.
It advised the citizens to “rely on official statements from Sindh Police, local administration, or government press briefings”.
Further, air travellers were advised to leave their homes for the airport at least one hour earlier than usual due to enhanced screening, stop-and-search measures and increased security around airport and key points.
It stated that only one visitor or attendant should accompany one passenger to the designated drop off or pick-up point to avoid crowding at the airport.
Citizens were also told to carry their computerised national identity cards (CNICs) with them at all times, as they may be required for verification at various checkpoints.
“National security forces and law enforcement agencies are fully prepared to respond to threats and protect citizens. All measures are designed to maintain peace, stability, and public safety,” the advisory concluded.</p><small>2026-02-28 16:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653426-pakistani-national-killed-in-iranian-missile-strikes-on-uae-diplomatic-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani national killed in Iranian missile strikes on UAE: diplomatic officials</strong></a><br><p>

However, the videos are unrelated to the current situation and are old.
Pakistan launched Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban, after the neighbouring country opened fire on multiple locations across the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on late Thursday.
Authorities in Kabul had called it a response to Pakistani strikes against terrorist hideouts on Afghan soil over the weekend.
On Feb 27, a pro-Indian account on X shared a video of buildings set on fire. “Afghan BM-21 rocket strikes have begun from areas of Alishero district targeting Pakistani military installations across the so-called (imaginary) border… look what’s happened,” reads the caption.
The post gained 100,800 views.







Another pro-Indian account shared the same video with the caption: “Reports of BM 21 rocket strikes from Afghanistan’s Alishero district targeting Pakistani military installations.”
That post garnered 11,100 views.
The clip with similar captions was shared by several other pro-Indian and pro-Afghan accounts, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.
A separate video, showing rockets being launched in the darkness of the night, was shared by pro-Afghan accounts with similar claims.
One such user posted the clip with the caption: “Breaking BM-21 rocket strikes have begun from areas of Alishero district targeting Pakistani military installations across the so-called (imaginary) border.”
The post gained 22,400 views.







This video was further amplified by multiple pro-Afghan and pro-Indian accounts on X, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the ongoing conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
A keyword search was conducted to verify whether any credible Pakistani or international media outlets had reported Afghan rocket strikes targeting Pakistani military installations, but it did not yield any results.
A reverse image search of the first viral video yielded Facebook posts and Egyptian news coverage. It was shared on Facebook by a user two weeks before the Pakistan-Afghanistan conflict broke out, with the caption, “Muslim extremists set fire to a Coptic Christian neighbourhood in the Egyptian capital Cairo”.
Another Facebook page, namely Global Disaster News, also shared the clip on Jan 29 with a similar context. “Emergency teams respond to a large fire burning structures in the Mokattam area southeast of Cairo, Egypt; eyewitness video shows at least one person on top of a building. - factual,” the caption reads.
This indicates that the video predates the current Pakistan-Afghanistan tensions and is unrelated to any cross-border rocket strikes.
A pro-Christian Instagram account also posted the same video on February 8, 2026, describing a fire in “Garbage City,” a Christian area in Cairo, stating that 21 houses were destroyed and two children died. The post received 1,300 likes.
An English-language Egyptian news outlet, Egypt Today, published a report on Jan 29 titled “Cairo fire brought under control; firefighting drone deployed”.
The report stated that a fire broke out in several homes in Mansheyat Nasser in western Cairo and was later contained by Civil Defence forces. No fatalities were reported at the time, though several people were treated for smoke inhalation.
Another Egyptian news portal, Gomhuria Online, published a report the same day titled “Fire in 3 houses in Manshiyat Nasser brought under control with no injuries”.
Separately, a reverse image search of the second viral video, allegedly showing the BM-21 rocket launch, yielded a YouTube video dated August 29, 2018, titled “M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)”.
The description states: “5thBN3rdFAR conducts a night live fire exercise with the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) in support of their Battery External Evaluations.”
The video had 42,142 views, indicating it is years old and unrelated to current events.
One video shows a residential fire in Cairo, Egypt, from January 2026, while another depicts a 2018 HIMARS live-fire exercise. Neither video is related to the current situation between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Therefore, the claim that viral videos show Afghan BM-21 rocket strikes on Pakistani military installations is false.

The monument in the central Parliament Square was smeared with red paint early on Friday and “Zionist war criminal” among the slogans written on it.
The Metropolitan Police said Caspar San Giorgio, 38, of no fixed address, was charged early on Saturday, some 24 hours after his arrest.
He had been detained within minutes of officers being alerted to the incident, according to the force.
He was due to appear at a London magistrates’ court later on Saturday.
The words “free Palestine” and “stop the genocide” were also sprayed on the statue, which workers cleaned off on Friday.
The incident prompted Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office to call the damage “completely abhorrent” and commend police for the swift arrest.
“Churchill was a great Briton,” a spokesman said.
The 3.6 metre Churchill statue has been vandalised a number of times in recent years, including during Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion climate demonstrations in 2020.</p><small>2026-02-28 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2818125308ebedc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976509/information-ministry-rubbishes-claim-about-pakistani-jet-being-shot-down-in-afghanistans-nangarhar' target='_blank'><strong>Information ministry rubbishes claim about Pakistani jet being shot down in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Saturday rejected claims about a Pakistani jet being shot down in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar and the pilot being captured.
The ministry’s fact check account on X attributed the claims to Afghan Taliban officials that were “amplified by Indian media”.
“The Ministry of Defence of the so-called Islamic Emirate claimed that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani fighter jet in Nangarhar and captured its pilot alive. The claim was widely amplified by Indian media and Afghan propaganda outlets,” it said.







The ministry further said Pakistan’s armed forces had not reported any aircraft loss and stated that no “independent international media outlet or defence monitoring agency” had verified the claim.
“The story relies solely on statements from Afghan officials and selective media amplification,” it said.
It further stated that there was no visual proof of crash debris, the wreckage site or the captured pilot. “No geolocated imagery or satellite evidence supports the claim,” it said, adding that “in modern conflict environments, verified crashes are rapidly documented — none exists in this case”.
It said that viral footage being shared as “jet crash evidence” was from an unrelated panic situation in Afghanistan.
“Multiple videos used in the narrative are old clips being recycled to fit the false claim,” the ministry said.
It also pointed to a “misleading image” shared by TOLO News, saying: “he image corresponds to a Russian aircraft incident in Turkey in 2021”.
“Reusing unrelated foreign crash imagery is a deliberate attempt to construct a false narrative,” the ministry said.
It said that the past two days, “hundreds of fake or misleading videos linked to the India–Afghan propaganda ecosystem have been debunked”.
“The current jet claim fits into the same coordinated disinformation cycle. No credible defence analysis suggests Afghan forces possess the operational capability demonstrated in the claim,” it said.
Meanwhile, Foreign Office Spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said that Afghan claims of downing a Pakistani jet and capturing a pilot were “totally untrue”.
“That’s a false claim. Totally untrue,” Andrabi told AFP.</p><small>2026-02-28 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/281657237114f58.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976454/bombing-a-sovereign-country-is-not-preemptive-politicians-analysts-react-as-us-and-israel-strike-iran' target='_blank'><strong>‘Bombing a sovereign country is not preemptive’: Politicians, analysts react as US and Israel strike Iran</strong></a><br><p>The United States and Israel launched a wave of strikes against targets in Iran on Saturday, triggering explosions in the capital Tehran and an escalation across the region.
“We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally — again — obliterated. We’re going to annihilate their navy,” said US President Donald Trump in an address from his Florida home posted to his Truth Social platform.
On the other hand, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation aimed to “remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran”, and urged Iranians to overthrow the Islamic Republic’s clerical leadership.
In response to the Israel-US aggression, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran later in the day confirmed the launch of the “first wave” of missile and drone attacks against Israel in response to the strikes on its territory.
Political figures and analysts in Pakistan have condemned the recent developments, particularly criticising US President Donald Trump, and warned that the escalation could have grave consequences for the region.
In a statement issued by the PPP Media Cell, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari condemned the Israeli attack on Iran, calling it a “matter of serious concern” for peace in the region. He further stated that the “cowardly attack” by Israel was an attempt to cover its atrocities in Gaza.
The PPP chairman also called on the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to take all possible measures to stop the Israeli aggression. The international community should take notice of Israel’s open violation of Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added.







Author and journalist Zahid Hussain noted in a post on social media platform X that “predictably, the US and Israel have attacked Iran”.
“The so-called ‘peace time president’ has invaded two countries and attacked several others in the first year of his term,” he added, seemingly referring to Trump, who has repeatedly claimed that he has played a role in stopping multiple wars.
Hussain also warned that the “latest US aggression will have serious consequences for Pakistan and the entire region”.







Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, UK and United Nations Maleeha Lodhi called on Pakistan to condemn the US-Israeli aggression against Iran “without delay”.
“The people of Pakistan expect no less than to stand in solidarity with Iran,” she said in a post on X.







Meanwhile, former senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed pointed out that the Israeli-American aggression against Iran has “grave implications” for the region and Pakistan.
“If God forbid, Iran loses, then Israel’s de facto border will be at Taftan on the Pakistan border […] India-Israeli axis will tighten the squeeze on Pakistan, creating a nutcracker situation.
“Balochistan and Pakistan’s nuclear program could then also be targeted! Hence, urgent need for Pakistan to defuse tensions with Afghanistan as well as give a healing touch at home to defuse political polarisation,” he said.







Lawyer and human rights professional Reema Omer noted that “preventative” or “preemptive” attacks had no basis in international law.
“They are mere euphemisms for the crime of aggression, i.e. the use of force against another state without legal justification,”she wrote on X.
“The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg described the crime of aggression as the ‘supreme international crime’ as it ‘contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole’,” she added.







Jamaat-i-Islami Pakistan former emir Sirajul Haq termed the attack on Iran “state terrorism” and urged Muslims to unite instead of “merely condemning it and waiting for their turn”.
“Following Israeli aggression, Muslim countries should announce their withdrawal from Trump’s so-called peace board,” he said.







Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari said: “Terrorist Israel has launched multiple attacks against Iran just as Iran and the US were supposedly near an agreement.
“Given the lack of support within the US to attack Iran, Trump most likely sought an attack by Israel, knowing Iran would respond, which would allow the US to ‘justifiably’ attack Iran.”







Separately, journalist Iftikhar Firdous said that with Iran being attacked during an active conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the entire Western border strip “is now under fire”.
“The dynamics that emerge out of this conflict will shape global and regional geopolitics for the decades to come,” he wrote in a post on X.







Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief and Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas condemned the “reckless and unlawful military attacks launched” against Iran.
“This timing makes it clear that the talks were used as cover for a pre-planned aggression. Diplomacy was sabotaged deliberately. Who can trust any negotiation process now when advances in talks lead straight to bombardment? The Israeli claim of a ‘preemptive’ strike is absurd. There was no evidence Iran planned any attack on Israel,” he said.
“Such actions by the US under Trump and Israel under Netanyahu are a grave violation of international law, including the UN Charter. They risk turning the Persian Gulf and the wider Middle East into a catastrophe. The entire prospering region is now on fire because of this madness,” he said.
He added that Iran’s response was a “legitimate act of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter”.
“I call on the government of Pakistan to categorically and unequivocally condemn this aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he said.







Author and activist Fatima Bhutto said, “If they succeed in Iran, Israel will turn to Pakistan next. They are the greatest threat to the world — a rogue terror state.”







She further stated, “Bombing a sovereign country is not preemptive. The only state that has a right to defend itself now is Iran. May they do it, they would acting on behalf of the world.”







Former federal minister Khawaja Saad Rafique said that the Israeli attack on Iran with American backing was “state terrorism”.
“It is the fundamental right of the Iranian people to determine Iran’s national security priorities. The US and Israel cannot dictate this,” he said.
“Attacks on Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear energy are nothing but global tyranny,” he said.







Former federal finance minister and Awam Pakistan Party leader Miftah Ismail said the party condemned the “unwarranted attack” by Israel and the US on Iran.
“It has sharply escalated tensions and risks far-reaching consequences across the region. It is particularly regrettable that this attack has come in the midst of negotiations being facilitated by Oman,” he said.
“We call on Israel and the United States to immediately end this bombing campaign against Iran, so that dialogue can resume and peace can return to the Middle East,” he said.
“We are also concerned about reports of missiles being fired on other Gulf States and call for this bombing to be stopped forthwith,” he added.

Trump: ‘annihilate’
US President Donald Trump vowed that the strikes would cripple Iran’s military and urged Iranians to rise up against the Islamic republic.
“We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally — again — obliterated. We’re going to annihilate their navy,” Trump said in the address from his Florida home posted to his Truth Social platform.

 


Calling on Iranians to stand up to their government, Trump added: “The hour of your freedom is at hand.” But he also warned that “the lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties”.
Netanyahu ‘cast off the yoke’
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation aimed to “remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran”, and urged Iranians to overthrow the Islamic republic’s clerical leadership.







“Our joint action will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands,” Netanyahu added. “The time has come for all the people of Iran… to cast off the yoke of tyranny and bring about a free and peace-seeking Iran.”
Russia: Talks a ‘cover’
Russia called on its citizens to leave Iran, with former president Dmitry Medvedev saying that talks with the United States had just been a “cover”.
“The peacekeeper is at it again,” Medvedev, now the chair of Russia’s security council, said in a post on X.







“The talks with Iran were just a cover. Everyone knew that. So who has more patience to wait for the enemy’s sorry end now?” he added.
Qatar: ‘secure’
Qatar, which hosts a US military base, initially said it was secure after the US and Israeli attacks on neighbouring Iran but was monitoring developments closely.
“The situation inside the State of Qatar is stable and secure,” an interior ministry statement said.
An official later told AFP that Qatari defence systems had intercepted an Iranian missile, and the defence ministry said it had repelled “a number of attacks.”
Shah’s son: ‘final victory’ near - Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah and a leading critic of Tehran, said that “we are very close to final victory” following the strikes.
“I want to be by your side as soon as possible so that together we can take back and rebuild Iran,” said Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the Washington area and had repeatedly urged Trump to intervene.







Jordan: protect skies
Jordan’s military said its air force was at work on Saturday to protect the kingdom and its people while the strikes were ongoing.
“These sorties are part of aerial reconnaissance and inspection operations aimed at maintaining the safety of Jordanian airspace and ensuring that it is free from any attempts at infiltration or illegal activities,” a military source said, after sirens were reported in Amman.
France: safety a priority
France, which has several military bases in the Middle East, notably in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, said that Paris’s priority was the safety of its citizens.
“Obviously our priority in these sort of cases is the protection of our nationals, the protection of our forces in the region and the monitoring of the situation in real time, which we are doing,” Alice Rufo, minister-delegate to the Armed Forces and Veterans’ Affairs ministry, told France 2 television.
African Union: stability at risk
The African Union called “for restraint, urgent de-escalation and sustained dialogue” after the strikes, warning that conflict could risk harming people on the continent.
“Further escalation risks worsening global instability, with serious implications for energy markets, food security, and economic resilience —  particularly in Africa, where conflict and economic pressures remain acute,” said the pan-African body’s head, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf.
Poland ‘prepared’
Polish staff at its embassy in Tehran were “safe” but the country is “prepared for various scenarios,” Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X.







Netherlands: ‘restraint’
In a post on X, Dutch Foreign Minister Tom Berendsen said: “The Netherlands calls on all parties to exercise restraint and prevent further escalation.
Stability in the region is essential.

“In view of the prevailing sensitive national situation, PTA urges all citizens to be responsible while using social media and digital platforms,” the body said, advising citizens not to “share, disseminate, forward or upload information/content which is authentic and based upon official sources and to refrain from spreading rumours and fake news”.







PTA cautioned against sharing fake news or information “liable to legal action in accordance with applicable laws”.
“PTA calls upon all citizens to act with caution, maturity, and a strong sense of national responsibility to help, maintain stability and public confidence,” the statement added.
The statement comes against the backdrop of escalating geopolitical tension in the Middle East, as Israel and the United States launched an attack on Iran on Saturday.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s armed forces continue to counter the Afghan Taliban regime’s aggression on its western border as part of Operation Ghazab lil-Haq, which was launched against the Afghan Taliban after “unprovoked firing” from across the border.</p><small>2026-02-28 10:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2817285840bc39e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976305/misinformation-and-memes-run-amok-amidst-pak-afghan-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Misinformation and memes run amok amidst Pak-Afghan conflict</strong></a><br><p>The moment reports of a military confrontation break, newsrooms gear up for sleepless nights, social media erupts with all sorts of “information” and memes (the latter is Pakistan-specific), and fact-checkers know they will have their hands full in the coming days.
The latest clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which began late Thursday night and continued into early Saturday morning, was no different.
Within the first 12 hours, the fact-checking team at iVerify Pakistan had spotted more than a dozen claims circulating on social media, ranging from the names of Taliban commanders allegedly killed and footage of Pakistani jets crashing to visuals of chaos following an attack on the Kakul military academy and soldiers from both sides purportedly being captured. Local journalists and social media commentators all fed into this cycle of mis- and disinformation, along with propaganda accounts from India and Afghanistan.

 

When war turns into content
In the midst of the late-night action on Thursday, as Pakistan launched ‘Operation Ghazab lil-Haq’ and both sides reported mounting damages inflicted on each other, UK’s Sky News ran a news bulletin in which the anchor says, “ …Afghanistan’s military authorities say they have begun carrying out air strikes against Pakistan”.
The clip, which was posted on X and started receiving backlash within minutes — since Afghanistan has no real air force to speak of — was deleted after a while, but not before the meme brigade had a field day with it.
But as mentioned above, Pakistanis’ memes are always at the ready; scrolling through X on Friday night, I saw as many people posting memes, mostly about Pakistan’s military supremacy compared to its neighbour’s, as I did people sharing updates about the ongoing military engagement at the time.
That Pakistanis turn to humour in moments of crisis, from cricket to war, is not new information – and we are, undoubtedly, exceptionally good at it – but that we do so as an immediate reaction to a situation that could lead to more civilian casualties on both sides is a concern worth pondering over. For netizens of a country all too familiar with turmoil, humour may be a somewhat natural coping mechanism, as this article from the India-Pakistan meme-war of 2025 observes, but when it comes at the expense of those living in your own country, you know it is no longer harmless.
To elaborate, the Prime Minister’s Media Coordinator Badar Shahbaz, at 3:13 a.m. on Friday night, shared a video of a group of people with the caption: “Youth of Pakistan expressing their feelings for their armed forces in the wake of the Afghanistan situation. Pakistan Hamesha Zindabad.”







Six minutes later at 3:19am, in the middle of providing important updates on the skirmishes, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar – or his team – re-shared it with this caption: “The youth of Pakistan have a distinct sense of patriotism; they find humour in every situation.”
Laughter that lands on the vulnerable
Setting aside the government co-opting the nation’s tried-and-tested coping mechanism, let’s talk about how they didn’t even do it right. The video features a group of men and women, with one person delivering lines like, “You’re Afghani, and you’re going to attack Pakistan?” and a young woman popping in to say, “acha jee”, which can only be translated as “oh really”. One could have ignored the cringe-inducing script, but not when one of the lines goes: “Apart from running tandoors, you also fight wars?”
The line perpetuates stereotypes, looks down upon the livelihoods of many, and brings the war within our own borders. As of December 2025, according to UNHCR, 1,021,562 registered Afghan refugees live in Pakistan. This figure comes after the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan, which began in November 2023 and did not exempt even those with proper documentation, such as Proof of Registration (PoR) cards, or those born in Pakistan.
This publication has already addressed the flaws in the repatriation policy in many articles, including this one by former parliamentarian Ghazan Jamal, so I won’t delve into that here. However, I will emphasise that Pakistan has witnessed multiple waves of Afghan refugee influx, spanning the period from the Soviet Union’s invasion in 1979 to the Taliban’s recapture of Afghanistan in 2021.
Over the years, millions of Afghans have lived in Pakistan and become part of its society. The “tandoor” that is referred to so derogatorily in this video is available and appreciated across the country. You will find an eatery named Afghan Tandoor, or some iteration of it, in most of our major cities. Our capital boasts some of the best Afghan cuisine. Whether these establishments are run by Afghans or employ them is a moot point; the video reduces them to “tandoor walas” without taking into account the racist slurs and comments that already exist in our society.
From being linked to rising crime waves and violence without clear data to being labelled a ‘tattered Afghan refugee’ who is perceived as a burden on the government — regardless of education and economic background — the Afghans in Pakistan have struggled for acceptance in Pakistan for decades.
On its own, this video — and particularly this one line — is in poor taste; but when it is endorsed by government officials and lumped together with patriotism, it becomes extremely problematic and poses a danger to a community that has made Pakistan its home.
Our government would be among the first — and rightly so — to speak about the safety of Pakistan-origin migrants in other countries when they are targeted. For example, back in January 2025, Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) condemned the “increasingly racist and Islamophobic” comments directed at Pakistanis in the UK following the disturbing revelations of the Rochdale grooming gang. Most of the perpetrators were indeed British-Pakistanis, but as the FO noted “the increasingly racist and Islamophobic political and media commentary in the UK … aimed at conflating the reprehensible actions of a few individuals with the entire 1.7 million British Pakistani diaspora” was deeply concerning.
So shouldn’t the same principles apply to the people who live alongside us?
In military escalations, it’s a given that misinformation and mockery can run amok – but is one more dangerous than the other?
The answer is that they can overlap and cause even more damage when combined.
The stakes of speech in escalating tensions
When we speak of false information, there is a third category apart from misinformation (spreading inaccurate information) and disinformation (deliberately spreading inaccurate information): malinformation. This refers to information that is based on truth — though it may be exaggerated or presented out of context — but is shared with the intent to attack an idea, individual, organisation, group, country, or other entity.
This is the trickiest category for fact-checkers, much like hate speech, which often falls under it, as you cannot always verify social commentary or provide evidence (something fact-checking is meant to do) to demonstrate how a notion is preposterous and harmful. As identified in the iVerify report, based on data from the claims it reviewed over two years, these narratives exploit historical grievances, deepen mistrust, and pose tangible risks to social cohesion and public safety.
The comments under both government officials’ posts show many people criticising the crassness of the video. But — lest they (or I) be labelled anti-state for critiquing it — they are not unpatriotic; Pakistanis believe the country has the full right to defend itself resolutely and ensure that no armed actors violate its territory. However, we also expect better from our leaders, who represent all those who live in the country, regardless of where they come from, and are tasked with ensuring their safety.
In situations of conflict and battle, nationalism and emotions are at their peak, so the words and actions of leaders carry even greater weight and implications. Leave the humour to the people; keep your focus on the facts.</p><small>2026-02-28 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/281029214f42378.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976371/trump-directs-us-agencies-to-toss-anthropics-ai-as-pentagon-calls-startup-a-supply-risk' target='_blank'><strong>Trump directs US agencies to toss Anthropic’s AI as Pentagon calls startup a supply risk</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Friday he is directing the government to stop work with Anthropic, and the Pentagon said it would declare the start-up a supply-chain risk, dealing a major blow to the artificial intelligence lab after a showdown about technology guardrails.
Trump added there would be a six-month phase-out for the Defence Department and other agencies that use the company’s products. If Anthropic does not help with the transition, Trump said, he would use “the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow”.







The actions mark an extraordinary rebuke by the United States against one of the premier companies that has kept it in the lead on national security-critical AI, threatening to give Anthropic a pariah status that Washington until now had reserved for enemy suppliers. Google and Amazon are among Anthropic’s financial backers.
The moves further set a precedent that US law alone would constrain how AI is deployed on the battlefield, with the Pentagon seeking to preserve all flexibility in defence and not be limited by warnings from the technology’s creators against powering weapons with unreliable AI.
In a statement, Anthropic said it would challenge any risk designation in court by the Department of Defence, which the Trump administration has renamed the Department of War.
“We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government,” the company said.
“No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons.”
Late on Friday, rival OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, Amazon and others, announced its own deal to deploy technology in the Defence Department’s classified network.
CEO Sam Altman on X said the Pentagon shared its principles for human responsibility over weapon systems and for having no mass US surveillance.







“We put them into our agreement,” Altman said of the points. “We also will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the DoW also wanted.”
It was not immediately clear whether these contractual details differed from the red lines proposed by Anthropic. The Pentagon and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
‘Nuclear War’
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said Anthropic would be designated a supply-chain risk, following an impasse in months of talks on whether the company’s policies could constrain military action.
Meeting with Hegseth this week, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei argued for weapons and surveillance limits and irked Pentagon officials. The Pentagon said US law, not a private company, would determine how to defend the country.
The designation could bar tens of thousands of contractors from using Anthropic’s AI when working for the Pentagon. That represents an existential threat to its business with the government and could harm its private-sector relationships, said Franklin Turner, an attorney who specialises in government contracts.
“Blacklisting Anthropic is the contractual equivalent of nuclear war,” he said.
Similar US action was taken to remove Chinese tech giant Huawei from the Pentagon’s supply chains. Starting in 2017, the US restricted Defence Department use of Huawei equipment, prohibited federal agencies from purchasing its technology, and halted federal grant and loan funds for Huawei equipment.
Anthropic has raced to win fierce competition to sell novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of a widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalised an IPO decision.
Saif Khan, who served in the National Security Council in former President Joe Biden’s White House, said the Defence Department’s action “may be the most draconian domestic AI regulation any government has ever issued.” “The Department is arguably treating Anthropic as a greater national security threat than any Chinese AI companies, none of whom they’ve designated supply-chain risks,” Khan said.
‘Killer Robots’
Tech companies and the Pentagon have repeatedly locked horns since at least 2018, when employees at Google protested against the Pentagon’s use of its AI to analyse drone footage. A rapprochement ensued with companies including Amazon and Microsoft jousting for defence business, while several big-tech CEOs pledged co-operation last year with the Trump administration.
But theoretical “killer robots” have worried human-rights and technology activists as wars in Ukraine and Gaza showcased increasingly automated systems.
Bolder US military action in the past year has added to these concerns, said Jack Shanahan, who had directed the Pentagon’s algorithmic warfare effort Project Maven.
“People might be a little bit more nervous about no restrictions,” Shanahan said. The White House’s legal sign-off could be “top cover for anybody that does anything that would potentially result in lack of due process, civilian casualties, collateral damage.”
The Pentagon signed agreements worth up to $200 million each with major AI labs in the past year, including Anthropic, OpenAI and Google.
Anthropic, negotiating for awards under that ceiling, had flagged concerns about the legal system’s ability to keep up with AI progress. At present, for instance, US laws do not prevent the use of technology to compile seemingly innocuous data to reveal information about people’s private lives, its CEO Amodei has said.

A SCREENSHOT from the Greens’ Urdu language campaign video.

LONDON: The Green Party of England and Wales secured a landmark victory in the Gorton and Denton by-election, overturning Labour’s 13,000-vote majority in a result that comes as a significant setback to Keir Starmer.
Hannah Spencer, a local plumber and Green councillor, was elected as the party’s first MP in northern England after winning 14,980 votes in a tightly contested race.
Reform UK came second with 10,578 votes, while Labour slumped to third place, finishing 5,616 votes behind the Greens, a dramatic 25.3 per cent drop in its vote share compared with 2024.
Starmer, facing mounting questions over Labour’s campaign strategy, vowed to “keep on fighting” after what party insiders described as a humiliating defeat in a constituency long considered a Labour stronghold.
Multilingual campaign
Central to Spencer’s campaign was an unprecedented multilingual outreach effort aimed at engaging Gorton and Denton’s diverse electorate. The Greens released campaign pamphlets and a video in Urdu, and later in Bangla, highlighting issues such as inflation, unemployment and the housing crisis.

Councillor Hannah Spencer wins on the back of unique campaign which used Urdu and Bangla to spread her message

In the Urdu language video, Spencer is seen visiting local businesses and addressing voters directly in Urdu. Over images of Starmer shaking hands with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Foreign Secretary David Lammy meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Spencer says: “Politicians aren’t working for us.”
The references were widely interpreted as an attempt to appeal to Muslim voters, who make up 28.4pc of the constituency, while 26.6pc of residents identify as Asian. Although there is no official breakdown of Urdu speakers in the constituency, it is considered one of the more diverse areas in England.
Spencer defended the strategy, saying it reflected the constituency’s linguistic diversity.
“Gorton and Denton is a beautifully diverse constituency, with thousands of residents who speak languages other than English,” she said.
“I’m proud of our campaign, and of this video, which has been positive, inclusive and focused on the issues that matter most to local people: bringing down rents and bills, proper investment in public services, and rebuilding our NHS.”
Rivals cry foul
The multilingual materials triggered sharp criticism from Labour and Reform UK.
Deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell accused the Greens of a “shameful attempt to manipulate the respected Muslim community,” while a senior Cabinet minister told The Times that the party was “deliberately raising the salience of Gaza” to erode Labour’s support.
Reform UK candidate Matt Goodwin described the Urdu language video as “blatant sectarianism,” and Reform MP Sarah Pochin released a video condemning the move.
The Greens rejected the accusations and doubled down by issuing a similar campaign advert in Bangla, the national language of Bangladesh. Spencer accused Labour of resorting to “racist dog whistles” and insisted that providing materials in languages other than English was about inclusion, not division.
“I will be an MP for the whole of Gorton and Denton,” she said, “and I’m proud that we’re demonstrating that by speaking to constituents in the languages they speak.”
Landmark win
The by-election result marks one of the most significant Green breakthroughs outside London and Brighton, raising questions about Labour’s grip on urban, ethnically diverse constituencies.
For Starmer, who had pledged to rebuild Labour’s electoral coalition, the loss is a stark warning that disaffection among key voter groups could reshape the political landscape ahead of the next general election.
For the Greens, meanwhile, the victory signals a new phase of ambition and a willingness to adopt bold and targeted campaigning in pursuit of it.
Columnist Taj Ali, writing for Hyphen noted that the Green victory in Gorton and Denton proves working-class and Muslim voters have options.

Addressing the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Volker Turk slammed “social systems that silence women and girls” and allow powerful men to abuse them with impunity.
“Violence against women, including femicide, is a global emergency,” the High Commissioner for Human Rights told the UN’s top rights body.
He highlighted the extreme situation in Afghanistan, warning that the “system of segregation imposed on women is reminiscent of apartheid, based on gender rather than race”.
He also pointed to two cases that have recently caused shock waves around the world: those of convicted Epstein and of French rape survivor Gisele Pelicot.
Both cases “show the extent of the exploitation and abuse of women and girls”, Turk said, asking: “does anyone think there are not many more men like Dominique Pelicot or Jeffrey Epstein?”
Epstein associated with the world’s rich, famous and powerful despite his conviction in 2008 to procuring a child for prostitution.
He died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while facing trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.
Gisele Pelicot gave the public insight into her shocking case when she waived her right to anonymity during the 2024 trial in France of her ex-husband Dominique and dozens of strangers who he brought in to rape her while she was unconscious.
“Such horrific abuse is enabled by social systems that silence women and girls, and insulate powerful men from accountability,” Turk charged.
“States must investigate all alleged crimes, protect survivors, and ensure justice without fear or favour,” he insisted.­

ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Friday adjourned the hearing of applications seeking suspension of sentence filed by lawyer and rights activists Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chat­tha in the controversial tweets case, as the defence pressed for an early date before Eid.
Justice Muhammad Asif took up the matter amid a request from the state to transfer the appeal to another bench.
During the proceedings, the assistant attorney general submitted that a case of similar nature had earlier been heard by Justice Azam Khan and reques­ted that the present appeal also be placed before his court.
He argued that it would be appropriate for the same bench to hear related matters.

Rights activists granted bail by anti-terrorism court in two other cases

However, the counsel for the appellants, Advocate Riasat Ali Azad, opposed the request, maintaining that no such case was pending before any other court of the country.
He pointed out that the present appeal had been heard by Jus­tice Muhammad Asif since its inception and questioned how the government could raise objections to the bench at this stage.

 

Expressing full confidence in the court, Mr Azad urged the ju­­dge to fix the matter for hearing before Eid, saying an early date would bring relief to his clients.
Justice Asif asked the state to clarify which case was pending before Justice Azam Khan. Observers present in the courtroom noted that while other cases involving the accused might be pending elsewhere, the instant appeal had consistently remained before the same bench.
The judge later rose and proceeded to his chambers after re­­marking, “Let’s see,” in response to the request for an early date. The state counsel informed the court that it had no objection if a date was fixed. Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned without immediate scheduling of the suspension pleas.
Bail granted
In a separate development, Anti-Terrorism Court Judge Abul Hasanat Muhammad Zulqarnain granted bail to Ms Mazari and Mr Chattha in two other cases.
The bail was allowed against surety bonds of Rs5,000 each in cases related to an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court and a protest outside the National Press Club.
In the case concerning the al­­leged altercation outside the high court, an affidavit submitted by the complainant and Islamabad High Court Bar Association president Syed Wajid Ali Gillani was made part of the record.
However, in the controversial tweets case — in which both rights activists have been convicted — bail has yet to be granted. Owing to the absence of relief in that matter, their release remains subject to the outcome of the pending suspension of sentence applications before the high court.

CAIRO: Relentless Israeli attacks killed at least seven Palestinians in Gaza on Friday, medics said, adding to a death toll of at least 600 people killed by Israeli fire since a US-brokered ceasefire agreement came into effect last October.
Gaza’s health officials reported that in southern Gaza, five people were killed and several others were injured, some critically, in Israeli drone strikes. The strikes targeted two police checkpoints in Khan Yunis and in the Abu Hujair area northwest of the Bureij refugee camp later in the day, medics said.
Separately, an Israeli airstrike against a group of Palestinians in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood in northern Gaza killed two people and wounded several others.
Ban on NGOs frozen
Meanwhile, Israel’s Supreme Court decided in a ruling published on Friday to freeze a government ban on 37 foreign NGOs working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank pending a final decision.
“Without taking any position, a temporary interim order is hereby issued,” the court said in a ruling responding to a petition from more than a dozen NGOs, seeking to reverse the ban after Israel’s government revoked their status in Israel.
The decision theoretically allows the NGOs to work in Gaza and the West Bank until a final ruling, but aid groups are unsure about the freeze’s implementation.
Organisations like MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and CARE were informed on Dec 30, 2025, that their Israeli registrations expired and they had 60 days to renew them by providing Palestinian staff lists.
If they failed to do so, they would have to cease operations in Gaza and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, from March 1.
The NGOs, through AIDA, petitioned the Supreme Court after losing their charity registration in Israel, following a year-long refusal to disclose their Palestinian employees to Israeli authorities.
The court said in its ruling that there existed a “genuine legal dispute” due to the foreign NGOs’ responsibilities to their employees’ privacy under European law.
“We are still waiting to see how the injunction will be interpreted by the state and whether or not this will mean an increase in our ability to operate”, Athena Rayburn, AIDA director, told AFP, calling it “a step in the right direction”.
Sympathy shifts to Palestinians
Separately, a fresh Gallup poll shows that for the first time, Americans sympathise more with Palestinians than with Israelis in their decades-long conflict.
The poll, released on Friday, found that 41 per cent of Americans sympathise more with the Palestinians and 36pc sided with Israel, a sharp reversal from just a year ago when Israel led in sympathies 46 to 33pc.
For the first time in over two decades, Israel is not leading in Gallup’s poll, though the gap is not significant.
Partisan views on the Middle East show more independents shifting towards Palestinians, with an 11-point preference over Israel in the past year.
Democrats overwhelmingly support Palestinians, with 65pc sympathising with them versus 17pc for Israel.
Democrats blame ex-president Joe Biden for insufficient action to curb Israel’s offensive in Gaza after October 7,2023, escalation.
Gallup surveyed 1,001 US adults by telephone from February 2 to 16.

UNMARKED boxes can be used to violate rules on safe charity.—Dawn

• Experts warn unregulated funds being channelled through anonymous collection boxes undermine NAP objectives• Official says ‘owners’ will be identified once seminaries registered with home department
LAHORE: Despite the Punjab home department’s crackdown on illicit charities and the listing of 89 banned organisations, so-called “nameless donation boxes” continue to proliferate on street corners and electric poles, with their anonymous collectors leaving donors wondering who is really behind the appeals.
These “nameless donation boxes”, physically secured with heavy chains and locks, can be spotted at road intersections, markets, shopping malls and banks across Punjab.
Experts say billions of rupees in unregulated funds are being siphoned off under the guise of piety. They warn that this system has bypassed the core objectives of the National Action Plan, which was intended to dismantle the financial networks that fuel instability.
When contacted, a senior home department officer acknowledged that the “nameless donation boxes” were still in place, adding that the department would identify the ownership of such boxes once madaris (seminaries) were registered with the home department.
Identifying the network of “nameless donation boxes” as silent routes of funding, founder of the Civil Services Legacy Guide and former civil servant Yawar Mehdi called upon the federal and provincial governments to dismantle what he described as a dangerous network operating across Pakistan.
‘Silent routes’
Acknowledging the Punjab government’s recent notification banning extremist and illegal organisations from collecting funds, Mr Mehdi warned that the “silent crime” of anonymous donation boxes remained hidden in plain sight, effectively blinding the administration and bypassing the law.
He said funding collected through these boxes was undermining the core objectives of NAP aimed at dismantling destabilising financial networks. “The blood of martyrs and the loss of thousands of lives to domestic unrest will remain a grave concern for the state as long as these silent routes of funding stay open,” he warned.
State intervention sought
To reclaim the state writ, Mr Mehdi proposed that the prime minister issue emergency directives to the interior minister and all chief ministers, ordering that all illegal and anonymous donation boxes be taken into state custody under the direct supervision of divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners and district police officers. He said this should be accompanied by a transparent official record of every rupee collected.
“If the state does not close these unregulated financial channels today, future generations will never forgive the silence of those in power, as the haunting question remains: where do those who spread unrest get their fuel?” he said.
Registration key to tracing owners
A senior home department officer said the department had “completely squeezed” illicit and unregistered charities and was actively working on the registration of all madaris. Admitting that some “nameless donation boxes” were still present, the officer said the department would identify the ownership of such boxes once madaris were registered with the home department.
He said the home department had held several meetings with ulema from various madaris and had developed a proforma for madaris registration.
“Once the madaris are registered with the home department, they will be asked to identify their donation boxes installed at different locations across the province,” the officer said.
However, he said the existing donation boxes belonging to registered organisations and NGOs already carry complete information, including the organisation’s name, registration code and contact numbers.

An official statement said members of the Tax Bar Associations apprised the chairman of the challenges being faced by taxpayers, particularly in relation to the super tax and SRO 350(I)/2024.
Mr Langrial assured participants that the FBR remains fully committed to facilitating taxpayers and addressing all genuine concerns on a priority basis. To ensure timely resolution, he announced the formation of a committee to examine the issues raised by the tax bar associations and propose practical solutions for their early redress.
Operations, policy and legal members of FBR’s Inland Revenue wing also attended the meeting and took part in detailed deliberations.
Appreciating the consultative role of the tax bar associations, the chair­man said their in-depth understanding of Pakistan’s taxation framework makes their input valuable for policy refinement, system imp­rovement and the promotion of voluntary compliance.
The meeting was atte­n­ded by prominent representatives of the tax bar associations, including Pak­istan Tax Bar Association Patron Rana Munir Hus­sain, Pakistan Tax Bar Association President Shei­­kh Ahsanul Haq, Lahore Tax Bar Association Presi­dent Muhammad Asif Rana, former president of Lahore Tax Bar Association Chaudhary Qamaruz Zam­an, Senior Vice President of Pakistan Tax Bar Associa­tion Sheikh Muhammad Yasin Pakistan Tax Bar As­­sociation General Secretary Tahir Mahmood Butt Lahore Tax Bar Association General Secretary Mian Asad Hanif, Pakistan Tax Bar Association Senior Vice President Faraz Fazal Sheikh, and Karachi Tax Bar Association President Muhammad Mahmood Bikiya.

LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has ruled that immigration authorities must record and communicate written reasons in every case where a passenger is offloaded from an international flight, holding that such action, though preventive, must comply with constitutional safeguards of due process.
Justice Raheel Kamran announced the judgment while deciding two identical petitions filed by Muhammad Soban and Ali Raza against the federal government.
The petitioners were off­loaded on Dec 24, 2025, from the Allama Iqbal Inter­national Airport, Lahore, while attempting to travel to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on valid visit visas. They contended that they possessed valid passports, return tickets, confirmed hotel bookings, and that no criminal case, blacklist order or placement on the Exit Control List (ECL) existed against them.

 

Through their counsel, they argued that the offloading was arbitrary, unlawful and violative of their fundamental rights protected under various articles of the Constitution.
On behalf of the federal government, an additional attorney general maintained that the petitioners were neither blacklisted nor permanently barred from travelling. However, he said, immigration authorities claimed that the passengers failed to satisfactorily explain the purpose of their visit. He said the passengers had insufficient funds and doubtful hotel bookings.
The law officer argued that the action was taken under the Emigration Ordi­nance, 1979 and Standing Order No.31/2005, which empower immigration offici­als to scrutinise travel documents and prevent unlawful emigration. He further contended that the petitioners’ own pleadings referred to travelling “to earn bread and butter,” suggesting possible intent to seek employment abroad under the guise of visit visas.

 

In his judgement, Justice Kamran held that while the state possesses statutory authority under the Emigration Ordinance to regulate and prevent unlawful emigration, such authority is not unfettered.
He observed that the right to travel abroad is a valuable civil right protected under Article 15 of the Constitution.
The judge said administrative discretion must meet standards of reasonableness, transparency and proportionality.
“Even preventive measures must comply with due process requirements under Article 10-A of the Constitution,” he ruled.
Justice Kamran noted that although immigration officers may legitimately examine financial capacity, documentation, and travel purpose, no written order stating reasons for offloading was furnished to the petitioners at the time of restraint.
The absence of recorded and communicated reasons, the judge held, undermines transparency, prevents meaningful legal challenge and opens the door to arbitrariness.
While upholding the authority of immigration officials to regulate emigration, the judge issued a prospective direction, requiring the officer concerned to record brief but specific reasons in writing and provide a copy to the offloaded passenger at the earliest opportunity.
The judge observed that the petitioners may travel in the future on valid visit visas, subject to lawful scrutiny and compliance with documentary and financial requirements.
The additional attorney general assured the court that the ministry of interior would consider establishing a structured administrative review mechanism for offloading decisions to reduce unnecessary constitutional litigation.

ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers said on Friday they were willing to negotiate after Pakistan unleashed air strikes on major Afghan cities, killing dozens in the most serious clashes between the allies-turned-foes, which Defence Minister Khawaja Asif described as an “open war”.
The Afghan Taliban, who claimed to have launched “retaliatory attacks” over strikes against terrorists’ hideouts last weekend, said on Friday that they were “ready for dialogue”.
“Afghanistan… has always preferred to reso­lve issues based on mutual understanding and respect,” the Afghan foreign ministry quoted Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi as telling Qatar’s junior Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khalifi by telephone.
Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid echoed that sentiment, saying “now also we want to resolve this matter through dialogue”.
Key regional powers are also quickly mobilising to prevent the conflict from spiralling.
Iran, which borders both nations, offered to mediate. “The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready to provide any assistance necessary to facilitate dialogue and to enhance understanding and cooperation between the two countries,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X.







Saudi Arabia and Qatar were also engaged in a diplomatic drive to halt the hostilities, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP.
“Saudi Arabia, in coordination with Qatar, is making efforts to reduce tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” the source said, adding the goal is to “de-escalate the situation and prevent it from spiralling out of control”.
Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, in a phone call with his Afghan counterpart Muttaqi, expressed concern over the recent situation.
Meanwhile, during a phone call with Paki­stan’s Ishaq Dar, the Saudi foreign minister agreed to stay closely engaged.







Similarly, Turkish Fore­ign Minister Hakan Fidan held separate calls with his counterparts from Paki­stan, Afghanistan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia to discuss the conflict, a Turkish diplomatic source said.
From Moscow to Beijing, international powers also issued urgent calls for de-escalation.
China, a neighbour and major investor in the region, expressed deep concern over the violence.
“China supports combating all forms of terrorism and calls on both parties to remain calm and exercise restraint, properly resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation, achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible, and avoid further loss of life,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.
She confirmed that China was mediating through its own channels and had requested both sides ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and projects.
Moscow urged an immediate halt to the attacks and a return to diplomacy. Russia, which is the only country to officially recognise the Taliban government and also maintains good relations with Pakistan, said the clashes were a dangerous development.
“We call on our friends Afghanistan and Pakistan to abandon this dangerous confrontation and return to the negotiating table to resolve all differences through political and diplomatic means,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov added that Moscow was “closely monitoring this situation.”
From Europe, Britain expressed grave concern. “We are deeply concerned by the significant escalation in tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan,” UK Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper said on X. “We urge both sides to take immediate steps toward de-escalation, avoid further harm to civilians, and re-engage in mediated dialogue.”







Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump, known for his enthusiasm in mediating conflicts and a strong desire for a Nobel Peace Prize, offered a stance that diverged from his usual eagerness to resolve disputes.
In Washington, Trump suggested he would not be willing to step in, highlighting his strong ties with Pakistan’s leadership. Spe­aking to reporters before heading to Texas, Trump was asked about Pakistan’s retaliation to unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban.
Asked whether someone had asked for him to intervene, Trump said, “Well, I would but I get along with Pakistan, as you know, very well. Very, very well.
“[They] have a great prime minister, a great general there … two of the people I really respect a lot,” he said.
“And I think that Pakistan is doing terrifically well,” he said.
The United Nations added its voice to the global chorus for peace. UN Secretary-General Ant­onio Guterres “is deeply concerned by the escalation of violence we’re seeing,” his spokesman Step­hane Dujarric said.
“He calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and he reiterates his call on the parties to resolve any differences through diplomacy.”
The International Comm­­ittee of the Red Cross also echoed calls to protect civilians. The organisation’s president has called for a de-escalation of hostilities between Afghanistan and Pakistan, AFP reports.
ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement that her organisation was “preparing an operational response to humanitarian needs on the ground”.
